            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HOW ſhould we all admire the workings of the Holy Ghoſt! You may know from your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that all the operations of the Holy Spirit, from the beginning, have been in order to the cleanſing, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, and preparing you for the kingdom of God. This experience is given to a little remnant, to know that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his working, that the end, aim and deſign, of all the operations of his power, is for our good, and in order to our eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>Now, this is a great engagement upon the minds of the people of God, diligently to wait upon him, that they may be opened more and more into the myſtery of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hath been hid from ages and generations, and is now revealed by his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And they that are thus exerciſed with the meaſure of grace given unto them, they do grow and encreaſe in holineſs and righteouſneſs, by the working thereof; and they encreaſe in knowledge in the great things of the law, and the myſteries of the kingdom of grace: By the eye which God hath opened, they diſcern, that the working of his power in all ages, has been for the extirpating, rooting out and deſtroying of that root of iniquity, that hath brought forth ſuch a crop of ſin and wickedneſs, which was not of his planting, nor of his creating.</p>
            <p>For, from the beginning of the creation of God, unto this day, God hath had a ſingular love and favour to the ſons and daughters of men, as being (as I may ſay) the maſter-piece, or greateſt piece of the creation, moſt nearly related to himſelf, created in his own image, in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020309_0004_0FAEF6524EF5E520"/>
and holineſs; and in that they now are not ſo, but marred, and ſpoiled from bearing the heavenly image, is not the Lord's doing, but hath been wrought by the enemy both to God and man; yet the Lord continuing his love unto the work of his hands, hath from age to age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and made known his power, for the reſtoring and bringing back again loſt man, fallen man, ſinful man, to be reconciled unto him; that he may, as was intended, enjoy and poſſeſs the love and favour of his Maker; but there was no poſſibility found for his reconciliation with the holy God, but by making him holy: For as the making him unholy, ſeperated him from his Maker; ſo the making of him holy again, would unite him again unto his Maker: So that there muſt be a way and means for the reducing of him to his primitive ſtate, before he could enjoy and obtain his primitive enjoyments; that is, the love and favour of God: And there hath been a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral univerſal ſenſe, upon the ſons and daughters of men, of this alienation, and eſtrangedneſs from God; and they have put themſelves upon divers ways and methods to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reconciliation, and to try if they could reſtore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and they have found out ways, and tried and proved the inventions and imaginations of their own minds, in their fallen wiſdom, what they might do to pleaſe God, and be reconciled to him.</p>
            <p>We are ſinners, and we will ſacrifice, we will bring a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our ſins; and when men have brought a ſacrifice, it hath not been accepted, becauſe there hath not been a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator known, that might mediate for them with the Lord; ſo that all the ſacrifices they have offered, have never been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him, in order to an atonement and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Now only thoſe that have relation to the Mediator by faith in him, doth he intercede for, that he might preſent them again to God; and this hath been the difference between ſacrificer and ſacrifice, from the days of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> unto this day. Some have had relation to the Mediator in all their ſervices and ſacrifices, and ſome have had relation only to the thing offered, and the ſervice performed; but they have not in all ages ſped alike: They whoſe ſervice and worſhip was performed to God, with a relation to the Mediator, they
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020309_0005_0FAEF6531B0E25C0"/>
have found acceptance; and they whoſe worſhip and ſervice was performed only with a relation to the thing offered or done, that was but their own act, that was but their will-worſhip, and that was always turned back again upon them; <hi>for there is no name given under Heaven, by which any can be ſaved, but only the name of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is the Mediator of the new covenant, for the old one was broken: And when <hi>Aaron</hi> was ſet up to be an high-prieſt to God, he was appointed to offer ſacrifices for the ſins of the people, and he that committed a ſin, was appointed by the law to bring an he-goat of the flock unto the door of the tabernacle, and to deliver it to the prieſt, and he was to make an offering for the ſin committed after ſuch and ſuch a manner, and it was to be an atonement with God for him: So here was ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a reconciliation by a ſacrifice; and ſome ſaw no further than the bringing of a goat, and a ram, and the performance of the prieſt's office, and they counted all was well: And others ſaw farther, long before the apoſtle ſpake or wrote it, <hi>it was not the blood of bulls or goats, nor the blood of a ram, that could purge away ſin from their conſciences.</hi> And after the apoſtle had opened the myſtery of Divinity, who had a divine and ſpiritual skill, in unfolding the reſtoration of mankind, he declared plainly, that <hi>when the offering was made by</hi> Aaron <hi>for ſinners, even then there remained ſtill a conſcience of ſin; for it was not poſſible that the blood of bulls and goats, ſhould take away ſin:</hi> So that their outward performances, and their outward ſervices, they did but point out the Mediator; they had a pointing finger, as it were, to the real, true and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus; who is made a Mediator betwixt God and man; that by and through him, man might be again reconciled to God.</p>
            <p>So that now in theſe goſpel-days, wherein God is opening the myſteries of life and ſalvation, to the intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the ſons and daughters of men might be reſtored again into their primitive enjoyment of the favour of God; now in theſe days, it is the duty of all Chriſtians, and of all that are ſeeking the welfare of their immortal ſouls, to have their eyes and hearts unto Jeſus, as unto one that is able to reconcile them unto God; to him it is committed, to him wiſdom and power is committed, and to him authority is
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020309_0006_0FAEF653D01A8F00"/>
committed, that he ſhould be an everlaſting high-prieſt; and that all the ſervices, and all the worſhip and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances that people offer up to God, ſhould be in his name, that ſo by him they might be recommended to God: For none will find acceptance with the Father, unleſs in all their performances they have an eye unto him.</p>
            <p>So that it comes plainly to paſs, according to that ſhort and confident aſſertion of the author to the <hi>Hebrews, that without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> But it is poſſible to offer ſacrifices without faith, and poſſible for people to perform religious ſervices without faith, as woful experience hath taught us in our days, that many have been exerciſed in a kind of religious ſervice, that never in their lives had faith enough to believe the things that they pray for, and they are without faith. When people pray to God to ſend his Holy Spirit into their hearts, that they may keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to their lives end, and have not faith to believe it, and when they pray, <hi>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven,</hi> it is a religious performance; but if it be not done in faith, it is but an encreaſing in ſin, and an addition to ſin. Where is the man that is exerciſed in praying to God, that believeth that ever ſuch a thing is like to come to paſs? Go where you will in this or the other nation, and enquire of people about their faith; they believe there is no poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of extirpating and rooting out of ſin, while they live upon the earth; therefore all their prayers for it are vain, and their faith a vain faith: And it is high time in ſuch a day as this, when men are faithleſs and unbelieving, to preach up the object of faith, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. People are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers faiths, and of divers beliefs; but we have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that they do them no good, they do not bring a thing to paſs, that of neceſſity muſt be brought to paſs, before they can be reconciled to God; their faith doth not cleanſe the heart, nor extend ſo far as to believe that ever they ſhall be cleanſed; in all the worſhip and religion that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, they come not to this faith, that they ſhall be made clean: All that is done is but in ſin and uncleanneſs; they cannot bring a clean ſacrifice out of an unclean veſſel: And our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith concerning this ſubject, <hi>an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit;</hi> but there muſt be good
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020309_0007_0FAEF65489C1CD80"/>
fruit brought ſorth; how muſt we do it? <hi>Make the tree good, and the fruit will be good.</hi> When mens vain janglings about religion and religious fancies come to an end, then all this religion will appear to be in vain, and will not anſwer the end for which it is performed, till men believe that it will make the tree good, and cleanſe the heart, and transform men by renewing the ſpirit of their minds. So that religion muſt begin within; and it is not our changing of forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, from one form to another, and taking up this and the other opinion, that doth change our hearts. Sad experience doth teach us, that men may carry over their old luſts into a new religion; we can carry over our old inclinations into our new opinions: For though the form of worſhip be changed, the heart remaining unchanged, and the luſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, <hi>their religion is in vain,</hi> let them be of what perſuaſion they will.</p>
            <p>Now the remedy of this great calamity, that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread all ſorts of people; for there is no ſort of people, but there are thoſe among them that are under this great calamity, of holding the profeſſion of godlineſs with an ungodly mind, and the profeſſion of truth with a falſe and treacherous ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And for the remedying of this, there is but one way that all men be brought off from having their eye unto their performances, and to the doctrines and tenets that they hold, and do, as the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ſix their eye upon Chriſt, and look upon Jeſus.</hi> This is the firſt thing that muſt begin our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for Chriſt muſt be the <hi>Alpha</hi> of our religion, as well as the <hi>Omega</hi> of it. If I begin not there, let me begin where I will, I begin wrong; let me begin at the moſt ſerious and ſound doctrine, and at the moſt apoſtolical religion; if Chriſt and his apoſtles were here upon the earth; if I walked among them; if I believed all they ſaid and did, I ſhould begin wrong, if I did not fix mine eye upon Jeſus Chriſt, that is the taker away of ſin, and is the ſanctifier of the ſoul by his Spirit. There muſt be the beginning, and there muſt be the concluſion; he is the author, and the finiſher of all true faith. There are authors of other faiths: Men have their different faiths, and creeds, and articles, and they have expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impoſed them too; but this is the worſt of it, none of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020309_0008_0FAEF6555F6C4BD8"/>
them are right; let them be expoſed and impoſed with ever ſo much force and violence, none of theſe will cleanſe the heart; but that faith which is delivered over by Chriſt Jeſus, that hath the quality of cleanſing and purifying; that is the faith when all is done, that will do the work; that is it that will ſave and ſanctify, and do the buſineſs that all the world is about. Every one would have a reconciler with God, and ſin rooted out, and be as God would have them be; this is the public profeſſion of Chriſtendom; at leaſt they would find out ſomething by which it might be done: Altho' many are willing enough to continue in ſin and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, whoredom, lying and hypocriſy; theſe are a ſort of <hi>fools,</hi> that <hi>make a mock of ſin,</hi> and that ſwim in the ſtream of pleaſure; and what care they, ſo long as they make a profeſſion of chriſtianity?</p>
            <p>But I am ſpeaking of a people that are ſtruggling under their corruptions; that would mortify ſin, and ſerve God in holineſs and righteouſneſs, and do God's <hi>will on earth as it is done in Heaven;</hi> and do it not inform, but would have power to do it; and they have tried ſeveral ways to do it, and it is not done; and many have been at this work till grey hairs are upon their heads, and it is not done. Now God hath given Chriſt to make reconciliation; now how can we, that have the love of God extended to us, but extend our good-will to our friends, and ſignify to them, that all the travel and pains they are at, and all the prayers they make, will do nothing till they have their faith fixed upon Jeſus, that is able to ſave and deliver them, <hi>and ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here ſome will object and ſay, it is true what you ſay, but is it needful to preach ſuch doctrines to us? for we all believe in Chriſt, that is, the only Mediator and Saviour. We know that Chriſt Jeſus is the only Mediator, and that unleſs he commends us to God, we cannot be accepted of him. This is our general doctrine, therefore what need it be urged and preſſed upon us, that are come into the faith already.</p>
            <p>Let me ſearch into the matter; it is of greater importance than to ſearch into a bargain of worldly things. Men would fain have others open and diſcover to them wherein
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020309_0009_0FAEF6560C2BD458"/>
they may be cheated, to prevent their being impoſed on in a worldly bargain. I hope then they will hearken to know how, and wherein they may be deceived by themſelves, and deceived by others in matters of eternal concernment. There are no Proteſtants, but the reject any Mediator but Jeſus Chriſt, and believe that no Mediator can reconcile them to God, but Chriſt alone, and they ſay he is the object of their faith. I would ask them this queſtion, whether they believe in Chriſt at a diſtance, or as preſent, really preſent with them? If their faith be hiſtorical and at a diſtance, that they believe in Chriſt, as one born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was crucified and dead before they were born, and aroſe again, and aſcended into Heaven, and is ſet at the right hand of God, if the reaſon of my belief be, that I have heard of this relation of Chriſt, or whether the reaſon be, becauſe by his Spirit, he hath viſited me in this age; the one is, I believe, becauſe good men have told me ſo; but the other is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe, by this Spirit he hath promiſed to ſend, to lead me into all truth, he hath viſited me. Now let me examine whether I am aware of ſuch a ſpiritual viſitation, by this quickening Spirit, which is the Lord from Heaven, and not only the Lord in Heaven. Whether I am aware of ſuch a quickening power and virtue, which I have received upon my ſpirit, that he is not only at the right hand of God on high in Heaven, but is now come to knock at the door of my heart, and hath raiſed in me a life, as oppoſite to ſin, as his was. Let me conſider if I be aware of a ſecret touch of his quickening virtue upon my ſoul, whereby he hath begotten me into a life oppoſite to ſin; ſo that if ſin remains, it remains as a burthen, and oppreſſion upon me, ſo that I am a ſufferer; for as much as I am quickened, and made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of a better life, of a godly life, I would fain be at it, and live in it, but iniquity, luſt and corruption lie in the way. He that hath quickened me ſo far, as to bring me to a ſenſe of the burthen of ſin, my faith tells me, he will take the burthen off, elſe my faith will do me no good, if cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſtill prevail upon me, if my faith tells me this, it will tell the wickedeſt man in the world as much; but if my faith tells me I am a ſinner, and my ſins conſiſt of this and the other evil thing I do, and am inclined to do, it tells
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020309_0010_0FAEF656D4722950"/>
me again, that he that hath quickened me, and brought me to a ſenſe of ſin, he can take the burthen off from me.</p>
            <p>Here now is a true faith, that begins in conviction, and ends in true converſion; this is the word of faith, delivered to the ſaints, and which we are to preach. They ſaid of old, that the word of faith, they had to preach, was that which was nigh in their mouth, that they might receive it, and do it. I have ſomething nigh that reproves me for ſin; if I be obedient to it, then faith gives me victory over that which is ſinful, for which the world reproveth me; and as I ſee faith gives me victory over any corruption, which I have been ſtruggling under, I am encouraged to fix my faith upon him that hath thus quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened me: So that this is the difference between faith in Chriſt at a diſtance, and faith that quickeneth me by God's Spirit; that Spirit that hath been ſo much ſlighted in our days, by the higheſt notioniſts in our age; they ſuppoſed it to be a meer fiction; ſome have mocked and derided, and others have been diſcouraged to ſpeak of the Spirit of Chriſt, and his operation upon the ſoul; ſome have declared both in the preſs and pulpit, that they have had no experience of the touches of God's Spirit upon their ſouls. But our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath brought us to another degree of knowledge. We know, and you may know if you pleaſe, and that before you ſleep, that there is a way opened, God has made way for his Spirit to reach the ſpirits of men, to ſignify immediately to their ſpirits without means, herein thou doeſt wrong, and herein thou mayeſt have life, and ſeek after it. Now the Spirit that thus worketh, is the Spirit of Chriſt, the Spirit that proceeds from the Father and the Son, that voice in men that tells them they might believe and be ſaved. When he comes, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he will lead you into all truth.</hi> How ſhall the world know this is he? <hi>He ſhall convince them of ſin.</hi> If there be any convincement that ariſeth in man of this and the other ſin, it muſt be from the way the Holy Spirit hath upon their ſpirits; he hath a way to ſpeak to men, and every one that is a lover of his own ſoul, is bound to hearken to that voice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the latter days,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>when I ſhall raiſe a prophet in the midſt of you, whoſoever will not hear that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall it cut off.</hi> All commentators agree on this text,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020309_0011_0FAEF6578D8F7750"/>
that that prophet was no other than Chriſt Jeſus; it was not <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Peter;</hi> but Chriſt that was promiſed to be raiſed. There was ſuch an abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand went along with that prophecy, <hi>that all ſhould hear him,</hi> and it had a threatening at the end of it, <hi>that all that will not hear him, ſhall be cut off.</hi> Are they not whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and drunkards, and liars, that will not hear this prophet? They will not hear him, becauſe they love their ſins. What becomes of them? They are cut off from the enjoyment of the love and favour of God, and when they draw nigh to God in prayer, and other religious exerciſes, it is with them, as it was with <hi>Cain, ſin lies at the door.</hi> When they come into a ſtorm at ſea, or are arreſted with ſickneſs, and death looks them in the face, they would have peace, but there is diſtreſs, and trouble in the room of it. What is the matter? Waſt thou not baptiſed in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith? Did not the miniſter tell thee, <hi>that thou art a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven?</hi> Alas! my ſin lies at my door; O! that I had time to live a better life! What ails thy life, man? My life hath been a life of deceit, luſt, and vanity, corruption and hypocriſy. Did not thy teacher teach thee, that a believer hath no guilt upon him, but that all his ſins are pardoned from the day he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a believer? This doctrine will not hold in a ſtorm, tho' it will do in fair weather; when men are ſwimming in their pleaſures, it will ſerve them; but when they come to deal with their Maker, no faith will ſerve them, but that which <hi>purifies the heart,</hi> and that which makes a change <hi>from the earthly image to the heavenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were better for you and I, and every one of us, to take theſe things into conſideration, while we have health and ſtrength, and while ſome ſand (as I may ſo ſpeak) is in our glaſſes, to conſider what is my faith? What is the object of it? Have I a dependency upon my duties, and alms, and good deeds? They will fail me. But if my dependency be upon Chriſt as a Saviour, and a Sanctifier, and my ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is carried on gradually, <hi>he that hath begun a good work in me will perfect it.</hi> And if the reaſon of my going to meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and going into my cloſet, and bowing myſelf before the Lord, is to keep cloſe to him that carries on the work of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020309_0012_0FAEF6585EB4AFF0"/>
ſanctification, <hi>he will work all my work in me and for me.</hi> I cannot expect to live in the world, but I ſhall meet with temptations; the Devil will tempt me, but my Saviour will be nigh me, as nigh to me as the Devil can be; if I will keep cloſe to him, he will keep cloſe to me. <hi>My Father,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, is greater than I, and none is able to pluck you out of your Father's hands.</hi> I muſt expect to be tempted; <hi>for the adverſary the Devil goes about like a roaring lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Alas! ſaith one, though I have made ſome progreſs in the work of ſanctification, yet for all that, he may one day betray me. Am I grown ſtrong enough to reſiſt his temptations? and wiſe enough to foreſee all his gins and traps, which he lays to enſnare me? But I know who can ſee them, and defeat them. I have my faith fixed upon one that can bind the ſtrong man, and caſt him out. The life that I now live, is not in my own parts, and by my own underſtanding and ſenſe: <hi>But the life that I now live, in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> This is that faith that gives me victory. The apoſtle had a battle for it; <hi>I have fought the good fight; and henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, and not for me only, but for all them that love the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that come to have familiarity with Chriſt, with his Spirit and truth, with his grace and word, in their hearts: Though theſe are ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, they all ſignify one immortal ſeed of life, by which men are united to God: It is a leaven there, to leaven them into the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>Whenever ſuch a one is tempted, he reſiſts not the tempter in his own power, but he waits to feel the ariſings of that life, and power, and virtue that was in Chriſt Jeſus, and is in him ſtill: He waits for that power, that in the name of Chriſt he may ſay, <hi>get thee behind me Satan.</hi> Being forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt's name, and armed with his power, what is it that a Chriſtian cannot do? What valiant, noble and wonderful things have they done, that have been ſhielded with this faith? See the eleventh chapter of the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> All the repetitions of that chapter, from one end to the other; in all of them the apoſtle aſcribes all the valiantneſs and courageouſneſs of thoſe noble acts, to the power of faith. They looked to Jeſus, before ever the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020309_0013_0FAEF65A6B2FC940"/>
               <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> brought him forth out of her body. The prophets did earneſtly ſeek to know thoſe things, which the Spirit of Chriſt that was in them, did ſignify unto them, that there was to be this great Prophet, before ever the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> was born: So that Chriſt was always the object of a true believer's faith. Though under the law they had an high-prieſt, and he was placed at the altar, and they had offerings burnt upon it, yet they had an eye unto Chriſt, they had an undervaluing of all that their ſacrifices could do for them. <hi>If thou wouldeſt have had burnt offerings,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I would have given them; I would not have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them from thine altar; thou ſhouldeſt have had enough of them.</hi> He was bold to ſay, in reſpect of acceptance and reconciliation, <hi>burnt offerings and ſacrifices thou wouldeſt not; a body haſt thou prepared me; for it is written in the volume of the book, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> He had an eye unto Jeſus that was to come, upon whom help was laid: There was a Redeemer, that ſhould come from <hi>Zion,</hi> and a law-giver from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> They had an eye beyond ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, unto Chriſt. In all ages the people of God have had the anſwer of their ſouls, which is reconciliation, and the favour of God: They that had this anſwer, never had it but by Chriſt. No man can be accepted with God, can ever have the deſire of his ſoul anſwered in peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, until his faith be placed on Chriſt Jeſus: Neither can any man have faith in Chriſt at a diſtance, and thereby be reconciled unto God, but muſt know his Spirit. I muſt have an experimental knowledge of his power and wiſdom, and this I cannot have without his Spirit: Let me believe ever ſo othordoxly, except I have the Spirit of Chriſt, it will do me no good, it will be no advantage to me.</p>
            <p>This is the word, that was in my heart as a well-wiſher to the ſouls of all men: As God hath done good to my ſoul, ſo I cannot but wiſh well to the ſouls of others; that as he hath found out a way for my redemption and ſalvation, ſo likewiſe I wiſh the ſame for others that are bond-men and bond-women, and under the power of their corruption. God's work hath been to deſtroy the bondage and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and to deſtroy the tyrant that reigns over the ſouls of people; God having made them for his glory, and the Devil has ſtolen them away: That they do not that which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020309_0014_0FAEF65B01399170"/>
pleaſeth God: But God's good pleaſure is, that all <hi>may be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth: And God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> And he is called, <hi>the Lamb of God, which takes away the ſins of the world.</hi> He can take away ſin; if my ſin do not obſtruct my faith and confidence in him, he will take it away; and if he takes that away, then he makes the tree good. Nothing hinders us from the enjoyment of God, but ſin; and if Chriſt will take it away by the blood of his croſs, no matter for all the ſcorn, contempt, hardſhip, reproach and perſecution of this world; no matter, for he hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us, but told us before hand, if we will be followers of him, and be led by him; we muſt expect theſe things; ſufferings, reproaches, perſecutions, diſdain and envy. Theſe things come not uncertainly upon us; the world loves its own, and cannot love them that are not of it; but they that are not of the world, may be brought to the terms of God, and they may not be any longer in the world. Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that his diſciples may be taken out of the world, but kept from the evil: So that Chriſt is a Mediator, and a propitiation for all men; and he is working by his Spirit for the redemption of all men, <hi>that to as many as believe in him, to them he gives power to become the Sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſum of all this is, that we have an opportunity put into our hands; we cannot deny it; you muſt all upon ſearch, confeſs, that the grace of God doth often work in your hearts againſt any corruption, againſt any evil: Let not this price be put into your hands in vain, as into the hands of fools. If I knew that this and that was a ſin, I would leave it; let us be of that mind, and we ſhall ſoon know it; and then ſay, if I knew ſuch a thing to be a ſin, and could get a thouſand pounds by it, I would not do it, Why ſhould'ſt thou love ſin for profit or pleaſure? I am ſure it is an ill bargain when it is done. Whatſoever I am convinced is a ſin, I will not do it.</p>
            <p>Reſolve upon this, and then the grace of God will be at work; we ſhall ſoon ſee that we muſt leave off ſinning. There is ſuch a thing I muſt leave; God hath ſet up a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my mind againſt it; though it bring profit and pleaſure, away it muſt go. Here is a ſtep, a following ſtep,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020309_0015_0FAEF65C5956E488"/>
to follow Chriſt. He that will deny himſelf, will follow Chriſt: My Redeemer ſhews me this to be an evil, I will not do it, but follow him, and imitate him. Here the ſoul is led ſtep by ſtep, even by Chriſt, the Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till it is gradually cleanſed from ſin, and reconciled unto God; and this can be done by no other means; for prayers and alms will not do it; all that can be done by us will not do it; none can do it but Chriſt alone, that God hath laid help upon, that you may all wait for the Divine operation of his grace in your hearts. That is it which we labour and travel for, as knowing that God hath wrought wonderfully by it, for the redemption of all thoſe that love him more than they love their pleaſures, more than they love their ſins. It muſt be concluded, that following of him, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing father and mother, huſband and wife, children, brethren, and ſiſters; all theſe things as they ſtand in competition with him, and the obedience of his Spirit, muſt be looked upon as nothing to him: Then above all things, I muſt not diſpleaſe him: <hi>He can ſpeak peace, and none can take it away; and if he take it away, none can give it.</hi> If we follow Chriſt, when this is done, then all is done according to the will of God; then the bleſſing deſcends upon the whole creation; then every man will ſpeak truth to his neighbour, and every man will govern his family with diſcretion; ſo God is glorified, and his name comes to be exalted; who is worthy to be beloved, adored, and exalted above all bleſſings and praiſes. To him be glory, who is God over all, bleſſed forever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>IT is in my heart at this time, to deſire that every one's heart were prepared to be made a partaker of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the goſpel; for there is a certain preparation that every one muſt witneſs in themſelves, before they are capable of receiving divine bleſſings; for in all ages of the world, the bleſſings of the Lord have been manifold, and his arm hath been always ſtretched out in all ages, to the ſons and daughters of men, that are ſenſible of the love he hath unto them; and where theſe tenders of the love of God have met with prepared hearts, they have received it to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare: But this hath been the lamentation that hath been taken up upon the greateſt part of mankind, that they have not been prepared to receive the love of God; their hearts and minds have been ſo filled with the love of viſible things, and carnal objects, that they have not been truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the riches of the grace, mercy, and love of God unto them.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:020309_0018_0FAEF65F30770738"/>Now, it was ſaid of old by the prophet, <hi>that the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the heart is of the Lord;</hi> and there is ſomething that belongs to us on our part, that we may attain this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may be brought into this ſpiritual frame of mind; and that is, by returning to the Lord, for people to think upon his name, and have regard to his appearance: And although this is not the work of nature, for by nature the minds of people are abroad, and they are crying out as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Yet to help that defect, the Lord hath been pleaſed to ſend forth his grace and his truth, and to call unto the ſons and daughters of men, that they might ſeek after him, that they might <hi>ſeek the Lord while he is to be found;</hi> and they that hearken to his voice, they will readily confeſs, that there is nothing doth ſo well ſatisfy an immortal ſoul, as to be gathered into fellowſhip with its Maker; and that one time or other, it is the deſire of all men and women, that they might attain peace with the Lord; and they know there is no peace to the wicked; they know wickedneſs will remain until it is aboliſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and they know it is not in their power to deſtroy it; and therefore of neceſſity there muſt be a waiting upon the Lord, who is <hi>Almighty,</hi> that he may reveal his power in our weakneſs.</p>

Such a religious meeting thus gathered together, hath a promiſe; <hi>I will be in the midſt of them,</hi> ſaith the Lord; and therefore, having a promiſe, we may reaſonably expect that we ſhall be made partakers of the living virtue and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by which we may do that, which of ourſelves we cannot do.</p>

All thoſe objects that people fix their mind upon, they will wax old; but they whoſe deſires, and the breathings of whoſe ſouls are, that they may grow into acquaintance with their Maker, this will never wax old. When peoples minds are fixed, as the people of the Lord of old were, when they made a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between the ſtate of their minds, and the minds of others, and ſignified it in theſe words, <hi>they are ſaying; they are crying</hi> (that is, they that are of the world) <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> But for our parts, our cry is, <hi>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon us, and we will be more glad of that, than they can be with all the increaſe of corn, and wine, and oil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now they that feel in themſelves that the reaſon of their meeting together is to enjoy the light of God's countenance, and to partake of the bleſſings of God, they have their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation from God, their minds are retired into God; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right well, that if the tongues of men and angels are mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to declare the heavenly and divine myſteries of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, they cannot be edified or benefited by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the divine help and aſſiſtance of God's Spirit; for there is a <hi>ſeal</hi> upon them, and none can open that <hi>ſeal,</hi> but the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> he only is found worthy to unſeal the myſtery, and unſeal the divine bleſſings that are with the Lord: So that people muſt come to that retiredneſs of ſpirit, to that reſignation of ſoul, to be as a little child waiting upon the Lord, crying out unto the Lord, that he will prepare them, <hi>that he will make them hungry, and then feed them, that he will raiſe a thirſt in them, and then ſatisfy them with thoſe divine ſprings of life, which through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt are opened to every one that believeth.</hi> So far as your minds are ſtayed and ſettled in waiting for the Lord, ſo far you will feel in yourſelves an openneſs and readineſs, that if the Lord ſpeaks, you are ready to hear him, ready to ſubmit to his word, ready to obey him; there will be ſuch an openneſs in the mind, not to the words of any man, but unto the word of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020309_0020_0FAEF660888BB2C8"/>
God, to receive that; for where the words of men are receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though never ſo excellent, they convert not the ſoul, <hi>but the word of the Lord is pure, converting the ſoul.</hi> And this word is that which is able to quicken thoſe that are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and bring them to be made partakers of life. For it is not an increaſe of knowledge that will do the turn, but it is the increaſe of life and virtue, the increaſe of godlineſs, and ſubmitting our wills unto him that made us: It is this that will do our turn, this will bring peace to the ſoul, and bring us into the favour of God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now, that you may all feel that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the heart for this reſignation, and quietneſs, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, you muſt wait upon the Lord, that you may be made partakers of the bleſſings of his everlaſting goſpel, and of his divine preſence: This is that which is moſt profitable, moſt advantageous: And then the Lord will <hi>open to you the windows of Heaven, and rain down theſe bleſſings upon you,</hi> whereby you will be comforted and refreſhed, far beyond all the works that we can do; for it is an <hi>inward work</hi> that muſt be done upon the ſoul, to convert people that have been alienated and eſtranged from God, and bring them to a reconciled ſtate, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby they may partake of the divine virtues, which ſanctify and juſtify the ſoul in the ſight of God.</p>

               <p>MOST glorious and powerful Father! thy arm of power is made bare in this our day, to bring ſalvation to the poor.</p>
               <p>O Lord! thou haſt lifted up the light of thy countenance upon a people that have waited for thy glory and thy ſalvation; a little remnant whom the good of this world could not ſatisfy; but O Lord! in an acceptable time, thou haſt brought thy ſalvation near; and the light and brightneſs of the everlaſting goſpel, thou haſt commanded to ſhine into the hearts and ſouls of the mourners and bowed-down ones, who are ſeeking the living God, not among the outward forms and ways of men.</p>
               <p>But, O bleſſed Father of Life! thou haſt now brought us to the day of thy power, and bowed our wills, and made us a willing people therein to ſerve thee, and to do thy will on earth, as it is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020309_0021_0FAEF663DA7EAF30"/>
done in Heaven; and for that end, O Lord, thou haſt put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of thy people to wait upon thee, in whom all our freſh ſprings are, that from thee we may receive the renewing of power from day to day.</p>
               <p>In all the hours of our temptations and trials, our eyes, O Lord, have been to thee and to thy power; and we acknowledge, to the glory of thy power and goodneſs, that thou haſt been a God nigh at hand, when we have been ſeeking thee, and truſting in thee, ſo that we are a people ſenſible of thy power and preſence with us; for that eye which thou keepeſt open to thy children it brings thy glory to our view, and ſhews it breaking forth over the nations; and we have great joy and ſatisfaction in beholding the progreſs of thy mighty power in our day, how thou haſt broken down and confounded, and art ſtill breaking down and confounding, all the dark imaginations and devices of the ſons and daughters of men, that have conſpired to hinder the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the glory of thy Son, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>O powerful God of Life! ariſe more and more in the greatneſs of thy power and love, and make known thy counſel, and thy will among the inhabitants of the earth; and bow their minds, O Lord! and their wills, that none may dare to withſtand thy appearance, leſt they be found fighters againſt God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of themſelves.</p>
               <p>O powerful Father! for this end, make bare thine arm unto the rulers and governors of theſe nations, that they may know thy counſels, and bow to thy heavenly will, and may promote thy law of righteouſneſs in their own hearts, and the hearts of others; that by thy power, a bleſſed reformation may be wrought, and a ſtop put to iniquity; that it may not run down in a mighty ſtream, as it hath done in time paſt; but that truth and righteouſneſs, and ſound judgment may be known in the earth: That they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, may have their ſouls deſires ſatisfied; and ſo praiſe and thankſgivings ſhall ariſe from their ſouls to thee.</p>
               <p>O powerful Father of Life! preſerve and keep thy children, whom thou haſt gathered, and purged, and purified, and to whom thou haſt made known the way of life, and made them a willing people in the day of thy power, to do thy will, and to wait for the coming of that kingdom that thou haſt promiſed to eſtabliſh under Chriſt Jeſus, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords; and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020309_0022_0FAEF6651800B6E0"/>
that it may grow, and increaſe, and be ſpread abroad upon the earth, and let every one deſire to be the ſubject thereof.</p>
               <p>Powerful Father of Life! the arm of thy power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible ſtrength hath been revealed, that nothing hath been able to reſiſt or ſtand againſt and prevail, by which thou art planting <hi>Zion</hi> and building <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and eſtabliſhing it: By the ſame power, let thy work be carried on, and let many be brought in to be ſubject to Chriſt, for the good of their immortal ſouls: As thou haſt multiplied thy bleſſings upon us, ſo from day to day thou haſt made us ſenſible of thy love unto us, owning us to be thy children and peculiar people, by thy preſence in the midſt of us, whenever we meet in thy name to wait upon thee, that ſo, Living Father, all thine, both here and every where, may be encouraged to attend upon thee, and to be faithful to thy power; that waiting for the opening of thy counſels, and the enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their underſtandings, they may be able to comprehend, with all ſaints, the height, and depth, and length, and breadth of thy love in Chriſt Jeſus; that in the ſenſe of the freeneſs and greatneſs thereof, all thy children here and every where, that in an everlaſting covenant of grace thou haſt gathered to thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may have communion with thee and thy Son and Spirit; and may return thee the honor, glory, and praiſe of all thy love, and mercy, and grace; for thou alone art worthy, who art God ever all, bleſſed forever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <date>May 27, 1688.</date>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN God gave forth his <hi>Law</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to hear and obey, the firſt and great commandment was, <hi>thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me.</hi> Here is the ſum and ſubſtance of all <hi>true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> that ever was upon earth to this day. All the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all the precepts, prophecies, and all the dealings of God with his people, from that day to this, have all been contained in this ſhort precept, <hi>thou ſhalt have no other Gods
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020309_0023_0FAEF666A5720388"/>
but me.</hi> And as long as <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtood in obedience to this command, their bleſſings were multiplied upon them, their good things were increaſed from day to day; the Lord was with them, as long as they were willing to be his people; he appeared as their <hi>God,</hi> and as their defender wrought their deliverances, <hi>fought all their battles</hi> for them, gave them dominion and ſtrength, courage and wiſdom; miniſtered out of his <hi>treaſury</hi> all good things unto them; for the great care of God Almighty was with all his people, he had regard to them, and viſited them at all times, to keep them from idolatry; <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a jealous God,</hi> take notice of me to be ſo; I am jealous of my name; if thou wilt be mine, <hi>thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all the precepts about offerings and ſacrifices, and making atonement for ſinners, and the divers ſervices and worſhip, the various offices in the temple and <hi>ſanctuary,</hi> they were all outward means appointed of God, to keep this outward church in an inward conformity to the command of God. This command was written in tables of ſtone, and theſe tables were laid up in the <hi>ark of God,</hi> and all this appertained to the <hi>firſt covenant,</hi> and typed and figured out the diſpenſation of the <hi>new and everlaſting covenant</hi> that God would make with his people, not like unto the old: How not like it? Not like it in the outward ſhadows, the types and ſhadows of things, but he would bring forth the ſubſtance of all thoſe <hi>ſhadows</hi> and <hi>types,</hi> and would alter the form and outward appearance of things; <hi>for as God is unchangeable,</hi> ſo is his <hi>law</hi> unchangeable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, the firſt and great commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me.</hi> This was put into the ſtone tables. Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, the firſt and great commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind,</hi> Matt. xxii, 27. This is put into the <hi>tables of the heart.</hi> So here is a difference between the firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the firſt commandment by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they both acknowledge the firſt and great command to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the creature to him that made him, as his God, that he may only ſerve him, and that he may love him with his whole heart: The <hi>Jew</hi> could prove this by his <hi>ſtone tables,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> proves this by the fleſhly tables of the heart, for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020309_0024_0FAEF66753C0EE38"/>
there he is bound to love the Lord with his whole heart, and to ſerve him only; <hi>him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, here the Jews law is brought over to the Chriſtians, in the greateſt point of religion that ever was preached; ſhuts out all idolatry, all ſuperſtition, all variety of religions; all is ſhut out by this commandment, and the Chriſtian that hath the law written in his heart, according to the new covenant, he can go as readily to it and read it, as ever the Jew could go to his <hi>ſtone table,</hi> and read the law there; you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that if there be a thing written and engraven in my heart, I can go at readily to it as I can go to any book or table, tho' I have the keeping of it: But the Jews had not the keeping of it, for generally it was laid up iij the <hi>ark of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, friends, that which lies upon my mind to ſpeak to you at this time, and that out of the great love that I have to all your precious and immortal ſouls, as God hath had <hi>love to mine,</hi> is, that you would all conſider and weigh in the fear of the Lord, whoſe preſence is among us, which of you, and how many of you are come to the obedience of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: I do not doubt but the moſt of you can ſay them <hi>all,</hi> but a happy people are you if you can do <hi>one:</hi> I dare pronounce that ſoul a bleſſed ſoul, that can perform this one commandment, that can or dare ſtand before his <hi>Maker, and ſay, O Lord! I love thee with all my heart, with all my ſoul, and with all my might;</hi> my love is withdrawn from all other things in compariſon of thee; there is nothing in this whole world hath a place in my mind, but as it is in ſubjection to the love of thee.</p>
            <p>Here is the firſt and great commandment, the unchangeable law, the <hi>law</hi> that was <hi>good</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>' days, and good in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s days, and it holds good in our days; and indeed it is ſuch a definitive law, that the breakers of it can neither be good <hi>Jews,</hi> nor good <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> There is an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity lies upon us, of abſtracting and drawing away our minds and ſouls from all other gods, from all images and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies and truſts that people are naturally liable to truſt to, and to have their whole confidence ſet upon the Lord; but alas! with grief of heart I ſpeak it, there are but very few that as yet have known the right giving forth of the <hi>law,</hi> and there are fewer that are ſubject to it. This law was not
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020309_0025_0FAEF6680AFC2A10"/>
given forth at firſt without thunder and lightening, and a terrible noiſe, and the mountain ſmoking (he that hath an car to hear, let him hear) inſomuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſaid, he feared greatly, and he quaked exceedingly, becauſe of the thunder of the Almighty, and the mountain that ſmoked and burnt with fire, ſo that <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not draw nigh.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay, there are but a few that have come to the knowledge of the giving forth of this law, that have certainly known thoſe thunders, and that terrible work that the Lord of the whole earth makes, when he comes to ſet up his law; for a great many that have come nigh to it, and might have heard and received the words of the law of God, they have gone backward, they have done like unto the Jews of old, though they had ſuffered much, and gone through much, and had ſeen the wonders of the Lord; how he had led them and delivered them; yet when it came to this, that they muſt hear the voice of God, they ſaid we cannot bear it; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure it: We have deviſed for ourſelves an eaſier way; for the voice of thunder and dreadful noiſes, put them into ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and quaking, and trembling, and great dread came upon them; but we have found an eaſier way, ſay they; what is that? <hi>Go thou,</hi> ſaid they to <hi>Moſes, and hear thou what the Lord ſaith, and come thou and tell us,</hi> thou ſhalt be a Mediator between us; let God ſpeak unto thee, and do thou ſpeak the ſame to us, and we will hear thee.</p>
            <p>Thus the Jews that were not come beyond the law of God written in <hi>tables of ſtone,</hi> they would not come to receive it in their hearts, as the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> received the <hi>law</hi> from the <hi>mouth of God,</hi> and he was faithful as a ſervant in the houſe of God, and he miniſtered forth the law of God, his precepts, ſtatutes and judgments, and teſtimonies; and he made them a book of laws for all of them to walk by, from the higheſt to the loweſt; how they ſhould act in criminal matters, and to do juſtice between man and man, and what they ſhould do in the worſhip of God, and what they ſhould do towards the prieſt, whoſe lips ſhould preſerve knowledge for them; and ſo he brought up a form of religion; but his work was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the precepts of God; and he brought them into the form of national religion, and government, and national laws. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prieſt ruled over them; and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020309_0026_0FAEF668F66EC4C8"/>
the prieſt offered ſacrifice for them, and made atonement for them, and <hi>Moſes</hi> enquired of the Lord, and asked council for them, and taught and inſtructed them; and what became of all this at laſt? When this was done, the prieſt made atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin, but he could not pluck away the guilt of one ſin; <hi>there remained the conſcience of ſin</hi> after he had made his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; and <hi>Moſes</hi> taught them the counſels of God, and the commands of God, but he could not bind their hearts to the obedience of them; for he declared openly againſt them, that they were <hi>a rebellious and ſtiff-necked people,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they had a law without them. Indeed, time would fail me to run through the manifold miſcarriages of the church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in reſpect of their idolatry, in reſpect of their contempt and rebellion, both to God and his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was to teach and to guide them: I ſay, the time would fail me to mention the manifold miſcarriages that happened among this people, that had a law and religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and a teacher without them.</p>
            <p>Now in the fulneſs of time it pleaſed God in ſending his Son, Chriſt Jeſus, to raiſe up a prophet like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in reſpect of faithfulneſs, though higher in reſpect of dignity; for <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in all his houſe as a ſervant, but this man was faithful as a ſon in his own houſe, in the houſe that he was heir of, that houſe wherein he was as King, even a prieſt, a prophet, and a ruler in. When the Lord ſignified by the ſpirit of prophecy, the coming of the <hi>Juſt One,</hi> he ſignified to the people that his miniſtry ſhould not be as that of <hi>Aaron;</hi> the people ſhould not have their religion without them, and their laws and precepts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and their prieſts without them, and their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and church without them; but that they ſhould have it all within them. <hi>I will write my law in their hearts, I will put it into their inward parts, then they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God, and they ſhall not forſake me.</hi> Your fathers brake my old covenant, but I will make a new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the latter days, a new covenant, not like that your fathers broke; they brake the law without them, <hi>but I will write my law in their hearts; this prophet that is like to</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>he ſhall teach my people, he ſhall be a leader to them, and guide them in the way they are to go, and ſhall be a captain for
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020309_0027_0FAEF66A301DDF00"/>
them, to lead them to ſalvation; and it ſhall come to paſs, in the day that I do this, if there be any that will not hear him, he ſhall be cut off from among the people.</hi> That is, the judgment that comes upon the contemners of the goſpel, upon them that will not hear Chriſt Jeſus, they ſhall be cut off from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; from what people? From the people of God; they ſhall have no part of the privileges that are enjoyed thro' Chriſt; they ſhall be cut off from the benefits that others reap by their faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So that now we are to expect the operation and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a miniſtry, that leads a people to an inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, a heart religion, where the heart is fixed entirely upon the true and living God, as the object of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and truſt; and they have no other. This is a ſtrange word to fleſh and blood; what, no other depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than on the inviſible God? Fleſh and blood, and ſenſuality, can never come to this; this is a religion that hath been hid from ages and generations, and will be hid to all ages that ever ſhall be in the world, where ſenſuality prevails. What, will you have me to have my whole depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the comfort of my life here, and of the life that is to come, the other life, to have my dependence upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God, that inviſible power that made me, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the world? How is it poſſible for me to ſequeſter myſelf, and draw myſelf off from all viſible objects? I muſt truſt to this, and truſt to that: Fleſh and blood can never attain to this, with all the wit and reaſon it hath; it can never ſeparate itſelf from idols; they are little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; they are children of another birth, born of another ſeed, that keep themſelves from idols.</p>
            <p>Friends, idolatry is a great deal more common, I find, than moſt are aware of. Am I commanded to <hi>love the Lord with all my heart, and ſoul, and mind, and might?</hi> What is left when the whole is taken away? If God hath my whole heart, what have I to beſtow upon the world? What love, what affection, what eagerneſs, what fervency can I beſtow upon the world, or any object in the world, when my whole heart, and ſoul, and mind, is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is gone toward the Lord?</p>
            <p>This is the firſt and great commandment; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020309_0028_0FAEF66A4939B1C0"/>
is like unto it, that is, <hi>thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> Here it is that the law and the prophets, ſaith, creeds, prayer, religion and worſhip, all that ever was in the world, all are comprehended in this, <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ſoul and ſtrength, and thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> So what need is there for us to be diſputing about religion; about this tenet, and the other tenet; this text, and the other text? For my part, I ſhould only deſire you to underſtand this text, and I ſhould not doubt your going to Heaven. Here is the ſum; here is all at once; here is the quinteſſence of all religion, of all types, ſhadows, figures, ceremonies and prieſt-hood, and all that ever was or could be named and practiſed in the world; all brought to this, <hi>the heart giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up to God;</hi> our love ſet upon him.</p>
            <p>What, is this ſufficient, will ſome ſay? This will make you a good moral man; but what is this to the Chriſtian religion? You may be led into error, and become a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic for all this.</p>
            <p>How can this be, that I ſhould not be of a ſound faith, but led into error and hereſy for all this? When people let in error, and hereſy, and unſoundneſs of faith, where do they let it in? Do they not let in the principles of error and hereſy into their hearts? I believe this, and that, and the other error, that it comes into the heart, and hath a ſeat in the heart; but how can we let it into the heart, <hi>when the heart is given up to God?</hi> Cannot I keep out error and hereſy, if I give up my heart and ſoul to him? Cannot I truſt him with all?</p>
            <p>This kind of talk of error and hereſy hath come among men that have had the keeping of their own ſouls: They have taken their own ſouls into their own hands, and have ordered their religion themſelves, or have had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body to order it for them; and a great many of them have met together to make creeds, and catechiſms, and confeſſions, and orthodox doctrines, that might certainly be profeſſed and ſubſcribed. So afterwards ſome have come and found fault with them; then they muſt have a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to try them; then theſe go off and are laid aſide, and others are given in the room of them; ſo that theſe men
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020309_0029_0FAEF66C8797E8A0"/>
have ſet up for themſelves. Theſe would not be under the government and preſcription of God, as children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of a father; but they will ſet up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions themſelves, and ſay to the reſt of the world, if you own any thing contrary to our principles, you are a heretic; and being a heretic, you are to be rooted out and cut off. Do not you read in the ſcripture, that <hi>whover hears not the Prophet that was to come into the world, ſhould be cut off?</hi> What, will not you hear Chriſt ſpeak in the church? Will not you hear Chriſt ſpeak? The church cannot ſpeak without a head; if you will not hear the church, you muſt be cut off. Then they have fallen to hanging, and burning, and killing, and deſtroying people, and nations not a few: And this comes from their mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faiths, and creeds, and ordering religion themſelves: All their barbarous and inhuman cruelties, martyring and dungeoning people, comes from their making faiths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and of all things nothing is more deſperately wicked, and they did not know it. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> Men know not how proud and arrogant they themſelves are, and yet they would be ordering the hearts, and minds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of others; and out of this hath ſprung all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and idolatry, becauſe men would not give up their hearts to God; <hi>thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me.</hi> This commandment is great in itſelf; ſtrict in the terms; <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> Their neighbours could not ſee with their eyes; therefore they would be hanging, and burning, and deſtroying one another.</p>
            <p>But, bleſſed be God, who is now bringing forth true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity upon its old baſis and foundation, whereon it was placed at firſt, for Chriſtianity hath been juſtled off from its firſt foundation; for inſtead of loving God with all their hearts, and loving their neighbours as themſelves, they hated them: Now this is the day, O friends! the weight of it is great; this I ſay is the day wherein God is bringing Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity upon its old foundation.</p>
            <p>I would not have you think that I am here judging our fore-fathers, that are fallen aſleep, that, therefore, they are
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020309_0030_0FAEF66DAD5FFF50"/>
gone to Hell, becauſe they ſaw not this day, and lived not to ſee that benefit of it that we enjoy; I am far from it: This was the thing that they believed and prayed to God for; they did not ſee this day outwardly, but they ſaw it by faith. When I was a child, I remember the people of God, when they met three or four together, they would rejoice in the hopes of what they foreſaw; they gave thanks to God for the bleſſed days that he would bring forth, though they could not tell when; they did ſay, and believe, that God would ſcatter the fogs, and miſts, and bring forth a happy day, wherein his people ſhould have the gift of his Spirit: When they ſaw the impoſitions and perſecutions of thoſe times, when they that did not conform, and comply, were caſt into priſons, dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and gaols; well, it will not always be thus, ſay they, there is a day coming, wherein the Lord will ſet his people free from all the yokes of oppreſſion, and from the oppreſſor.</p>
            <p>Indeed, my ſoul did rejoice in hearing the prophetical ſayings of thoſe good men, and I thought I might live to ſee that day. Bleſſed be God that hath preſerved my life to this day, and to this hour, to enjoy what they prayed for: They prayed to God to ſcatter the miſts and fogs, that they might no longer cloud and darken men's minds, and hinder them from enjoying God's teaching. Bleſſed be God, that we are now in the enjoyment of the prayers of the faithful, that left the world before we were in it. Now the day is come that they prayed for, and enquired after.</p>
            <p>How ſtrangely doth the man talk, will ſome ſay, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chriſtian religion; the Chriſtian religion is all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land over;</hi> go to any meeting in <hi>London,</hi> except one, and they will tell you they are Chriſtians; I would to God they were; that is the worſt I wiſh them all. But what ſhould we talk of the Chriſtian religion without the Chriſtian life? except we find that amongſt them, what ſignifies the name and profeſſion of it? And the Chriſtian doctrine is wanting in many places too. There is many in this city, urging this very command, of loving God with all their hearts, and their neighbours as themſelves, as fervently as I can do, or any body elſe; and yet they will tell you in the next breath, that no man in <hi>London,</hi> nor in the world, can do this; no man can poſſibly love God with all his heart; never a man can be found that can
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020309_0031_0FAEF66F1F52C898"/>
perform ſuch an act, as to love his neighbour as himſelf: Not every neighbour, it may be, but ſome one choice aſſociate he may pick out, that he can love, and bear with his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and affronts, and <hi>love</hi> him as himſelf; <hi>love</hi> thy neighbour, that is every body, that there may be a good-will for all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple throughout the whole race of mankind, <hi>peace on earth, good-will towards men:</hi> This is the fruit of the goſpel. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian words will not make the Chriſtian religion, there muſt be a Chriſtian life; but where ſhall we find that, or ſeek it?</p>
            <p>I know not, I have nothing to do to judge any body, but there is one that judgeth who it is that liveth the Chriſtian life, and who doth not? Who is this? what one is this? <hi>The HEAD of the Chriſtian church:</hi> Why, is he here? Yes, the head of the Chriſtian church is here, and he ſpeaks and gives ſentence; if you have an ear you may hear him, and if you will turn your mind inward, for he is an <hi>inward miniſter,</hi> every one of you, if you will turn your minds inward, he will tell you whether you live a Chriſtian life, and what <hi>life</hi> it is you <hi>live:</hi> If there be a drunkard here, let him ask whether his life be a Chriſtian life; will a man go away ignorant from this place, and have no anſwer? If there be a drunkard here, let him ask inwardly in his own boſom, Lord is my life a Chriſtian <hi>life?</hi> I dare affirm, on God's behalf, he will have an anſwer, no, thy life is not a Chriſtian <hi>life,</hi> but a ſhameful, beaſtly life, a brutiſh one.</p>
            <p>Who told you that the <hi>Head</hi> of Chriſtians, Chriſt Jeſus, is preſent? Chriſt Jeſus, is he preſent? How came he here? He is aſcended up into Heaven ſuch a day, ſay they, how came he here? Let him be aſcended up into Heaven, yet he is not ſo aſcended into Heaven as not to be here alſo; how ſhould he fulfil his promiſe, if he be circumſcribed in Heaven or earth? How ſhould he make good his promiſe, if when <hi>two or three are met together in his name, he is not in the midſt of them?</hi> Here now are many more than two or three met together in the name of Chriſt, and that hope for acceptance with God, through the <hi>Mediator,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus; if you think that here are two or three met together in the name of Chriſt, it follows that Chriſt is in the midſt of them.</p>
            <p>I know not what you may enjoy, ſome may poſſibly ſay, I do not find any ſuch preſence of Chriſt; I hear of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020309_0032_0FAEF66F924794A8"/>
of Chriſt in the ſacrament, and I have heard talk of the preſence of Chriſt at a meeting, but I have been at many a meeting, and I never found ſuch a preſence of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Can you read the ſcriptures? Yes, I can read the ſcriptures as well at you but that cannot give me a ſenſe of it; I do read the ſcriptures and believe them; but what ſignifies my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcriptures concerning the preſence of Chriſt, if I have not a ſenſe of it? I have been at many a meeting, but never had the ſenſe of ſuch a Divine Preſence as you talk of, nor it may be at the ſacrament neither: What is the reaſon thou haſt no ſenſe of it? If thou wilt take my counſel, and turn thy mind inward, and enquire whether the thing I ſpeak of be true, whether there be ſuch a voice as I ſpeak of, that will tell thee what thy ſtate is: If thou wilt be true to thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, thou mayeſt know the Divine Preſence, and thou mayeſt hear Chriſt ſpeak.</p>
            <p>The ſoul hath eyes, and ears, as well as the body. What eyes doth the apoſtle mean when he ſaith, <hi>the God of this world hath blinded the eyes of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them?</hi> If the ſoul hath eyes, and ears, as well as the body, it can hear, and ſee as the body; as the bodily eye can ſee viſible things, ſo the eye of the ſoul can ſee things that are inviſible, and heavenly; you can hear my voice outwardly, and you may hear the voice of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. I have known ſome that have been ſo afraid to hear ill of themſelves, that they would not enquire; ſome have been ſo guilty in their own conſciences, that they have been afraid of hearing ill, and would not enquire about them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: So it is inwardly; ſome have been ſo conſcious that their life and converſation is naught, that their life is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life, that they dare not put it to the queſtion: It would certainly have been told them, thy life is not a Chriſtian life; thou muſt mend thy life, before ever thou comeſt to have peace with God: If this ſhould be thy portion and mine, that upon ſearch we ſhould find our condition bad, what harm is it?</p>
            <p>I would put one queſtion to thee, be ſerious in conſidering of it: We are all children of wrath by nature, none of us differ about that, and that <hi>unleſs we be born again, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> The queſtion is, whether I
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020309_0033_0FAEF670483B2998"/>
am one of thoſe or not? Suppoſe upon enquiry it be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to me that I am not, that is bad enough; this is hard, but not ſo hard as it is true; this is the thing which I would have you conſider: Am not I in a better caſe to know that I am in a natural ſtate, than to go on and periſh to eternity? As long as there is life, there is hope; as long as a man is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and taking care for his ſoul, and enquiring about the ſtate of his immortal ſoul, if his ſoul is not in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is it not better for him to know it, and to ſeek for a cure? For there is no greater infirmity and infelicity can be upon man, than to have ſome occult and hidden diſeaſe, that he cannot be made ſenſible of; for this waſtes and ſpoils him, and he cannot be perſuaded to look out for a remedy: So it is inwardly; if a man be ignorant of his condition, and go on to his dying day, and hour, and does not ſeek after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, this men periſheth without all peradventure. When you are in this enquiry, be content to be controlled, be willing to have the truth ſpoken, though it be againſt yourſelves. I might inſtance in divers things that I have ſpoken of: If a man be ſatisfied that his life is not a Chriſtian life; I ſay, if the ſwearer or liar, if the proud perſon, or the effeminate, as ſoon as they come to be ſatisfied that their life is not a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian life that they now live, what can this man expect? What counſel ſhould we give him, and what counſel ſhould he take? I will go on in the way that I am in: What, after thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy life is not a Chriſtian life? God forbid: Wilt thou go on and perpetrate ſin upon ſin, and heap up wrath againſt the day of wrath; I am a ſinner, my life is unchriſtian, I make account to live in ſin, and die in ſin; is this good policy? Conſider another text which our Lord ſpake, <hi>if ye die in your ſins, whither I go, ye cannot come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O friends, lay theſe things to your hearts; what have I to do but to tell you that the love I have in my ſoul for you all, makes me deſire in my heart that you might be ſaved? <hi>This is the will of God, that you might all be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth: Bleſſed are they that know the truth; the truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi> Truth in the inward parts, hath a ſpeaking voice; and if thou hearken to it, it will tell thee that thy ſtate is naught. Canſt thou believe the truth when he tells thee ſo, that
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020309_0034_0FAEF6710C6821D8"/>
thy ſtate is naught, and that thou art like to go to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction, unleſs there be repentance and regeneration to prevent it? Canſt thou believe this doctrine, when it ſounds in thy own heart? If thou canſt not believe it, unbelief will be thy ruin. <hi>The ſpirit of truth is come to convince the world of ſin, becauſe they believe not in Chriſt:</hi> He tells them their condition, and they will not believe him. The Spirit of Chriſt convinceth men of ſin, and they believe him not. The ſpirit of truth convinceth thee of thy ſin, but thou believeſt him not. If thou loveſt thy pleaſure, and thy profit, and thine honour, then thou lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not God with all thine heart; and then thou art not a Chriſtian, but out of covenant with God. Art thou ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that thy condition is bad, were it not beſt to get it mended? After we are convinced of our own ſinful ſtate, is it not our beſt, courſe to ſeek to have it mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Who ſhall mend it? ſaith one; I have done all I can to mend my life, and I cannot mend it.</p>
            <p>I have concluded ſo in my younger years; I have faſted, and prayed, and ſpent time in hearing, reading, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and did all in my own power, and all to mend my ſtate, but I could not mend it; and as I grew up in years, ſin and corruption more prevailed, and there was no help; and I came ſo far as to believe there was no help, and that if God did not help me, I was undone to all eternity. I many times wiſhed that I had never been born: I went to miniſters and meetings, and to all ſorts of ſeparate people, and to all manner of ordinances, and to all manner of means, to mend this bad heart of mine, to ſee if I could get a power that would give me vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over my corruptions; but my arm was never ſo long as to reach thereunto; it was far out of my power and reach.</p>
            <p>Many have ſought to get this power of reforming their hearts and lives; to attain it by their own hands, by their own endeavours, but they could never do it; they could never better their condition, nor bring forth fruit worthy of amendment of life. I wiſh that every one was come to that paſs, that they knew not which way to turn them; that they were come at laſt to their wits end: They
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020309_0035_0FAEF671CEA58300"/>
will come to it ſooner or later; the ſooner the better. I have done all I can; I can do no more; I am at my wits end, and I know not what to think, concerning my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate; I know not what to judge of it; I ſtrive againſt my luſts and corruptions, but for all that they prevail againſt me: Temptations come before me, but I cannot conquer them. O I am glad when people come to that paſs, that they know not what to do, but deſpair of their own arms, of their own ſtrength, and their own wit, and deſpair of all other help in the world; I am glad of that.</p>
            <p>I am not preaching up deſpair of God's grace and mercy; but let me tell you, when men deſpair of their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and of all outward means, and helps, then they are fit objects for the mercy of God; and not till then: <hi>When the Lord looked, and ſaw that there was none to ſave and deliver, then his own arm brought ſalvation.</hi> God will not ſave till then; God will not reveal his power, till men have done with their own power; they will never truſt God, while they think they can do ſomething for themſelves. All the forms of religion of the ſeveral peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this nation, will do them little good without the power. What is the meaning of that principle, to have ſuch maſſes, and prayers, and performances? What is the meaning of it? Let us ſearch to the bottom. They ſay we are ſinners; when we pray to God for his bleſſing, and for ſalvation by Chriſt, there is this at the bottom, they think theſe duties and performances will be very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their ſtate; helpful towards the knowledge of it: To ſpeak plain Engliſh, theſe are their Gods. If I ſpeak of prophane and wicked people, I would ſay their luſts are their Gods: But when I ſpeak of righteous people, that are meer formaliſts, then I ſay their duties, as they call them, are their Gods. When they have done all, they can do nothing for them, and then they have no Gods at all; then they are <hi>godleſs:</hi> And if God doth not help them, then they are undone to all eternity.</p>
            <p>When poor creatures are caſt out, as it were, into the open field, to the loathing of their perſons, not ſalted at all, nor ſwaddled at all, but lying in the guilt of their blood: <hi>When
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:020309_0036_0FAEF6728C917BC8"/>
I paſſed by thee, ſaith the Lord, and ſaw thee polluted in thy own blood, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, yea, when thou waſt in thy blood, I ſaid unto thee, live. When I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was a time of love, and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, I ſware unto thee, and entered into covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> What, was it a time of love, when I was ſuch an object in mine own eyes, that I thought I was the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creature in the world; one that could not make a good prayer, nor diſpute for religion, nor perform any duty; a poor creature caſt out into the open field, to the loathing of my perſon; loſt all that I gained; my name was from among the living; my days were paſſed over in ſorrow, and I ſaid there is nothing but darkneſs, and death, and miſery for me: I uſed all means, and tried all things, ſaving only a living truſt in God alone, and that fleſh and blood cannot do. Fleſh and blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know him, therefore fleſh and blood cannot truſt in him. Alas! ſaid I, I cannot truſt in the Lord, I cannot caſt my ſoul and all my concerns, my fame and reputation in the world, I cannot caſt all upon the care of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; I cannot know him, nor truſt in him; how can I do it? nobody can do it. <hi>They that know my name,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>they will put their truſt in me:</hi> Never a truer word was ſpoken; but how they ſhould know God, and truſt in him, I know not.</p>
            <p>When thou comeſt once to this paſs, to be at thy wits end, and not know which way to turn thee, nor to whom to run for help, or to ask counſel for thy ſoul's welfare, when thou art come to the end of all, and without hope, then God reveals himſelf by his Son Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt the Son of God, is known by our coming to him; but none can come unto Chriſt, <hi>except the Father which hath ſent him, draw him: When thou haſt done with thy Gods, and thrown away thy idols to the bats and moles,</hi> then thou wilt find the Lord; and thou wilt cry out, O! that God would have mercy upon me, and lift up the light of his countenance upon me; I am a poor, miſerable creature. There are many that make ſuch a whining and complaining, that they take a pride in their very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:020309_0037_0FAEF673A1D600A8"/>
their hypocriſy is ſo great. I have known ſome that have prided themſelves in wording their condition, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their miſerable caſe before the Lord; but ſuppoſe thou canſt not ſpeak at all, but feeleſt thyſelf miſerable, thou canſt not expreſs thy condition; at ſuch a time as this, God was drawing thy ſoul to Chriſt Jeſus, the Mediator of it: I have heard of a Mediator, and that there is <hi>Balm</hi> in <hi>Gilead</hi> for me; that there is a phyſician there; that there is one phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, even Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator of the new covenant; thou haſt ſinned againſt him, and grieved him, yet he ſtands with open arms for thee, ready to receive thee and embrace thee; where ſtands he? He ſtands as the door and knocks; it is a ſmall matter, one would think, to let him in: <hi>Rev.</hi> iii, 20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock; and if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Here is good news for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſoul, if any ſuch be here; Chriſt the Mediator, ſtands at the door and knocks, he will come in and ſup with thee, if thou open to him; then we ſhall meet with the Lord's ſupper: <hi>This is the Lord, I will wait for him;</hi> he will bring his bread with him, the bread of life, and the wine of his kingdom, and the Lord's ſupper will be celebrated without cavilling and jangling.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe we will not pervert the ſcripture, I would have you that underſtand books, read what <hi>commentators</hi> of this and former ages ſay upon this text; whether they do not deliver in their opinions, that this knocking at the door, is Chriſt calling the ſoul by his grace; and this door is the door of the heart, and Chriſt's calling the ſoul by his grace and Spirit, to let him in by faith: This is their judgment and ſenſe, and their ſenſe is mine; and I believe the genuine ſenſe of this text, that Chriſt would have people think he is near to them, and would have them open their hearts, and receive him by faith, to be a Saviour to them.</p>
            <p>No; that, ſaith fleſh and blood, I cannot bear, I cannot conſent to have him for my Saviour, I will not let him in, for he is like <hi>Micaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahab, he never ſpake good concerning me:</hi> For if I have him for my Saviour, I muſt part with my luſts and pleaſures; if there be any other Saviour, I will try, and not meddle with him; he will ſpoil all our mirth and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020309_0038_0FAEF674F2325B68"/>
good ſociety; he will tell me that every idle word that I ſhall ſpeak, I muſt give an account thereof in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: What, do you think that I can like ſuch a Saviour? That I can live with ſuch a one as will call me to an account for every word I ſpeak; and that if I ſpeak one idle word, judgment will come upon me? No, I will try one and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rather than accept of him on ſuch terms; I am one that am joined to ſuch a church, and enjoy ſuch and ſuch ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and ſuch helps: I am in covenant with God, and under the ſeals of that covenant; I am baptized, and do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lord's ſupper, which is another ſeal of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; I hope it will go well with me. I will go ſomething farther: Another ſaith, he muſt have a Mediator; I will go to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and offer ſomething to her, and pray to her: Saith another, I will go to Saint <hi>James,</hi> and Saint <hi>John,</hi> and other Saints to intercede with God for me. They muſt have ſome Mediator: This is the twiſting and twining of the ſons and daughters of men, to keep out Chriſt, the great Mediator, who came into the world for this purpoſe, to deſtroy the works of the Devil. Alas! I have nothing left but my bare life and living in this world; I have nothing left me but ſome <hi>little deſire I had to pleaſe God,</hi> and that he will never judge and condemn me for; but my falſe dealing, and buying and ſelling with deceit, he will judge this, and condemn me; and my diſcourſing of things without me; all my carnal friendſhip of the world, and my vain faſhions, all this is corrupt and defiled; theſe he came on purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy; he came to deſtroy both the Devil and his works. What, can a man live in the world, and never join with the Devil? never ſin at all? never do any thing that the Devil would have him to do? There is no perfection in this world; no living without ſin here; then I am ſure there is no unity with Chriſt here; and if there be no unity with Chriſt, then there is none with God the Father. What will become of thee now? What will all the pleaders for that opinion ſay now? There is ſomething ſtands between God and me, and I ſhall never have peace; and what is that? It is ſin; I would have my ſin taken away, elſe I had better ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born. Canſt thou remove ſin out of thy heart? I have tried, but I cannot do it; I have heard of Chriſt the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020309_0039_0FAEF6758B00E118"/>
               <hi>Mediator</hi> of the new covenant, he ſaith, he came into the world, and that for this purpoſe he was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil. Now ſin in my heart is the Devil's work, I will ſee if he will deſtroy that for me; I will truſt and rely upon him, and ſee if his great power can deſtroy it in me.</p>
            <p>Here people come rightly to believe in him that God hath ſent, and truſt in him, and he will take them in; and, like a Chirurgeon, he will rip their hearts, and let out their corruptions, though there hath been ever ſo much rottenneſs; and he will heal them, and purify them, and pardon them, though they have been ever ſo wicked, if they come to him; when thy ſins are ſet in order before thee, then thou crieſt out, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Is it God that hath thought on me, and waited to be gracious, hath born my ſins long? how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful is his patience towards me! All theſe things working in the ſoul, tends to beget a love of God, and fervent deſires after being cleanſed and purified from ſin, and earneſt prayer to the Lord, to make the holy fire to kindle that would burn it up: The more the ſoul truſteth in Chriſt, the more doth this heavenly fire burn up our luſts, and then a man feels a great change in his mind: The things, ſaith he, that I delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, are now grievous to me; I hope I ſhall never be found in thoſe things again; my mind is now taken off them; who took it off? Didſt thou not ſtrive before to take it off? I did, but I could not do it. There are many, I believe, in this aſſembly, before the Lord, that are my witneſſes in this matter, that when they came to Chriſt the Mediator, he changed their minds, and he untied the Devil's fetters; they were tied to their ſins and luſts, but he hath unlooſed them; they are aſhamed of thoſe things that they formerly took pleaſure in. <hi>What fruit</hi> (ſaith the apoſtle) <hi>had you in thoſe things, whereof you are now aſhamed?</hi> So I ſay, what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have you in ſporting, and gaming, and drinking, and company-keeping? What pleaſure have you to think on your wanton diſcourſes? What pleaſure in pride and vanity? What pleaſure in wrath and bitterneſs of mind? And what pleaſure in malice and envy? What pleaſure have you in theſe things whereof you are now aſhamed? So far as you
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020309_0040_0FAEF6776D7223D8"/>
are convinced, you are aſhamed to think of them; I am aſhamed to think that the Devil at ſuch a time, by ſuch a temptation, ſhould prevail over me.</p>
            <p>I would to God you were all come to this, to be aſhamed that you might remember your paſt evil ways and actions, with ſorrow and ſhame: There is a ſecret joy in this. Sure it is better to be aſhamed, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in impudence. God hath wrought this change at laſt; and who ſhall have the glory of it? God ſhall have the glory of it; for his own works will praiſe him. What men do, many times they do for their own praiſe; but when they are at their wits end, and know not what to do, they caſt themſelves upon their Maker, to ſee if he will have mercy upon them; if not, they muſt periſh: Then for what he doth, he gets the glory and the praiſe of it.</p>
            <p>There are ſome here, that are bound to praiſe God while they have a day to live, for what he hath done for them. They could never have loved God with all their hearts; but they would have continued ſtrangers to God, and the Devil would have led them captive at his will. They would not have loved God with all their hearts, had not God firſt <hi>ſhed abroad his love upon their hearts,</hi> and conſtrained them to love him: It is he that hath firſt loved them, and <hi>wrought in them, both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> Whatſoever we are, we are by the grace of God; this grace is magnified in them that believe and obey the goſpel.</p>
            <p>My friends, we know there is ſo much peace and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the ways of God; ſo much ſoul-ſatisfaction in walking with God, and loving of him with all our hearts, I ſhould be glad if every one of you were of the ſame mind, and had experience of it. We labour diligently for this purpoſe; and we would ſet before you theſe two things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, how we may come to know our miſerable ſtand by nature.</p>
            <p>And what a bleſſed and happy ſtate they are in, that have been converted and changed; that have been tranſlated out of the kingdom of darkneſs, into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:020309_0041_0FAEF679068D71C8"/>Conſider your ſtate by nature is evil; we hope that many of you believe the report's of the goſpel, concerning the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord, his great love in ſending his Son into the world, to ſeek and to ſave you that were loſt, and that you believe in him. And we are perſuaded, that by the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of preaching God will ſave ſome of you, that you may be his redeemed ones, and truſt to no other Saviour: <hi>For there is not any other name under Heaven, but the name of Jeſus, by which we can be ſaved.</hi> He only can take away the ſins of the world; his ſpirit ſearcheth the heart, and trieth the reins, which he promiſed to ſend into the world when he was about leaving of it. Now I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim that Holy Spirit to be the Spirit of the God of Heaven, that now ſees what reſolution thou art of, and what thou art now propoſing to do; whether to go on in ſin, or to return to God. This I can ſpeak without blaſphemy, it is God's Spirit that ſearcheth the heart, and knoweth thy thoughts and purpoſes, and convinceth thee of thy ſin: God hath ſent his Son Chriſt Jeſus into the world to enlighten you, that by his light you may ſee him; and that by his grace you might receive him; and that by his grace you might be ſaved.</p>
            <p>To him I commit you all, and theſe words that we have ſpoken in the evidence and demonſtration of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, according as he hath wrought in us.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you we were never called of God to ſtudy <hi>Sermons</hi> for you, nor to preach things that are made ready to our hands; but as the <hi>Lord our God</hi> hath wrought in us, and as God hath been pleaſed to make known his mind to us, and by his Spirit given us utterance, ſo we ſpeak, and ſo we preach. You that are come to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things of the Spirit, you will judge what I ſay. <hi>I ſpeak unto you that are ſpiritual; judge ye what I ſay,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle. So when I ſpeak of divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, you that are ſpiritual, judge what I ſay? And as you come to judge and determine in yourſelves that theſe things are true, you will feel the power of them in your own ſpirits, and we ſhall all be of the ſame mind; and as we have <hi>one God,</hi> we ſhall ſerve him in ſincerity, and worſhip him with reverence. Then his name
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020309_0042_0FAEF67A29AFD830"/>
ſhall be exalted in the midſt of us, and we ſhall edify one another in <hi>love,</hi> and we ſhall inſtruct one another, and call upon one another; <hi>come, let us go to the houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>he will teach us, and preſerve us</hi> in his way, and do us good, and keep us from all evil.</p>
            <p>Turn your minds inward, and conſider that God is a God at hand, ready to help you; and he requires no more of you than of other people in former times, to love the Lord with all your hearts, and to abſtract and withdraw your mind from all other things that do come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with him; and be ſure to have no truſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence but upon him; then ſee what God will do for you: No tongue can expreſs, nor pen write; <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, the things that God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi> That wiſdom and knowledge, that joy and peace, and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that paſſeth all underſtanding, he will reveal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by his ſpirit to them that love him, and truſt in him, and rely upon him, and receive teaching from him; he will feed them <hi>with food in due ſeaſon; he will bring the former and the latter rain, and they ſhall be as trees planted by the rivers of water, and bring forth fruit in due ſeaſon; and their leaf ſhall not fade or wither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath been <hi>London</hi>'s wonder, and <hi>England</hi>'s won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how it comes to paſs, that ſuch a people's leaf hath not withered, nor faded, as many have done: Our root was by a river; if we had ſtood in ourſelves; if our dependence and ſupport had been upon doctrines, tenets, and commandments of men, then our leaf would have been upon the ground as well as others; but becauſe we have been upon our root, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is always green, both in ſummer and winter, therefore our leaf hath not withered; to the praiſe of God, and to the honour of his name, be it ſpoken: He hath preſerved us, for we have no power of ourſelves, no more than others; but we truſt in God, and have received power from God, to ſtand as witneſſes for him; we have truſted in the Lord, and he hath ſtood by us, and delivered us, when we were compaſſed about with dangers and diſtreſſes; if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to truſt in him ſtill, he will bring us through all
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020309_0043_0FAEF67AD464BFB8"/>
our trials and troubles, and he will be with us, and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave us nor forſake us;</hi> if we take him for our God, we ſhall never need any other.</p>
            <p>We read that <hi>Senacherib,</hi> king of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> ſent <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> with a great army, ſaying, <hi>what confidence is this wherein thou truſteſt? And he ſpake alſo to the people, and cried with a loud voice, hear you the word of the great king of</hi> Aſſyria; <hi>let not</hi> Hezekiah <hi>deceive you, for he ſhall not be able to deliver you; neither let</hi> Hezekiah <hi>make you truſt in the Lord, ſaying, the Lord will deliver us.</hi> Hezekiah <hi>went and prayed to the Lord, ſaying, O Lord of hoſts, God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that dwelleſt between the Cherubims, thou art the God, the God alone of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou haſt made Heaven and earth; incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord, and ſee and hear all the words of</hi> Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib, <hi>which he hath ſent to reproach the living God,</hi> &amp;c. And we read, that after he had preſented his ſupplication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, <hi>the angel of the Lord went forth and ſmote in the camp of the</hi> Aſſyrians, <hi>one hundred four ſcore and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; and when they aroſe early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what came of it at laſt; and thus it hath been in our day; they that truſt in the Lord, he will deliver them, and they ſhall never be aſhamed nor confounded; but as for all other Gods, they that truſt in them, ſhall be confounded and covered with ſhame, and they and their Gods will periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>And now, my friends, I beſeech you all to have reſpect to this great duty of putting your whole truſt in the <hi>Lord,</hi> who is the living <hi>God,</hi> and he will be always preſent with you, and work in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure; he will ſupport and preſerve you in all your trials and ſufferings, that you may be veſſels of honor, to bear his name in the earth, and ſo ſound forth his praiſe to the following generations.</p>

               <p>Glory, praiſe and thankſgiving be to thee, O Lord! that by thy power, thou haſt inclined the hearts and conſciences of the ſons and daughters of men, to ſubmit to thee, and bow their necks to the bleſſed and eaſy yoke of thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, that they may do thy will on earth, as it is done in Heaven. They that are travelling, and diſtreſſed, and afflicted in their ſouls becauſe of their bondage, do thou ariſe, living Father, and reveal, and diſcover thy power to them; ſhew them the exceeding greatneſs of thy power, that they may truſt therein, and be ſafe; make bare thine arm for their ſalvation. Thoſe that are ſlumbering in their profeſſion, let them be awakened; and bring to thine heavenly kingdom, thoſe that have paſſed through thy refining fire, and whom thou haſt cleanſed and ſanctified.</p>

            <head>SERMON IV. <hi>The</hi> STANDARD <hi>of</hi> TRUTH.</head>
            <head type="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <date>May <hi>29, 1692.</hi>
               </date>
            </head>
            <p>THERE is a univerſal ſtandard of truth, that God hath ſet up over all the ſons and daughters of men; he hath given the knowledge of it in, and through Jeſus Chriſt; he hath dealt it out to them, that they may be capable of joining and adhering to the truth, and to be delivered from eternal condemnation. This <hi>ſtandard and meaſuring-rule</hi> is revealed and manifeſted in every man and woman, by the light that ſhines in their hearts, by which they are able to diſcern, and to give a ſound and true judgment, (if they are but willing) upon all <hi>their own ways.</hi> A man or woman may know in every word they ſpeak, in every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they do, whether they ſpeak, and do, according to the truth, or whether they are juſtified by the truth, in what they ſpeak and do.</p>
            <p>I tell you, my friends, this is no ſmall mercy, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath obtained at the hand of his Maker, that he is brought into a capacity of not acting blind-fold, but that he may ſee his way, and his own inclinations, and paſs judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, whether they are good or evil? Whether they will ſtand juſtified in the ſight of his Maker, or whether they will be condemned.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, the veil of ignorance, that is come over the ſons and daughters of men, through ſin, tranſgreſſion and rebellion, is very great. And I may ſay, as the apoſtle ſaid, <hi>ſometime you were darkneſs:</hi> And what can darkneſs ſee? what can dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſcover? The Lord our God, that made us, hath not left us in that ſtate of darkneſs, blindneſs and ignorance; but through the riches of his mercy and goodneſs, hath found out a way, to <hi>command that light ſhould ſhine out of darkneſs,</hi> into people's hearts, for all that the Devil did to darken man, to alienate and eſtrange him from his Maker.</p>
            <p>The ſame Almighty Power, that ſaid in the creation, <hi>let there be light, and it was ſo;</hi> he hath ſhined into our hearts;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020309_0046_0FAEF67D6AD7A6C0"/>
and the way by which he hath done ſo, is through the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, through Jeſus Chriſt the Redeemer, <hi>in whom the fulneſs of the God-Head dwells.</hi> He hath received power from his Father, not only to by a light and ſalvation, but to impart and communicate of that divine light unto them, even <hi>unto every one that cometh into the world;</hi> that ſo by means thereof, they may be delivered from their darkneſs, and ignorance of the mind of God, that they were liable to in the fall, and might be reſtored, through the Mediator, to a capacity of judging of their own actions, and of their own words, and ways, and inclinations.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>ſtandard</hi> which God hath pitched in every one of our boſoms, for the trial of ourſelves, either for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or condemnation, of every word and action.</p>
            <p>Now, to make every one ſenſible of the greatneſs of this bleſſing, conſider, it is not only given to augment and encreaſe knowledge, but it is given on purpoſe to allure and perſuade men into a liking of truth, into a love of truth: The apoſtle eſteemed it a wonderful mercy that came by Chriſt; <hi>he hath ſent him to bleſs us, in turning every one of us from the evil of his ways:</hi> So that here is a capacity that the ſons and daughters of men have, through the Mediator, of being turned from the evil of their ways and doings, to that which is well-pleaſing to God.</p>
            <p>The next work, after God hath wrought thus mercifully for the ſons and daughters of men, is, that they would be good to themſelves, and merciful to themſelves, and take pity of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by a due improvement of the grace, and mercy, and kindneſs of God, that he hath beſtowed freely upon them; and in bringing all their deeds to that ſtandard, all their words and actions to that rule; that ſo whatſoever they may be, or how many ſoever, if they do not anſwer that ſtandard and rule, they may deny, withſtand and reſiſt them, that ſo they may keep out of condemnation: For the apoſtle declares it plainly without ſcruple, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> If he had ſaid to them that profeſs Chriſt Jeſus, there had been a large latitude, eſpecially for thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but the words are limited, and you will find them ſo; that is, <hi>to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and (as if he ſhould ſay) that you may know rightly what I mean; I mean, <hi>ſuch
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020309_0047_0FAEF67DE39AE228"/>
as walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> They that are in Chriſt, walk after his Spirit; for, <hi>they that walk not after the Spirit of Chriſt, are none of his;</hi> but they that are his, walk after the ſpirit the ſpirit of truth, and there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them.</p>
            <p>It is not only the ſcriptures that ratify and confirm this doctrine, but you yourſelves are all living witneſſes of the truth of this, that ſo far as you do act and ſpeak in obedience to the principle of truth, that God hath planted in you, you feel no condemnation upon you: Such a thing I did at ſuch a time, and I had no condemnation: Why ſo? becauſe I did it in obedience, and ſubjection to that meaſure of grace that God ſet up in me; and ſuch a thing I did, for which I was condemned: Why ſo? becauſe I did it according to the inclinations of my own corrupt mind, and in contradiction to the truth that opened in me.</p>
            <p>My friends, I would have you in point of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of chriſtianity, to be the better for what you read and hear: It is poſſible for me to preach the truth, and you may believe what I ſay, and you may read the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and have the belief of what you read; but if you come to a ſenſible feeling of the fulfilling of things you hear, you will give a greater ſeal to the truth of the doctrine, than by all you have read and heard; and you will <hi>grow wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> by trying and experiencing the effect of every thing you underſtand; and not like the carnal men of this world, that have not faith, that mind only their worldly profits and pleaſures, ſuch are <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſenſual and deviliſh;</hi> but I would judge of actions and words, according to truth, and according to the effect I find in me. I did ſuch a thing, and I had peace in the doing of it; I feel no reproach, no condemnation upon me. Here is a way for people to grow up in the life of chriſtianity; to keep to the ſtandard of truth; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men will or no, they muſt do it at laſt, and may now, if they pleaſe, make a trial of their words and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>As for the moſt part of you, you are got paſt <hi>Pilate: Pilate</hi> could make that enquiry; <hi>what is truth?</hi> ſaith he: And I confeſs, it is not long ago, it is within the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020309_0048_0FAEF67F1772DA78"/>
of man, that a more ſerious and better ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo confounded with the darkneſs and ignorance of thoſe times, that they were ready to cry out, what is truth? and where is truth? Their eyes were ſo blinded, and things were ſo jumbled and confuſed by the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that men raiſed, that made things ſo dark people could not ſee their way: But <hi>God who hath commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs,</hi> hath brought a <hi>glorious day;</hi> hath diſſipated, and ſcattered, and driven away a great deal of that fog and miſt, that did overſpread men's minds. As many as have ſincerely ſought the truth in the inward parts, they have found a divine principle of truth, that hath a ſelf-evidencing quality in itſelf, to convince the minds and conſciences of the ſons and daughters of men, that it is the truth: And to this the Lord hath brought moſt of you, to be ſenſible of ſomething that is truth in itſelf. There are many things that are true in the words of them; many true expreſſions; but there is truth in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the eſſential truth of God, which, as it is in God, is everlaſting and eternal, and will ſtand over all error, and falſhood, and deceit: The truth, as it is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, is a ſtandard and rule for men to act by; he hath given it to the ſons and daughters of men; and as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in them, it is either a Judge to condemn them, or a Saviour to ſave them from their ſins, and to juſtify them.</p>
            <p>Now, that which concerns us, is to find out the meaſure of truth, or manifeſtation, or principle of truth, which it hath pleaſed God to reveal in ourſelves: And whoſoever will turn their minds a little while inward, into the ſerious ſearch and conſideration, how the Lord hath dealt with them, they will find they are not quite deſtitute of truth. One that makes it his practice to lye, cheat and cozen, is not utterly deſtitute of truth; for there is a principle of truth in him, that doth check and reprove him for his theft, lying and falſhood, and he lives under condemnation himſelf. He cannot draw near to the God of truth upon any occaſion, but his lying and falſhood ſtand in his way. Now, if ſo be, that this liar be made ſenſible of a principle of truth in him, and do but bring his words and actions to the truth, ſo much of it as he
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020309_0049_0FAEF67F4E829980"/>
knows will make him leave lying and deceiving, and to practiſe truth to eſcape condemnation; if he will but leave lying and falſhood, and live in the truth, and ſpeak the truth to his neighbour, he will find another ſtate, condition and frame in his ſoul, than there was before: He is now more at peace, And hath a clear and ſerene way, to come to God by prayer, and for pouring out his ſupplication, which he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for he had barred up his own way by his ſin, which lay continually at his door; <hi>if thou doſt not well, ſin lies at thy door,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Cain:</hi> So, when you do evil, you cannot but know it; when you are drunk, or ſwear or tell a lie, and deceive your neighbour, and carry on the deſign of ſinful profit, thou knoweſt it, whether men know it or no, and God that made thee knoweth it; and there thy ſin lies at the door, and blocks and bars thee out, that thou canſt not offer thy prayers to God with that clearneſs, as if thou hadſt ſpoken the truth: So that it highly concerns every one of us, to be waiting upon God, for the diſcovery of his truth to us; and then we muſt embrace, adhere and join to the truth, as our chiefeſt good.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, this adhering and joining to the truth, is a hard leſſon: It is pretty eaſy to find out a principle of truth, that ſtandeth againſt, and oppoſeth all manner of evil: Very few, now a-days, will deny a ſettled principle of truth in all men, that judgeth falſhood, and condemneth deceit, and witneſſeth againſt it in others, and in themſelves: But this ſame joining, and adhering to it, that cannot be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a croſs to a carnal mind.</p>
            <p>Now, if the croſs of Chriſt be not taken up, there is no good Chriſtianity among us; where this is neglected, it ſpots and ſtains the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, becauſe it is ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the doctrine of Chriſt; <hi>he that will be my diſciple, muſt;</hi> it is not, he may if he will; but, <hi>he muſt take up the croſs of Chriſt, and follow</hi> HIM. There were a ſort of people, that were never like to be made Chriſtians, that would be exempt from taking up a daily croſs; therefore he preſſeth it upon them to deny themſelves, and take up his croſs and follow him. No man is like to live a Chriſtian life, without taking up a daily croſs.</p>
            <p>This I cannot do, ſays one; I know how to carry myſelf
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020309_0050_0FAEF6824CD2F580"/>
among Chriſtians with ſeriouſneſs, ſobriety and watchfulneſs, without ſhaming any profeſſion; but I cannot deny myſelf, I cannot contradict my own will: This is that which keeps a man from leading a Chriſtian life, when he cannot deny himſelf, and take up his daily croſs.</p>
            <p>Now, it is come to this now a-days, when a light is broken forth, and men have a principle of truth in their own hearts, it comes to this; ſaith one, I ought to be <hi>holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> and to be watchful over my words, and have my converſation honeſt and juſt without deceit: See what a deal I know, yet I can never live this life, for all I know it ſo well; I cannot take up a daily croſs, which is ſo much againſt the contrary inclinations working in me; then the queſtion I put to myſelf is, ſhall I take up a croſs or no?</p>
            <p>Here it comes to the point with every man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or woman, after they come to the knowledge of this <hi>ſtandard</hi> of truth: If the world would but come to this rule and ſtandard, there would be no more cheating nor cozening, no more fraud, deceit nor diſſimulation, nor war and bloodſhed; but if men would, in every thing they doy anſwer the principle of truth in themſelves, they would put the queſtion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhall I take up my daily croſs, or no? Shall I deny myſelf thoſe pleaſures that my conſcience doth condemn; and thoſe ungodly gains that I ſeek after by falſhood, by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prevaricating and departing from the truth? Shall I do this, that I may be rich and great in the world, or ſhall I not?</p>
            <p>You know what I ſay, many of you, and have put this queſtion to yourſelves, and ſome have made a good anſwer to it: I will take up my daily croſs, by the grace of God; this ſtandard of truth ſhall be the rule of my words and actions, to my dying-day.</p>
            <p>They that have learned this leſſon, and obtained peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that have not only made a reſolution, but performed it in act and deed, by the power of Chriſt's croſs, they are purified, and ſanctified, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their old converſations, and <hi>have their converſation in Heaven;</hi> that is, live after a heavenly manner, live a godly life here upon earth, when they have come to this reſolution, and alſo the practice of it.</p>
            <p>I would deſire, and it is my labour, that you that hear me
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:020309_0051_0FAEF683B021E640"/>
this day, who are aware of what I am ſpeaking, <hi>viz. The STANDARD of TRUTH,</hi> the principle of Truth, that unerring Guide, which is placed in the conſcience of every man, and juſtifieth, or condemneth, his actions and words. You who are come to be aware of this, that you may all come to this godly reſolution in yourſelves, I would have this diſpute carried on in every one's boſom. When the queſtion is ſtated, I would have you really anſwer it; ſhall I guide my actions and words according to this unerring rule, or no? I cannot tell what to ſay, ſay ſome, there is danger in it: What danger can there be to anſwer that which a man knows to be truth? I will tell you what danger: The world is perverſe, and moſt men live out of truth, and the Devil is a cunning adverſary, and he would have none live in it: <hi>He abode not in the truth;</hi> and he would not have us live in it, nor regulate our words and actions by the truth in our own ſouls: What if moſt men in the world pervert the truth? What if ſo few walk in the <hi>narrow way,</hi> and ſo few come to life eternal; is that an argument that I muſt not come there? Should it not ſtir me up to greater diligence, that by any means I may be of the number of that few that ſhall obtain ſalvation, and not go with a great company in the way that leads to deſtruction? If we improve our times, and ſeaſons, and opportunities, and mercies, and bleſſings, that are vouchſafed to us, we at laſt may obtain life eternal.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, I muſt ſit down in deſpair, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come thither of myſelf, though I do what I can to <hi>work out my own ſalvation.</hi> There is a decree againſt me; what, tho' I ſhould pray ever ſo much, and ſpend my nights in grief and ſorrow? If I be decreed to eternal damnation, there is no help for me, no hope that I ſhould eſcape. And if I be decreed to ſalvation, though I take my liberty to ſin, and be looſe and wanton, as others, it cannot hinder me from attaining ſalvation at laſt.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, many have laid aſide the ſpiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare againſt corruption, and their ſpiritual travel, that they will do nothing in order to their everlaſting happineſs; therefore they think they had as good take their pleaſure: But, my friends, the caſe is not now ſo with us; let every ſoul among us praiſe the Lord for his mercy, in expelling that
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:020309_0052_0FAEF684DF402AF8"/>
thick cloud of darkneſs, which is vaniſhed and gone: This I know, and I hope you do all believe, that God doth every where, and in every nation, call ſinners to repentance, and that <hi>he delighteth not in the death of him that dieth, but rather that they would turn and live;</hi> and in order thereunto, he hath given his Son, Jeſus Chriſt, to be a Saviour and a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; and <hi>he hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,</hi> to give direction to us in our way: Now our duty is, to make improvement of thoſe viſitations of mercy, that God hath beſtowed upon us, in order to our ſalvation, and not live in <hi>rioting and drunkenneſs, chambering and wantonneſs, ſtrife and envying,</hi> and following the faſhions of the world: But we muſt <hi>work out our own ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, is not this done already? Is it not already wrought by our Saviour and Mediator? <hi>Chriſt hath taſted death for every man,</hi> and laid down a price for the ſoul of every man.</p>
            <p>But yet there muſt be a change wrought in us; there muſt be a tranſlation of our ſouls, from one ſtate to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is called in the ſcripture, regeneration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born again; this is called a being baptized into Chriſt, and deſcribed alſo by other expreſſions: But the matter is, to change thy life; for there is a ſinful ſource of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that is ſtirred up by the motions of the powers of darkneſs, and our own concupiſcence; but God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to bring us under the government of his Holy Spirit, that will lead us into all truth; and this cannot be done without a Croſs. But the queſtion lies here, ſhall I take up this Croſs or no? If I do, it will <hi>crucify me to the world.</hi> Let me ſee; how much do I love the world? A great deal: But do I love the world better than my own ſoul? <hi>What will it profit me, to gain the whole world, and loſe my own ſoul? Or what ſhall I give in exchange for my ſoul?</hi> I cannot get to Heaven without denying myſelf; let me take care of my immortal ſoul: I am a poor creature; I will ſerve the Lord my Maker, and make it my buſineſs to glorify and pleaſe him. He can ſnatch me away by death when he pleaſeth; therefore will I labour, that my thoughts, words, actions and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:020309_0053_0FAEF685497BF2B0"/>
may anſwer to that rule that he hath ſet before me, as a ſtandard of truth, to ſquare and regulate my actions by. I will not live any longer in vanity, as many do; I do not know but my breath may be ſtopt to-day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to-morrow; therefore <hi>to-day, while it is called to-day, I will hear</hi> God's voice, <hi>and not harden my heart,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that counſel, that is offered to me, for the benefit of my ſoul. I am bought with a price, I am none of my own; I will live to him that died for me: I have more reaſon to live to Chriſt, and ſerve him, that ſhed his precious blood for the redemption of my ſoul, and to be ſubject to him, than to be ſubject to Chriſt's enemy, to the prince of the power of the air, who rules in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience. I will take up a reſolution to ſerve God, but I can do nothing of myſelf; but <hi>the grace of God which brings ſalvation, will teach me to deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly, in this preſent world.</hi> Take heed of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and beguiled, for there is no way will bring you to Heaven, but a holy and undefiled way.</p>
            <p>Therefore, come and take this, ſtandard of truth in your hands, to guide you in your way, that you may neither turn to the right hand, nor to the left: This will ſhew you the way you ſhould walk in, and be like the cloud and pillar of fire to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in their journey to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> which was a type of Heaven; the cloud they could ſee by day, and the pillar of fire by night; ſo this ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of truth will direct you in your travel to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Let this be the rule and meaſure of your thoughts, words and actions.</p>
            <p>If a workman, that is a builder, hath a rule to work by; if he goes on, and never examines his work by his rule, but makes his eye his rule; if he doth not bring his rule to his work every little while, to ſee whether his Work be right; if he worketh on, and never minds his rule, what ſad work will he make. But a prudent skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful workman will ſay, I will not truſt mine eye too much, but I will look to my rule, my rule will not fail me; if there be bad work, it will diſcover it to me, that I may mend it before I go any further. Thus a diſcreet
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:020309_0054_0FAEF686130E9210"/>
workman will often bring his rule to his work, and uſe his line and plummet, that he may make it workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. He will ſay, if I let my rule alone, and not make uſe of it, but work as I pleaſe, and truſt to mine eye, no wonder if I make bad work, and what I build fall down again, and tumble about mine ears.</p>
            <p>You to whom God hath given the ſtandard of truth, as a rule and meaſure to govern your thoughts, words and actions by, let every thing be tried with it, before you die, and leave this world: If you do ſo, and make this your daily practice, then ask yourſelves, and you will be able to tell yourſelves, and tell me, and ſay, I have now obtained more hopes of God's favour, and a greater ſenſe of his love and goodneſs to me, than ever I had before. The apoſtle doth exhort us, to <hi>walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time.</hi> We have ſpent a great deal of time in vain, let us now be wiſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our time, for our eternal advantage; let us walk circumſpectly, that is, look round about us, conſider our ways, and try all our thoughts, words and actions, by the ſtandard of truth. <hi>To-day</hi> (my friends) <hi>while it is called to-day,</hi> hear the voice of God, and <hi>harden not your hearts,</hi> and receive that heavenly counſel, that is tendered to you, that you may be <hi>partakers of the inheritance, among the ſaints in light.</hi>

               <p>BLESSED and eternal Father! thou haſt brought forth thy glorious name, and revealed thy power and thy mighty arm; and thou haſt cauſed a remnant to bow and worſhip at thy appearance: Thou art wonderful; thy majeſty is great; they that do behold thee, will, with reverence, worſhip before thee. Thy power is gone forth, and hath reached the hearts of thy people; thou haſt humbled them, and ſubjected them to thy Divine, Almighty Power, that they might appear in the earth, to the praiſe and glory of thy great name.</p>
               <p>And, O Lord, as thou haſt begun a great work in the earth, ſo thou haſt committed this work to thy ſervants and children, that bear thy name among the ſons of men, that they ſhould ſhew

All our fitneſs and ſufficiency, our meetneſs and preparation is from thee: Do thou reveal thy power, and make bare thy Almighty arm. We have found thy preſence from day to day, and thou haſt upheld them that know thy love.</p>
               <p>O glorious God of Life! herein we have encouragement to go on in the work which thou haſt called us to; hereby we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to worſhip before thee, and to offer up living praiſes unto thy great name, for that refreſhment and conſolation, which thou haſt miniſtered unto thy people.</p>
               <p>And, O Living Father! we have never waited on thee in vain; whenſoever we have met together in thy name, we have found thy Divine Preſence, and the opening of the treaſures of thy love, of thy wiſdom, and of thy favour to thy children: So that from day to day, and even at this day, thou remembereſt thy people, and thou giveſt them freſh occaſion to draw nigh to thee, and receive their daily nouriſhment and ſtrength, from the operation of thy power.</p>
               <p>O living God of Life! gather up the hearts of thy people more and more, and draw them into a nearneſs to thyſelf, that their underſtandings may be more and, more opened to diſcern thy will, and ſubject themſelves to thy wiſdom, that every thought that is exalted againſt thy divine power, and living voice, in their own conſciences, may be brought down; that ſo all the nations of the earth may bow before thee; that ſo thy truth may reign, and thy power may be exalted, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which thou haſt revealed, may ſhine forth more and more, in the brightneſs and glory of it, and enlighten thoſe that are afar off, that they may be brought to ſeek after God.</p>

               </date>
            </head>
            <p>THERE is only <hi>one living and true God,</hi> Creator of Heaven and earth, whom we are obliged to ſerve and worſhip: I have ſo much charity as to believe, there are none among us, but will own and acknowledge this: And my ſoul wiſheth, that this obligation did always reſt upon every one's mind, that they might remember their Creator, that hath given us all life and breath, and continued all our bleſſings to us; that ſo every one might apply their hearts unto that univerſal duty, that we are all convinced of.</p>
            <p>And they that are thus employed and exerciſed, they are conſidering how, and after what manner, they may quit and diſcharge their duty, and perform the obligation that lies upon them, ſo that it may be accepted at the hands of God; I ſpeak now of thoſe that are conſiderate, not of thoſe that go on in a form of religion, and matter not, nor regard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are accepted of God or no; but all that are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious towards God, they are deſirous to ſerve God, and worſhip him, ſo as they may be acceptable to him, ſo to perform duties that they may receive their reward, and that encouragement that God in all ages hath diſcovered, and made manifeſt to be in his purpoſe towards them that truly ſerve him.</p>
            <p>When people come to this conſideration, how they may ſerve God aright, and worſhip him acceptably, the Lord is high unto them, to inſtruct them, to teach them, and guide them in that way that is everlaſting: And, bleſſed be his holy
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:020309_0057_0FAEF6884B1065C0"/>
name! a great many in our days, have met with this divine teaching and inſtruction; and are taught in this age, as in former ages, to underſtand the worſhip of God that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; that is, in ſpirit and truth; and do find, that the Father doth ſeek ſuch worſhippers, and where he finds them, rewards them, and they have an anſwer of peace in their boſoms, and they are encouraged to go on in the worſhip and ſervice of God, to the end of their days.</p>
            <p>And it is a great mercy and benefit; a great bleſſing that God hath beſtowed upon a remnant, to open their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to let them ſee and know the way of being near to God, that ſo they may know whom they worſhip; for you have read, there have been worſhippers, that do worſhip they know not what: As our Saviour ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, you worſhip you know not what; we know what we worſhip:</hi> So all that are taught of God, do know which is the firſt leſſon of Chriſtianity, as the apoſtle ſaith; <hi>he that cometh to God, muſt firſt know and believe, that he is;</hi> that is, people muſt firſt be ſenſible, that <hi>there is a God, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> before they can rightly worſhip him.</p>
            <p>Now, for want of this knowledge, the world is ſcattered, and people are divided into a great many ſorts of worſhips, and faſhions, and ways of religions, for want of the knowledge of the true worſhip, of the true and living God; ſo that though men are univerſally convinced, that there is a God, and that a worſhip is due to him from every one of us; yet people are confounded, ſcattered, and divided about the performance of their great duty; and in the day that the Lord hath viſited his people, he hath come to anſwer this doubt, and queſtion for them; it hath been the great queſtion of the world, and is ſtill of many thouſands; I know we ſhould worſhip God, but I know not the way and manner wherein to find acceptance: The Lord hath anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that queſtion in abundance; <hi>they that have ears to hear, let them hear what the Spirit ſaith;</hi> there is a ſhort anſwer to it in all.</p>
            <p>Let people profeſs what religion they will, there is no acceptance with God, but through Chriſt: So that if people come to be of this, and that, and the other profeſſion, and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:020309_0058_0FAEF68919204810"/>
change their religion ever ſo often, and go from one religion to another, if they come not to Chriſt, they come not to him in whom they may find acceptance; in him God is pleaſed with every one; but out of him he is pleaſed with no one. The great myſtery of religion lies in Chriſt; people muſt come to God, by faith in him; <hi>for without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Let people perform ever ſo much ſervice and duties, all muſt paſs through the hand of the Mediator, before ever their performance will reach unto God, or before peace and comfort will reach to any man's ſoul. Therefore, it is the wiſeſt way for every one, that would have acceptance with God, to come to him, in the name of the great Mediator. People would be glad to have acceptance with God, and not to have their ſervices turned back upon them, as <hi>Cain</hi>'s was: Now, every one that will have accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, muſt come this way; there is but one way, it is not the way that men have invented; ſome by their works and merits, ſome by their made-faiths, and made-beliefs, and by divers articles and principles, holding this principle, and the other principle; but our Lord and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, he hath ſound out one way, in his infinite wiſdom, and unſpeakable mercy to mankind, that was forever loſt, and could never return to God, by all his ſacrifices, offerings and performances; he was never able to return into unity with his Maker, if God had not ſound out a way; and the way that God hath found out, is by his beloved Son Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>God ſpared not:</hi> He ſpared not what? He ſpared not his only begotten Son: Why, what did he do with him? <hi>He gave him for the life of the world;</hi> in him that God gave, there is life. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord that his Son ſhould have life in him, as the Father had life in himſelf;</hi> for Chriſt was <hi>with the Father before the world began; in him was life, and the life was the light of men;</hi> John i. 4. It was no created life; that life that is in his Son, is not a created life, but is an eternal life, and it was given for the life of the world, and that life is the light of men: <hi>This is the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> So that here is the dignity of that life which God hath beſtowed upon us; we are endued with that life, which was with the Father through Jeſus Chriſt, before the world was. Let us conſider the dignity of that light, that we are lighted with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:020309_0059_0FAEF68A016F9D60"/>The queſtion is, whether we ſhould obey this light, or no: It is the queſtion of every one; I am enlightened, ſaith a man, ſhall I obey it, or no? If I obey, I muſt take up a croſs, and part with my beloved luſt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. No doubt of that; we muſt perſuade people to do that, before we can bring them to Heaven and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and fellowſhip with God; it muſt not be by that way they loſt it, but by the contrary way, by which God will bring men to happineſs again. They loſt it by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and ſinning againſt God; by this way and means men came out of the preſence and favour of God; but what way ſhall they obtain it again? Shall it be by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting iniquity, and breaking God's law? No; here is the way that God hath found out, to bring poor man back again to himſelf, by the ſufferings and obedience of his Son, Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>He hath given to him all power in Heaven and Earth,</hi> that all ſhould be ſubject to him; here is a dignity which Chriſt hath obtained.</p>
            <p>It comes to the queſtion with us, whether we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened? now we know we are enlightened; God hath beſtowed ſomething upon us, that wars and fights againſt ſin and iniquity. How came we by it? Is it any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in nature? No; nature is corrupted and defiled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the carnal mind is enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> yet there is ſomething in me that anſwers the pure law of God, which makes me to hate things that are reprovable; that is, light: How came I by it? It is not natural; for then it would run parallel with the natural inclination that is in my ſoul, to lead me further and further from God. Theſe are ſet in oppoſition one againſt another, the fleſh and the ſpirit; <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh.</hi> Here is part of an inward war, that you may all be ſenſible of. Now, theſe two warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, the fleſh and the ſpirit, make war one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one of them is overcome. It is true, there is ſuch a principle in me, that ſtrives againſt ſin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: How came you by it? If you believe the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I ſay, it is the life of the Son of God, <hi>that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> Now, many that
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:020309_0060_0FAEF68B459B39F8"/>
have rejected and deſpiſed the light, I believe they did not think, at the ſame time, to mock and make a ſcorn of the life of Jeſus, tho' it was really ſo: But if people come to a true eſteem and value of that light that God hath planted in the ſoul, they will give more reverence and reſpect to it. It is this that brings thoſe that preach Chriſt, to preach him in thoſe terms, and under thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations,that he is nigh them.</p>
            <p>We do not doubt of Chriſt's being born of a Virgin, in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that he wrought miracles, and preached many godly ſermons, and that he was crucified, dead and buried, and roſe again from the dead, for theſe things are certainly true: But we would have him our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this age, we would have a nearer knowledge of him, and a ſenſe and feeling of the virtue of that power, by which he ſaved them that lived in former ages: He is not a Chriſt and a Saviour of one age only, but of all ages to this day; from <hi>Adam,</hi> to the laſt man that ſhall live upon the earth. That age and generation that knoweth not Chriſt, will not be ſaved by him, if there be any age wherein he is not known: <hi>There is no other name under Heaven by which you can be ſaved.</hi> If you ask where is this Saviour? <hi>Say not in thy heart, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? that is, to bring down Chriſt from above; or, who ſhall deſcend into the deep, that is to bring up Chriſt again from the dead? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is the word of faith, which we preach.</hi> He is nigh thy ſoul, he is the Lord of life, and a quickening Spirit, if I know that quickening Spirit, after this I know the Lord Chriſt; when he comes to work in me by his power, changing my heart, and tranſlating me from death to life, then I know the true Chriſt: God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, in all ages, that it is the duty of people to come to the knowledge of the Son of God; for <hi>he hath ſent forth his Spirit to teach us, and to lead us into all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For when Chriſt was with, his diſciples, he told them that he would pray the Father, and he ſhould <hi>ſend the Spirit, the comforter;</hi> and when he came, he would be known by his divine and inward teachings and operations, guiding and <hi>leading them into all truth;</hi> that was his work to them: But what ſhall other folks do? He will be made known to others
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:020309_0061_0FAEF68B5EB9E3F8"/>
too: When he comes, <hi>he ſhall convince the world of ſin:</hi> So that his work to his diſciples was, to <hi>lead them into all truth;</hi> and his work to the world is, to <hi>convince the world of ſin:</hi> Who will deny, but that there is a Spirit in our age, as well as in other ages, that will convince men of ſin? Is this the Spirit of God, that convinceth the world of ſin, or is it the ſpirit of the <hi>QUAKERS only?</hi> When peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come to conſider really and truly, how they may ſerve God aright, they will find there is no ſerving God aright, unleſs they come to Chriſt the Mediator, that in and by him they may put up ſupplications to God; and through him, they may expect at the hand of God, peace and comfort; and there is no other way, nor ever will be.</p>
            <p>The Jews, they had another way, they had an outward way of ſerving God; this ſtood in divers offerings, ſacrifices, waſhings and obſervations; this was a way of worſhip of God's own inſtitution to that people; but what came of it? When the apoſtle came to graſp it, he ſaid, <hi>the comers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, were not made perfect:</hi> What were the tranſgreſſors of it then? They that would ſin on, and continue in ſin, and not bring a goat, or a ram, or other oblation; they that did obſerve it, and came up to the point of the law, they did bring their offering when they were convinced of their ſin: If a man ſinned, he was to bring an he-goat, and to bring it to the door of the tabernacle; but when he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the conſcience of ſin, the guilt of ſin remained upon him. <hi>For it was impoſſible,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>that the blood of bulls and goats ſhould take away the ſin: For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the aſhes of a heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth, to the purifying of the fleſh, how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt (who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God) purge your conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When there is no hope of atonement and reconciliation with God, by all thoſe offerings under the law, he tells you of <hi>one offering of the Son of God himſelf, through the eternal Spirit, by which he became a propitiation;</hi> for this will do <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> if I believe that Chriſt offered an holy offering to the Father for my ſins, I believe he offered his body, and that through the eternal Spirit, that he might be a propitiation for ſin, and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:020309_0062_0FAEF68C128CDEF0"/>
take away ſin, and have power over ſin and death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer death and darkneſs: The apoſtle drives the matter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; you muſt come to the inward work of this outward offering, this eternal offering, that was in due time offered to God; you muſt come to know the operations of it, by the <hi>ſprinkling of the heart from an evil conſcience:</hi> So that there was to be an applicatory faith for the offering of that. The way to a Saviour was not made by man, no more than the way of ſalvation by Chriſt was found out by man; no more than the application of the benefit is effected by man.</p>
            <p>When it pleaſeth God to call a people by his grace, he calleth them by his Son; not by this and the other form: <hi>No man cometh to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> The firſt thing that a man or woman comes to be aware of, is the ſecret ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord's Divine Power upon the heart, to feel Chriſt Jeſus; as ſoon as they feel this, and embrace it, this is a token of the love or God. I hope all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation will acknowledge, that they have ſometimes felt his drawings, and that they have not embraced and cloſed with them ſo well as they ought.</p>
            <p>When people are aware of theſe drawings inwardly to holineſs and righteouſneſs, and are ſenſible that they ſhould, with care and attention, cloſe with them, for the good of their poor ſouls; and that it concerns them to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the other world that is to come, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be led by theſe drawings of the Spirit of God, theſe are not weeds that grow in the fields naturally; theſe are Sparks of Divine Fire, kindled in the hearts of men by God himſelf: No man comes unto God, till God comes to him, and touches him, and gives him ſenſe and motion: Theſe are the motions and ſtirrings of God's Holy Power, in the hearts of many that are wicked and abominable; yet the Lord doth not deſpiſe the work of his own hand, but reacheth to ſuch.</p>
            <p>When the Lord meets with thoſe that deſpiſe not, but highly prize this wonderful grace, and cloſe with it, and are glad of it, ſuch a one faith, I feared that the Lord had forgotten me, and had paſſed by me, and had done with me; but I ſee he viſits me again, and he hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:020309_0063_0FAEF68D64E60B80"/>
my ſoul this day, inclining me to walk more anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to his love; he hath doubled his power upon me, and hath kindled a holy fire in my heart, and cauſed me to ſeek after him; he hath touched my heart, and I will pour out my ſoul in ſupplication; ſeeing he hath touched me, he will take hold of me by his power, and he will keep me from being any more drawn away: I will live in the ſenſe of his power and mercy, that keeps me night and day, that I may encreaſe in it, and grow in grace. When the Lord meets with ſuch a one, he will draw him into the way that he hath appointed: <hi>None can come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> If I am drawn, into what form ſhall I go now? and what ordinance ſhall I take up now? This is all under feet; this is none of my work; I will come to Chriſt the Mediator, and he will take the government and rule of me: It is not my beſt way to ſtudy a form, and an outſide religion; I will wait upon that power that hath thus touched my heart, that he may by degrees bring me to the obedience of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But ſome are ready to ſay, who, and what is this Chriſt Jeſus that you are ſpeaking of; that immediate Chriſt Jeſus that is extant and preſent, that I am to have to be the object of my faith; that I may believe in him, and come to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, that I may partake of the life of Jeſus Chriſt, and have it communicated to my ſoul?</p>
            <p>We have not a thought, or a word to ſpeak, that may derogate from the wonderful grace of Chriſt, who died in his perſon on earth for the ſalvation of our ſouls: Yet we muſt know, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be ſpiritually preſent with us, and take the government of us, and we are to be ſubject to him: How ſhall this be? I am ſpeaking of one that hath felt the Father's drawings, when he draws them to his Son, and draws them to ſomething that is holy and pure: This God the Father hath begotten: We read in ſcripture, <hi>that God hath begotten Chriſt, who is the only begotten of the Father.</hi> It is ſtrange, you will ſay, to ſpeak of begetting Chriſt again, God begets Chriſt again, that is, ſpiritually; he being the firſt born in many brethren, in every true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and there is a travel of ſoul that Chriſt may be formed
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:020309_0064_0FAEF68D86FB8578"/>
in him. See what travel of ſoul the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> falls into the ſecond time, for the <hi>Galatians.</hi> They were a brave people, they worſhiped God in Spirit, and believed in Chriſt Jeſus, and afterwards they came to be ſeduced by falſe prophets, and falſe teachers, that ſet them about their works, and told them they could not be juſtified and ſaved without their own works: Theſe falſe teachers that came among them, were as bad as Popiſh prieſts and friars. It is not your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt, and the Spirit, that will ſave you, you muſt be doing: So theſe poor people were deluded and bewitched; and to give you the apoſtle's own words, they were infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, and <hi>drawn away from the ſimplicity of the goſpel,</hi> and they thought by the works of the law to obtain ſalvation: The apoſtle writes a letter to them, and tells them that he <hi>travelled in birth again, till Chriſt was formed in them.</hi> If this was not ſcripture, it would look like a ſtrange work; there muſt be a forming of Chriſt, a birth there muſt be, and a begetting: Who muſt beget in this and that moment, but the ſame that begat from the beginning? the ſame is the Father, he begets Chriſt in all that believe and obey the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. He is begetting ſomething in me that is holy, though I be unholy; the Father, by the operation of his divine hand, begets ſomething in me that is holy. This I find, though I am not ſo good as I ſhould be; I have that given me, that will tell me, that the more I adhere and join myſelf in my deſires and affections to this good principle, the more I ſhall partake of the quality of it; this good principle, though it be like <hi>a little grain of muſtard-ſeed,</hi> I cannot tell what to compare it to for littleneſs, in compariſon of the great lump and maſs of ſin, corruption and filthineſs, that wars againſt it; yet this will overſpread all that is bad, and make me <hi>holy,</hi> as that is <hi>holy; pure</hi> as that is <hi>pure,</hi> and to have a love for him, from whom it came, even to Chriſt and God; it will gather the affections from corruptible things, and place them upon things above.</p>
            <p>This faith tells people that it is <hi>the ſubſtance of things hope for, and the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> ſuch a one live by faith, ſuch a one that comes to be joined to that, that is begotten of the father, he <hi>lives by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> and can do nothing of himſelf, but through Chriſt that
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:020309_0065_0FAEF68FB92F4070"/>
ſtrengthens him; he ſays unto God, I perceive I can do nothing without thee; I cannot pray unto thee, nor ſerve thee; of myſelf I can do nothing acceptably, but through Chriſt the Mediator; ſuch a one becomes like a little child, and he muſt be led; and who muſt lead him, but the Spirit of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>You cannot preach, ſays one to him, unleſs you be moved by the Spirit: You cannot pray until you be moved by the Spirit: How ſhould I? No, without him I can do nothing, I cannot preach, nor pray, nor do any thing acceptable to God the Father, but by Chriſt; and he hath revealed him in me.</p>
            <p>This is no new doctrine, we ſee the new and living way; it was an old way to old Chriſtians, and a new way to the new; and ſo a thouſand years hence, if the world laſts ſo long, men will ſee that they cannot do any thing pleaſing to God, but as they are gathered into Chriſt; they will ſee their own righteouſneſs, works and doings, will avail them nothing at all. This is all laid at the feet of Jeſus, whom God hath exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to be Lord and King.</p>
            <p>Now, my friends, we are engaged in this age, abundantly engaged, to offer thanks to God, through Jeſus Chriſt, that he hath provided and opened a way for the ſending forth the Spirit of his Son: And that God hath gathered a people, and hath made known to them the way of life, that they might walk in it; but there is no walking in it, but through a daily croſs, and ſelf-denial. It is not likely that a man ſhould be brought back to God the ſame way that he went out from God; and the prophets and apoſtles do allude to this turning to God; <hi>when thou turneſt aſide to the right hand or to the left, thou ſhalt hear a voice behind thee, ſaying, this is the way, walk in it.</hi> There is a voice, that calls to people in our days, to look behind them, for they are out of the way. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is fulfilled in our day; we cannot turn away from the good ways of God, but we may hear a voice behind us, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou art ſinning againſt God, and breaking the holy law of God, Now, if people return, it muſt be by the croſs: I will not return to God, ſaith one; I have pleaſure, profit, and honour, and whatſoever my heart can deſire, in this evil way that I am walking in; if I return, I ſhall have nothing but ſhame and reproach; I ſhall be undone and ruined, and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:020309_0066_0FAEF68FD2562EF0"/>
I ſhall loſe the favour and friendſhip of my friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I cannot return to God, but through a daily croſs, and ſelf-denial: What then? It is likelier to be the right way, by this bearing the croſs. Chriſt tells us, <hi>if any will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me.</hi> This voice of Chriſt calls me to repent and turn from ſin, and giveth me a ſtrong argument, that it is true; that it is the ſame way that will bring me back to God, by the Mediator. It brings its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with it; we need no argument to prove that it is a right way; it is a right way, becauſe it is the <hi>narrow way;</hi> it is the right gate, becauſe it is the <hi>ſtrait gate.</hi> Every body can walk in the broad way with eaſe, with out any croſs.</p>
            <p>When people are come thus far, that they are convinced of their duty, when they are called to amend their lives and converſations, to forſake their lives and turn to the Lord, this is the great queſtion, have I power to do this? This queſtion hath ſtumbled a great many, when they have ſome beginning thoughts of turning to the Lord; and at laſt they have ſettled themſelves in a belief that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it; it is true, and nothing truer, that men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their ſins, have not power to leave their ſins of themſelves; this is true, but not all the truth; to men that God convinceth of ſin, he gives them power to be made willing to forſake their ſins. He hath given power to all that <hi>are in Chriſt Jeſus, to believe and become the ſons of God; then they have denied ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> if they be the ſons of God, and <hi>live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly, in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall they do that are ſenſible they have not power to forſake their ſin, till God is pleaſed to give them power? Such have nothing to do but to wait upon the Lord, for the giving of this power; and there is a duty incumbent on them then to anſwer this power. The apoſtle, upon this ſubject, tells us what people are to do for their own converſion. He aſcribes the power of converſion to Chriſt Jeſus: The prophets and apoſtles, they tell us, there is ſomething for man to do, that is, if he hath not power, he is to be willing to receive it. The apoſtle hath a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:020309_0067_0FAEF690E3492C30"/>
expreſſion to this purpoſe; he puts them in mind, how they uſed to do by the devil, when they were the devil's ſervants; they did obey his commands, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their members ſervants to unrighteouſneſs: How did they yield? They did it heartily, with pleaſure and delight. Thus you did when you did not know the power of God; but now you are come to the knowledge of the power of God, <hi>yield not your members as inſtruments of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto ſin, but yield yourſelves unto God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your members as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of righteouſneſs unto God:</hi> Rom. vi. 13. Let your minds, and wills, and affections, be joined to that power which God viſited you with; in love to God, give up your members as ſervants unto righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Here is ſomething for man to do in the day of God's viſitation; <hi>thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power;</hi> when they come to that, and experience that, this ſhews that they are the people of God: But they that are not a willing people, are none of God's people, God's people are ſo; and I pray God make you all ſo, to be a people willing to be God's people, when he gives you power, and it will not be long before he gives you power to forſake your ſins, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake this, and the other fooliſh, proud and vain action and faſhion; he hath made Chriſt Jeſus to be Lord and King, and he ſhall reign over death; he hath made all things by Chriſt, and he is become the Saviour of all men, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of them that believe; ſo that I would have a ſpecial ſalvation, and thou wouldeſt have it too: Chriſt hath made a way, and opened a door for us to be ſaved, <hi>that we might have an abundant entrance into his everlaſting kingdom:</hi> But I would have a ſpecial ſalvation, that would inveſt me with the love of God in my heart, before I die; it is to be had through Chriſt, therefore to him will I come, to him muſt every one come, and every knee bow to his name, and every one muſt wait for his appearing in the Spirit. When Chriſt appears, truth ſtirs. Now, if a holy, divine life is in thee, it is he; if a principle of truth ſtir in thee, it is he: The ſame Jeſus, only in a ſmaller manifeſtation: He that is faithful in a little, he will make him ruler over much: This is he that God hath ordained to be the Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:020309_0068_0FAEF6915A707A78"/>
this is that which we preach in his name, and teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and declare to all people, that there is no other ſalvation, no deliverance from death and hell, but by and through him; <hi>in him there is a reconciliation, and that peace which paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> and power over all thoſe things which have captivated us, and made us diſobey our great Lord and Maker: Let us wait for the coming of Chriſt; <hi>he is our King, our Lord and Law-giver, and he will ſave us:</hi> This was the cry of his people of old, for the glorious and great ſalvation he hath given, and the work he hath wrought. Let the prayers and ſupplications of all people, that deſire ſalvation, be put up more and more, that he will viſit the earth, and give power from above, and <hi>bring us into that new and living way, which he hath conſecrated for us, through the veil, that is to ſay, his fleſh;</hi> to whom be glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

There is nothing ſeaſons the mind and ſoul of man, and prepares and fits it for an everlaſting well-being, but the divine knowledge of the living God that made him. And there is a propenſity in the ſoul of man, even ſince the fall, to return again to God, and to have that acquaintance and communion with the Lord that man had before he fell: And they that have regard to that inward ſpark of divine love, that they find in their own ſouls towards God, they will experience that the Lord is merciful and gracious, and propitious to that which is of himſelf</p>

               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:020309_0071_0FAEF693B59B53E0"/>For tho' the ſoul is loſt, and man is loſt through tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and a great alienation has happened between him and his Maker, yet the mercy of the Lord endureth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and his kindneſs and favour to loſt man is ſuch, that he ſtretcheth out his hand all the day long, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and offers to the children of men a friendſhip and acquaintance, and a communion again with him. And tho' by ſin and tranſgreſſion, there is a rebellious nature grown up in the ſons and daughters of men, yet the ſoul of man is not wholly ſo; there is ſomething that ſtrives and labours in a contrary way, and perſuades the ſoul to turn again unto the Lord, and to wait for the knowledge of God; and whoſoever hearkens with care and diligence, to that divine Monitor, that is daily drawing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading people to ſeek after God, they come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Lord is not ſo angry with mankind, but his love, and mercy, and good will, reaches towards all the ſons and daughters of men; and the bar that hinders their communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with God, and peace with God, it is not in the Lord, but it is in themſelves; and therefore the remedy muſt be wrought in themſelves.</p>
            <p>This is evident to every eye, that there is ſomething gotten into mankind, which the Holy God cannot own, and can never have fellowſhip with; that is, another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſpirit hath wrought upon the ſouls of people, and hath ſeduced and drawn them out to that which is unholy and contrary to God, and the terms of God's covenant to mankind, which is, that he ſhould forſake that which the contrary ſpirit hath wrought. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts.</hi> Why ſhould he forſake his ways? Becauſe the Lord never led him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe ways. He that made him, never led him into them; but the devil, the enemy of mankind, ſeduced him into thoſe ways; therefore the Creator cries out to him, <hi>let the wicked forſake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;</hi> I cannot have union with him, as long as he walks in his evil ways; I cannot dwell in his mind, ſo long as evil thoughts are in it: So may the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the works which the devil hath wrought, that man is carried away from God, by his evil thoughts, and the works of the devil.</p>

               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:020309_0072_0FAEF695037E7860"/>Why doth not God deſtroy thoſe works, when he is Almighty, and able to do it? Very true, God is ſo; but he hath offered to mankind, through the ſon of his love, a way and means, how man may come to be purged, and cleanſed from the evil that the devil hath wrought in him, and how he may come to be reconciled to God: God hath not choſen the way of coercion and force, and to work altogether by irreſiſtible power, that man ſhall go to Heaven whether he will or no: There was no force uſed for his going to hell and darkneſs, but it was the choice of his will: The devil could not have forced him, and led him away out of covenant with God, he could not compel him to break the holy command of God; but the devil tempted him, and he yielded to the temptation, and now man is driven out of the preſence of God; yet God hath found out a way for the ſons and daughters of men, to turn again to him: What by force and coercion, and irreſiſtable power? No, but the ſcripture ſaith, He hath offered life and ſalvation to all men: <hi>He hath freely given the Son of his love, out of his own boſom, who making himſelf an offering for ſin, hath preſented a way and meant for man's returning again to God.</hi>

He preſents him to the view of every one's mind, to the underſtanding of every ſoul; he offers and preſents him for ſalvation to the ends of the earth. There is a damnation come in by man's being ſubject to Satan, but ſalvation comes in by his being ſubject to Chriſt; as damnation came in by his being defiled, ſo ſalvation came in by his being cleanſed: As the devil is the defiler, ſo Chriſt is the cleanſer, and man is the object upon which both do work; and they that have been defiled and corrupted (as we all have) by the unclean Spirit, can any of us give a reaſon they ſhould not be cleanſed by the holy Spirit? We have loſt our right to Heaven by ſin and tranſgreſſion, in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and can any give a reaſon, why we ſhould not be reſtored, and redeemed, by Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam?</hi> No reaſon can be given of our redemption, but that God is free in his love, and Chriſt in his offering: <hi>He hath offered himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin: Every prieſt hath ſomething to offer; this man, the man
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:020309_0073_0FAEF6951C6AFE70"/>
Chriſt Jeſus, offered himſelf, through the eternal Spirit, a ſacrifice for ſin; and now the ſacrifice is offered, and a door is opened, and a new and living way conſecrated through the veil, that is to ſay, his fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, who can be wiſe enough to find out a reaſon, why all men enter not in at this door? For all men enter in at the other door, which the devil and Adam opened, to run from God; all could run in at that door. What is the reaſon, that all go not in at that door which Chriſt hath opened, and God hath revealed, and which coſt Chriſt ſo dear to work our way back again, for mankind to return to God? If we go about to enquire into the reaſon, we ſhall find it very little, for there is all the reaſon in the world we ſhould ſerve God, and ſeek our own happineſs; there is all the reaſon in the world we ſhould part with ſin and iniquity, and with the devil's work, which he wrought, if we knew but how: Now this, I ſay, is a great privilege, that God hath afforded to the ſons and daughters of men, that they may know; for here the terms of the goſpel and of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are brought into a narrow compaſs, to a ſhort ſum, there need no catalogue of them; they that will be ruled by the wicked one, muſt have their part with him; and they that will be ruled and governed by the Holy One, ſhall have their part with him, <hi>that where he is, there they may be alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this in the power of man's will? No, there lies the miſchief in the will of man; for you cannot but know by experience, if a man may have his own will, he will always run headlong to deſtruction, and run in the way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And if ever he comes to turn out of that way, into the way of righteouſneſs, he muſt do it in a way that is a croſs to his own will. Some have ſaid, becauſe we have ſpoken of the free grace of God, in a way that is univerſal, of his kindneſs to mankind, through Jeſus Chriſt, they have ſaid, that we hold free-will, that men might be ſaved if they would; but alas, we have tried it, and we have an univerſal knowledge, that is able to convince us, and all the world, that it is far enough from our own will. Man is far enough from being able to ſave himſelf, from being ſaved by his own will: He can run on to damnation, there is a current goes
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:020309_0074_0FAEF695CD0275A8"/>
with his affections, and with his corrupt deſires, they go with the current and ſtream; as long as a man goes on in ſin, he ſwims down the ſtream.</p>
            <p>Now many, after they have long gone on in ſin, and their evil ways, they think or returning to God; for they think there is a better way, a ſurer and ſafer way for their ſouls, than to go on in wickedneſs: So there is; if there be ſo, ſaith the ſincere ſoul, O that I might walk in it: Why doſt thou not? I am convinced that I ſee a more excellent way than my way is, a better walking and converſation than my life is; but alas! it is too hard for me to walk in it: Why? what is the matter, what makes it hard? becauſe of my own will; I cannot walk in it and have my will, I cannot walk in it, and enjoy my affections and deſires, and my intereſt in the world: This is no wonder that thou telleſt me; now thou art convinced of a better way, and wouldeſt walk in it, and thou canſt not walk in it, but thou muſt take up a daily croſs; we might all of us tell that, and read it before; I pray God you may come to read it within, what a croſs it is you are to take up, and what way it is you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to walk in; that is the way of God, the way that leads to Heaven, it is a narrow way; but the way that the devil would have you to walk in, is a broad way, there is no rub in it.</p>
            <p>O would you but once come to experience how hard it is to walk in that <hi>way that leads to life,</hi> you would find that you cannot do it without ſelf-denial: It comes to this point; I have read of it before, but now I find it ſo. Such a man, or ſuch a woman, will ſeriouſly apply themſelves to live blameleſs, harmleſs, and inoffenſive towards God and men; they will ſet a bridle, and a watch before their mouths, that they may not ſpeak a vain word; they will take care of the frame and temper of their minds, that they ſin not in their thoughts, that they ſin not with their lips, nor with their hands. This is not as I was wont to do; I was uſed to have my liberty; now I find myſelf yoked, I dare not ſin againſt God: Now I find, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, what I heard before, that no man can follow Chriſt, without denying himſelf, and taking up a daily croſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:020309_0075_0FAEF696C79FA900"/>I would have you experienced in this work; wicked men think it a pleaſant life, to follow the devil's work, and to walk in the <hi>broad way;</hi> but the way of ſelf-denial is uneaſy, there is much ſtrife and oppoſition in that way; If I have a mind to ſpeak a vain word, I am limited; if I have a deſire to wrong my neighbour, and cheat and defraud him, I am limited, I am not to do it, that belongs to the broad way: If a man will ſeek after the Lord, and walk in the way of holineſs and righteouſneſs, the end whereof is peace, he will find it is a narrow way, wherein he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy his own will; ſuch a one muſt be a <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I behaved myſelf as a weaned child;</hi> that is, as one that is afraid to be beaten.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt be ready to ſay, I am a man, and not a child; I am come now to be a man, a man of parts; I have ſeen much, and read much, and would you have me become a child? How great a man was <hi>David:</hi> If you ſpeak of a man, he was a man of dignity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a man of valour and experience; yet when he ſpeaks with reſpect to the frame of his mind before the Lord, he ſaith, he behaved himſelf <hi>as a weaned child,</hi> as one that feared to be beaten, feared to commit an offence; he feared the rod of his God upon him; he feared ſomething of judgment upon his conſcience. <hi>David</hi> was an old teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament man, but he had regard to that which never wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth old, which is the ſame in all times, new and old, <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus was his leader, before he was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> his word was a light to his feet, and a lanthorn to his paths: <hi>David</hi> had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, who did lift up the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon him.</p>
            <p>And when Chriſt himſelf came to preach upon earth, he ſaith himſelf, <hi>every one that comes into the kingdom of God, muſt become as a little child.</hi> He muſt become as a little child in ſimplicity and ſubjection; he muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der government; he muſt become as a little child, or he muſt in no wiſe enter the kingdom of Heaven; they muſt not think to enter into Chriſt's kingdom becauſe they are men; men of parts, men of courage, men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, learned doctors, maſters of liberal arts and ſciences:
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:020309_0076_0FAEF698AA47A390"/>
Theſe may help to make them men, but they muſt be children; all their wits, and parts, and manhood, courage and valour, will do them no good; for little children, babes and ſucklings, may underſtand more than they of Divine Myſteries, and have greater communion and intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and their ſouls than they; ſo that all who enter into Chriſt's kingdom, muſt become like little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>So that here is a way provided by Jeſus Chriſt, for man to come again into the favour of God, which is by Chriſt alone, not by any thing that a man can do; Chriſt muſt be their leader and their counſellor, he alone can give them the true knowledge of God. <hi>No man can know the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him.</hi> Men can never attain to the ſaving knowledge of God by ſtudy, and by diſputation and reading books, and commentators, and obſervators of matters of religion, Time would fail me to ſpeak of the multitude of books that have been written about the knowledge of God. You muſt come to Chriſt for divine knowledge; theology, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and divine and heavenly things, are from Chriſt: He ſhall have this divine knowledge, be he ever ſo ſimple, that comes unto Chriſt for it; he cannot have it any other way, for God hath ordained this way: Saith God, he ſhall have it of my Son, who is the Reconciles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Mediator between God and man, he ſhall be beholden to Chriſt for all. All men's own works and labours will not juſtify and ſave them, for God hath committed the whole work of ſalvation to Chriſt. One would think it ſhould be no great matter for men to lay aſide their own works and duties, and ſubmit to Chriſt; but I tell you it is very hard, and I found it hard myſelf.</p>
            <p>Men think by reading and learning, and hearing this and the other man's notions and opinions, they may be edified and profited, and come to the true knowledge of God; but while they are waiting upon God, in the way he hath appointed, they may receive knowledge from Chriſt, and be more certain and infallible in what they do know, than by conſulting all the wiſe men and learned doctors in the world. For no man knows all at once; and no man
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:020309_0077_0FAEF699F2245978"/>
knows all things neither: It is not a thing neceſſary that man ſhould know all things in relation to God; for as he is in himſelf, he is incomprehenſible: <hi>For no man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal him;</hi> yet that which he knows of God, he may know it is certain and infallible.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a man know nothing of God, but that he is the <hi>ſearcher of the heart, and trier of the reins.</hi> There are many that have tried this, and ſay they know it, that yet doubt whether there be a God or no. But when God comes within them, and convinces them of ſin, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them, and brings judgment upon them for what they have done, then they know infallibly, that God is <hi>the ſearcher of hearts.</hi> This is not a man's work, this is the work of God; if I find God doth approach my ſpirit, I know it is God's work; I have now got ſome knowledge of God, how came I by it? Who gave it me? No one but he that hath all knowledge; he that was with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the beginning, and was glorified with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the world began, he gave me this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and now did he give it thee? By his Spirit; <hi>for he hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into my heart;</hi> and that Spirit of Chriſt ſearches the hearts, and tries the reins. He tells me this is evil that thou haſt done, this is that which God that made thee hath againſt thee; this thou muſt forſake, and this thou muſt repent of; here I have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of what I know, but I cannot get rid of my evil.</p>
            <p>Now if I can believe in the power by which my heart is ſearched, and truſt in him that hath begun to deal with me, then his work is not only to reveal his light to convince me, but to put forth his power to convert me; ſo that by the power of that truth by which my heart is ſearched, I come to be converted, and turned from my ſin, and break off from it; and when I am broken off from it, I am ſure, and have a certainty that it is ſo, that I am broken off from ſuch a ſin, and that my heart is turned againſt it; I am ſure that now I hate it, and deteſt it, and that God hath turned my inclinations another way: I am ſure this is God's work, I can witneſs this infallibly, that ſomething is now done in
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:020309_0078_0FAEF69AE50825F8"/>
order to my redemption: But there is ſomething yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to be done: What then? I will go ſtep by ſtep, by following my guide, I ſhall be ſure to be making ſome progreſs every day, to that ſtate to which the Spirit of Chriſt will lead me: Theſe perſons come to a certainty of knowledge by their own experience.</p>
            <p>Some will ſay, take heed of being deluded and deceived by the <hi>Quakers;</hi> ſo ſay I too: Take heed of being deluded by any body; if any go about to perſuade thee, to believe that which thou knoweſt to be a lye, I am ſure they are about to delude thee; I would have every one to have an evidence in themſelves of what they believe.</p>
            <p>Doth a man believe that ſuch a one is a drunkard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſcriptures declare judgment againſt the drunkards? the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>wo to the drunkards of</hi> Ephraim: There are judgments denounced againſt the drunkards in the old teſtament; conſider the ſcripture doth not tell ſuch and ſuch by name, that they are drunkards; but the Spirit of God, by a work and operation upon a man's conſcience, ſingles him out, and charges him with the guilt of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>There is a great condemnation pronounced againſt whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers in ſcripture, but it doth not tell us who they are by name; but their conſciences tell them ſo, and gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible judgment againſt them, and ſay, <hi>thou art the man,</hi> thou art a perſon that God doth judge and condemn; <hi>whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge;</hi> but that doth not concern thee, and affect thee, except thou be one; I may read this an hundred times in the ſcripture, and not have a reflection in my own conſcience, except I be guilty: But when God meets with a guilty perſon, and judgeth and condemneth him, there will be an infallibility in what ſuch a one knows. If a whoremonger is reflected upon by his own conſcience, if his conſcience tell him he is the man, if all the world ſhould flatter him, and ſay he is not guilty, he would certainly know that they tell him a lye.</p>
            <p>So that here is no dependence upon any man's judgment, but upon an inviſible judge in a man's own heart: Who ſhall delude and deceive this man, that hath this experimental knowledge? thoſe perſons will not deceive a man, that
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:020309_0079_0FAEF69C775976D0"/>
would turn him from the evil of his ways; theſe do not go about to deceive him, that will tell him he muſt hearken to that principle of truth and holineſs in his own heart; they would deceive him that tell him he is converted when he is not, and leave him there: But when he is really convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and turned from ſin to God, ſome will tell him he is deluded and deceived; I pray God every one of us may be ſo deceived: Saith the apoſtle, <hi>we are deceivers, yet true:</hi> All that are truly converted, though men cry out they are deceivers, though they are deceivers, yet true; they are come to the ſavour of the knowledge of God, through Chriſt; and ſo ſhall certainly <hi>come to be partakers of the inheritance that is undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friends, you know that this hath been the propoſition of all the prophets, and apoſtles, from the beginning to this day; the thing that they have propoſed to the ſons and daughters of men, hath been to enquire after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God: It hath been wonderful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what the devil hath done to preſent divers doctrines that he hath found out, and ſtirred up others to invent a company of Gods, that other people have adored and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. It is hard to find any nation that do not worſhip ſome God; it is natural for man to deſire to come to ſome God, he thinks he muſt come to ſome God, and cannot be happy if he come not to GOD: But the devil hath invented many Gods, and ſet the people a worſhipping of idols, the work of men's hands, ſuch Gods that are ſo far from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their worſhippers, that they cannot help themſelves, they cannot wipe off the duſt from their own faces; and if they fall down, they cannot riſe again.</p>
            <p>But this is not our caſe, we have but one God preached among us, and but one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man: Our condition is happy, in having but one God, in compariſon of theirs that have many Gods.</p>
            <p>If the true God, that you worſhip, were but truſted in, you would be the happieſt people in the world: If you do but ſearch, you will find that the devil hath in this nation, and in this age, ſtirred up people to worſhip as many Gods, as he did in other nations in ancient times, among the <hi>Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and <hi>Amorites,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:020309_0080_0FAEF69C91DD93F0"/>But you will ſay, we worſhip one God, and truſt only in one God, and one Chriſt, and one Holy Ghoſt, the only living and true God.</p>
            <p>Do not tell me what God a man profeſſeth to worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what God he truſteth in, that gives it the name: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man truſteth in, that he makes his God, whether it be gold or ſilver, or the honours and pleaſures of this world, if he truſteth in theſe things, he makes them his God. Let a man but ſearch and try himſelf, and he will find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath got a place in his heart, that he cannot part with for Chriſt's ſake. He will be ready to ſay, I cannot part with my houſe and land, with my wife and children, and my goods and poſſeſſions, becauſe I have a confidence in them, and believe they will do me good, and be a defence for me; I truſt that in times of peril thoſe things may do me good. Here is a divine adoration, here is that truſt, that confidence, that all true Chriſtians ought to have in the true God, and this is placed in theſe earthly things. Now, whereſoever the truſt and confidence is placed in tranſitory and earthly periſhing things, theſe men truſt in tranſitory Gods.</p>
            <p>Nothing ſo ſhews that a man makes the Lord his God, as when he caſts all care on him, and puts his whole truſt in him, when he makes a profeſſion and acknowledgment of his dominion and greatneſs, and of all his other perfections, that by his wiſdom he can procure for them all that is good, and by his power, keep off from them, and ſecure them from evil. When I make the Lord my truſt and refuge, and truſt him for my God, I chooſe him before all the Gods of the Heathen, and truſt in him above all things under Heaven, upon the account of the profundity of his wiſdom, and the almightineſs of his power: When a man hath this ſenſe upon him, he will walk before the Lord with reſignation of mind, and be willing to be at God's diſpoſal, and he will not only give up himſelf to God, but he will hearken to him, and hear his voice when he ſpeaks to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God, who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt, unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his Son:</hi> But, where is his Son, you will ſay? He is in Heaven; but though he is <hi>the high
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:020309_0081_0FAEF69D61C8D978"/>
and lofty one that inhabits eternity, yet he dwells with meek, humble and contrite hearts, that tremble at his word.</hi> If I be one of the number of thoſe that tremble at God's word, I have that promiſe that he will come home to me, and dwell with me. It is well for thee, if the over-ruling power of God hath prevailed upon thee, that thou canſt be willing to be at God's diſpoſal, and ſay, Lord, what wouldeſt thou have me to do?</p>
            <p>Therefore, friends, I would adviſe you all to love your own ſouls, that when God deſires your hearts, you would give them up to him, that there he might delight to dwell, and have his habitation. Hearken to God's voice, and have regard to his word, which is a more ſure word than any man's in the world. <hi>There is a more ſure word of prophecy,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>unto which you will do well to take heed.</hi> This will check you, and reprove you, when you do evil, and ſhew you wherein you have tranſgreſſed; and will encourage you, and be a comfort to you, when you do that which is good. This will <hi>make you wiſe to ſalvation, and thoroughly furniſh you, and give you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for every good work.</hi> This word will tell you, this you muſt not do, leſt you offend God, and wound your conſcience, and grieve the Holy Spirit; this word will help you ſo to ſpeak, as to adminiſter grace to the hearers; ſuch a one as hath regard to this word, hath a chaplain in his own boſom, that will direct and teach him how to ſteer his courſe, and order his converſation among men, and how <hi>to ſerve God acceptably.</hi> This <hi>High Prieſt's lips will preſerve knowledge,</hi> even Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who ſpeaks to us in his word; we can do nothing but by his direction: If you come to him to lead you into all truth, he will bring you to the Father, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile you to him, that ſo you may obtain his favour and everlaſting life. When one of Chriſt's diſciples ſaid, <hi>ſhew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us,</hi> Jeſus ſaith unto him, <hi>he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father, and how ſayeſt thou then, ſhew us the Father?</hi> If you ſubject yourſelves to Chriſt, and to the government of his Spirit, he will bring you to that life and immortality, that <hi>fadeth not away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath been our labour and travel from time to time,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:020309_0082_0FAEF69E0CABE580"/>
to preach Chriſt among you, and not to preach ourſelves, and gather a church for ourſelves, but to gather a people unto Chriſt, who is Lord of Heaven and Earth. We would preach Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; we would not have you admire men's words and ſayings, and charge your memory with them; but we would have you remember the words and ſayings of Chriſt, who is the great Mediator, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile man again to God, that you may know him by his power, working effectually in your hearts; we labour for nothing elſe, and we want nothing elſe. <hi>We are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you, in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God:</hi> That you may ſo live, <hi>that whether you eat or drink, or whatſoever you do, you may do it all to the glory of God,</hi> your great Creator, that hath given his Son to die for you, and <hi>redeem you from all iniquity, that you might be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let God have all the honour and glory, for all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and bleſſings; let us render unto him hearty praiſes, and thankſgiving, for his wonderful love, and acknowledge that it is a great privilege that we may obtain by Jeſus Chriſt, even to be brought again to have the knowledge of the living God, which we loſt by our tranſgreſſion.</p>

our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom thou haſt given a name above every name; and let his kingdom and glory be exalted over all, and ſhine in the midſt of us.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed Father of Life! give wiſdom to our counſellors, that they may counſel for thee; make known thy will, and ſend help from Heaven to all that ſtand in need thereof, and that wait upon thee for it; give them thy Holy Spirit, that they may be guided in thy way. Let thy Son Jeſus Chriſt have the ſteering and governing of all things, and let glory be rendered to thy great and worthy name, and keep us in the love of God and in union with one another; let the ſtroke of thy power remain upon the hearts of all whom thou haſt touched at this time; let them be bowed down always in thy holy worſhip, and remain in a belief of thy truth, and ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well, and walk accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably before thee, that ſo tranſgreſſion may be finiſhed, and ſin and iniquity may be put an end to; and that truth and righteouſneſs may be ſet up, and ſhine among us, and that our ſouls may rejoice in thee, that we may magnify and praiſe thy power, and glorify thy name; for thou art worthy of all honour, praiſe and glory, and humble thankſgiving, for the manifeſtation of thy love and power. All which we deſire to offer thee through Jeſus Chriſt, who art God over all, bleſſed forever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <date>June 21, 1692.</date>

               <salute>My Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MANY have been ſent among you, that from living experience have declared their teſtimony for the truth, that you might all be brought to wait for the teſtimony of truth in yourſelves. This is that which
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:020309_0085_0FAEF6A04E9F7050"/>
will ſtand you in ſtead, to know the teſtimony of truth in your own hearts to be for you; therefore you are to wait, eſpecially at ſuch times as theſe, to hear the voice of truth in your own ſouls: For whatſoever the preacher preacheth, if the truth in thine own heart doth not ſpeak peace, it is not well with thee. Whatſoever teſtimonies are born of the truth itſelf; it is the truth that muſt bear teſtimony of thee, that unerring word, that gives to every one an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible evidence of their peace with God, or againſt that which hinders them.</p>
            <p>You know our labour hath been to perſuade all people to hearken to the truth in themſelves, and to make it their buſineſs, and travel, and endeavour, that they might have unity with the truth in their own hearts, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences may not condemn them.</p>
            <p>For ſuch as you, in whom God hath raiſed his witneſs, and hath exalted the truth for a judge, you are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, nor covered over with darkneſs, as many others are; you do not remain in doubt, but you know the truth, and have an anſwer of peace in well-doing, and a condemnation in evil-doing; not adminiſtered to you only by preachers without, but by the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit of God in your own hearts. This is that ſtanding myſtery which God hath raiſed, which can never be put down again, but as each one may put it down in themſelves.</p>
            <p>I grant that men may put it down: You have read, and had it plainly witneſſed to you, even <hi>killing the juſt, and crucifying the Lord of Glory; and of ſpiritual</hi> Sodom, <hi>and</hi> Egypt. Theſe things you have read of, and you that are turned to the light, know the meaning of thoſe ſayings, by woful experience; for when ever you have turned aſide, from a due ſubjection to the grace of God, by which we are convinced, then there hath been a piercing, <hi>and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of the Son of God afreſh, and vexing and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Spirit, by which you ſhould be ſealed to the day of redemption:</hi> Then there hath been anguiſh and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation upon your ſouls; and if this be minded, it will plant a fear upon your minds, and make you afraid to do the like again; but where this tribulation and anguiſh is neglected and put off, there a cuſtom of ſin takes away
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:020309_0086_0FAEF6A2A92D07E8"/>
the ſenſe of ſin. You know many have had more judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at ſome time upon them for a vain word, or a vain thought, than afterwards they have come to have for the moſt abominable wicked action. How came this to paſs? Was ſin ever the better? Or hath it changed its nature? No; but they are further off from the ſenſe of the evil of it. This is the word of truth, to which you muſt ſtand or fall; this is the ſtone, that whoſoever falls upon it, ſhall be broken and tendered; but if they ſtay till the weight of truth fall upon them, it will grind them to powder.</p>
            <p>They will have a life of liberty, let the truth ſay what it will: I will have my liberty, and uſe my tongue as I liſt, I will be wanton and proud, and envious and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, tho' I know theſe things be naught, and the witneſs in my conſcience teſtifies that theſe things are wicked, and contrary to the will of God, yet I will have them: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes to this mind, the ſtone is near falling upon them, and they will be ground to powder; they are like to barren earth, which beareth thorns and briers, and is rejected, <hi>and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, friends, I entreat you to hearken to the word of the Lord, it is a holy word, and an old word; many have profeſſed it: There are many preachers that will cry, hearken to the word of the Lord in ſuch a chapter, and ſuch a verſe. My teſtimony this day is, hearken to the word of the Lord: But where ſhall we find it, ſome will ſay? I tell you, it is written with the finger of God in your own conſciences; and it is either for you, or againſt you. Let your profeſſion among men be what it will, this Miniſter of the Covenant hath no reſpect of perſons, or regard to profeſſion; he will not excuſe this or that man, becauſe he makes a greater profeſſion of his name than others; this rather is his judgment, and his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhall be more ſwift and ſharp upon him that makes a profeſſion of Chriſt's name. <hi>If judgment begin at the houſe of God, what will the end of them be that obey not the goſpel of God.</hi> Thoſe that take upon them a ſtrict profeſſion, they do greater diſhonour to God, than thoſe that cry out there is no reforming; there can be no liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:020309_0087_0FAEF6A407FAC150"/>
without ſin: Theſe profeſs what they do, and they do as they profeſs. But when people come to profeſs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and righteouſneſs, and profeſs a power alſo by which righteouſneſs is obtained, but live not ſtrictly according to their profeſſion; theſe are they <hi>that cauſe the name of God to be blaſphemed among the Heathen,</hi> more than they that ſay there can be no living without ſin.</p>
            <p>Now this witneſs of God hath no reſpect to profeſſion, but hath reſpect to the ſtate and frame of the mind of a man or woman, that they ſerve God with, whether it be with ſincerity and uprightneſs of mind, and with breathing deſires, that <hi>they may know the good and acceptable will of God, and what is well-pleaſing in his ſight;</hi> and that they might perform that which is according to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly will. Where this ſincerity is, where this cry of the ſoul is, the Lord hath regard to it; but where people's religion is only to bear up a profeſſion, and hold up an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fellowſhip and communion one with another; when this ſincerity is wanting, the Lord abhors their worſhip, it is an abomination to God, and no benefit or advantage to themſelves: It is not for the glory of God, that they make a profeſſion, but for ſome deſign to themſelves, and ſo they become abominable.</p>
            <p>This was the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and it is the ſtate of a great many now, that think they do great matters, if they conform ſo far to the truth, as that outwardly they may not be charged with a lye, and that they are of ſuch a ſociety. It is well if ſome would come ſo far as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ſociety with God's people, and their external profeſſion; but if they have not regard to the truth in their own conſciences, what is their profeſſion worth? What will all thy unity with them ſignify? If there be a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and thine own ſoul, who can heal that breach? What will the profeſſion ſignify and amount to at laſt? But, <hi>go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</hi> And all the reaſon to be rendered for it, is this; depart from me, <hi>ye are workers of iniquity:</hi> He did not ſay in that ſentence, ye are lyars, you never propheſied in my name, and I never preached in your ſtreets; but allowing what they ſaid to be truth, that they had made a profeſſion, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:020309_0088_0FAEF6A41D31A9D0"/>
held communion with other Chriſtians, allowing theſe things, yet notwithſtanding it is, <hi>go ye curſed;</hi> and the reaſon of the ſentence is, <hi>you are workers of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the dread of the God of Heaven reſt upon you. My friends, it is another thing to make a profeſſion of the Lord God of Heaven and earth, than moſt are aware of; <hi>let every one that names the name of Chriſt, depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> What is iniquity? It is all things that men or women do to gratify their own wills contrary to the will of God; that is iniquity: Where had all men liberty? Where had <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſons their liberty to fulfil their own wills, and to contradict the will of God? Yet nothing is more common in nations, countries and families, than for people to aſſume a liberty to perform and fulfil their own wills, and to bring about their own intereſt, deſigns and contrivances, though at the ſame time they are convinced that it is contrary to the will of God. Where this liberty is taken, there iniquity is wrought; that is iniquity that is unjuſt, that which is committed againſt him upon whom we have all our dependence every moment for life and breath, for food and raiment, and every thing we enjoy; we have a dependence upon that God that made us, yet vain men and women aſſume a liberty of gratifying their own wills, and ſetting up for the fleſh.</p>
            <p>You may remember that paſſage of the good apoſtle, when he ſaw ſome libertine profeſſors of Chriſtianity, grow looſe and careleſs; they thought it was well they did acknowledge God in their meetings and worſhip, but as to the affairs of the world, they had forgotten that God was concerned in thoſe things; tne apoſtle takes notice of ſuch libertine looſneſs, <hi>go to now, you that ſay, to-day or to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we will go into ſuch a city, and continue there a year, and buy and ſell and get gain; whereas you know not what ſhall be on the morrow: For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little while, and then vaniſheth away: For that you ought to ſay, if the Lord will, we ſhall live and do this or that.</hi> You ought to live in ſubjection to him that made you, you ought to have regard to God's honour in whatſoever you do: <hi>Whether you eat or drink, or whatſoever you do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> Is
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:020309_0089_0FAEF6A52A9542A8"/>
not this ſcripture? Is not this found amongſt the apoſtle's writings? Do not we hold the name of Chriſtians which was given to them at <hi>Antioch?</hi> Yea, we are called Chriſtians, and theſe writings of the apoſtle are holy writings, and what then is the matter that we take ſo little notice of them? That men do not apply theſe wholeſome exhortations to the particularities of their converſation, but that they go from country to country, and from one place to another, and do what they pleaſe, without having any regard to give their ſubjection to the great God: This looſeneſs hath brought into the minds of ſome, ſuch a liberty, that they live without God in the world; when they go ſometimes to religious meetings, and when they hear the name of God mentioned, it may be there is a little awe upon their minds, and they have ſome regard to that God that gave them breath and being, for the preſent: But if there be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if there be not a tie (religion ſignifies a tie, a being bound to God) if men be not bound and tied to God, by that which is made known to them, every one will deſire that <hi>which is good in their own eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is neceſſary for you, my friends, above all people, you that are come to a meaſure of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit, to know and to mind what it doth ſpeak. Such a thing I did this morning, and I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for it; ſuch a thing I did well, and I am juſtified and warranted in the doing of it: Thus it is when a thing is well or ill done. Sometimes ſome men act two or three days together, and never bring their actions to the rule; that is, like a man that is building and never minds his rule, ſo what he builds up, tumbles down again upon his head. You know there is ſomething in you that hath a ſpeaking voice, an infallible voice, and gives judgment on your actions, and paſſeth a ſentence, either of juſtification or condemnation upon you. If you would live ſo as to anſwer God in what you do, you need not fear anſwering men. I do not fear anſwering men in all I do or ſpeak; if I do but anſwer mine own conſcience, I fear no man, tho' he be of another perſuaſion and judgment oppoſite to me; if I keep peace in mine own conſcience, I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the principle of truth in my adverſaries conſciences,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:020309_0090_0FAEF6A6E3940840"/>
tho' they hate me, and deſpiſe me, and ſeek occaſion againſt me; if my actions anſwer the truth of God in mine own heart, they will anſwer the truth in any man's heart: This makes a man as bold as a lion.</p>
            <p>When the people of God obtain a reputation, to be true and juſt, and holy and righteous, all men will expect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and righteouſneſs at their hands. What if I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be one of theſe people? If I have not the truth in my own heart, tho' I put on this reputation as a cloak to hide my inſincerity, the want of that truth takes away my courage. It is truth that hath a power in all men in the world, and it is the power of holineſs and righteouſneſs that makes wicked men afraid; and therefore the apoſtle argues upon that ſubject, the magiſtrate is cloathed with power. What power hath he? The power of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and the power of the ſword. What ſword hath he? A ſword of juſtice; and he is a <hi>terror to evil-doers, but a praiſe to them that do well.</hi> It is true, if I have done evil, if I meet with a man that is but my equal; if in buying, and ſelling, and commerce, I have wronged him, and deceived him, tho' he knows not of it, yet I am afraid of him, I am fearful that he will diſcover me and find me out: But if I ſpeak the truth, and do that which is honeſt in the ſight of all men, I ſhall not fear any man: There is no nation under Heaven, but there is a principle of truth to be found among them in the hearts of men. If I act according to the principle of truth in mine own heart, there is the ſame principle of truth in all men. If I walk up to the principle of truth in myſelf, I ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe walk up to the principle of truth in all men's hearts; if mine own heart doth not condemn me, all the world cannot condemn me.</p>
            <p>If profeſſors were reſolved to anſwer the principles of truth in their own hearts, and go thorough-ſtitch in their profeſſion, they might live courageouſly: Truth will crown them with victory. But if they do not live according to the rule and ſtandard of truth, they are like ſalt that hath <hi>loſt its ſavour, which is trodden under the feet of men.</hi> But where all are one in truth, they are gathered into the truth, and they will live according to it, ſo far as they
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:020309_0091_0FAEF6A7104D3F90"/>
are convinced of it. If you would give them a world, they will not give away a hair's breadth of the truth which they have profeſſed. When truth thus comes to have dominion, then truth ſhall overſpread the earth, and the <hi>kingdoms of the world ſhall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt,</hi> and righteouſneſs ſhall rule, and the ſceptre of it be ſwayed over the nations, and they that rebel againſt it, ſhall be broken by it, and they that are found in it, ſhall have dominion, and they ſhall condemn hypocrites and diſſemblers. Now if you would grow up in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, you have an opportunity for it, becauſe the truth is revealed in your own hearts.</p>
            <p>They who undertake to walk in the truth, meerly from what they hear the miniſters of truth preach, laying up in their minds a company of doctrines, notions and tenets, they will ſtumble and fall; but they that will hearken to the truth in their own hearts, and regard the voice of it in all their ways and undertakings; theſe have a miniſter at home with them, they have a chaplain in their own houſes; if there be any thing they know not, and if they know not what to do, they ask the miniſter of the ſanctuary; others will ask their miniſters, but your miniſter is at home with you: Where hath God appointed any man to rule over your conſcience? No, God hath appointed Chriſt only to rule and govern your conſcience, to be <hi>the author of faith, and the finiſher of it</hi> too: You that are come to the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of Chriſt, keep to the teſtimony in your own hearts; then you have fellowſhip with one another in the truth; and you have cauſe to bleſs God for it, that God hath ſo opened the hearts of one toward another, that the ſuffering of one, is the ſuffering of all; and the conſolation of one, the comfort and rejoicing of all: But alas! who is in this fellowſhip? Only thoſe that are in fellowſhip with the truth, in their own hearts, and really ſo: If a man ſhall break fellowſhip with truth in his own heart, he will make no bones of breaking fellowſhip with his brethren: As ſoon as men break fellowſhip with truth, they are unruly, heady, troubleſome, and make no matter of ſplitting and tearing, and rending of fellowſhip with others. How comes it to paſs that thou haſt done this? Thou didſt not thus while
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:020309_0092_0FAEF6A7E5600228"/>
thou fearedſt ſinning againſt the witneſs of God in thine own heart. But when men have once made light of the great miniſter of the goſpel in their own hearts, it is an eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make light of the reſt; if, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>they have done ſo to the green tree, no wonder that they do ſo to the dry tree: If they deſpiſe me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>do you think they will love you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is moſt evident in a great many at this day, they diſpute againſt truth, they have taken a liberty to ſpeak contrary to the truth in their own hearts, and then they cry down the miniſters of it: Do you think they do ſo that keep their firſt tenderneſs? When they were convinced, the power of the Lord reſted upon them; when the power of the Lord firſt wrought upon you, and brought you to yea and nay, and to plain ſimple language and habit, this was with joy and delight for Chriſt's ſake. They that keep up this tenderneſs and ſimplicity of mind, there is no ſcattering, nor rending, or tearing among them, they <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> and they are kept together in one.</p>
            <p>Friends, you have an opportunity in your hands, ſee that you make uſe of it; you may bear up, and not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by men, or devils, if you keep faithful to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of truth in your own hearts. Let what reproach and perſecution ſoever come, here is a ſtandard, a foundation and a rule, for you to be governed by, every hour of the day; ſearch your hearts, and try your conſciences by it. As ye do this, and keep to the rule of the new creature, of the regeneration, being changed from a carnal birth to an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible birth. <hi>If you be born of the incorruptible feed,</hi> the devil cannot corrupt you, evil paſſions cannot corrupt you; if you keep up that foundation that is incorruptible in itſelf, then nothing will corrupt you, nor your ways and manners: If you will live according to the ſimplicity of the goſpel, you will ſerve God, and be examples to others in the life of holineſs and righteouſneſs, and hereby God ſhall be glorified. This is that which will ſhine forth to the whole nation, and give a good report to truth: But if any that profeſs the truth, be found falſe to their profeſſion, and be found unholy, and deceive and over-reach their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they loſe by it, and the devil rejoiceth at it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:020309_0093_0FAEF6A8979DA780"/>Thus we know the life of righteouſneſs is brought forth through the Spirit of truth, and out-ſhines all, and will reach God's witneſs in them that are afar off, and bring them near; and happy and bleſſed are they that are found in this divine work, conforming their lives and converſations according to the new creature, peace be upon them, <hi>and upon the whole Iſrael of God.</hi> There is a miniſter that abides with you, that goes home with you, it is his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that you muſt ſtand or fall by: If any one ſhould be a falſe profeſſor, and be cried up, it he be not ſincere, he hath not peace; though he flutter awhile, and make a ſhew, the worm of guilt gnaws and torments him; ſuch as theſe have not peace with God, nor fellowſhip with the church: Though they ſeem to be alive, yet they are dead; as it was with the churches in <hi>Aſia, they had a name to live, yet they were dead;</hi> though they have an empty name, ſuch a one is a living man or woman, they are eſteemed friends to the church; but though they are commended and cried up, and have a name to live, yet they are dead; <hi>there is a few names in</hi> Sardis <hi>which have not defiled their garments, they ſhall walk with me in white,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for they are worthy. I know thy works, that thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, and art dead.</hi> See what Chriſt, the bright Morning-Star, could do: He could look into a meeting, and ſee whether few or many had only a name to live, or were really alive; if they were dead as to ſincerity and truth, though they had been among the church, they would help to break it down, but not to build it up.</p>
            <p>You that have this divine life ſtill ſtirring in you, and feel the operation that firſt quickened you to God, prize this principle of the divine life above all: What is there can rob you of it? Value not the friendſhip of the world: Alas! what can it amount to? Count it as <hi>dung in compariſon of Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> look upon all things with a ſound eye: Peace with God is of that concernment, that you cannot be happy here or hereafter, without it; the friendſhip of the world I can be without, and the cuſtoms and faſhions of the world I can be without, I can ſpare theſe things; but the favour of God I cannot be without, <hi>and growth in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:020309_0094_0FAEF6A95845B6F0"/>
a ſincere profeſſion of the goſpel; I cannot be without theſe things.</p>
            <p>My friends, though you do not make a ſhew and flutter in the world, as ſome others do, yet your glory is within; they that are living members of this divine body, the glory, and beauty and brightneſs of ſuch, appears in the ſight of God. If you grow in <hi>grace,</hi> you will be a comfort to one another; and as the apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>you are our epiſtle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our hearts, known and read of all men.</hi> The Lord preſerve and keep you ſimple, keep you in all ſincerity, in that truth that hath wrought in your own hearts, that you may have acquaintance with your teacher, that he may not be driven into corners; for you may do it, and ſtop his mouth, and ſilence him too. If you let your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe will rule, you may ſlay the juſt; but there will come a day of his riſing, then down you go. Whatſoever men may get by it at preſent, when truth riſeth, when the Juſt One that was ſlain hath a reſurrection in them, then moſt certain down they go. While you have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in your hands, and an intereſt in the covenant of life, walk with God according to the counſel and dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of his Holy Spirit, that you may be brought to a heavenly fellowſhip, and to partake of the good things that God hath prepared for his children.</p>
            <p>My friends, pray prize your ſeaſons, let no day ſlip, for fear you miſs a day at laſt; wait upon the Lord, and let his fear and a holy awe be always upon your hearts: Then peace will be upon you, and there will be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all that you do. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the upright, for the end of that man is peace;</hi> when he can reflect upon his paſt life, and ſay, I have walked before the Lord with a perfect heart, and done that which is good and well pleaſing in his ſight, and have not turned aſide to the right hand or to the left, but the Standard of Truth hath been the guide of all my <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> actions. If <hi>truth</hi> hath been thy <hi>guide</hi> here, then <hi>truth</hi> ſhall be thy portion hereafter.

               <p>EVERLASTING, glorious, eternal God of Life! whoſe kingdom ruleth over all; thy kingdom is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdom; a glorious, bleſſed day hath dawned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou art making thyſelf known to the ſons and daughters of men; and thou haſt opened an eye in a remnant (which the God of this world had blinded) to ſee the glory of this day. For tho' we have lived without God in the world, yet thou art near to us, and thou haſt called us to repentance, and inſpired our ſouls with a deſire to thee, and to the remembrance of thy name: Praiſe and everlaſting thankſgivings belong unto thee, who art the author of our ſalvation; who haſt reached out thy hand and laid hold upon us, and ſought us out when we ſought thee not, and haſt made known thy power and love for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation; and thou wilt make it known more and more to every upright, ſincere mind.</p>
               <p>O powerful Father of Life! how hath thy power and goodneſs been revealed on our behalf for thine own name's ſake? Thou haſt ſtood by us in all our trials and exerciſes, and we have found thee a God nigh at hand, and thou haſt brought a remnant to deſire nothing ſo much as the enjoyment of thy preſence; thou haſt brought them to be ſenſible, that without thee they can do nothing; therefore, in all our aſſemblies and meetings, we deſire to be acquainted with thy power, to hear thy word which ſpeaks life to our ſouls, by which we may live.</p>
               <p>And dear and powerful Father! the continuation of thy goodneſs among us, doth greatly engage the hearts of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to offer up praiſes and thankſgivings to thee. Thou haſt inclined the minds and hearts of thy people to wait upon thee, and haſt opened their underſtandings to receive thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly truth, and thoſe rich and heavenly treaſures which thou offereſt them, and haſt provided a cup of ſalvation to refreſh the poor and needy ſoul.</p>
               <p>O Living God of Life! reach forth thy hand, to ſupport and ſave thoſe that are breathing after thee, that are ſenſible of the want of thy preſence, and are frequenting the aſſemblies of thy people, with a hope and deſire that they may enjoy a bleſſing from thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:020309_0096_0FAEF6AAC94C2468"/>Living God of Life! touch their hearts with the finger of thy power, let them know that thou art ready to open the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thy love, and life unto them, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that their ſouls may be comforted, and they may offer up ſacrifices of thankſgiving. And let all thy children every where, render to thy name, through Jeſus Chriſt, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and honour, and praiſe; who art God over all, bleſſed forever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>SERMON VIII. SAVING FAITH, <hi>the</hi> GIFT <hi>of</hi> GOD <hi>alone.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <date>March 8, 1687.</date>

               <salute>My Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU that are made partakers of that precious faith, which hath brought you to an expectation of that redemption and deliverance that comes alone by Chriſt Jeſus, your minds ſhould be continually exerciſed in that faith which God hath given you, for it is a great gift, a bleſſed gift that he hath given to us to believe. This never came of ourſelves, never was there a true believer in Chriſt Jeſus, but he received his faith of God, it was the gift of God, it was given to him to believe. Other ſorts of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there are in the world, that can communicate their faith one to another; but they are true believers that have their faith communicated to them by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, it is <hi>given to them that believe;</hi> and becauſe it is ſo excellent and ſo heavenly a gift, and hath ſuch large privileges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, it is neceſſary that every one that receives it, ſhould have a continual exerciſe in it; that you may know what it is, and what it doth for you, and ſo come to be experienced Chriſtians. Now all that are partakers of it, they do believe, and know in whom they have believed, and for what they have believed, even for the ſaving of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>The true faith, that is the gift of God, it is not at all
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:020309_0097_0FAEF6AB89965C68"/>
ſhort of a complete ſaving of their ſouls; they that truly believe, their faith ſtands in one that they know is able to ſave to the utmoſt; and ſo a true believer hath a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his faith above all other believers in the world; for he knows that his faith reaches to a complete redemption, unto a complete ſanctification, unto a complete fitting of him for the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Now there is no ſuch faith that ever was made by men, there is no ſuch faith that all the wiſe and learned men upon the face of the earth, have either preached or given forth to be received; for if you come to conſider the divers forms of faith that men have miniſtered, they will fall ſhort of ſaving their ſouls, they fall ſhort of redemption, they fall ſhort of fitting and preparing them for the kingdom of God, and ſo they have not that comfort, that ſatisfaction, and that inward refreſhment that belongs to the others, or that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to their ſouls, that have <hi>the faith of God's elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein hath been the privilege of the people of God in all ages, as well as in our age; their faith hath had a farther extent, it hath reached farther in order to the good of their ſouls, than the faith of all others hath done: What comfort can a ſerious Chriſtian take in a faith that falls ſhort of righteouſneſs and redemption? Would it not make a man or woman's heart ach, to think I am a believer, but yet I have no faith that reacheth to ſanctification, and holy living, and redemption from ſin? All my faith leaves me a ſinner all my days; to my dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour there is no maſtery to be had, no getting vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over ſin, it will prevail over me as long as I live.</p>
            <p>This is not that <hi>precious faith</hi> that God's elect have been made partakers of, that works effectually in their ſouls; this is not that faith that can miniſter real comfort to the poor ſoul that is laden with iniquity, and weary of ſin; the faith that falls ſhort of ſanctification, and redemption from ſin, is ſuch a faith as God never gave his people; it came ſome other way into the world, and it hath cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated moſt of the ſons and daughters of men, and they have expelled the true faith (as much as in them lies) that ſaving faith that purifies and cleanſes men from ſin, and gives them victory over the world, and have got another
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:020309_0098_0FAEF6ADE3F4A6A0"/>
faith in the room of it; and they live in their ſins, and in their luſts and concupiſcence, and ſtill remain in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
            <p>But God was pleaſed to hear and anſwer the cry of the ſouls of a remnant (for which many of us have cauſe to magnify the name of our God) when we had travelled from mountain to hill, to ſeek where true comfort might be found, where one ſhould ſay to us that we ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. We know there is no eating of the tree of life until we do overcome; nor entering into God's kingdom till we be cleanſed. Some laid an impoſſibility in our way, which made many a one to mourn. What, muſt we never be cleanſed? Muſt this crooked heart, and perverſe will, always remain? Muſt I be a ſinner and a believer? A ſinner, and call myſelf a child of God? How can theſe things hang together? Theſe have made many to faint in their minds, and to ſay as <hi>David</hi> did in his diſtreſs, <hi>one day I ſhall periſh by the hand of Saul.</hi> One day this corruption will be my ruin; for all my prayers, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other duties and performances, this ſin will be my utter ruin at laſt.</p>
            <p>After many have mourned, and been afflicted, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the burden that was upon them, it hath pleaſed the Lord to viſit a remnant, and to open their hearts to make known the <hi>precious faith,</hi> the <hi>faith of God's elect,</hi> the <hi>faith that was once delivered to the ſaints.</hi> Is this the faith that is worthy of an earneſt contending for, and preaching for, and ſuffering for? Who was ever ſo mad, as to ſuffer for ſuch a faith as will leave a man under the power of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and his own luſts? No wonder that ſuch have a faith that is not worth contending and ſuffering for. Who will expoſe themſelves for ſuch a faith that will never do them a kindneſs? Now that faith which belongs to a purified ſoul, to one that is ſanctified, that faith delivered to the ſaints, it is called a <hi>ſhield;</hi> when once a Chriſtian comes to make uſe of this faith as a ſhield, he will find the power of it. A ſhield is that which is worn by perſons that are among enemies; it is for the defence and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of one that is beſet with enemies; and a good Chriſtian is ſo ſituated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:020309_0099_0FAEF6B0952EF170"/>There is a ſort of blind Chriſtians, friends to the world, their chriſtianity is worldly, and their faith worldly; but all true Chriſtians are in the midſt of their enemies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward; and if they had not the ſhield of faith to defend them, they would certainly be wounded every day, they would be ſlain and loſe their lives: The faith that is called a ſhield, it is that by which a Chriſtian is to be defended and ſaved from harm deſigned againſt him every hour; <hi>for the devil goes about like a roaring lion, continually ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> The apoſtle ſpeaks more particularly to believers; <hi>the devil, your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> he is an adverſary in himſelf, but more eſpecially <hi>your adverſary</hi> that are believers; that have believed to the ſaving of your ſouls. You that believe that Chriſt is ſent of God, endued with power ſufficient to break his head, and power to redeem you out of his ſervice and bondage, the devil will be your adverſary: Let him be ſo, if I have but my ſhield. This is that which if a man uſe, he will <hi>quench all the fiery darts of the devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a man come once to receive the faith, the true faith, faith in the power of God, this faith will remain victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over temptation; but if thou doſt not keep thy faith in a continual exerciſe, thou doſt not deſerve the name of a true believer: If a man receive the true faith, and grow careleſs in his chriſtian exerciſe, will not this adverſary, the devil, be about his ears? Will not he ſend forth his fiery darts at him; his temptations, and ſnares, and gins, to entangle him, tho' he be a believer, if he doth not keep in the continual exerciſe of his faith? But a true Chriſtian, that feels the power of the grace of God, and is in the continual exerciſe of true faith, he is like a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or ſentinel, that hath his armour on, and his ſhield ready, he knows he is on the borders of his enemies quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and he keeps himſelf in perpetual watchfulneſs, in daily expectation of the devil's fiery darts; he keeps his ſhield in readineſs; I ſee a temptation lies in ſuch a thing, but I ſee the Lord's power is able to keep me out of it. I ſee there is profit or pleaſure in the ſnare; it is a hook that is baited, but I ſee the hook through the bait, bleſſed be God; and I have a confidence in his
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:020309_0100_0FAEF920594F8DA0"/>
power, and that he is able to keep me from that thing, for all the baits of profit, pleaſure, or the friendſhip of the world.</p>
            <p>A believer keeps in the exerciſe of his faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that <hi>his ſalvation is nearer than when he firſt believed;</hi> the people that believe, are not preſently ſaved, the work of ſalvation is to be wrought after they believe; <hi>for without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, nevertheleſs the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> it is founded upon the power of God; when a man believeth, the work is begun; tho' ſome fooliſh profeſſors tell us, that the work is done when the act is only in the mind; they will tell you what day of the month, and ſuch a day of the year their converſion was wrought; but they know not what they ſay. A man may poſſibly know when it was brought about: A man may know about the time when God communicated faith to him; but he muſt know after he is a believer, then begins the work of ſalvation, the believer is to be ſaved from this or the other enemy; he is not preſently ſaved from all, there muſt be a warfare, <hi>a fighting the good fight of faith,</hi> before theſe enemies of his ſalvation are overcome; the devil will not give over becauſe I am a believer, and becauſe Chriſt promiſed to <hi>break his head; the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpent's head.</hi> I am now but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on my armour; the battle is not fought; I have not yet gone through the peril of the fight; I am now buckling on my armour; when the fight comes, if I have not my ſhield and my armour ready, I may be ſlain for all this; ſome <hi>have made ſhipwreck of faith,</hi> they have not held it, nor kept the faith, but given it away: But ſaith the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith,</hi> I have gotten the victory.</p>
            <p>So people, after they are believers, they muſt wait to have their faith ſtrengthened by renewed manifeſtations of the ſame power in which it firſt ſtood: They muſt wait upon the Lord, and he will renew the ſtrength of their faith, zeal and courage; and as temptations are renewed, they have new courage, and new ſtrength and new ability, and all by this divine, ſpiritual and Chriſtian exerciſe; they every day come to ſee the work they believed, that which their faith tended to, ſee the work in ſome meaſure wrought, they
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:020309_0101_0FAEF920D61AC488"/>
ſee ſome enemy of their ſouls brought down and ſlain, and they ſee their ſouls come up to a little more dominion than they had before; they ſee the devil's power is weakened more than before, and that he hath not ſo much power as he hath had over them. Theſe things are ſome encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to raiſe up in a true Chriſtian, living praiſes to God; ſeeing, by believing, he hath found thus much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the working of the word, why ſhould he not wait on the Lord for the accompliſhment of this work, that he may believe to the ſaving of his ſoul, that he may come to receive the end of his hope and faith, the ſalvation of his ſoul? Now, by thus keeping their faith in exerciſe, they know that their <hi>ſalvation is nearer now, than when they firſt believed.</hi> It is not ſo with every one, for many that have believed, their ſalvation is fartheſt off, becauſe of their negligence, profeſſing one thing with their mouths, and doing another thing in their practice; there are ſome things which they believe and profeſs, and yet do the contrary; that puts their ſalvation further off, and draws them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly into deſponding, and into a loſing their courage and zeal for God; the cuſtom of ſinning hath at laſt taken away the ſenſe of ſinning. It is ſo with a man when he firſt tranſgreſſeth the rule, he is ſomewhat tender, and doth it with ſome regret; but after he is come to a cuſtom of doing it, he is pretty well at eaſe, and ſo by degrees he goes on towards the ſtate of being paſt feeling. At laſt ſuch ſinners come to dying; they were dead once before, and <hi>were quickened through the operation of the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> they were quickened, and if they ſhall die again, if you die a ſecond time, pray remember it is a ſecond time; you that are careleſs and ready to die, remember it is the ſecond death that you are going to; and conſider that if you <hi>die the ſecond death, you ſhall have no part of the firſt reſurrection:</hi> Better ſuch had never been born at all, than after they have lived in hope, to loſe it again. This is that which was upon my heart to commend unto you, that you may partake of this <hi>precious faith,</hi> that hath a tendency to the ſaving of the ſoul, and fitting you for the kingdom of God. Hath God given you to believe? And will you not believe that you ſhall live without ſin?
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:020309_0102_0FAEF921998470B0"/>
If you come to obtain this precious faith, you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you ſhall come to live without ſinning againſt God, and have the light of his countenance ſhining upon you. He that truly believeth, his faith reacheth to this, and he will ſay to himſelf, I am ſaved a little from the liberty of my tongue, and from many ſins of an evil prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: God hath redeemed me from my vanity, pride and paſſion, and other things that were troubleſome, the Lord hath redeemed me from them; I ſee the work is going on, and I am nearer to the kingdom of God than when I firſt believed; I have gotten victory over many of my ſpiritual enemies, and I hope the Lord will carry me on, and keep me by his power through faith unto ſalvation: Hitherto the Lord hath helped me, I have not fought in vain, I have not been beating the air, but God hath given me victory over the tempter inwardly and outwardly, ſo that he could not prevail, whilſt I kept the ſhield of faith over my head; but when I have been careleſs, and not exerciſed my faith as a ſhield, I have been weak as other men.</p>
            <p>You are not called to weakneſs and feebleneſs, but to the power of God, that you may be exerciſed in it, and by it be kept from the evil of the world: There is a poſſibility of being kept, if you be faithful to him that hath called you, that is, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, the Captain of our Salvation,</hi> if you follow him ſtep by ſtep, and do not run headlong all at once; when you ſee a great deal of ſin and corruption before you, and ſeek to maſter it in your own ſtrength, you will loſe the victory: The ſame word that ſheweth us our ſin, ſheweth us our own ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to overcome it, and that we can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divine aſſiſtance; tho' we lie long ſtruggling under the weight and burden of ſin, we cannot of ourſelves get vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over it, we cannot bring judgment into victory, God muſt have the glory of it. If you keep to Jeſus, he will carry on the work; you did believe in him, for he did work this faith in you, and he will carry on his own work, and his own work ſhall praiſe him. All others that talk of faith, and make an empty profeſſion, they diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God; they talk of perfection, and living without ſin,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:020309_0103_0FAEF924A34F5E20"/>
but never experience it, and ſo bring diſhonour to God: If you wait to ſee this work carried on; if you believe and exerciſe your faith for the overcoming of your ſins, and <hi>perfecting holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> you will hereby bring glory to God, who alone is worthy of all praiſe; who is God over all, bleſſed for ever more. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>GOD hath made you witneſſes of the great work of this day; the Lord I ſay hath given you eyes to ſee, and ears to hear, and hearts to underſtand the great work of the day; he hath called you forth, that you may be faithful witneſſes every one in your meaſure of that which he hath brought to paſs in your ſight, for he hath revealed his power, the eternal power by which the world was made, he hath revealed and manifeſted that power for the raiſing up of life, for the ſubjecting and bringing under death, and the power of it; for a great while a teſtimony that hath been born in the nation hath been unto death; he that hath the power of death,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:020309_0105_0FAEF927521063C0"/>
that is, the devil, he hath had a great many to ſound out his power, to declare the continuance of it, that death muſt reign, and darkneſs muſt continue, and that the kingdom of the man of ſin will never be brought down.</p>
            <p>But now in our day, glory to God on high, here is another ſound come forth, the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath uttered his voice, and who can but prophecy! The word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is given of God, and many are raiſed up to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, and to ſound forth the name of the Lord in the extirpation, the ruin and deſtruction, that is and ſhall be brought upon the kingdom of iniquity, upon the kingdom of the man of ſin, and to prophecy and declare in the name of the Lord, that righteouſneſs ſhall run down like a ſtream; this is the goſpel, the glad tidings that we receive from God, and miniſter unto you, that you might believe, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving you might come to wait upon the Lord, and behold the accompliſhment of it.</p>
            <p>For, my friends, herein hath conſiſted all the labour, travel and exerciſe, of the ſervants of the Lord; and for this cauſe have we ſuffered many things, and gone through many trials, <hi>becauſe we have ſtedfaſtly believed, and therefore have we ſpoken it;</hi> that the Lord will, by his Almighty power, lay waſte, deſtroy and bring to an end, that power, that the wicked one, the devil, hath had upon the minds and ſpirits of the ſons and daughters of men, and that he will ſet up and eſtabliſh, in the very ſame ſoul, a law of righteouſneſs, and a law of truth, and will cauſe the beauty of holineſs to ſhine forth through them, where iniquity hath lodged, where the wicked one hath ruled.</p>
            <p>Now you that have believed this teſtimony, you have received it, as glad tidings unto you, for you are weary of that old ſervice, you are oppreſſed under the power of that ſtrange prince. There was a kind of ſpirit and power that had ruled over you, that neither gave you life nor breath, nor had done any good thing, and yet you were ſubject; and many there were, who through the grace of God, came to ſee that a ſtate and condition of ſin and iniquity was not a happy ſtate; and by a ſecret kindling of the <hi>ſpark</hi> of God's love in your ſouls ere you knew him, there was a cry raiſed to be delivered, if it be poſſible. If
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:020309_0106_0FAEF9279D435540"/>
there be any deliverance, O why may not I be delivered! If there be any redemption, why may not I be redeemed! If there be a power that can ſet me free from the ſervice of this wicked one, why may not I be ſet free?</p>
            <p>Ah, friends! remember the days and nights in which theſe living cries run through you, then you were poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; then you were humble and broken, and the Lord beheld you in thoſe days, he ſaw your ſtate and condition, he ſaw how helpleſs you were, and did not he ariſe to help you? Did not a power ſpring forth in the day of your humility, in the day of tenderneſs, by which you became able to make war againſt the luſts of your own hearts, and did not you overcome and prevail in your war? Did not you make a progreſs by the power and by the grace that firſt raiſed deſires in you? And as you made this progreſs and gained ground, as I may ſay, of your own corruptions, your faith came to be ſtrengthened, and you were confirmed in the belief and in the obedience of the truth; and the more you truſted and relied upon him, the more did he manifeſt his power in you; he made known his ability and his ſtrength in your weakneſs, ſo that you did become <hi>living witneſſes,</hi> every one in your meaſure, that there was ſuch a power; and that that power was able not only to ſave from a little, or from a few, but was able to ſave to the uttermoſt, to ſave out of all that was polluted and defiled, and to cleanſe and purify the conſcience from all dead works, and to enable you to ſerve the living God.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord having thus eſtabliſhed you, and confirmed you by his power, that you were found in the <hi>faith,</hi> and firm in the believing of the <hi>truth,</hi> my friends, all the labour, and travel and doctrine, and exerciſe of the preachers of the goſpel, to thoſe who were converted and confirmed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very acceptable. So we preach, and ſo you believed; here was a unity in our faith, here grew up a fellowſhip, a communion in the faith, and the Lord became glorified in the aſſemblies not only of thoſe that preached, but of thoſe that heard, becauſe each one had a place in the body, and each one had a ſavour of the word of life by which the body was nouriſhed.</p>
            <p>Now, my friends, that which lies particularly upon me
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:020309_0107_0FAEF9285532C9D0"/>
to leave with you for my teſtimony (and I pray God that it may be placed in the hearts of all you that have believed) is, that you may all wait upon the Lord, to ſee all that brought to paſs which you have believed: For I take notice by the eye that God hath opened in me, by which he hath made me to take care of his flock, and ſometimes put his word in my mouth, that I may ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon: I ſay, by this eye, I take notice of many that have received this precious faith, and thereby have believed the great and high ſtate; their faith reached ſo far, they knew that power to be able to bring them into a perfect dominion over their luſts, and paſſions, and corruptions, and over the ſpirit of the world, over pride, over anger, over all things that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the divine life; their faith is as ſound as we can preach it in reſpect of the extent of it, but their faith hath not reached thus far in its operation upon their hearts; they have not had the power going on, to accompliſh and fulfil that which remains.</p>
            <p>Are there not ſome here and there that are ſettled in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth, but are got into an eaſe from the labour of the truth? But if I be ſound in the faith, my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is opened; I do not only believe this matter, but have inward evidence and demonſtration, that I am certain, paſt all doubt and queſtion of it, that the Lord reveals his power in them that believe, that purifies them, and makes them every whit clean; and here I have a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion with them that preach, and them that believe.</p>
            <p>But, my friends, all this will not give you communion with God; though there is communion with the church of God, with reſpect to men, who are come into one faith and doctrine, yet for fellowſhip with God, it ſtands in a life beyond all doctrines, and beyond all words and expreſſions; therefore your buſineſs and mine, and every one's, is what we undertook when our faces were firſt turned to God, that we may be followers of Chriſt in the regeneration. For many may be firm in point of doctrine, and yet may not follow Chriſt Jeſus: Many hold the truth, but do not hold it in righteouſneſs, but unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now, my friends, have a care, your religion and your
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:020309_0108_0FAEF92911A37CD8"/>
ſouls eternal welfare are concerned. This doctrine I leave you in charge in the name of the Lord God: Flatter not yourſelves any one of you, becauſe of the ſoundneſs of your belief, but look for ſoundneſs of heart, and for a right ſpirit to be created in you, a ſpirit that can no way endure any thing that the light of Chriſt hath made manifeſt to be evil; if it be truth you own, then exerciſe faith upon it, and whatſoever ſin or temptation aſſaults you, ſay, I ſhall overcome in the name of the Lord Jehovah; I ſhall bring thee under, be what luſt, paſſion, or corruption ſoever thou wilt, in the name of the Lord, I ſhall overcome thee, and bring thee under.</p>
            <p>Travel on in the faith committed to you, and you will be more than conquerors; you will not only grow into external fellowſhip with the people of God in the ſight of men, but into fellowſhip with the church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in Heaven; and your communion will not be in words and doctrines, and principles of faith; but your communion will be with God the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo in all your meetings together, the joy of the Lord will be your ſtrength, and the joy of his great <hi>ſalvation</hi> your covering, and he will manifeſt his gracious preſence with you; and that power which hath kept you to this day from your childhood, and preſerved you in all your battles and conflicts with the world, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and encouraged you when you went ſometimes ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and mourning night and day, and fearing leſt you ſhould not overcome your adverſaries; that power that hath kept you hitherto, will do greater things for you than you have yet been witneſſes of.</p>
            <p>Therefore, dear friends, this I would leave with you, there is nothing will keep you and me in that little time that remains to us here to ſpend on earth, but that which will keep us in the exerciſe of faith towards God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>able to ſave us to the uttermoſt:</hi> Let us wait to ſee the power of God for <hi>ſanctification and holineſs;</hi> that will reach as far as ſaving us from our ſins.</p>
            <p>This hath been the greateſt reproach that ever our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries have thrown upon us, that there are ſome amongſt
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:020309_0109_0FAEF929D78B3CA8"/>
us that talk of believing in the power of God, and talk of an ability to overcome their ſins, and living a holy life, and living without ſin, while they themſelves live in it. This is the greateſt reproach that ever our adverſaries have thrown upon us: Whoſoever have been the cauſe of this reproach, God will require it of them, for the Lord is jealous of his name and glory; and he will have the praiſe and honour that is due to his great name, for <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle; tho' I know nothing of myſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified. When you come to that, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not charge yourſelves, then the Lord will not charge you; but take heed that therein you place not your juſtification, hereby you are not juſtified.</p>
            <p>Therefore have an eye to <hi>Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our faith.</hi> He begins the work of faith, and he will carry it on until he be the finiſher of it, and the juſtifier of it; he is the Mediator of the New Covenant, that alone juſtifies the children of God. Depend not upon your own holineſs and righteouſneſs for juſtification; keep your eyes to Jeſus the author of your faith, who will be alſo the finiſher of it; keep your hearts with all diligence, and walk humbly with God, watching leſt your adverſary that you have overcome, prevail againſt you. By going from the power, there is no ſafety for the flock, but only while they keep in the ſhepherd's fold; be faithful and keep yourſelves in the love of God, and he will be preſent with you, and keep you to be his witneſſes to the end of your days, and will raiſe up another generation to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to his power, when he hath taken you to himſelf.</p>
            <p>To that mighty power of God I commit you, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving you in humility of mind and ſoul; and my prayer for you ſhall be, that you may go on, and make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the good ways of the Lord, until his work be finiſhed in you.</p>

            <head type="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <date>October 12, 1690.</date>
            </head>
            <p>HE that knoweth the day of the Lord, and the ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of his arm, is quickened to feel the power that is in Chriſt Jeſus, the Head of the Church; that ſo he may be enabled, through his power, to bring forth fruit unto God. The eye of the Lord is upon you all, and he expects at the hand of every one, that they bring forth fruit unto God, that according to the aboundings of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards you, and of his patience and long-ſuffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, there might at laſt be an anſwer in the ſoul of every one, unto the mercy and goodneſs of God. They that do not know and experience this, that the long-ſuffering and patience of God leadeth unto repentance, they know no part of Chriſtianity; let them make their profeſſion ever ſo high, and proclaim their notions ever ſo loud, they that know not the work of repentance in their hearts, as yet, need to learn the firſt principle of the Chriſtian religion. You know it hath been the cuſtom of people to learn their children principles, and they that have learned their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they go for Chriſtians, whether they repent or no; though they go on in ſin and iniquity all their days, yet they go under the reputation of Chriſtians; and it is high time to examine and find out (if you can) a reaſon for this, that a man ſhall be accounted a Chriſtian upon any other terms
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:020309_0112_0FAEF92CD84224E0"/>
now in this age, than the Lord Chriſt did preach and publiſh in the days of his fleſh; for he did abſolutely deny that any man could be his diſciple, without taking up a daily croſs, and without ſelf-denial: Now how ſhould a man at this day be a Chriſtian, or a diſciple of Chriſt, without taking up a daily croſs, and without ſelf-denial?</p>
            <p>It may be ſome will tell you, that they are baptized into the Chriſtian faith, and have been taught, and have made a profeſſion of Chriſtian principles, and aſſociated themſelves among thoſe that make profeſſion of Chriſt; but here is not a word of a daily croſs in all this, nor of ſelf-denial; ſo that they would have you to underſtand in this, that the terms of Chriſtianity are changed, and that men may be Chriſtians without the terms of Chriſt, or at leaſt reputed ſo.</p>
            <p>And this hath been occaſioned by the great apoſtacy that hath been brought into the church by a long night of darkneſs, and the revealing of Antichriſt. Antichriſt hath been diſcovered and revealed, and hath ſet up, in deſpite of Chriſtianity, a falſe Chriſtianity; and there came in the terms of a man's being accepted, and being reputed a Chriſtian upon Antichriſt's terms: And if you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to do thus, and ſay ſo, you ſhall be admitted into the Chriſtian Society. Now all theſe terms of Antichriſt, have been ſuch things as an unregenerate man could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to and comply with.</p>
            <p>And the opening of this door, hath let into the church abundance of hypocrites and evil-doers, who were in too unregenerate a ſtate to conform to thoſe things that were required; for in the public ſociety of Chriſtians, it was not ſaid, you muſt be regenerate, and take up a daily croſs, and deny yourſelves, and walk as becometh ſaints, and ſo behave yourſelves that God may be glorified, and the profeſſion of Chriſtianity honoured by you. Thoſe were the terms of old; but there are other terms of being Chriſtians, which are of a later date.</p>
            <p>Now this apoſtacy hath prevailed and ſpread over whole nations and countries, not a ſew, ſo that whole kingdoms have become Chriſtians upon theſe latter terms, and God is greatly diſhonoured among us, and Chriſt the Holy One moſt horribly prophaned. It is not ſo common among
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:020309_0113_0FAEF92D8FCE3808"/>
Heathens and infidels, to find people wronging and deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, and killing and deſtroying one another; and yet it is the practice of many that are called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Theſe are the fruits and effects of thoſe latter times of Chriſtianity. Now ſeeing it is thus, which no mortal man can deny, I have this queſtion to ask, and I deſire that you would ſeriouſly weigh it in your hearts and ſouls, both while you are together, and when you are ſeparate one from another, whether it is not high time for all of us to return again to the firſt terms of Chriſtianity, and to reckon no man a Chriſtian, let him profeſs what he will, ſaving ſuch a one as doth know and witneſs, that the long-ſuffering, and patience, and goodneſs of God, doth lead him to repentance; and ſaving ſuch a one as hath ſo much faith towards God, that for love to God he will deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and be a follower of Jeſus in that way and life he lived in.</p>
            <p>It is high time for all of us to return again to the terms of Chriſtianity, that were ſet up by a higher authority than ever Antichriſt had, and before Antichriſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; for tho' it is true that Antichriſt hath obtained power on earth, to eſtabliſh his ſort of Chriſtianity, that is, without the croſs, and a ſort of religion whereby they indulge themſelves in whatſoever pleaſeth their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hearts, and corrupt minds; yet Antichriſt hath not all power, he is not Almighty; I hope neither Antichriſt, nor the beaſt, nor the dragon, nor the falſe prophet, nor the whore, have all power on earth, though they have a great deal, and by that power they have eſtabliſhed laws, decrees, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and innumerable things about religion; and ſome cry, this is the way you muſt walk in; others cry, the way to Heaven lies here, and here you muſt travel if you will come thither: Some cry, this is truth; others ſay, it is error: So that the world is divided; Antichriſt's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the world is divided; and when <hi>the houſe is divided againſt itſelf,</hi> there is hopes that it will fall at laſt.</p>
            <p>But there is one, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given and committed; and his Chriſtians are not divided among themſelves, but they are of one heart, and
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:020309_0114_0FAEF93132A758A0"/>
of one mind; and he that hath all power in Heaven and Earth committed to him, can cruſh and bruiſe that power that others have. <hi>Herod</hi> had ſome, and <hi>Pilate</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>your power is limited, this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs; and thou hadſt not had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Pilate, were it not given thee from above;</hi> here is power given to the dragon, to the falſe prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the beaſt, to ſpeak great things; but this power of Antichriſt is going away; Chriſt Jeſus was ſent into the world in his day, to bring people back again to God, and to primitive Chriſtianity and obedience, and to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> terms of ſociety and communion, and to a fellowſhip in Chriſt Jeſus through the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Now if we had ſet up a way of religion, as other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> have done, which is contained in ſome canons, articles, doctrines, and ſuch and ſuch commandments of men; and if men will confeſs theſe articles, and obſerve theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, they ſhall be of our ſociety; then we ſhould have done like the reſt of the fallen Chriſtians; but we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from the beginning, that profeſſing our doctrine, and the principles of religion, doth not give any man fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion with us; but our communion is in the ſelf-denying life, and a daily croſs, in oppoſition to ſenſual luſt, vanity, pride and bitterneſs of ſpirit, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, enmity and wrath; this hath brought us to a holy fellowſhip and communion in the Holy Ghoſt, and to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in unity from one head, which is Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that there is not this man's church, and the other man's church among the people of God.</p>
            <p>Do you read in the primitive times, that <hi>Paul</hi> had his church, and <hi>Peter</hi> his church, and <hi>James</hi> his church, and <hi>Jude</hi> his church? Indeed they had their meetings as we have now, in many cities and countries among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but theſe holy apoſtles that were the firſt publiſhers of the everlaſting goſpel, after their great Lord and Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt, they never did appropriate any church to themſelves, that was not their buſineſs; but our work and buſineſs, ſaith the apoſtle, is to gather you to Chriſt, and <hi>preſent you as a chaſte virgin to Chriſt;</hi> our work is, to <hi>turn you from darkneſs to light,</hi> that you may
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:020309_0115_0FAEF93158A449E0"/>
walk in it, and be the children of it; our work is, to <hi>build you up as a ſpiritual houſe, to be preſented to Chriſt the</hi> Mediator.</p>
            <p>This is primitive Chriſtianity that hath its foundation in holineſs and righteouſneſs, ſincerity and truth, not in words, and terms, and articles, and canons, and decrees, and other obſervances; this is not the foundation of true Chriſtianity, nor will it ever be, the devil's kingdom muſt be deſtroyed, it is ſhaking, for he in whom we believe, hath power from his Father to break the devil's head, Antichriſt and the dragon's head. Chriſt Jeſus is ſignified by divers names, <hi>the ſecond</hi> Adam, <hi>Lord from Heaven, the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> but he is the ſame Chriſt; ſo Antichriſt is expreſſed by ſeveral terms and names, but he is the ſame power of darkneſs, he hath made the nations drunk, to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and deſtroy, and devour one another.</p>
            <p>This hath been done in the fallen ſtate of Chriſtians, and the deſign which the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> hath in ſending his miniſters and workmen to labour among you, is to reſtore men to the firſt Chriſtianity, and to bring men to God; that religion is not made up of doctrines, articles, canons and decrees of men, but it hath the word of God for its foundation; <hi>he that hath an ear to hear, let him hear:</hi> There is ſome ſpirit, and power, and viſible work in a true Chriſtian, which the falſe Chriſtian never had. The falſe Chriſtians have taken the name and profeſſion of Chriſt, and their fruits have been diſhonourable to him; they might as well make profeſſion of Antichriſt and ſatan, they have a form of godlineſs, they have ſome of the word, but they deny the power. What is their religion and outward profeſſion, when they want the internal life, and the motions of the Holy Spirit; if they bring forth the curſed fruits of the fleſh, enmity, wrath, luſt and corruption, which belong to the fallen nature and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate?</p>
            <p>The apoſtle takes notice of this deceit and hypocriſy in religion, which was growing up before he died; <hi>men having a form of godlineſs, and denying the power thereof, from ſuch turn away.</hi> If there be any brethren <hi>that walk diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, have no company or fellowſhip with them,</hi> if you would have the holy name of Jeſus free from ſcandal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:020309_0116_0FAEF93285CD4290"/>This hath been the deſign of all the faithful miniſters of Chriſt, to keep their holy profeſſion of the name of Chriſt free from reproach; that the holineſs of God's ways might be ſeen in the holy lives of the profeſſors of them. Till men come to know this, and take up their daily croſs, and exerciſe ſelf-denial, their Chriſtianity is good for nothing; I would not have you truſt in it; neither in articles, tenets, or obſervations; but ſee how with your lives you anſwer your profeſſion: Chriſt was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſinners.</hi> And why ſhould not Chriſtians be ſo too? How can Chriſtians be followers of Chriſt, and not ſeparate from ſinners? Chriſt was ſo. He went one way, and ſinners went another; they followed their ſins and luſts, but he followed the work his heavenly father ſent him <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. If thou art a follower of Chriſt, thou art worthy of the name of a Chriſtian. Do drunkards and ſwearers follow Chriſt? Do the wanton and proud follow him? Do the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and hypocrites follow him? you know they do not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why do you call them Chriſtians? This is a reproach and ſhame to the holy name of Jeſus, and to true Chriſtianity, that any of theſe folks ſhould be called Chriſtians, but ſuch as are followers of Chriſt, who are <hi>holy, harmleſs and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and ſeparate from ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems a ſtrange kind of doctrine, yet if it had been preached in the primitive time, there were people that would have received it as apoſtolical doctrine, that a man ſhould crucify the fleſh with the affections and luſts: For ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>mortify your members which are on earth; if <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> through the ſpirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhalt live; but if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die. And to be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace.</hi> This was ſound doctrine then.</p>
            <p>Now come and tell a man he ſhall certainly periſh and come to damnation for all his profeſſion, if he does not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the deeds of the fleſh; if he lives in ſin and dies in it, he is like to periſh: How many have been hauled to gaols and dungeons, only for preaching this doctrine, and when we were firſt ſent to preach, we durſt not do otherwiſe? And God did not ſend us to preach till he had waſhed us, and ſanctified us, and fitted us for the work of the miniſtry.

Now when we ſaw in the holy ſcriptures, that God did work upon others by his Spirit, before he ſent them to preach the goſpel, was not here ſufficient authority given to preach the downfal of ſin, and deſtruction of it? One would think that ſuch a one, thus called and ſent of God, had as good authority to preach the everlaſting goſpel, as the laws enacted by all the princes of the world could give him; a man ſure that hath an authority for preaching the goſpel, would not need to wait for orders and approbation; he would not ſtay for an induction. The apoſtle Paul took it for a commiſſion that was creditable, when he tells you of his miſſion, <hi>it was not by man, but by the will of God,</hi> that he was called to preach the goſpel. If we ſhould ſay we were made preachers, if you ask by whom, not any man in the world can tell you; but we were made preachers many years ago: Not by man, or by the authority of man, but by the will of God. What was your commiſſion? to turn men from darkneſs (that darkneſs we had formerly lived in) <hi>to turn them from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> The apoſtle ſums up his commiſſion in a few words; the Lord told me <hi>I muſt turn men from darkneſs to light.</hi> This is our commiſſion that we have received from God in this age, to turn men from darkneſs.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, that we have not human learning and qualifications for the work of the miniſtry: To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if I heard a man ſwear or tell a lie, I could tell him that this was not of God, I have learning enough to know, and tell men that, and ſay, whoring, drunkenneſs, and ſwearing, and lying, were works of the fleſh, and fruits of the devil's power; I would have you turn from theſe works to the power of God. What is that power of God? I will tell you, it is a manifeſtation of grace in your hearts, that will draw you away from the love of all theſe things; the grace of God, is the power of God to ſalvation to them that believe: <hi>To as many as received Chriſt, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God; to ſuch as believed in his name.</hi> Such Chriſtians will ſhew forth the power and life of religion in their converſations: So that here is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authority, no want of authority.</p>
            <p>I have been ſometimes examined by what authority do
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:020309_0118_0FAEF9339E92FB08"/>
you preach? By the higheſt authority in Heaven and earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the authority of God that came by Chriſt, the Redeemer. What do you preach? Truth in the inward parts, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and truth, and againſt all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>As long as Antichriſt hath a rule, you muſt not preach down ſin without authority; you muſt have power, you muſt be ordained, and have an induction before you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to preach the goſpel, and preach down ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The devil hath got ſuch power and rule, that ſome tell us, that no man can live without ſin; if it pleaſe God here and there to raiſe a man and bring him to a holy and righteous life, this man wants a patent, a commiſſion, an induction, an ordinance to preach and cry down ſin in other folks; what commiſſion had the Pſalmiſt when he ſaid, <hi>Come, all ye that fear the Lord, and I will tell you what he hath done for my ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not high time for people that have evidences of the love of God ſhed abroad upon their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, to bear their teſtimony againſt ſin and wickedneſs? Is it not high time for every one's mouth to be open, to teſtify againſt ſuch a horrible miſt of darkneſs that is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> over men; to teſtify againſt hypocriſy, uncleanneſs, and unrighteouſneſs?</p>
            <p>It was the great deſign of the primitive preachers of the goſpel, to cry down that which ſome miniſters cry up, ſo that Chriſtianity is not like what it was, for then they told them that there was no happineſs but by breaking off <hi>from ſin by repentance.</hi> No poſſibility of ſalvation without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and forſaking ſin, and truſting in the mercy of God through Chriſt for the pardon of it. Tell them of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and the blood of Chriſt, they will tell you that they cannot be cleanſed from all ſin, they cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin. How comes it to paſs that there are miniſters that preach an impoſſibility of living without ſin, when we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="119" facs="unknown:020309_0119_0FAEF934645335A8"/>
as to ſay a man may live without ſin? I will prove it from good authority, both from ſcripture and the fathers, that no man in the world can do it.</p>
            <p>If any ſet themſelves to it in their own ſtrength, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will make fools of them; ſome indeed have gone about it in their own power and will, and have cloiſtered themſelves up in monaſteries, and ſhut themſelves up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two walls, that they might be ſeparated from all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and live without ſin; they would do it in their own power, and the devil is ſtronger than they.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you, men of the greateſt wiſdom, courage and ſtrength, of the moſt excellent natural parts that any man can have, are not able to grapple with their enemy the devil by their own power; there are ſeeds of ſin, and luſt, and concupiſcence ſown in all their hearts; ſo far this is right and ſound doctrine, that no man can do any thing in his own power and ſtrength. But here is the miſtake; a man hath been a long time wreſtling with his ſins and luſts, to get the victory over them; but by woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience he finds his weakneſs and inſufficiency; he is ſunk in his harneſs, and ſo hath given over the battle, ſaying, I ſhall never overcome the devil and his temptations, my ſins and luſts are too hard for me, I deſpair of ever over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming them in my own ſtrength, by all that I can do; that is true enough, but muſt thou needs periſh becauſe thou canſt never overcome thy corruptions? If ever I be ſaved, it muſt be the free grace of God, that muſt ſave me. How canſt thou come to lay hold of the free grace of God? I am told I muſt lay hold on Chriſt by faith, who is the Mediator between God and man, and is my only Redeemer; there is no ſalvation in any other: This is very well; now thou art a believer, what doſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, what doſt thou hope that Chriſt will give thee? He will not give me power over my corruptions, ſo as to live without ſin, that is more than I hope for; but I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that Chriſt will reveal his power in me, and give me ſo much ſtrength and power againſt my luſts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they may not have dominion over me: Now if you tell me that you hope for ſtrength and power from Chriſt againſt ſin, ſatan and corruption, do you now tell
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:020309_0120_0FAEF935434664E8"/>
me that it is ſtill impoſſible? It was impoſſible before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to live without ſin, when thou didſt truſt in thine own ſtrength; but now, when thou comeſt to have grace and aſſiſtance from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Son of God, and Saviour of the world,</hi> that giveth thee ability to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand temptation, and overcome thy corruptions, and the luſts of thy own heart, is it impoſſible ſtill to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin? Then thou mayeſt ſay, the devil's ſlave I am and muſt be; for there is no other power in Heaven or earth for thee to lay hold of, if thine own power, nor Chriſt's power neither can do; then thou doſt ſay, that the devil is Almighty. Thus they tell us, when Chriſt hath revealed his power, it is impoſſible ſtill.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould call this antichriſtian doctrine, I could make it out. Bleſſed be God, I do believe that Chriſt is able to preſerve me from the devil's temptations, and all his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if I believe; though I could not do it in mine own power, yet by Chriſt's power I may be preſerved an hour without ſin: If ſo, then a day, and if one day, then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand days, if I live ſo long; Chriſt hath promiſed that he will <hi>bruiſe Satan, and tread him under feet,</hi> and deſtroy his works, and judge you whether ſin be not the devil's work; ſhall I deſpond, or deſpair to have the devil's work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in me?</p>
            <p>Here is ground for you all to believe, he that hath faith may lay hold of this power which is offered of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay hold of it, elſe your religion will be good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This is the enjoyment of a true believer, that he receives power from Chriſt to deny himſelf; therefore all their pretended Chriſtianity and profeſſions at the day of judgment, will melt away like ſnow. Theſe canons, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, forms, liturgies, theſe will melt away when the day of the Lord comes to burn upon them; none but they that feel the redeeming virtues of the blood of Chriſt, that have their ſouls filled with the love of God; and they that will part with whatſoever they love in the world, for Chriſt's ſake, ſhall be accepted.</p>
            <p>I am not for ſetting up this and the other ſect or opinion; if it be among thoſe of my own profeſſion, if they profeſs holineſs, and bring forth unrighteouſneſs, it is all one; I
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:020309_0121_0FAEF935D5425260"/>
ſhall not value their profeſſion. There are many in this city and nation, that have ſheltered themſelves under the profeſſion of truth, and talk of perfection, and have brought their luſts and imperfections with them: Here Antichriſt is trying another game to bring them under a profeſſion that will ſerve his turn; the devil will allow men profeſſion, if they will live according to their own hearts luſts, ſo that they may ſave his head from the blow that God's power will bring upon it, ſo that they may diſhonor the holy name and religion they make profeſſion of; thus faith the apoſtle, <hi>I have told you often, and now tell you weeping;</hi> they were Chriſtians, ſo called, to whom he ſpake, but <hi>they were enemies to the croſs of Chriſt,</hi> not to the profeſſion of Chriſt; he did not ſay they were ſtrangers to the croſs of Chriſt, but enemies to it; they let it fall, they kept the name, word and doctrine up, but they let the croſs fall; how much were theſe Chriſtians worth? ſure but a little.</p>
            <p>Nay, Antichriſt hath been ſo ſilly, that becauſe the words are ſo put upon the croſs, no being diſciples of Chriſt without the croſs; the words of ſcripture are ſo put upon it. Thinks Antichriſt, I ſhall never perſuade the people to be at eaſe, unleſs I give them a croſs; therefore he ſets them a making croſſes. They muſt be baptized with the croſs; they ſay we deny not the croſs of Chriſt, we hang it about our necks, we ſet it up in our meetings and acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and many princes, and wiſe men, and learned men, have been ſo bewitched and drunk with deluſions, that they have called this the Chriſt which they have made with their own hands; they have made Chriſts, and prayed to them; and all their religion hath been putting together croſſes, crucifixes, forms and liturgies, which they have made with their own hands.</p>
            <p>Here is Chriſtianity in an empty profeſſion, but where is the ſoul of it? I would enquire for the life of it, I would ſee Chriſtianity living in love to God above all, and loving our neighbours as ourſelves. When this Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity comes, there will be no killing one another, nor perſecuting one another, nor fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, nor pleading for it neither.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, that our eyes have ſeen the witneſſes
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:020309_0122_0FAEF93989F404F8"/>
raiſed, and life from Heaven come into them; and now religion begins to have a life and ſoul, and ſhews itſelf in a little remnant: There is a people raiſed by God that feel life in their worſhip, in their families, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, and in their behaviour towards relations, they do what they do as to God. Many lads and laſſes, men-ſervants and women-ſervants, they do their work and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, not barely to pleaſe their maſter and miſtreſs, but to pleaſe God. <hi>The life they live is by the faith of the Son of God;</hi> they live as becomes the members of his body. Huſbands love their wives, not ſimply becauſe they are their wives, as the men of the world do, but they do it upon the account of inward religion, and of the divine fellowſhip and communion they have in Chriſt Jeſus. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſhould love their wives as Chriſt loved his church, and laid down his life for it; ſo a man ſhould love his wife, and be tender over her, and miniſter to her.</p>
            <p>The life of Chriſtianity hath taught us to behave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo as God may have glory, and Chriſtianity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to its ancient luſtre and beauty that it had in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, do as well as you can, men will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver love you; if you have the ſoul of Chriſtianity, you ſhall be reviled and ſcandalized. Men will make works againſt you, and ſtrow papers againſt you, and ſet the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates againſt you; live as well as you can, they will follow you and diſturb you.</p>
            <p>This is more than you know. If a man once comes to feel the life of Chriſtianity working in him, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it keeping him from doing evil, and wiſhing evil to his enemies, and diſpoſing his mind to a frame of praying for them, inclining him to pity them; if a man comes to this ſtate, he is at peace in himſelf, and enjoys tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of mind; he looks up to the Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus, and feels an anſwer of peace in his own ſoul, and is come to reſt in himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now concerning perſecution, hatred and enmity, between the woman's ſeed and the ſerpentine ſeed, and how long it will laſt. God whom we ſerve, did ſay to the devil in Paradiſe, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:020309_0123_0FAEF939A8475B08"/>
and between thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> So that it is not to be expected, that the ſeed of the ſerpent (thoſe that are born of that ſeed) can love thoſe that are born of the woman's ſeed. It is poſſible, that thoſe that are born of the ſeed of the ſerpent, ſhould be tranſlated and brought out of that corrupt ſtate; but it is impoſſible that thoſe that are <hi>born of the fleſh, ſhould love thoſe that are born of the ſpirit,</hi> while they continue in their unregenerate ſtate, but perſecute them. It is like a natural inſtinct, as for water to run downward, and fire to fly upward. Were not all men and women born children of wrath, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enemies in their minds to Chriſt Jeſus? And did he not die and ſuffer for them all? So that the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing is the very reaſon why Chriſt died to redeem thoſe that were his enemies to be his friends.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I, or any other to be a member of Chriſt, and men do perſecute me, and revile me, and hate me, ſhould I not love them, and do good unto them, when I ſee one infinitely better than either you or I, do it for us? <hi>when we were enemies, Chriſt hath ſent his Spirit into our hearts,</hi> that we might become friends of him, and of him that ſent him: This is the effect of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and of his innocence, that enemies may become friends; thus have many been brought to a friendſhip of truth, that were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to it; if we could not ſuffer for the teſtimony we have received of God, what were it worth? But ſeeing God hath not only given us to believe, but to ſuffer for his name, many have been turned by this means from darkneſs to light, and many more will; the light breaks forth apace, notwithſtanding there hath been ſo much ado to ſtop it.</p>
            <p>It hath been the deſign of many learned men of this nation, how ſhall we ſtop theſe men's mouths that preach the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of truth in the inward parts, the light within, and Chriſt within them? I will not repeat the many laws that have been made againſt them that will not preach lies, but the power of Chriſt and his truth; now what will you do? You cannot lay hand on them as you uſed to do; no, but we will reproach them with the tongue, we will render them odious to the government, as perſons that wil over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:020309_0124_0FAEF93B24660DE0"/>
turn church and ſtate, and that preach falſe doctrine; and when all is done, and they have ſaid their worſt, people will ſtill believe that ſin and wickedneſs is hateful to God, that God takes no delight in ſin, and that the devil will lead us to ſin; he that keeps moſt from ſin, keeps moſt out of the devil's clutches; and he that lives moſt holy, is moſt like to God.</p>
            <p>Theſe things we will preach, and we will go on in this teſtimony, that the beſt way that man can take, is to break off their ſin by repentance, and turn to God, their Maker, with their whole hearts, and they will look to their ways, and ſearch, and try and examine their hearts, and if they ſee evil, to keep out of it; this is ſuch a thing, as there is no withſtanding of it, it will go through this nation, and all the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>What if a company of people ſhould combine together, and ſay, we will not have the ſun to ſhine upon the city of <hi>London;</hi> what courſe muſt we take? When the ſun is down, we will build a bank or high wall to intercept its light; but notwithſtanding all their endeavours, when the ſun riſeth, it will get over their high banks and wall; ſo all their deſigns, and all the contrivances againſt the light of the goſpel, and againſt Chriſt the Son of righteouſneſs, and againſt the Spirit of Chriſt, the light will aſcend and get over the heads of them all, and it will confound them, and break through all oppoſition.</p>
            <p>I exhort you all, my friends, that laying aſide all doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and tenets, and contrivances among Chriſtians, as come to this ſimple <hi>theſis</hi> and <hi>poſition;</hi> it is no matter what I profeſs of <hi>religion,</hi> if my life is not anſwerable to it, if there be not a love to God, and my neighbour, and to mine own ſoul; there is no life nor power in my profeſſion of religion. I will reſt ſatisfied in the meaſure of knowledge that God hath given me; I muſt not do to my neighbour what I would not have my neighbour do to me; I muſt be upright and ſincere towards God; God will not accept of any worſhip from me, when I am unclean in body and in mind too; we muſt ſee that we be purified, for God will not accept of an offering from an unclean heart; <hi>you cannot bring a clean thing out of an unclean,</hi> ſaith our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:020309_0125_0FAEF93C86940D30"/>
Chriſt, the great preacher of truth and righteouſneſs; I muſt <hi>firſt make the tree good, before the fruit will be ſo;</hi> you and I are theſe trees; till we have ſomething good in ourſelves, we cannot bring forth good fruit.</p>
            <p>Therefore you muſt have reſpect to the principle of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification in your own hearts, and turn to what you may feel an experience of in yourſelves, ſome principle of grace and light in your hearts, that can diſtinguiſh between good thoughts and evil thoughts. Is this good for me to do? I will go on in it with faith and courage; but if it be evil, I will not touch it, though there be profit and pleaſure to allure and draw me to it; I will not touch it, though I might gain the world by it.</p>
            <p>Here is Chriſtianity with life and ſoul in it; we have been ſcandalized as if we preached up error for juſtification: We ſay there is no juſtification without ſanctification; ſo you that know the power, live in it; and you that deſire to know, turn your minds to the light and grace of God, and you will feel the power that will oppoſe ſin in its motion, and it will never trouble you in its act and workings. If I would not do ill to my neighbour, and I judge ſuch a motion when it is ſuggeſted, it will never trouble my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe when the devil moved me to it, I rejected it, I would not follow him. It is no ſin to be tempted; for our Saviour, that was perfectly holy, and free from all ſin, was yet tempted; he had motions in his mind, but he withſtood them, and reſiſted the devil in all his temptations; Chriſt was tempted that he might be able to ſuccour us when we are tempted; and he will do it for all thoſe that wait for him.</p>
            <p>Therefore, friends, truſt in the name of the Lord, and you ſhall feel the ſtirrings of that power, that <hi>hath called you out of darkneſs into the marvellous light</hi> of the ſun of righteouſneſs wherein you live, and which will ſhine to his immortal glory and praiſe, and the everlaſting comfort of your immortal ſouls.</p>

            <p>YOU that are met together in the name of the Lord, and have your expectation from God, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally waiting to receive a bleſſing from his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful hand; you are they to whom the Lord will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the good things of his kingdom, and inſtruct you in the divine knowledge which the wiſdom of this world cannot find out; you ſhall have your portion in the bleſſings prepared for you, and laid up in Chriſt for you, to be handed forth to you from day to day for your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. And hereby you have been preſerved and kept alive unto this day. You have received your nouriſhment, and divine and ſpiritual refreſhment, always in the preſence of God; when you have been out of his preſence you have met with troubles, and darkneſs hath gendered upon your minds, and veiled and clouded your underſtandings, that you have been ſometimes in danger to loſe your way, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you have returned again unto the <hi>great ſhepherd <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>For there are a great many that are convinced, that do yet want eſtabliſhment: There are a great many that know the truth, yet cannot be brought to abide in it, but are ſometimes drawn out of it, and then they meet with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their minds, and <hi>diſtreſs and anguiſh lay hold upon them,</hi> and they do not enjoy that tranquillity and peace, and that inward joy which they believe others do enjoy at the ſame time; and which they might have enjoyed if they had abode ſtedfaſt in the truth. Now what is it that will eſtabliſh ſuch a one, but their waiting upon God
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:020309_0127_0FAEF93D5F562FB0"/>
to receive power from him to reſiſt the temptations, and the manifold wiles and ſnares of their ſoul's enemy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are daily in danger to be drawn away from God; drawn out of the way?</p>
            <p>You know, friends, how the Lord brought us into this exerciſe of waiting upon him, by making us ſenſible that there was none could help us but him. Teachers we have always had, and men that have ſpoken of God, ſpoken of his power, and ſpoken of his wiſdom; but how to dwell in that power, and ſtand eſtabliſhed in it, ſo as at all times to reſiſt the power of the wicked one, is what no man can help us to; and upon this account it was, that the Lord's people were fain to cleave cloſe to him, and by faith to have their dependence upon him; and cry in their ſouls, Lord, unleſs thou eſtabliſh me, I ſhall never be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The confirming power that ſtays and ſettles their minds upon the Lord, it comes from him, it is handed to us through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom we have believed in; they that kept their faith in him have had longings and breathings of ſoul, that they might receive ſome divine bleſſings by him, and through him. So that they that meet together in this mind, they find a ſettlement in the truth, as it is manifeſted and revealed in them, and goes down into the deep where unity is known, where they are of one mind, and the ſoul is made capable of putting forth ſtrong cries to God, and living breathings and prayers to God, that he will teach them how they ſhall profit, how they ſhall grow, how they ſhall ſerve him, and honour him in their day; that he will reveal his power in them, to expel any darkneſs or veil that hath been gathered upon their minds, that doth hinder them from beholding ſo much glory and excellency in the truth, and in the ways of God, as ſome they have beheld. And ſo theſe are travellers that are tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling with the Lord in faith, to receive a bleſſing at his hands. Their minds are not left to this, or that, or the other man, or to meer words or viſible things; but they feel the word of truth anſwering the truth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and they receive a comfort and benefit, becauſe they find a bleſſing to ariſe in them. Theſe words reach my
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:020309_0128_0FAEF93E16D667B0"/>
ſoul; theſe adminiſter help to me, and I am comforted in them, becauſe I find thoſe works working in me, or wrought in me.</p>
            <p>For, alas! my friends, many of you know, that there are ſome who hear the word, and the declarations in the word are but ſounds unto thoſe who have no experience of the work that is ſignified by the word; many ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do hear the lovely ſound, and they are affected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to hear talk of the work of regeneration, and of the enjoyments of God's people, and how they are borne up in all their trials by an inward and divine power, and how they are always kept alive to God, and preſerved in his living preſence; but this doth not bear them up in a time of trial; but if a trial or an affliction comes, they ſink under it, and they are filled with anguiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity; ſo that the word barely heard ſpoken, and not rooted in the mind, doth not miniſter to the work; the words ſpoken do not carry that kind of operation upon them as to witneſs an inward work wrought upon them.</p>
            <p>But where there is an effectual work and operation in the ſoul, it continues in its labour and travel from death to life. And as thoſe heavenly things, thoſe divine operations of God's power are ſpoken of, there is an <hi>amen</hi> in your ſouls, ſaying as far as you have travelled, thus hath God dealt with me, he hath indeed by his power carried ſome beyond my ſtate and condition, and my faith is hereby ſtrengthened, and my hope is confirmed. He that hath begun a good work ſo gloriouſly in my ſoul, will carry on his own work, and bring me to higher attainments, and further experiences that ſome of his ſervants bear witneſs of.</p>
            <p>So that now being exerciſed, the work goes on, and <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord proſpereth in Chriſtians,</hi> that when they meet together <hi>in the name of the Lord,</hi> they know for themſelves that the Lord is preſent with them, they know what the word of the Lord is unto them; if they hear the word preached to another ſtate and condition, yet they abide in and keep that which makes manifeſt to them in their own ſtate: And this ſuffers not the ſoul to be carried away with the word, and ſight and viſion of a higher ſtate than their faith can witneſs to; and they keep low, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:020309_0129_0FAEF93ECF0F1270"/>
and tender, and have a care of their own ſouls; as the apoſtle when he was come to glorious and high attainments in the work of the Lord, yet he would not <hi>glory of any thing,</hi> but what the grace of God wrought in him: We do not boaſt of things that are not wrought in us.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible for the creature to gather in, and comprehend the form of things, that they have not the work of in them; and a great many have done ſo to their great damage, and ſome, it is to be feared, to their utter ruin. They have comprehended high things, and the notions of great attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they have heard them declared and ſpoken of thus, and ſo ſome have in their ſpeculations declared to others their conceptions about thoſe things, yet thoſe things were never wrought in them; they could preach of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, when the root of pride was not removed; they could preach of regeneration, and the <hi>old man not put off,</hi> and the <hi>new man created in righteouſneſs not put on.</hi> All this kind of preaching hath been in the world, and is ſtill too much in the world, but it hath not produced and brought forth any profit and advantage to the ſoul, either to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or hearer; for it hath not been accompanied with a divine and heavenly bleſſing; but the true miniſtry ordained of God brings forth a work of holineſs and righteouſneſs in the ſoul.</p>
            <p>And therefore every one that God hath thus reached, and hath opened your underſtandings, and hath made you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of comprehending and underſtanding divine things, take heed leſt by the ſubtlety of Satan, and the wiles of your great enemy, you be at any time lifted up, and exalted in your minds, in the notion of the things that you have not attained; not that you ſhould not ſo underſtand the things of God that God openeth to you, as they are many times opened to the creature, before the work of them is in the heart of the creature: And why ſo? why are they opened to me? It is for thy encouragement, that if thou doſt hold on, and be ſtedfaſt in waiting upon the Lord, theſe things God hath in ſtore for thee.</p>
            <p>Now the creature waits, and ſaith, though I have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch things as I have ſeen, yet the very ſight of them encourageth me to wait upon the Lord, that I may expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:020309_0130_0FAEF93F8CADBE28"/>
the witneſs of them in myſelf: There are many that have ſome taſte of great joy, and apprehenſions of heavenly things, which they have not attained, but they know what they are waiting upon God for; not that they may have a little joy, which paſſeth through them, but come to have that joy and tranquillity which will accompany them in all their doings, and their whole converſation. God hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many things to you, and you have ſeen the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which he hath caſt up for you; and many have taken ſtrait ſteps to themſelves, till they have attained to ſay, <hi>now my ſalvation is nearer than when I at firſt believed.</hi> Let ſuch go on and follow that guide by which they have been directed, and they ſhall at laſt attain to a further ſtate, not only to know that their ſalvation is now nearer than when they at firſt believed, but that they may come through the Divine Spirit of grace that they followed, and ſo cloſely cleaved to, as their bleſſed guide in their way, to have an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance adminiſtered to them abundantly into the ſalvation of God, whereby they may ſit down, in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, and have a wall about them, which is the ſalvation of God.</p>
            <p>Here is a great encouragement for ſinners, and upright ones, <hi>to follow on to know the Lord,</hi> and then they are ſure they ſhall know him, for they ſhall behold his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and their ſouls ſhall be ſatisfied, for nothing elſe will ſatisfy them.</p>
            <p>People may have great openings, and great diſcoveries of things, and may have delight and joy in the opening of things, as it was with the diſciples, when Chriſt our Lord converſed with them in the fleſh; he opened many things to them, and they had great joy and comfort in thoſe things which he opened to them, yet there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to ſuffice them. <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid unto Chriſt, <hi>Lord ſhew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us: John</hi> xiv, 8. There was ſomething further to be diſcovered and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that they could not find their ſouls to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſufficed, till they had it. Chriſt gave them ſuch an anſwer as relates to that miniſtration that we are now under; <hi>he that hath ſeen the Son, hath ſeen the Father.</hi> Now they had ſeen Chriſt daily, and converſed with him,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:020309_0131_0FAEF941B04F5AF8"/>
and had eat and drank with him in that fleſhly and bodily appearance wherein he converſed with them; but they had not a ſight of the Eternal Son of God in a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he was the Son of God, and their Saviour; they had not ſeen him ſo. And he that hath ſeen Chriſt in a ſpiritual manner, hath ſeen the Father alſo.</p>
            <p>So it is with us in our day. We have, in our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the teaching of this and that man. We have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Chriſt, as it were, to his fleſhly appearance. We have read the hiſtory of his birth, and of his life and great miracles, and of the great love he had to mankind, by which he laid down his life for them. We have been converſing with Chriſt as to his fleſhly manifeſtation; but conſider whether there doth not, till now, remain an empty place in our ſouls, ſomething that is not ſufficed and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied?</p>
            <p>What would you have? Have you not ſcripture? Read you not there of the birth, life, death, reſurrection and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt? I would ſtill have ſomething more, for that will not ſuffice me; I would have pardon of ſin, and my peace with God, <hi>and the light of his countenance lifted up upon me,</hi> and further manifeſtations of Chriſt to my ſoul. We can never ſee the glory of God, but in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. This is the diſcovery that Chriſt makes to the ſoul that believeth in him; this is that which gives ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian's work is to be converſing with him, and exerciſing his mind under the gathering and teaching of him, that can lead him to the Father. None but Chriſt can do that, lead them to the Father, and ſhew them the Father; and he hath in our day revealed himſelf, and made himſelf manifeſt by his ſpirit, that ſpirit, by which we come to know his holy teaching, reproof and inſtruction, daily diſcovered in our ſouls. The ſpirit is our guide; that ſpirit we are led by, and are to walk in. Let men go under what form and denomination they will, <hi>they that have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, are none of his,</hi> until they come to be guided by his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>People are not led into ſin by the ſpirit of Chriſt; they will tell you theſe are the devil's temptations, and
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:020309_0132_0FAEF9430C159CD8"/>
the frailty of our nature, and the corruption of our hearts, by which we are led into ſin; it is not the ſpirit of Chriſt. It would be a horrid thing for men to ſay that the ſpirit of Chriſt led them into ſin; there are few or none ſo wicked as to ſay ſo. The buſineſs we are to do in the world is, to obey the will of God: And where the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of men are ſo illuminated, that they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in their minds, that God hath been pleaſed to give them a manifeſtation of the ſpirit to profit withal; all thoſe that have this ſpirit of Chriſt, are directed by it to do the will of God, and to deny their own wills, and the will of others, that would draw them from their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they owe to God in their generation.</p>
            <p>It is an excellent ſtate and condition for a man to be guided by the ſpirit, and to be brought under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, who is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> So that they that come under this government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are directed and pointed out every day to do the will of God. This thou muſt do, and God will be pleaſed with thee; and this thou mayeſt not do, for if thou doeſt it, the Lord will be angry with thee; it is ſin againſt God. So that we have a heavenly advantage of being taught of God by his ſpirit, to have the divine and heavenly teaching of the ſpirit of God revealed in us; if we are at a loſs, or make a queſtion, or diſpute about a matter, the <hi>ſpirit will look us into all truth,</hi> if we give up ourſelves to his guidance and teaching.</p>
            <p>This hath been our deſire and labour many years, not to draw people to obſerve what we ſay; for who can direct another man in all things relating to the ſervice of God? If we were ever ſo certain ourſelves, we could not convey certainty and infallibility upon all occaſions to another, if we ſhould ſpeak ever ſo much, and be ever ſo converſant with them. Therefore our work is, that all people, in all things relating to their ſouls, might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe continually to the infallible teacher and guide, which God, through Jeſus Chriſt, hath made known to them. If people be ruled by this, they cannot but live in unity, and love one another; they will not fall into malice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and hatred one againſt another. It is impoſſible
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:020309_0133_0FAEF943C5D940E0"/>
for nations to make war, and deſtroy one another, if they would be guided by the unerring ſpirit of Chriſt; for how ſhould it contradict itſelf? For how can any thing agree with the ſtandard of truth, which Chriſt hath ſet up, that acts in contradiction to it? For nothing is truth but what concurs with it; therefore it muſt needs agree with itſelf. If we be directed by the ſpirit, we ſhall call that good which is really good; and that evil which is ſo. If there be thouſands directed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, which leads into all truth, that which is good to one, is ſo to all; and that which is evil to one, is ſo to all. We muſt firſt know what is good, and then receive power to do it. If we come to be inſtructed by the unerring ſpirit, <hi>to know what is the good and acceptable will of God,</hi> we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive daily power from him to do the will of God; we ſhall all ſpeak the ſame thing, and be of the ſame mind, and live in love and unity. There is no evil wilfully done againſt God, where the ſpirit of Chriſt, the goſpel ſpirit, comes to prevail upon us; it will bring us to a peaceableneſs of ſpirit, to live in love and unity. And the great work we have in the world, will be to do the good and acceptable will of God, both with reſpect to our ſolemn worſhip of God, and our duties towards our neighbours. Then there will be tranquillity, peace and joy, and comfort to all the churches of Chriſt that are under his government. And it is given to the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men every where, when they come under the yoke of Chriſt, and take up a daily croſs, and live in ſelf-denial; this will bring peace and concord among them.</p>
            <p>Many will come to our meetings, and ſpend a little time to hear what we ſay. We exhort them to give up themſelves to the peaceable government of the ſpirit of Chriſt, that <hi>will finiſh tranſgreſſion, and make an end of ſin,</hi> and bring into the ſoul (where ſin reigned) <hi>everlaſting righteouſneſs.</hi> Where there is a great deal of pride, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and envy, the ſpirit of Chriſt will root it up; and all that evil that the enemy hath planted in men, he will pluck it up, and bring in <hi>everlaſting righteouſneſs,</hi> and plant love in the ſame ſoul, and eſtabliſh and ſettle it. Such a one will have more joy, pleaſure and delight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:020309_0134_0FAEF9440E90AEF8"/>
the government of the ſpirit of Chriſt in one day, than any one can have that is governed by the evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in a thouſand days.</p>
            <p>You ſay <hi>the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal;</hi> what profit ſhall we get? How doth it appear, that the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withal? Becauſe there is that life and grace ſtirring in the heart that makes it profitable, and truth doth ſo prevail, that it makes us do thoſe things that are good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and to avoid thoſe things that are reprovable. If thou wouldeſt hearken to the ſpirit, that is the reprover, that convinceth of ſin, thou muſt turn away thy mind from that which will lead into thoſe things that are reproveable, otherwiſe thou wilt be under condemnation in thine own boſom.</p>
            <p>When the Spirit of God illuminates men to ſee ſin, the evil of ſin, he will give them power againſt it; but when they come to receive power againſt it, and ſtedfaſtneſs in the ways of God, what will be the effect of that? If I become righteous, and live a holy life, and my companions be wicked, they will mock me, and reproach me, what benefit ſhall I have by being righteous? I ſee evidently I ſhall loſe many advantages which I might otherwiſe reap, and reach with mine own hand. I muſt forſake my profits and pleaſure, and other delights of this world.</p>
            <p>The diſciples ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>we have forſaken all, and followed thee;</hi> what ſhall we have? People before they would forſake all would have ſomething in the room of it. Chriſt tells them, <hi>that he that hath forſaken all, father and mother, brother and ſiſter, and houſe and land, for his name ſake, ſhall have in this life an hundred fold, and in the world to come, eternal life.</hi> What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that, they ſhall have in this life an hundred fold? Chriſt that is truth itſelf, that cannot lie, hath promiſed, that they that forſake all, ſhall receive an hundred fold: Now people are ready to graſp at it; they think it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will anſwer the loſs of what they part withal; what thou receiveſt in this promiſe, muſt not be of the ſame ſort and kind with thoſe things thou didſt part withal; but when thou haſt parted with all for Chriſt's ſake, and the goſpel,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:020309_0135_0FAEF944F75EF510"/>
thou ſhalt receive that which thou ſhalt acknowledge is an hundred fold better, and will make thee an hundred fold richer and happier, and it will give thee an hundred fold more than all that thou haſt parted with could give thee.</p>
            <p>If we part with ſin, we part with that which brings bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and fear of death; having parted with that, then thy fear and bondage is gone, and thou liveſt then the reſt of thy life-time at liberty: But this is not all, thou liveſt in the enjoyment of the favour of God, thou ſhalt have the ſenſe of his love, and the comfort of his Holy Spirit, and you ſhall live in peace and righteouſneſs, and <hi>treaſure up to yourſelves glory, honour, immortality, and eternal life;</hi> whereas before you did <hi>treaſure up only wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</hi> thou ſhalt receive an hundred fold, that which is an hundred fold better. Thoſe that part with the things that are reprovable, and do what Chriſt in his day performed, the good and acceptable will of God, the enjoyments that he hath in Chriſt, and the comfort, peace and tranquillity he enjoys, is an hundred fold better and more delightful than all the pleaſures of ſin, and the pleaſures and delights of ſhows, and ſights and plays, and comedies, which vain men entertain themſelves with in their carnal ſtate. A carnal man cannot underſtand and diſcern the things of God, and the pleaſures that are to be had in his holy ways; he only looks <hi>at the things that are ſeen, which are temporal, and not at the things that are not ſeen, which are eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, my friends, thoſe things which are unſeen, are not ſo unſeen, but that when a man hath an eye opened within him of the ſame nature with thoſe things, he can ſee them: Bleſſed be God that we have an eye opened to ſee ſpiritual things, to ſee the heavenly treaſure, and enjoy it in theſe earthen veſſels.</p>
            <p>For all that have an ear to hear, it would be a profitable change to part with all that is evil in the ſight of God, and put themſelves under the yoke of Chriſt, and receive a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace which he will communicate to them, that they may do the good and acceptable will of God, and ſo may enjoy an hundred fold, and have comfort, peace, and joy before they go hence, and are no more ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:020309_0136_0FAEF945A3236068"/>You to whom God hath ſo graciouſly and mercifully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that have an underſtanding, and a taſte and feeling of thoſe things which are divine and ſpiritual, <hi>and which pertain to life and godlineſs;</hi> of all the people in the world, you are an engaged people to ſerve the Lord; great obligations lie upon you, that you ſhould abide and continue in that which God hath revealed and diſcovered to you; I mean grace: For you will never grow, till you be under the government of the grace of God, that grace that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to you before you came to the knowledge of God and his ways, that hath been with you in your travel from death to life, and from darkneſs to light. Prize it as a heavenly jewel, as that which contains in itſelf all thoſe things that your ſoul ſtands in need of. If you have any ſtrength to reſiſt temptation, it is from the grace of God that you receive power to withſtand temptations; if you have any living openings in your hearts, it comes to you from that grace that is in Chriſt. When this, and that, and the other prophecy of the prophets of old is opened to you, prophecying and foretelling that ſtate and condition which you are travelling towards, how the Lord will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due your enemies under you, you are encouraged hereby to go on cheerfully in your way, to that reſt which you are travelling to.</p>
            <p>There are many of thoſe that believe the truth, who are not come to eſtabliſhment; and they will find the reaſon and cauſe in themſelves. Do but ask and enquire how it comes to paſs, that ſuch and ſuch are eſtabliſhed, and not ſubject to fear, and horror, and perplexity, as I am? a little thing will turn me over, and ſhake and unſettle my mind; this hath been the cauſe, want of keeping cloſe to the grace of God in your converſation in the world. When you, and your children, and ſervants are governed by the grace of God in all you undertake, then the devil will endeavour to bring you into darkneſs, and bring diſcompoſure upon your ſpirits; for the purpoſe of Chriſt Jeſus, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, is to ſettle you; and the purpoſe of the deſtroyer is, to diſcompoſe and unſettle you, and to marry you to this and the other changing thing; if he can fix your hearts upon this and that object, then there is inſtability
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:020309_0137_0FAEF94655DE30B8"/>
upon the ſoul; take away that thing, and it brings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance upon you. If thou haſt any object that thy mind is ſet upon, thou wilt be much diſturbed at the parting with it; but whoſe fault is that? The truth manifeſted unto thee from the beginning of thy converſion, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage thee to ſeparate thyſelf from all viſible, ſenſible things, that God might have thy heart and chief love. If he had been thy God, nothing could diſquiet thee, when ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from thee. If ye will have other Gods beſides him, you will loſe your Gods; and when they are taken from you, you will be like <hi>Micah,</hi> and ſay, <hi>ye have taken away my Gods, and what have I more?</hi> Judg. viii, 24. The reaſon of your diſcompoſure, and anguiſh, and ſorrow, was this; when you had ſome other Gods beſides the Lord, and your hearts did cleave to ſome temporary thing, and the trial came that you had to part with it, you could not bear it.</p>
            <p>If you would live a ſerene life, a life of tranquillity, ſet your minds upon nothing but upon the Lord, let him be the object of your ſouls love; live in the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and you may always rejoice: Conſider, as for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, you hold them of the Lord; God gives you this huſband, that wife, that child, that eſtate, God hath entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with it? but not ſo, but he that hath it muſt part with it, and be bereaved of it when God pleaſeth. Now, if you give up your hearts to God, here will be your eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and ſettlement, and you will have an <hi>abundant entrance into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And would we ſeek to know and feel wherein the communion of the ſaints ſtands; doth it not ſtand in partaking together of the bread of life, which our father giveth us from Heaven? The father ſpreads a table for us in the ſight of our enemies, and we are ſatisfied. They that come to partake of this table of the Lord, find ſtrength and refreſhment; ſo do I, and alſo my brethren and ſiſters that ſit at the ſame table. We are daily confirmed and ſtrengthened by what we receive from God, and enjoy there; here is our heavenly fellowſhip and ſociety; and where there is this root of love, love cannot be wanting in the branches: There muſt be a departing from the bread of

life, before there can be any jarring and contention among the members of the ſame body, for we receive life from the ſame head, <hi>from which all the body, by joints and bands, having nouriſhment miniſtered, are knit together, and encreaſe with the encreaſe of God, and are built upon the foundation of the apoſtles and prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner-Stone, in whom all the building fitly framed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, groweth unto a Holy Temple in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that you may be all preſerved in Chriſt, this is the end of our labour, that ſo every one that hath begun in the ſpirit, may go on in the ſpirit, and never look for perfection in the fleſh: That you that have begun in humility, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and brokenneſs of heart, may in that meet together at times and ſeaſons, and have daily the preſence of God among you, and have the bread of life, which will nouriſh you to life everlaſting, and that you may ſhew forth to the world, the glory, brightneſs, and excellency of that holy life, which in Chriſt Jeſus is manifeſted to you.</p>

Some have conceived it to ſtand in their own will, and according to the working of their own will, they have framed worſhips, religions, and obſervations, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to pleaſe God: But you know the apoſtle in a few ſhort words, lays down a poſitive Chriſtian doctrine, <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this doth declare and ſignify, that there muſt be ſomething upon which this faith muſt work, that muſt be the object and foundation of it: Faith as it worketh in the creature, worketh upon ſomething; it lays hold on ſomething in which there is a capacity of pleaſing God. Now if <hi>we are all by nature children of wrath,</hi> and that no one of himſelf can pleaſe God, then there muſt be ſomething that is ſupernatural, that muſt be the object of that faith by which men alone can pleaſe God; and this muſt be made manifeſt to the creature for its help, to be its director and ſupporter in that work that is too mighty for himſelf, too great a work for a man or woman, too deep, too profound for any man's abilities, power, wiſdom, and acquirements, that he can attain to in this world, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God aright. To worſhip God, that is to perform a pure worſhip to a pure God; <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> Now if we are all obliged to bring a clean wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, a pure worſhip to a pure and holy God, who hath created us and all things, where ſhall we have it? Not out of an unclean heart, not out of a defiled mind; there is no bringing it forth from thence, for that is the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that men are fallen into by ſin, in which their minds and conſciences are defiled, their hearts are polluted, and their affections depraved and ſet upon wrong objects; and in this ſtate none can ſerve God aright: That which is pure and holy muſt be firſt made known, revealed, diſcovered, and believed, before people can perform a right worſhip to God.</p>
            <p>And therefore in vain is it, to go and drive people to this and that worſhip, and force people to this and that ſervice
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:020309_0140_0FAEF9489E687068"/>
and conformity, upon the account of the worſhip of God. This is vain worſhip; when they have done all, it is not acceptable to God; the poor creature hath no return from the Lord, for God accepts no ſervice or worſhip, but only through his Son. And if ſo be, men cannot pray and preach in the ſpirit of his ſon, and cannot preſent their complaints and ſupplication to God, but by the aſſiſtance and help of his bleſſed Spirit, there is no reaſon in religion why people ſhould expect a return and anſwer from God of the prayers they make. For it is the general doctrine of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> that Chriſt Jeſus is appointed of God for a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, and all the acceptance we have, or deſire to have, muſt be through him: And therefore if we pray without him, and perform this and the other duty without him, it is contrary to the doctrine of Chriſtianity, to think that ever we ſhould have acceptance in God's ſight.</p>
            <p>Therefore there is a neceſſity for every man and woman that deſires to be religious, that hath a religious mind, and is willing to worſhip God, and ſerve God aright, there is a neceſſity that they come to the knowledge of Chriſt, who tells us that he is <hi>the way to the Father.</hi> They that go any other way, go a wrong way; but they that go unto God by Chriſt, they do receive from him power to draw near to God; and through him they receive from God all thoſe bleſſings that their ſouls ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>So here would be an end of all religions the world is full of; of all the ſeveral worſhips that men have made. They have invented and found out ſeveral ways for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to worſhip and ſerve God. This and the other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; this and the other obſervation and method of preaching and praying. If all this be without the aſſiſtance and divine help of the Mediator, through whom alone we can juſtly expect acceptance at God's hands, it is all good for nothing. Therefore the firſt leſſon of a Chriſtian in point of worſhip, is, that he come to the knowledge of Chriſt, by whom, and through whom, he may expect favour with God.</p>
            <p>Now ſome people ſay, we are already come to the knowledge of Chriſt; we have read the relation in the goſpel of his conception, birth, life and death, reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:020309_0141_0FAEF94990190478"/>
and aſcenſion. Now where this belief doth give a man this kind of Chriſtian knowledge, it doth open a door and way for him into the preſence of God. This is a queſtion that ought ſeriouſly to be conſidered; for if we err in this queſtion, we err in all: This is like ſtumbling at the threſhold, and never coming into the houſe. If we miſtake in laying hold of Chriſt, we miſtake in our worſhip, and in all matters that relate to life and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>For if we muſt have another ſort of knowledge of Chriſt, than we can have from the reports of others; if I muſt have Chriſt revealed in me before I can have the hope of glory; if I muſt have the ſpirit of Chriſt in me, to help me to put up my requeſts and ſupplications, before he can preſent them to the Father, then all literal knowledge and faith cannot ſtand men in any ſtead; this is evident by the teſtimony of all the writers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Chriſt and his apoſtles did concurrently ſignify, that the hope of a Chriſtian, the power and ſtrength of a Chriſtian, all lies in this, that they had known the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chriſt, and the powerful operation of the ſpirit working in them; this was that which was well pleaſing to God. Many ſcriptures might be ſpoken of, but you know the ſcriptures, and can read them, and ſee in them the concurrent teſtimony of all holy men to this day, that the knowledge they had of Chriſt was a divine knowledge, a ſpiritual knowledge; it was a knowing him after the ſpirit; it was a revelation of Chriſt in them, that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and diſtinguiſhed them from reprobates; even the knowledge of God through Jeſus Chriſt their Lord. Why ſhould not we come to this knowledge as well as they? The Lord is the ſame, and his power is the ſame, and his <hi>arm is not ſhortened.</hi> We may ſee as much need of divine aſſiſtance, and divine love, as ever men did; we can perform no duty, either of prayer or preaching, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divine aſſiſtance; not ſo much as a ſigh or groan, that may have acceptance with God, without the help of his Spirit. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered: Rom.</hi> viii, 26. If we go about the duty of
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:020309_0142_0FAEF94A221334A0"/>
prayer without divine aſſiſtance, we ſee what ſad work we make of it; if we pray not in the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding, how can we receive the thing we pray for? But if we <hi>pray in the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding alſo,</hi> then the <hi>ſpirit helps our infirmities;</hi> the ſpirit that came from God brings us the things we ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>So that a Chriſtian hath a foundation for his worſhip and Chriſtian performance; what is that foundation? Nothing that is corrupt, if it be, it is good for nothing; for nothing that is corrupted and that defiles, can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſing to God; we are all polluted and defiled by nature; how can carnal men worſhip a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual God? Carnal men that are in death and darkneſs, cannot worſhip that God that is light, and dwells in light, that is inacceſſible, that is <hi>of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.</hi> Carnal men want a foundation for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and will until they come to that foundation that God hath laid.</p>
            <p>Now, that I may ſpeak intelligibly what the Lord hath laid upon my heart, I would ſay thus: There is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal benefit and privilege diſtributed and given free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God, unto the ſons and daughters of men, in their natural ſtate, through his Son, Jeſus Chriſt, in that he hath cauſed his light to ſhine, and his grace to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every man; <hi>for the grace of God,</hi> which bringeth ſalvation (for it is not by works) <hi>hath appeared unto all men,</hi> and bringeth light, by which every man may ſee how to worſhip God; God hath enlightened every man, and this light comes by Chriſt the Mediator; this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator is the way that men muſt walk in, if they will come back again to God; for men are run out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from God; if men will draw near to God, and take ſome foot-ſteps towads the kingdom of God, from the kingdom of ſin and ſatan, they muſt mind the way, the way muſt be their director, they muſt not go which way they liſt.</p>
            <p>This is that which was propheſied of Chriſt; ſaith God, by the prophet <hi>Iſaiah, I will give him for a leader.</hi> I would fain return to God, and go out of the kingdom of ſin and ſatan, to the kingdom of God: God hath given Chriſt to lead me; if
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:020309_0143_0FAEF94C0F53A520"/>
knew what way he would lead me in, I would go that way. As ſoon as a man takes hold of Chriſt, his grace, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and life, he will be ready to ſay, I am corrupt; my ſenſes are corrupt, my mind is depraved, my conſcience defiled and polluted; but I have found out ſomething that God hath beſtowed upon me, that is eſſential, holy and pure, that did never conſent to my corruption, but is a witneſs for God againſt it: Here now a Chriſtian lays hold on Chriſt, the leader; which way will he lead me? If thou layeſt hold of this guide, he will lead thee out of evil, he will teach thee to ceaſe to do evil, and ſpeak evil: This light will lead thee to nothing that will diſhonour God, or defile thine own ſoul: But this is not all, we muſt not only ceaſe to do evil, but we muſt be doing ſomething; there muſt be a breaking off from pride, <hi>fooliſh jeſting, evil communication;</hi> but this is not all that he will lead me to; let us learn that leſſon, <hi>ceaſe to do evil.</hi> This doctrine was preached before Chriſtianity was preached, as it is now preached; the prophets of old preathed this doctrine to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were under an outward adminiſtration, <hi>ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well,</hi> then I will plead with you, and diſcourſe with you, ſaith the Lord: <hi>Come now, let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, though your ſins be as ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt leſſon that a true Chriſtian learns in his turning to God, in his change and tranſlation, <hi>to ceaſe from that which is evil:</hi> Here is a ceſſation of rebellion, and here is ſome hopes of being reconciled to God; a man hath been a rebel againſt his Maker, but he hath now received help to reſiſt thoſe temptations that prevail over him: But there is no worſhipping yet, there is a forward mind in men to do ſomething that is pleaſing to God; but there are ſome that are not troubled at all for their evil ways, and dread not God's anger, but make a mock at ſin, that draw others to it, and make themſelves merry in it: And there is a ſort ſo far touched with a divine ſenſe of God's love to them, that they have alſo a ſenſe of his anger and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe of their ſin; and they would be fain out of his anger; and who can blame them? When a man feels the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:020309_0144_0FAEF94D967D5300"/>
anger of God burning like a fire in his boſom, who can blame that man if he deſire peace with God? If he be under a ſenſe of the diſpleaſure and indignation of the Almighty, he muſt not haſte too ſoon out of that condition he is brought into; for this is God's purpoſe, and this is the fruit of all his troubles and afflictions, to take away ſin: God hath no other end or deſign in the affliction that is upon him, than to take away ſin; when God hath brought a people into a diſtreſſed and dejected ſtate for their ſin, the fruit that God expects, is the <hi>taking away of their ſin,</hi> and he will hide pride from them, and humble them before him; if this be the purpoſe of God, that he intends to purge and purify his people; then ſaith the poor creature, it God deſign to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify me from ſin, then I will pray to God to ſupport me, and bear me up under his indignation: That is the cry of the ſoul that he may not be brought too ſoon from under the judgment of God, but may be ſupported and hid in the hollow of God's hand, until the time of remiſſion and refreſhing comes, that he may behold the light of God's countenance.</p>
            <p>Here is encouragement for every one that is acquainted with this divine principle of grace, that will be led by it, and follow it ſo far as to be led out of evil; then they will be fitted to do ſomething in the work of God; every ſigh and groan that thou haſt the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God to help thee in, is a part of worſhip: All thy broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart is part of worſhip; hereby thou acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the great God, that he is able to help thee on in thy way, and to pardon thy iniquity, and blot out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and give thee all thoſe heavenly bleſſings that thy ſoul doth ſtand in need of. Then thy ſoul will how down to God in acts of holy worſhip, and ſay, with a humble confidence and expectation, God will do all thoſe things in me, and for me, that will promote my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is nothing in religion for people to go from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preaching to ſinning; but God muſt have a holy ſacrifice, and that muſt come out of a pure heart. Now when a man is brought by the help of God, and by the divine aſſiſtance of the Mediator. Jeſus Chriſt, to break off from his ſin, then he ſtands fair to become a child of God,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:020309_0145_0FAEF94E63D76A40"/>
and to be a ſervant of God, and to do ſomething for God in his generation, and to offer to God praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and to perform all other duties that God ſhall lead him into.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, what, muſt not we do any thing? I have deeply weighed that queſtion, what a poor man or woman muſt do, that is come out of bondage. There is a propenſity in people to be doing, they would fain do ſomething, they would be doing; they ſay, what ſhall I do? If I do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that pleaſes not God, I had better let it alone; and I can do nothing acceptable to God without divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: Such a one that ſees his own impotency and inability, will caſt his care upon God, and will ſay, the Lord is able to lead me and guide me: I am ready to do thy will, O God! Make it clear to me that this is thy will, and that this is that which thou requireſt; I am ready to do it, though it be a croſs to mine own will: He is ready to go on in God's way, in the way of Chriſtianity; ſuch a one that hath the true knowledge of Chriſt, if he ſpeaks, the Spirit of Chriſt ſpeaks in him; if he prays, it is through the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Chriſt, through whom God alone is appeaſed and reconciled, and through whom they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a bleſſing from God's hands: But for men to run on in their own wills, and to do a thing becauſe they will do it, they had better ſit ſtill; this doing in their own wills, hath filled the world with a ſort of Chriſtians that want accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, which is to be had alone through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the want of the guidance of God's Holy Spirit, is the miſery and downfal of Chriſtianity in our days.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is our work and buſineſs to build upon that foundation which God hath laid; no worſhip is pleaſing to God, but that which ariſeth from that ſpring that is pure and holy: If I cannot find that which will keep me from all pollution and defilement, if I cannot find that, I muſt ſtay till I can; to begin a worſhip and a religion without I know that it is acceptable to God, is but loſt labour, and time ſpent in vain.</p>
            <p>Therefore, friends, let every one that deſires to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, turn their mind inward, wait for the gift of God, which is eſſentially pure, that never did conſent to evil,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:020309_0146_0FAEF94EA4E071E8"/>
that never mixed with the corruption of nature, but bears witneſs to the light, that will guide you and lead you, and conduct you firſt out of ſin; then it will lead you into that worſhip and religion, and the performance of thoſe things that are pleaſing to God. They that are come thus to worſhip, they do not only know what the Lord requires of them, and when he requires it of them, but they are given up into the hands of God; they pray, preach, exhort, and live according to the will of God.</p>
            <p>It is hard for people in a carnal ſtate to believe this; but you that are believers, that are come to know the gift of God in yourſelves, and the neceſſity of being ruled by him, you will believe us, for none elſe will believe us; let us preach to as many people and nations as we will, none will receive us as true miniſters, but thoſe that have the truth in their own hearts; if there be any that deſpiſeth the grace of God in his own heart, he hates that which chides and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves him; if there be ſuch a man, he will hate me becauſe I am a miniſter and a witneſs of the grace of God, and of that truth in the inward parts, which is the ground and foundation that man hath of acceptance with God. A wicked, carnal wretch will ſay, I hate ſuch a one, I hate the light, that which checks me, and witneſſeth againſt me; thou art ſuch a one as beareſt witneſs againſt me, therefore I hate thee: It is very true, it cannot be otherwiſe. Now our deſire and labour is, that men may come to the love of the truth in themſelves.</p>
            <p>You know there are a great many other miniſters, whoſe labour is to perſuade people to believe what they ſay; to lay down a doctrine, and prove it by ſcripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſet it home upon their minds by ſuch teſtimony as the ſcripture affords, and hereupon they prevail on the minds and judgments of people, to believe what they lay down.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to lay down a poſition, and prove it, and convince people that it muſt be according to ſcripture; but when a perſon is convinced of a principle of truth, he is not regenerated thereby, and come to God; therefore, though he cannot deny the doctrine of truth in words, yet he can deny it in works, and doth not rightly come
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:020309_0147_0FAEF94F55457710"/>
to love it. If people would believe what we ſay, and obſerve what argument we bring to prove a poſition, they may be convinced of the doctrine of truth, and come to a profeſſion of it, and yet be ſtrangers to it, till they come to love it in themſelves: If it were not for this, we would leave preaching, if God had not given a meaſure and manifeſtation of the ſpirit to every man to profit withal. You have it in yourſelves, we are but as monitors to you, to put you in mind of it; you have ſo much buſineſs in the world, that you have not had leiſure to take notice of it.</p>
            <p>A man may have a rich jewel, and be poor notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, till he come to know the value of it.</p>
            <p>A man hath a rich and precious jewel; a pearl beſtowed upon him, that would make him rich in faith and love to God, and qualify him for the kingdom of God, and make him an heir of it; but he knows not, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the value of it, and eſteems it not; therefore God hath raiſed up miniſters to put you in mind of it, that you may be happy forever, and live in bleſſedneſs to all eternity; <hi>whoſoever hath an ear to hear, let him hear;</hi> and when they hear what we ſay, let them take the benefit of it to their own ſouls. We bring not truth to you, but God hath beſtowed it upon you; you will be rich indeed, if you do as a man that bought a field where the precious pearl was, and digged till he found it. Come to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which you ſhould build all your hopes of happineſs, and depend not upon your own works, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious performances, for acceptance with God; for there is no acceptance with God, but only through Chriſt, we are only accepted of God through him. Thoſe that will become Chriſtians indeed, and worſhip God as he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and appointed himſelf to be worſhipped, they muſt come to the principle of light and grace in their own hearts, which they have in, and through Chriſt, and they will find acceptance with God.</p>

            <head type="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <date>March 16, 1691.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THE bleſſed life of Chriſt is not of this world; and it ought to be your care in all your religious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, that you be gathered into the inward, feeling ſenſe, of this divine life; that you may feel your fellowſhip and communion in that life of Chriſt that is not of this world. And may all of you lay hold upon it; for this is the nouriſhment and the heavenly bread, with which <hi>the children of the kingdom are fed and nouriſhed from day to day;</hi> there are many that feed upon words, that are not the children of the kingdom of God; but the begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God are come to know the virtue of the divine life, Chriſt Jeſus; their feeding and their nouriſhment is by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, and they grow up to life eternal by that divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, that God the Father hath beſtowed upon them, through his Son Jeſus Chriſt; and they enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſaints, through this divine Head of the Church, that communicates of his life and virtue through every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by which they are ſanctified, and every day more and more prepared for that living and eternal inheritance laid up for the children of God.</p>
            <p>And when there are a people that are thus gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the life of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they are able to draw nigh to God; they feel the power of entrance, becauſe their ſin is removed that did formerly lie at the door; and the way is opened and conſecrated for them to draw nigh and partake of the table of the Lord, by which they grow ſtronger and ſtronger in his might and power, and are thereby enabled to perform the whole will of God, and that divine worſhip and religious ſervice, which God requireth at their hands in their day.</p>
            <p>For it is very certain, and we have found it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the words of our Lord to his diſciples of old
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:020309_0149_0FAEF9510C4B9928"/>
are true; <hi>without me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi> For though people may meet together, and may pretend and ſet up a form of worſhip, and of religion in their own wills, yet it all amounts to nothing, with reſpect to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with the Lord; there is no return in their ſouls, no addition of life, nor encreaſe and growth of life; they are not nearer the kingdom than when they firſt believed, but many times further off; by leaning upon a formality, and not really entering into the work of God, nor tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling out of death into life; for there muſt be a path, and a travelling in it; the ſoul muſt have an exerciſe thro' the power and life of Jeſus, for the overcoming of death, that did ſeparate from God, and a preparing for life, that life that unites us to God again: And when people are in earneſt in this travel, they are reſigned up to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, direction and leading of him that is gone before, that hath made a way for us, and will further our progreſs towards the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>And, therefore, my friends, you know the way, and know how the power hath reached to you, and hath opened your underſtandings that you may be faithful to that power in your own ſouls, and may have the uſe and true im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this, and all other ſuch meetings as this, for the gathering of your minds out of all viſible and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objects, unto that life which God hath revealed, that ſo in the exerciſe of it, you may hold your fellowſhip with God, and with one another; here is the bond of perfection, here is that in which God hath created peace and reſt, and joy for his people; ſo far as every one is partaker of this innocent life, and feels himſelf changed into it, they are gathered into the church, and they are gathered into fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the head of it, and are comforted in their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in their partaking together.</p>
            <p>Though I be but a little one, yet I partake of the ſame virtue which the Lord adminiſtered to the greateſt ſaints, while I am a waiting upon him, and of the ſame divine conſolation, and operation, and power that weaneth more and more from the world, and that which is corruptible, and raiſeth up in me daily more and more fervent deſires after that bread that periſheth not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="unknown:020309_0150_0FAEF9518DC11288"/>Now herein men and women have an evidence of that Chriſtianity in themſelves, the <hi>Spirit of God bearing</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and <hi>witneſs with their Spirits,</hi> which all the looſe profeſſors of Chriſtianity in the world are ſtrangers to, their evidence in themſelves, being againſt them; they ſeek to have evidence without them, and to gather up ſome kind of marks and tokens, and ſayings, and ſentenccs, from without them, to make them believe that they are in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and that they are in a ſtate of ſalvation by Chriſt; but he that truly believeth, hath an evidence of his Chriſtianity, and of his reconciliation with God; and he hath this evidence in himſelf, a divine, ſpiritual teſtimony that anſwereth to his own ſpirit, that witneſſeth to him, that he is one of the children of God.</p>
            <p>And my friends, to this you are called, whether you are come to it or no; it is this you are called to with a heavenly call, that you might no longer live in the rudiments of the world, to be ſeeking and looking here and there, for a ground of peace and of reſt; a ground of hope, but may know and feel the ſame thing, the ſame ground of eternal hope that the ſaints of old had; what is that? what reaſon did they give and render of their hopes of eternal glory? The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tells you plainly the ground or reaſon of their hope of being glorified in the world to come, was <hi>Chriſt in</hi> them <hi>the hope of glory.</hi> They witneſſed that Chriſt gave his life for the world. Take the glorious teſtimony that the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did bear in one of his epiſtles; ſaith he, <hi>the life was manifeſted in me;</hi> it was not covered up or hidden, that people could not find it; God was pleaſed to bring it to <hi>light by the goſpel;</hi> when a thing is brought to light, you may ſee it. This he affirmed in his day, and the ſame is affirmed in our day. The life is manifeſted; what life? Not the life of this world, but a life not defiled, not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, but the life that is of God, a heavenly life that is holy and pure; that life is manifeſted; we have ſeen it, and we exhort all to lay hold of it, to lay hold of eternal life: Some had a ſight of it, that had not laid hold of it; they ſaw it in a viſion, and they might ſay poſſibly, oh that I could live ſuch a life, that there were no ſin in me, in my words, or thoughts, or actions, what a gracious life would
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:020309_0151_0FAEF9561EC5B368"/>
that be! They had ſeen that life, they had taſted of it, but they did not lay hold of it, but let it go by them: Take heed of that, when you have ſeen it with open eyes. <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they have ſeen, and your ears, for they have heard,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his diſciples: They ſaw that life that was holy, harmleſs and undefiled. Lay hold on this life, eſpecially when you are thus aſſembled together, in a ſolemn manner in the preſence of the Lord, waiting to behold it, and ſee it more and more diſcovered to you, and labour to have that gathering power that will bring you to it, that you may know the ſtrength that comes by it to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>There is none of you, but what will meet with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this world, that will draw you into death and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to things <hi>that are carnal, and ſenſual, and deviliſh</hi> ſometimes. How ſhall I ſtand if I be not centered in that life that was before the world began, and before the devil was? If I labour to feel the influence of that divine power, that is able to keep me, my faith tells me ſo: I know that power is able to keep me, if I keep in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it. The truſt of a true believer is, that whatſoever temptations and trials they are exerciſed with, they know one already come, <hi>in whom they have truſted, who is both able and willing to deliver them.</hi> So by this means he is kept harmleſs, and innocent, and blameleſs in his life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Thus you might be kept, if you would regard, and have reſpect to the life that is manifeſted in you.</p>
            <p>Whoſover comes to know, and feel and witneſs in their ſouls the diſcovery and revelation of the life of Jeſus, they know there is in it a certain dominion over that which is contrary to it; and you have many of you had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the exerciſe of the power of God in your own hearts, that hath enabled you to reign over thoſe things, that have formerly ruled over you: That you can now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due vain thoughts, and evil deſires, that you can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand temptations that come from without, and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Now if you could do this, and if ever you have done it, you did it by that power that God diſcovered and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you from Jeſus Chriſt: You had not ſuch hold of this once, before you believed, but by believing, the word of God ſent it unto you; it being fixed by faith in the heart,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:020309_0152_0FAEF957372AB610"/>
               <hi>that faith which is of the operation of God:</hi> You could then do that which you could not do before, and forbear that which you was led away by. Theſe experiences which God hath given you, ſhould encourage you to hold on in your labour and travel, and engage you <hi>to grow in the grace of God, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whatſoever is propounded by men in the profeſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, this ought to be our deſign and end, in the diſcovery that is made to us of the life of Chriſt; that we may grow in it, and live in it; (indeed there is great talking of it) but we ſhould labour to ſhew forth the reſurrection of that life in us.</p>
            <p>They that come to be baptized for the dead, are baptized into the death of Chriſt; the apoſtle tells you, <hi>in that he died, he died unto ſin.</hi> There are none baptized for the dead, and made partakers of the death of Chriſt, but thoſe that died unto ſin, as he died. Though Chriſt had no ſin, yet he died unto ſin: What uſe did he make of this, that Chriſt knew no ſin, but yet did take our ſin upon him? <hi>He died unto ſin, that they which did partake of his death, might be partakers of his reſurrection:</hi> He liveth again, and after death riſeth again.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that partake of this death unto ſin, are crucified unto this world, and have taken up Chriſt's croſs, and are dead to all the pleaſures and delights of this world, which are withered away and come to nothing. What do they live to now? To righteouſneſs, holineſs, chaſtity, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; theſe are pleaſant to them; theſe come to live to righteouſneſs, through the power of him that loved them. This ſhews the glory and the power of the grace of God. It is the grace of God that worketh ſuch a change in a man or woman. They that delight in ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in that which is corrupt and ungodly, they have no delight in this, no delight in ſobriety, chaſtity, holineſs, and purity of mind. In whom hath it wrought ſuch a change? In all that are freely given up to it. Where any one is given up to that life, the grace of God hath the praiſe of it. This is the exaltation and praiſe of the power of God; ſo that others may find by this, that they may by it come to believe, and by beliving, to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="unknown:020309_0153_0FAEF9579C8EA370"/>Thus the goſpel hath gone forth, from one to many, and from theſe to many more, and is encreaſing more and more; for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, mercy and peace, are multiplied, by which the heritage of God, and ſo every man and woman that partake of this life, are gathered into fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>So that your end in coming to theſe meetings, is not ſo much to hear what this, and that, and the other friend faith; but what you have in yourſelves to witneſs to: The divine operations of the power of God in your ſouls, bringing down ſomething that is to be brought down, and raiſing up ſomething that is to be raiſed. Temptation to ſin hath more prevalency upon me, than it hath upon this, and that, and the other man. I am not come to their degree, yet it is better with me than it was at my firſt convincement. If thou doſt ſay this and deceive others, cry to God, and pray earneſtly that all may be brought down which is contrary to his grace. If thou ſayeſt and profeſſeſt this, to ſtrengthen that, which is known, by the light of Chriſt, to be againſt the truth of God, if at the ſame time there is a deceitful heart, how will this appear at the great day of God? The eye of God is upon thy hypocriſy; he that <hi>never ſlumbers nor ſleeps,</hi> he beholds thee, if there be any ſin that thou wouldeſt keep and ſave alive. If thou makeſt a profeſſion, and notwithſtanding ſayeſt, this ſin I will keep, <hi>the Lord pardon me in this thing;</hi> like <hi>Naaman,</hi> the ſervant of the king of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> who ſaid to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>thy ſervant henceforth will neither offer burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor ſacrifice to other Gods, but unto the Lord. In this the Lord pardon thy ſervant, that when my maſter goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of</hi> Rimmon <hi>to worſhip there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myſelf in the houſe of</hi> Rimmon; <hi>when I bow myſelf in the houſe of</hi> Rimmon, <hi>the Lord pardon thy ſervant in this thing.</hi> He knew if he bowed not, the king would take notice of the alteration of his geſture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would bow in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon:</hi> That ſin he would ſave alive under a profeſſion: That hypocriſy the Lord did abominate.</p>
            <p>Be upright in the ſight of God, and be faithful to your own ſouls; if it be ſo, then every ſin will be a burthen, and you will long to be rid of it; if it be ſo, you know
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:020309_0154_0FAEF9585F217B80"/>
whoſe hand it is that hath brought you ſo far; if you be really cordial, and give up yourſelves to Jeſus, that <hi>work which he hath begun in you, he will finiſh for you.</hi> He will finiſh it for you, ſtand out with him in nothing; give up yourſelves to him, and join not with his enemies; take heed of hearkening to them; take heed of every ſin that will at laſt be a burthen and oppreſſion to your ſouls.</p>
            <p>But if you live this heavenly life of Jeſus, you will be ſet at liberty, to have dominion over ſin, and to ſtand without guilt before the throne of God. Friends, let your hearts be deeply affected with the great mercies that God hath beſtowed upon you, and for his gift to you of that divine life that <hi>is acceptable in his ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many things have been done upon the account of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and we could never be ſatisfied whether they were acceptable to God; we could not be ſatisfied whether we did any thing pleaſing to God: We may ſay of them as the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſacrifices, <hi>there remains a conſcience of ſin,</hi> an accuſing conſcience, that tells us, that guilt is not removed, nor the ſin taken away, till the Lord opens this divine myſtery to us, that our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be by faith in Jeſus; that nothing could recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God but the life of Jeſus, and the merit of his death.</p>
            <p>This life of Jeſus was a holy, blameleſs, harmleſs, and innocent life, which <hi>life he gave for the world;</hi> which <hi>life is the light of men;</hi> and our ſouls being turned to this life, we ſee the glory and the excellency of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are kindled in our hearts after it. Many have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and laboured, and travelled, that they might come to the enjoyment of it. The very diſcovery of this life ought to be highly prized, and your ſouls affected with it; and when you have obtained it, you will ſay, O! what a bleſſed condition am I come into! that Chriſt hath manifeſted his divine power in me, not only in <hi>reconciling me to God,</hi> but taking away the conſcience of ſin; by that alone the accuſer is caſt out, and I may now ſing to God, ſongs of deliverance. Now you taſte of the mercies that God hath beſtowed upon you; this will affect your ſouls with a child-like
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:020309_0155_0FAEF9591CE13040"/>
ſubmiſſion and ſubjection to him, that hath begun to ſave and deliver you, that ſo you may reſign up your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his will, and forſake the world, and the things of it.</p>
            <p>Now when theſe come to ſuch a meeting as this, their minds may be retired, and they may be ſenſible of the power of truth upon their hearts; but for want of keeping their ſubjection to the divine power, that hath opened their underſtandings, when they come into the world again, they are enſnared and entangled, and many times, for want of watchfulneſs, through a looſeneſs of mind, and unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of tongue, they run into anger and paſſion, and this grieves the Holy Spirit of God. And how ſhould you come to God through the Mediator, when you grieve his Spirit, and quench the motions of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe things have been hurtful to many, that in their time might have been pillars in the houſe of God. Take heed of this, and let the goodneſs of God dwell upon your minds, that you may feel and experience the inward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of it; there are many that are much affected with the outward miniſtry, and are very deſirous to hear the ſervants of God declare the things that God hath wrought for them, and in them, and the wonderful things that God hath opened to them; yet when you have heard all that man can ſay about it, if the divine miniſtry of the word of God doth not make powerful impreſſions upon you, and ſanctify and renew your ſouls, the outward miniſtry of the word will do you no good.</p>
            <p>Now that you may be eſtabliſhed in the truth that you have been taught, this teſtimony ariſeth in me, to deſire every one to heed and attend to the manifeſtation of this life of Jeſus in yourſelves. Whatſoever God hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me or another, you may periſh for all that, and I am not the better for what God hath beſtowed upon you, but may periſh notwithſtanding; but that God hath manifeſted eternal life to my ſoul, let that be every ones centre: This will make you holy and blameleſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you in every ſtate, and in the hour of temptation, and in the midſt of ſnares; this will be a bulwark to you; this will be as the walls of Zion, which is the ſalvation of the Lord. That ſo you may be preſerved ſenſible of
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:020309_0156_0FAEF959E4885738"/>
the goodneſs of the Lord: That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied in your boſoms; this will make you dear and affectionate one to another.</p>
            <p>Though there may be an external fellowſhip among thoſe that preach and profeſs the ſame doctrine, yet when they come off from that, when once men depart from the power of truth, they grow ſtubborn and rebellious; but when men come to be gathered into the inward fellowſhip that ſtands not in terms and words, but in the revelation of Chriſt, and in the participation of his virtue and goodneſs; the more you are united in this, the more you are knit one to another, and become uſeful and helpful one to another.</p>
            <p>The Lord vouchſafe to every one of you a taſte of his goodneſs, and you will prefer it above all that the devil has, and his inſtruments can preſent; and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire more into this heavenly and divine life of Jeſus, you will feel and enjoy more peace and ſatisfaction, and true conſolation in your ſouls, than I, or any man in the world can tell you of.</p>

            </head>
            <head type="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <date>July 26, 1691.</date>
            </head>
            <p>YOU have read and heard much concerning the day of the Lord, as a great and notable day; many of you are now living witneſſes that the great and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able day of the Lord is coming, in which the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great and notable things, the mighty works of God, which have been propheſied of, may be lawfully expected. It is the work of every Chriſtian to wait upon the Lord in the light of this day, and to be acquainted with the works of the Lord, both inwardly and outwardly; for the day of the Lord is a day of power, and that power of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wonderful things; and if we are not kept in the light of that day, the Lord may work great things, and we not
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:020309_0157_0FAEF95AA7C7FD90"/>
know it; we ſhall be looked upon as careleſs and negligent witneſſes of the works of the Lord, as thoſe that do not regard them. If you would be faithful witneſſes, you muſt have regard to the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands. One that is minded to be a faithful witneſs, he will take notice of what is ſaid and done; you are called to be witneſſes of the works of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of his doings; you muſt ſtand where you may hear, and ſee, and underſtand what the Lord is about to do at this time.</p>
            <p>In teſtimony and witneſs bearing, the greateſt thing we have to expect in this day of the Lord, is, that God will ſet up the kingdom of his Son Chriſt Jeſus; and unto this all the prophets did bear witneſs in their time, and now it is our turn to bear witneſs of it, by ſenſible and living experiences of the accompliſhment of thoſe things that they propheſied of, that the Lord will ſet up the kingdom of Chriſt, and bring down and lay waſte the kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. This our Saviour taught his diſciples to pray for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more than ſixteen hundred years ago, that the kingdom of God might come; and all the true diſciples of Chriſt ever ſince have prayed for the coming of this kingdom, and many of them have ſeen the coming of it, and rejoiced; and others have died in the faith of it, and have been gathered into the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But, my friends, that which chiefly concerns us at this day, is to behold the kingdom of Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, within us, to go forward and proſper; and the kingdom of Antichriſt ſuppreſſed and deſtroyed, and utterly laid waſte; and this is wrought two ways, firſt, inwardly; ſecond, outwardly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, inwardly; there is a great inclination in the minds of people, to look more at the operation of God's power in this great work outwardly, than to look at it inwardly, but unto that there muſt be a daily croſs taken up, and it is my buſineſs at this time to tell you in the name of the Lord, that your duty and mine is to turn our minds to the working of the power of God in ourſelves, and to ſee that other kingdom of the man of ſin weakened and brought down within us; then there is no fear but he will carry on his work outwardly, and we ſhall ſee as much
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:020309_0158_0FAEF95BA5E54758"/>
of that work as belongs to our generation; but the great matter and chief government of you and me, is to ſee the kingdom of God ſet up within us, which ſtands in holineſs and righteouſneſs: Our buſineſs is to walk till we ſee the righteouſneſs of this kingdom ſet up within us, in our hearts and ſouls, and to have a real change made.</p>
            <p>We all know, and we muſt confeſs, that we have been ſubject to the man of ſin, whatſoever we are now. We have ſeen the reign and government, the rage and tyranny of the wicked one, that hath led us into rebellion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Lord our Maker. How do we like that government, to be ruled by the devil, and to be led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and to be made to do his will, and to rebel againſt God that gave us our life, and breath, and being? How do we like the government of ſatan? I hope we do none of us like it. It was ſo with me; and they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyrannical government of ſatan, have many cries and wiſhes in their ſouls, that they were freed and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it, and brought under the government and obedience of Chriſt Jeſus; and that they were able to ſerve God as they ought to do, that they might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the kingdom of ſin and ſatan, into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the bleſſed and dearly beloved Son of God.</p>
            <p>This hath been the cry of ſome ever ſince they have known the word; and I am perſuaded it is the cry of many at this day. I have good news to bring you; not that the day of your redemption draws nigh, but that it is come; the day of redemption is now come, and there are a great many bleſſing and glorifying the name of God that they are redeemed, and delivered from the bondage of corruption; and have more joy and delight in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, that made them, than ever they had in the ſervice of the God of this world.</p>
            <p>But may not ſome ſay, how ſhall this great work be wrought? For it is a great work, and we verily think that nothing but an Almighty Power can effect it. For there are many in this aſſembly have been trying to no purpoſe, and done what they could in their own ſtrength, to deliver their own ſouls from death, and yet they find themſelves in bondage ſtill; nay, they have called in the
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:020309_0159_0FAEF95C2B87C4B0"/>
help and aſſiſtance of thoſe that they thought to be ſtronger than themſelves, and all have failed, and they are yet weak and entangled, and they cannot find themſelves at liberty to ſerve the Lord as they ought to do.</p>
            <p>I am of this mind, that nothing but the Almighty Power of God can do it; and when you have come to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, to know this as I have done, then I hope you will ſeek after that, and you will ſee good reaſon for it; and you will then come to this profeſſion, if the Lord puts not forth his Almighty Power, I muſt then periſh, for there is no other power can deliver me. When you come to know this, what muſt you do? Why you muſt wait for the revelation of that power that will take you off from all truſt and confidence that you have ever had in any thing elſe: A man that hath nothing to truſt to but the Almighty Power, and mercy, and goodneſs of God, he puts his whole truſt and confidenee therein, or elſe he knows he muſt periſh.</p>
            <p>When a man or woman comes to this paſs, that they have nothing to rely upon but the Lord, then they will meet together to wait upon the Lord: And this was the firſt ground or motive of our ſetting up meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and I would to God that this was the uſe that every one would make of them that come to them, then they would be juſtly and properly uſed, according to the end of the inſtitution of them at firſt; we ſhould uſe them as poor deſolate helpleſs people that are brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en off from all their own confidence and truſt, and have nothing to rely upon but the mercy and goodneſs of God; and if he pleaſeth to reveal his power among us, we know that he is able to ſave us. And when we have met with the revelation of God's power, and we have met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſimplicity of mind, the Lord was pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Spirit to us, and open a door for us, and diſcover and reveal to us that it was the day of his power: And when we came to examine ourſelves whether we were willing in this day of God's power (for the prophet gives us a note of diſtinction between the people of God, and other people; <hi>thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, when God diſcovers and
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:020309_0160_0FAEF95CCA24F450"/>
reveals his power to them, ſuch a people are willing to give themſelves over to the government of it; when we found we were ſubject to it, we had joy in believing, before we attained the end of our hope; it was gladneſs to us we found ourſelves willing; and I am perſuaded that every one of you would be glad to find yourſelves willing to part with that which you cry out againſt.</p>
            <p>What a cry is there of our bondage and corruption, and of our being led captive by our luſts. We may hear ſuch a cry from one end of the kindgom to the other: People cry out of the bondage of corruption, and of their ſubjection to ſin and ſatan: I would they were in earneſt; there is not that earneſtneſs and reality in men and women that God looks for, and ſo there comes nothing of it. There is no redemption, and no deliverance; the Lord doth not hear them, though they come now a-days into his preſence, to offer up their prayers. I would have you to be in good earneſt, I wiſh well to you all; and it would be hard to ſay that you do not wiſh well to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Here lies your welfare, that you find yourſelves willing to be ſubject to the power that made you; you have been ſubject doubtleſs to the power that deſtroyed you; that power that never gave you life and breath, and would be inſtrumental of your deſtruction: The power of the God of this world never did men good, but deſtroyed them, deceived them, and deprived them of their lives.</p>
            <p>Now if there was but a willingneſs in every one of us, freely to give up ourſelves to that power that created us, to obey his will, I am ſure there is never a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among us ſhould long be without the knowledge of it. If I am but willing to be ſubject to the law of him that made me, it will not be long before he diſcover it to me, and reveal his power in me in the glory and excellency of it; that power which is more able to preſerve me, than all the power of men on earth, or all the power of the devils in hell is able to deſtroy me. When the Lord ſhall diſcover and reveal his power in you, you will be willing to be ſubject to it.</p>
            <p>But methinks the ſound and noiſe of fleſh and blood grows loud here: I would be ſubject to God, but I would
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:020309_0161_0FAEF95DE84134D0"/>
not have him croſs mine intereſt, and deprive me of that I love and thirſt after; I would not have him imbitter my carnal delights and pleaſures, and undo me as to my reputation in the world.</p>
            <p>You may ſee whence this comes, that you would make a bargain, and draw a contract with the God of your lives about theſe things; this is a nonſenſical thing; becauſe of all people in the world, you are a people that have had a veneration for the holy ſcriptures, the ſcriptures of truth, and have been acquainted with them as familiarly as with any book in the world, wherein you find articles drawn, long ago fixed and ſealed; and no new ones are to be drawn. If any one will be my diſciple, <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Thomas, James</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or whoſoever he be, he muſt take up his daily croſs, and deny himſelf, and follow me. Now here is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract made, therefore turn aſide from all kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſulting with fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>If you will become ſpiritual, and partake of ſpiritual bleſſings and benefits, I would adviſe you to turn from all kind of reaſonings that come from the pit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that hath thus far deceived you, and will ruin you forever, if you hearken to them. For aſſure yourſelves, new goſpel-terms no man can make; and if any come to preach new goſpel-terms, count him a deceiver; for there is no poſſibility of being a diſciple of Chriſt, but by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a daily croſs, and denying ourſelves, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as our leader and guide. To him I muſt go, and go in no other way, ſpeaking nothing, and doing nothing but what is holy and pure; he muſt conduct me in my walking, guide me in my way, and juſtify me in it. This is to be a true diſciple of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he comes to adhere, and join to the power of God revealed in his ſoul, he ſees the coming of the kingdom of God; he ſees it at a diſtance; he ſaith within himſelf, and makes this concluſion, I will follow my cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; I will become ſubject to the kingdom of Chriſt. If I obey this divine principle of the grace of God, and the goſpel of Chriſt, I ſhall be his diſciple. I read in his bleſſed book, <hi>that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the children of God.</hi> I am not to propoſe new

terms, but to accept of the old terms of the goſpel of Chriſt. I ſee that the kingdom of God is to be ſet up, and the kingdom of the devil to be brought down in me; if I follow this divine principle, I ſhall never follow the devil more; if he would have me lye, I ſhall refuſe, and ſay I cannot; if he would have me run into vain and corrupt communication, and fooliſh jeſting, that will be a bridle to me, that I cannot do it.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak now to perſons that live under the light of the goſpel of Chriſt, and that are ſubdued by his grace; I would ſpeak that which all the logic in the world cannot overthrow; that which the moſt cunning logician, with all his wit and quirks, cannot refute and prove erroneous. If a man be led by the Spirit of God, he cannot lye; this is a common cure for all men; if I be led by the Spirit of Truth, and hearken to the principle of truth in my own ſoul, this will cure and heal me of the wounds and maladies of my corrupt nature, and ſet me at liberty from my old maſter; I do not like his ſervice.</p>
            <p>I hope if any of you like the ſervitude and bondage of ſin and ſatan, you will deſire liberty before you die: Why do not you deſire it now? It may be thou thinkeſt to enjoy a little liberty, and reputation, and pleaſure in ſin for many years, for ſix or ſeven, nine or ten years, and then break off from it, and repent and turn to God: How doſt thou know that thou haſt ten days to live? It is of high concernment to every one of us to wait for a diſcovery of goſpel liberty, and an ability and power in his ſoul, to enable him to break off from the ſervitude and bondage of ſin and ſatan, that he hath ſo long lived under; and to wait upon God with patience, for the ſetting his ſoul at liberty, and ſetting up the kingdom of Chriſt within him, and pulling down the kingdom of ſatan, that he may be brought into the kingdom of Chriſt, that conſiſts in <hi>peace and righteouſneſs, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Theſe are the things that follow one another; when righteouſneſs is ſet up in me, I ſhall not be diſturbed, I ſhall have peace; and if I have peace I ſhall have joy, and this joy is in the Holy Ghoſt; the apoſtle ſaith the kingdom of God conſiſts in theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="unknown:020309_0163_0FAEF960B64D3EC0"/>Now that every one might be perſuaded that God hath given a meaſure of his grace to them, as well as to other folks, let them conſider and ſay within themſelves, God hath not ſhut me out of the number of his people: He hath knocked at the door of my heart, to bring me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; he hath waited upon me ſo long, ſurely he hath a mind to ſave me: Would he call upon me, had he not intended I ſhould repent and turn to him?</p>
            <p>But where is the power? you will ſay; knocking at the door of the heart, and checks of conſcience, we underſtand them; but we underſtand not where the power is, to be conformable to the will of God.</p>
            <p>People will never underſtand it while they are in the kingdom of ſatan, and under the power of the prince of darkneſs; the apoſtle tells us, <hi>that the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine upon them.</hi> If men ſaw the beauty of the goſpel, they would run after it, and embrace it; therefore the devil blinds their minds, that they ſhould not ſee the beauty and amiableneſs of the goſpel, and like the terms of it: He hath the rule and government of the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. So long as I live in ſubjection to that deviliſh, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh power, which leads me forth into ſin, I ſhall be a ſtranger to God's power, that would enable me to break off from it.</p>
            <p>You never read in ſcripture of any that ever came to be ſaved by the power of God, but there was faith mixed with it, that came to join with that power of God. Our Saviour ſaid to the impotent man, <hi>thy faith hath made thee whole;</hi> thy faith joining with that power of God: <hi>We ſhall be made ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> and be able to withſtand temptations.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the ſoul of man joins with the grace of God, he doth forſake the ſervice of his old maſter and governor: Sin ſhall no longer have dominion over him; though he may meet with the ſame temptation, it ſhall not have the ſame power over him, but he will be enabled by the grace of God to withſtand it, and overcome it. If you ask ſuch a man, how it is that he overcomes that temptation that formerly
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:020309_0164_0FAEF9614C02F768"/>
prevailed over him, he will tell you, I have now an helper, I am now joined to the grace of God in my ſoul, therefore do I withſtand temptations, and have power over them. Thus comes the kingdom of Chriſt to be ſet up in the ſoul, and this is that which will ſit and prepare us for the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kingdom of God. They that do wait upon God, ſhall ſee this work wrought inwardly in them, they know more by faith than they can ſee by ſenſe.</p>
            <p>I know, and am certain, that the power the devil hath in the world, ſhall be broken down, and righteouſneſs ſhall be exalted, and juſtice and equity ſhall prevail in the nations. I ſhall not perhaps live to ſee it, but I may ſee it by faith; I have ſeen enough for my generation, and they that live in the next generation, ſhall ſee it alſo; for the church of God is the ſame from one generation to another. Now unto us it is given to ſee the things that in former generations were propheſied of, God having (ſaith the apoſtle) <hi>provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhall not be made perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The church of God from one generation to another, have their meaſure and degree of ſervice, and bear their proper teſtimony, and leave the reſt to ſucceeding generations: It concerns us in our generation to ſee a change made inwardly in our ſouls, and the kingdom of Chriſt ſet up within us, and the kingdom of ſatan brought down in ourſelves. This doth not concern my ſon or grandſon only, but it concerns me, and when they grow up to mature age, in their time it will concern them: Therefore that which is moſt profitable to us, is, that we have ſuch a ſtation, and ſtand in ſuch a place in our time, where we may ſee the work of God car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.</p>
            <p>I have conſidered, many a time, that there are many brave men and women in this age, that might have been eminent witneſſes of God in this world, and borne their teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to his truth, but their faith hath been weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual: They have diſcovered their unbelieving hearts, and have joined with the common herd of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought ſuch great things could never be done, that the kingdom of ſatan could never be pulled down and deſtroyed, and the kingdom of Chriſt ſet up within us,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:020309_0165_0FAEF96359797430"/>
but I would hope better things of you, things that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſalvation; and that he that hath begun a good work in you, will carry it on to perfection, that living praiſes, and joyful thankſgivings, may be rendered to him who alone is worthy, who is God over all, bleſſed forever; to whom be glory and dominion forever, and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <salute>My Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Lord will be with all his people, that are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in the way, that are ſpiritual travellers walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that undefiled way, that leads to an undefiled reſt. There are ſome that by this way are entered into reſt, that reſt which God hath prepared for them. We cannot apply to ourſelves that promiſe that is made to us of <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into reſt,</hi> unleſs we be real and true travellers in the way that leads to it, for if we do, <hi>we deceive our own ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore you that have had a ſight and viſion of the way everlaſting, that leads unto a holy reſt, you are an engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people to make ſtrait ſteps therein, and to have it your daily care, and make it your continual buſineſs, to look that your goings and foot-ſteps are of the ſame nature and kind that the reſt is that you deſire to enter into: For it is an undefiled reſt, that we all are, or ought to be travelling after; therefore every one of us muſt be undefiled in the way, and every foot-ſtep muſt be of the ſame kind and nature, and ſeparate from all that which defileth it and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth it; that ſo it may have a tendency to the bringing of the ſoul nearer to its reſt.</p>
            <p>This holy reſt many travellers have attained by this holy travel, and many are ſtill in hope to attain it.</p>
            <p>But now they that are full of hope of attaining this reſt, their foot-ſteps and goings are not of the ſame nature and
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:020309_0166_0FAEF96445894C20"/>
kind; they are not holy and pure, they are not undefiled; Theſe have not their faces truly <hi>Zion</hi>-ward, though the face of their profeſſion may ſtand that way; but the Lord looks at the heart of every one, and he knows which way the heart ſtands, they who have their hearts truly turned to the Lord, they have the mark of holineſs in their eye, and the mark of purity and righteouſneſs in all their undertakings, becauſe they know there is no attaining to that divine reſt, but by a holy way and travel; therefore their truſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance is alone on the Lord, that is to keep them in all their way; for if they be ever ſo clearly convinced that holineſs and righteouſneſs is their duty, and is the way whereby they may attain to the kingdom of God, though they are ever ſo fully convinced of it, yet there lies an impoſſibility of any walking therein without the divine aſſiſtance of the grace of God; for though they have been convinced by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his grace, and have had a light that openeth to them a ſight of theſe things, it is not this ſight and viſion that will enable them <hi>to run the race that is ſet before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the manifold impurities and hindrances which are in our way, between our coming out of Egypt's land, the bondage of corruption, and our entering into the kingdom of God, are too mighty and too great for any man with his knowledge and ſtrength to overcome. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might as well have gone through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> without the help of God, as the Chriſtian traveller can go through the many difficulties, and the many impediments that he is to meet with in his way, without the aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>My friends, it hath been a labour and travel at this time upon my mind, that all whom God hath ſo ſignally bleſſed with the knowledge of the truth, that you may ſee your way, and moſt clearly know and underſtand, that your way leads to life eternal; that all and every one of you in your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meetings, are to have a dependence upon that which can help you in your way.</p>
            <p>For I have ſeen too many that have had a wrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, after they were rightly convinced, and after they have had a true knowledge of their way wherein they ſhould walk; they have too much truſted to openings and ſights
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:020309_0167_0FAEF9645D98C070"/>
which they have received; they have thought their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo ſure, and that their <hi>feet have been paſt ſliding,</hi> that there hath grown up a ſtate of preſumption, that they have thought they ſhould never turn aſide, and have not had due regard to the renewing of the Divine Power of God in their ſouls, that God's children always muſt have. They have (as I may ſo ſay) forgotten what our Lord ſaid, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me ye can do nothing:</hi> They have paſſed a ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that doctrine in their minds, and they have thought they could do ſomething; that they could withſtand temptation; that they could do ſome work for God, and ſervice to God, without the Divine Aſſiſtance of that power that did beget them; and alas! the leaſt they have ſuſtained hath been, that they have run into evil, and they have defiled their way, and run into temptations, though it hath pleaſed the Lord, whoſe mercy is infinite, to pull them many times back again out of the ſnare which they were fallen into, and to take them again, and to waſh them, and cleanſe them, and purify them, and ſet their feet on a ſure place. This was more than they deſerved; but his mercy, and goodneſs, and tenderneſs, is over all his works.</p>
            <p>This he hath wrought for many a one; and not only once, but many times; it is hard venturing; it had been better if ſuch a one had never fallen, or that their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps had never ſlid from the ways of the Lord, than after <hi>they are fallen, to be renewed again by repentance.</hi> It hath cauſed ſore judgment, and condemnation, and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſpirit; and they have given their old enemy an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to whiſper in their ears; thou haſt loſt thy ground; thy ſins are gone over thy head, and thou ſhalt never find repentance. Theſe are the words of the wicked one, who ſeeks occaſion againſt us; and through our careleſneſs, and not being watchful, we put an advantage into his hands. Now ſeeing you know he is vigilant, and ſeeks occaſion that he may turn you out of your way, before you attain to the end of it, you ought to be vigilant to keep occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from him.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, how may I keep occaſions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from the enemy? I anſwer, the way hath been often told you, and I dare ſay moſt of you have tried it,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:020309_0168_0FAEF965080A3E28"/>
and found it to be true, that ſo long as you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in a watchful ſtate and poſture, and have had your minds exerciſed by the grace of God, by which you were convinced of your ſin, and by which your duty was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to you, ſo long you gave the enemy of your ſouls no occaſion; but the truth preſerved you wherein you truſted, and wherein you hoped and waited for the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of it. Did you find want of ability then? Did the enemy prevail then? He did not ceaſe to tempt when you was in the moſt watchful ſtate of a Chriſtian; the devil did not then ceaſe to tempt you, but you found in you a power that reſiſted him, and ſaid, <hi>get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, ſatan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So long as you are upon your watch; ſo far as you keep your mind fixed upon the Divine Power, ſo long you are in a ſure place; and whoſoever turns aſide from this, they ſuffer great harm and prejudice; and if ever they be reſtored again, it is with loſs and damage, and ſore exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; and if they be not reſtored, they are loſt to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: <hi>Then it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</hi> And then they ſaid within themſelves, this muſt be the way.</p>
            <p>Sirs, theſe things pertain to your everlaſting welfare; I ſpeak to you as a people that God hath abundantly loved; and it hath been far beyond any thing of deſert. He hath made known his ways to you; the Lord may ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you of this city, as of old, <hi>what could I have done more for my vineyard, that I have not done?</hi> So he may ſay concerning you, what could I have done more to make them a grown people, a holy people, an entire people, that <hi>they may bear my name, and walk before me in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs, all the days of their lives?</hi> What ſhould have been done more for them?</p>
            <p>But this is an exerciſe to us, whom God hath bleſſed, and ſet as watchmen, to behold and ſee the ſtate of his people, and to feel and bear the burdens that are to be borne; and this is a great burden, that after all that God hath done, and that we do in the hands of God, all that is neceſſary for the welfare of the people, there are ſome
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:020309_0169_0FAEF965CA46CC60"/>
that turn aſide, and defile their way; and we teſtify in the name of the Lord, that whoſoever walks in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed way, ſhall never come to an undefiled reſt; therefore that you do not attain to that undefiled reſt, it is becauſe ye have been defiled: Seeing the holy converſation of the people of God is the effect of the working of his own power and Spirit.</p>
            <p>Here comes the reſt, by and through a Mediator, even Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who is the Mediator between God and man, and the leader of all his people in the way of holineſs and righteouſneſs, which he hath made manifeſt to them that believe and obey the power: And <hi>he hath purchaſed eternal ſalvation for all that believe and obey the goſpel:</hi> But the tranſgreſſors do not obey the goſpel; the Spirit of Chriſt doth not lead you to tranſgreſſion; and the power and light that comes from Chriſt, doth not lead you to pride, vanity, envy and bitterneſs: Wherever theſe things are led into, there is another ſpirit, and that other ſpirit hath another tendency, it leads into the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>And my friends, this is that which my ſoul deſireth at your hands, and it is for your good and advantage; it is my duty to diſcharge my conſcience, and to ſpeak plainly as the Lord ſhall give me utterance, to warn you that you abide in the truth; for if ſo be you be not ſaved, but will turn aſide after your own hearts luſts, after your pride and the vanity of the world, and the luſts thereof, you may blame yourſelves, and your <hi>iniquity will be your ruin.</hi> We that have given up ourſelves to God for your ſakes, and the churches ſake, we ſpeak theſe things which we have learned of God, and we earneſtly preſs you that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that you walk in the truth which you have believed: There is no great need of more knowledge, and of the viſion of heavenly and divine things; for abundance of you have ſeen more of the things of God, than ever you have travelled and come up into. I would to God, that every one of you that are convinced, would come up <hi>to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the knowledge you have received.</hi> O! that you would anſwer the Lord's power, in opening and diſcovering his mind and will concerning your travel, and the things that belong to his everlaſting peace, that your foot-ſteps
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:020309_0170_0FAEF966C9F8EEC8"/>
may be directed thereby. If you will walk in this unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed way, you may lay down at night, and riſe in the morning with peace, and in the favour of the Lord, and have the anſwer of a good conſcience in his ſight.</p>
            <p>The means that muſt help and conduct us in this way, muſt be that familiar converſe that the ſoul muſt have with ſomething greater than itſelf; the familiar converſe that the ſoul muſt have with the Divine Power, with that manifeſtation of Divine Light and Grace, which, through Jeſus Chriſt, God hath given unto you. For if a man prize and eſteem the truth ever ſo much, and ſuffer ever ſo much for it, and love the miniſter ever ſo much, if he keep not a familiar converſe with the truth, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his profeſſion of love to the truths of the goſpel, and the preachers of it, he will reproach it: Though he profeſſes and ſays, I love thee, I love thee; though he hath ſuffered much in the way, yet if he love not the truth in his own heart, and deſire not to feel the excellency and virtue of it, that man will certainly diſhonour the truth, and grieve the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>We warn you to take heed of your way, and to your feet in your Chriſtian walk, that you may come to have an <hi>abundant entrance into the kingdom of God.</hi> Pray to God that the work of regeneration may be wrought upon you, that you may be born into another ſeed, and partake of the divine nature: Then, though the devil aſſault you, he cannot overcome you; he will find nothing in you whereby to betray you into his hands, when that change is wrought, and when God hath made an alteration, and hath brought you out of the love of the world, and the love of earthly things, <hi>and ſet your affections above, where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God.</hi> Now you can ſay, here comes a temptation with this inſtrument, and the other inſtrument, and the devil lays things before me that he would have me to do, but I have no inclination to it, I have no mind to be ſucking at the world's breaſts; but my mind is ſet upon this, that I may reach acquaintance with God, <hi>who will be a preſent help to me, and tread down ſatan under my feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is need of your continual care and vigilancy, and
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:020309_0171_0FAEF96751391690"/>
that you watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. It is not ſo eaſy a thing for a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man while they are in this world to do any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; but God hath called you to a holy profeſſion; which is, that you ſhould do all you can do, to do every thing you do without ſin: <hi>For whether you eat or drink, or whatſoever you do, you ſhould do all to the glory of God.</hi> This ſpirit we would have in you, and we would have all you <hi>that have received Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord, to walk in him as you have received him:</hi> Then you ſhall be kept undefiled in the way, and delivered from temptation.</p>
            <p>To this end you muſt be ſtill, waiting upon the Lord, that you may have acquaintance with him from day to day; you are in the world, but you ſhould not be of the world: The prayer of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to his heavenly Father for his diſciples, was not that he ſhould <hi>take them out of the world, but keep them from the evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Merchants, tradeſmen, and ſhop-keepers, have always ſomething to do in the world, but they ſhould pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly that they may <hi>be kept from the evil of the world.</hi> There is nothing can be done in the world, but there is evil in it, which we ſhall be overcome by, if we do not keep our watch. In the government of a family, there are occaſions and provocations given to be paſſionate and furious; many occaſions are given to men and women; but we ſhould not be tranſported and overcome: Our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion obliges us, that when a child or a ſervant gives a provocation, we are not to behave ourſelves unſeemly, and unbecoming our holy profeſſion; for it is not in their power, nor in the devil's power either, to kindle your wrath and anger into a flame: If you are upon your watch, and wait upon the Lord, he will give you wiſdom and ſtrength to ſtand againſt all temptations whatſoever, and <hi>to order your converſation according to the will of God, and as becomes the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In merchandize, buying and ſelling, there are ſnares, and there is evil we may run into; but this is our comfort and joy, there is no coercion, we cannot be forced to ſin, the devil can only lay a temptation before me; if thou wilt tell a lye, equivocate, diſſemble, here is an advantage
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:020309_0172_0FAEF968A3A10C48"/>
for thee; but the devil with all his ſubtilty, power and allurements, cannot ſay, thou ſhalt run into this ſin, and be overcome by this temptation; for though of ourſelves we can do nothing, yet in the name and ſtrength of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>we can do all things;</hi> we can do that which is juſt, and ſtand over the temptation, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon it, and <hi>not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> When we have bought and ſold, we may look back upon what we have done with pure minds, and clean conſciences in the ſight of God, and we may come off victors, and <hi>more than conquerors</hi> (over temptations) <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt that hath loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more a Chriſtian keeps himſelf unſpotted, and the more watchful he is in his walking, he may go on from day to day, and ſee the ſnares of the devil, that lies in this vanity, and this and the other vanity and temptation, and yet eſcape it.</p>
            <p>I would I could ſay of ſome of you, that when the devil laid a ſnare for you, you did not run into it when you ſaw it. I have known ſome that have had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding enough, that they need not be told where the ſnare of the devil lies; yet ſo hath it been, the devil and their own hearts luſts have agreed together, and they have run into the ſnare. This is from the old confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy that men have had with God's enemies; <hi>you are my friends,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>if you do whatſoever I command you.</hi> If you are the friends of Chriſt, you will be his ſubjects, and yield obedience to him; when he ſhews them a ſnare they will keep out of it: This is the proof of a true Chriſtian, that he will be true in a time of trial, and will truſt in that divine power that keeps him out of the ſnare.</p>
            <p>One thing more I would ſay, that divine fellowſhip that you have with Chriſt Jeſus, it conſiſts in holineſs of life and converſation, and the exerciſe of a good conſcience towards God, and towards man. It is in vain to tell me that you will walk in unity with the truth, unleſs you have unity with the truth in your own hearts; you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord, nor long deceive his people either. Here is the fellowſhip that you are to live in all your days, to live
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:020309_0173_0FAEF9690665E0E0"/>
in fellowſhip with the people of God, and communion of ſaints; can the ſaints have communion in any thing but holineſs? and holineſs is a bleſſed, ſacred thing, <hi>it becomes the houſe of God forever;</hi> they that are ſaints, are ſanctified and made holy; and <hi>he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one; for which cauſe, he is not aſhamed to call them brethren,</hi> Heb. ii. 11. They that are ſanctified are become ſaints, they bring forth the fruits of holineſs and ſanctification, and they are come into fellowſhip with God and one other. <hi>Every branch in me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that beareth not fruit, he taketh away; but every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> That branch which beareth not fruit, is caſt into the fire and burned.</p>
            <p>There are ſome that bring forth fruit, but it is fruit to the fleſh, and the wicked one, but I hope you are not of that number: Theſe ſeparate themſelves from the life of the true vine; theſe have no fellowſhip nor true memberſhip with the church of Chriſt, while they walk as captives to the devil, and ſin; theſe are of the world, and not of the church. If you would have fellowſhip with the church, do not think to have it by outward conformity: Do not think that this will maintain your fellowſhip with Chriſt, without a life of inward holineſs and righteouſneſs; for that day you break with the truth in yourſelves, you break off your fellowſhip with the church of God, and break your peace with God, and can no way be reſtored again to the favour of God, but by an unfeigned repentance; <hi>for the myſtery of faith</hi> is to be kept in a pure <hi>conſcience:</hi> How is my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience defiled, if I wrong not this, or the other man or woman? Some can hold the myſtery of faith; ſo far as it conſiſts in a profeſſion, they can profeſs it, and they preach it; but they have not held the myſtery of faith in Chriſt, ſo as to receive life, and virtue, and comfort from him. You have got the hiſtory of words and doctrines; but as ſoon as you defile your conſcience, by doing evil things, and depart from the principle of grace, you make ſhipwreck of faith.</p>
            <p>But, my friends, as you have a mind to continue and abide in the faith, and in this travel and heavenly journey,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:020309_0174_0FAEF96A09DF9298"/>
I would give you this as a certainty, it may do you good when my head lies low: The way to continue in the church of God, and communion of ſaints, and to retain your peace with God, is to keep a familiar converſe with the truth in your own ſouls, and it will keep you from falling, and lead and guide you in your way, in your travel and journey to Heaven. As the mother, when the child cries after her, but cannot go, takes it by the hand and leads it, ſo if you keep cloſe to the truth, it can lead you through all difficulties, through great buſineſs as well as little, and deliver you from ſnares and temptations, and when you are aſſaulted, it can bring you off clear. As for communion with God, and communion with the ſaints and people of God, it ſtands in that peace, and purity, and keeping a holy frame of mind in your heavenly travel, in the undefiled way, that will at laſt bring you to the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed everlaſting <hi>reſt that remains to the people of God.</hi>

               <salute>My Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU cannot but know and be ſenſible, that a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-day, a day of grace and ſalvation, hath dawned upon you, and that the light of it hath broken through many clouds of darkneſs, which ſometimes you could not ſee through. This is an ineſtimable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy of God unto us, that the light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of ſalvation ſhineth upon a people, that without it muſt be miſerable.</p>
            <p>There hath been a very dark and cloudy day upon our fore-fathers, and alſo upon us, in the days of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. We are apt to wander hither and thither, and to
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:020309_0175_0FAEF96A47BA5908"/>
be turned aſide with the wind of mens' doctrine, that we could not find a reſt, a home or a ſettlement for our ſouls, in order to eternal life. And there are many that have cried unto God, that he would pleaſe to reveal his way, and to make it known unto them; and they have been apt to covenant with the Lord, that if once they come to a certainty, they would walk in it. Unto ſuch as theſe the Lord hath bowed his ear, and hath anſwered them; and in his anſwering the cry of the ſoul, he hath brought ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation near, and hath revealed the power by which he would bring it to paſs, in every particular ſoul that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the goſpel of his Son.</p>
            <p>But now friends, you that are ſenſible of this bleſſed and glorious viſitation of his goſpel-day, in which <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is brought near,</hi> it is needful for every one to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their own hearts, whether they have really received the goſpel; whether they have received and embraced the great bounty, and unſpeakable bleſſings of the goſpel, with which the Lord God of life hath viſited us, or whether they have rejected it. For though it is our happineſs to know the viſitation of life, yet it doth not follow that every one that is viſited will be made an heir of it; for <hi>there are many that fall ſhort through their unbelief.</hi> There are many that have received the goſpel, who do diſobey the goſpel of Chriſt, and ſo have not eternal life by it.</p>
            <p>When people come to this ſerious examination of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves herein, then the light and grace, that comes from Chriſt unto every one of us, both to him that rejects it, as well as to him that receiveth it, that will make known to them their ſtate and condition, with reſpect to the goſpel of Chriſt. For there are a great many, that by an alienation of their minds from the light of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, are apt to be miſtaken in their ſtate, and to make a better judgment of themſelves, and of their ſtate inwardly, than really it will amount to in the day that the Lord ſearcheth and trieth them. But they that make a judgment of themſelves, by the openings and diſcoveries that they have through the light of Chiſt Jeſus (for ſo we are to do in this weighty matter) they make a judgment of their ſtate and condition, according to the evidence that the Spirit
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:020309_0176_0FAEF96C69BD0348"/>
of God bears to their ſpirits; and this I hope you will all ſay is a moſt certain way. For if we go to compare ourſelves one with another, and ſay, I am better than thee, and that man is better than I, here we are liable and ſubject to a great many errors, where there ought to be none. But if we come to meaſure and determine our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate and condition, by the evidence of the Spirit of God, bearing witneſs with our ſpirits, here we have a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to place an infallible and certain judgment upon. And they that are obedient to the goſpel of Chriſt, are capable of giving a ſound judgment of their ſtate, becauſe they are made partakers, through Chriſt, of that grace, and light, and truth, which they ſhould be obedient to; and they are brought into a kind of knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their duty, whether they do it or no. And this knowledge, and this underſtanding that God hath given them, makes them capable to paſs a right judgment upon their own ſtate. They will not call it a good ſtate, if it be an evil ſtate; and they will not call it an evil ſtate, if it be a good one. They know it is good by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of truth in their judgment.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince there are ſo many uncertainties in the world, and that men are ſo apt to take hold of an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of judging and determining, even in matters relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſouls: There is a greater aptneſs in people to take hold of uncertainties, in judging about the matters of their ſouls, than in thoſe things that relates to their bodies. Seeing people are ſo liable to it, it can do none of us harm to exhort one another, and move and ſtir up one another, to make a calculation of our ſtates, by ſomething that will not deceive. There are abundance deceived in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as well as other countries; we ſhall not need to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foreign parts to find people deceived and deluded. It will not be amiſs to ſay, the drunkard, the ſwearer, he liar, the oppreſſor, the proud, and the malicious, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: If they were not ſo, they would never be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the wicked one; the author of all evil, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, in that they ſhould think to go on in theſe things, and cry <hi>peace, peace,</hi> to one another, and in their own ſouls: This is a great deluſion; and the devil is the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:020309_0177_0FAEF96D41DC49B0"/>
great deluder that they are deluded by: And it would be worth the while to find out <hi>that</hi> which would make a man think himſelf in a happy ſtate, and hope to enjoy eternal life, with God and Chriſt; and when he goes on in ſin and iniquity, it would be worth the while to find out the deluſion.</p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo proper to turn every one to the grace of God, as <hi>to ſearch their own hearts, and try their ways.</hi> This is that which will diſcover their thoughts, and make them known to themſelves: This is God's grace and gift to men while they are yet ſinners and diſobedient; he doth not withhold his grace, but gives his grace, and light and truth, <hi>even to the rebellious: He gives gifts to men, even to the rebellious,</hi> that he might have a place and dwelling among them, that they might know there is a God <hi>that ſearches the heart, and tries the reins,</hi> and judges all unrighteouſneſs. If God hath given thee ſo much grace, that he might have a dwelling in thy heart, ſhould not that reſtrain thee from ſin, that the devil, by his temptations, might not defile thee, and unfit thee for the kingdom of God? When the Lord comes to ſearch the heart, it is in order to the purging of it, and the taking away of iniquity and ſin, that would unfit thee for his kingdom. This is a better way, and more excellent than living to the fleſh, and fulfilling the luſts thereof. Let people live ever ſo much to their own corrupt wills, in pride, wantonneſs, looſneſs, and the vanity of their minds, they will not find ſo much true ſatisfaction and delight, as in living a holy life, living in the fear of God, and avoiding ſin, and keeping themſelves from the temptations and ſnares of the devil.</p>
            <p>This is a more excellent way; and it is our work and buſineſs to declare to people this more excellent way, which all, one time or other, will confeſs. This is irkſome, ſome will ſay; this will abate my pleaſure and delights in the world, and ſpoil my ſecular intereſt. If it were not for this reaſon, they would grant it were better to live a holy life, and to live in the fear of God, than live in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the devil; and their carnal intereſt lies in the way, and weighs down the ſcale, but it is becauſe thou joineſt with it, otherwiſe the devil, and all the powers of hell,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:020309_0178_0FAEF96D534D6800"/>
could not weigh it down. If people would conſider theſe things ſeriouſly, they would ſay, it is better to ſerve God, that made them, and gave them life, and breath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than him that would deſtroy them; and then when they meet with the pleaſures and delights of the world, that the devil lays before them, they would never weigh down the ſcale againſt a Divine Reaſon: If thou wilt give thy heart to it, and ſeriouſly conſider it, it will weigh down the ſcale againſt all temptations to live in ſin, and pleaſure, and jollity. If thou wilt but join with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Reaſon, that tells thee theſe carnal pleaſures and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are not neceſſary for thy ſoul, but it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to live a holy, heavenly life, and to ſerve the Lord that gave thee life, and breath, and all things; that hath vouchsafed thee manifold preſervations. If thou wilt but join with the Divine Reaſon, and hearken to that which opens the truth in thine own heart, all the devil can do, cannot make thee ſerve him; for the devil hath no coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, no power to force thee to commit ſin; he cannot make a man work wickedneſs againſt his will; he muſt cloud the underſtanding, and work upon the will, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and entice the affections by earthly things. So thou canſt not be forced by the devil againſt thy will, to yield to his temptations, to commit any ſin; but thou muſt ſay, I will do it.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, when the underſtanding is bribed, and the will allured and ſeduced by the devil's temptations, there is no withſtanding them. But on the other hand, if men would give up themſelves to the power of God, they would have Divine Aſſiſtance; and joining with that power, they would <hi>be more than conquerors.</hi> Therefore we cannot but be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to keep in the way of the Lord, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the power of God, which will preſerve you, and give you victory over all the temptations and aſſaults of the devil; and without this power you cannot overcome; but if you have the aſſiſtance of this power, nothing will be too hard for you. When you are in ſtraits, and in a helpleſs condition, you ſometimes are ready to cry out, I ſhall not overcome my ſpiritual enemies; I ſhall never get victory over ſin and the world,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:020309_0179_0FAEF96E17F64ED0"/>
the fleſh and the devil; and I ſhall never be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his temptations, but they will prevail over me all my days. No wonder you make this concluſion, when you have parted with your truſt and dependence on that power that is able to overcome the devil, and baffle him in your thoughts, words and deeds.</p>
            <p>You may be ready to ſay, alas! of myſelf I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; I am not able of myſelf <hi>ſo much as to think a good thought;</hi> yet by Divine Aſſiſtance, I do many times think good thoughts. <hi>In me, that is, in my fleſh, there dwells nothing that is good.</hi> Not in my fleſh abſtractly; ſeparate from the power of God, and the Divine Aſſiſtance vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto me. <hi>In my fleſh dwells nothing that is good.</hi> But if you take me as one that hath faith in Chriſt the Mediator, this faith embraceth the tender of the love of God in the Redeemer. And when I have this faith, there dwells a good thing in me; and from this good thing that dwells in me, there flows forth good words and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then you come to be acquainted with a power greater than your own; and if you truſt in it, you will be able to withſtand temptations. When you are tempted to any ſin, you will not only be able to withſtand the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to overcome it too, and to be more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors in your ſpiritual warfare. This relying upon, and truſting in the power of God, is that which we call faith; and this faith is the operation of God.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak in plain words, God will operate upon thy mind, and make thee know, that this is his power, light, truth and grace, by which he would ſave thee. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God hath wrought and opened unto thee in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is thy duty then to belive in it, to put thy truſt and confidence in it, to be delivered. But though faith be offered unto me, yet it is not forced upon me; God hath offered faith to all men, but he doth not force it upon any. All have an opportunity offered to them; if they will but join with it, they may have ſaith wrought in them, and be fitted and prepared for the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>There are many that are convinced of the truth of the doctrine that we preach to them, but they do not get into
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:020309_0180_0FAEF96ED4910B90"/>
the power of the truth; they will hear us preach of the power of truth, and will hear what this man ſaith, and what the other man ſaith; and this will ſerve their turn, that they may talk of religion, and make a profeſſion: But they do not ſeek after that power that ſhould enable them <hi>to work out their own ſalvation.</hi> Theſe perſons grow in knowledge, but they do not grow in grace; they will embrace truth as far as doctrine and words will go; they have profeſſed it, and they have ſuffered reproach for it, and yet they have not received the truth in the love of it; they cannot reach to the power of it; they glory in their knowledge and in their underſtanding, but they come not to that which ſanctifies them; they are not able to reſiſt the devil, and to ſtand againſt his temptations; when a temptation comes, they join with it, but they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: They come to the knowledge of truth in words, but they come not to the knowledge of the power of it in their hearts and minds, ſo as to make them prepared veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels for God's honour; God is more diſhonoured by them than by thoſe that never profeſſed his name: They fall into the temptation of the devil, and never diſcern the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God's power in their own hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is another error as great as this; there are a great many that when the Lord's power hath wrought in their hearts, and they have truth opened to them in the power of it, yet they have not believed in it, they have not had faith wrought in their hearts, they have not truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it, nor relied upon the power; ſo they are weak and feeble, they have little faith, which is next to none at all. If they have ever ſo much knowledge, how eaſy can the devil tempt them to ſin, if they have no faith; <hi>this is the victory,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>that overcomes the world, even your faith.</hi> This is not my victory, that I ſee the ſubtilty and wiles of Satan, and know much; but that which is my victory is my faith: My truſt is in the power of God, and my reliance upon him who is God, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier than all the ſtrength of men and devils; that God who knows my heart. If I be faithful to him, and rely upon him by faith, I ſhall reſiſt the devil, and withſtanding his temptations, obtain victory over them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="unknown:020309_0181_0FAEF96FA4D75DB0"/>This power you may have by the goſpel; but then you muſt be true to the power of it in yourſelves; for I do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between the goſpel, as it is a doctrine and word preached, and an inviſible, divine power working upon men by the preaching of the goſpel; you will all hear the goſpel preached, though you be ever ſo proud and high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you will ſay it is true; but you can never come to the ſaving knowledge of the goſpel itſelf, till you find it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly upon yourſelves.</p>
            <p>We do not pretend to any power of opening mens hearts, as God opened the heart of Lydia; but when people come to wait upon God with a ſerious and religious mind, you will find the power of the word working effectually upon you, and ſo the goſpel <hi>will become the power of God</hi> to your <hi>ſalvation.</hi> This is, and ſhall be my prayer, for all religious aſſemblies, that the Lord will be pleaſed to teach them, by his inviſible word, and beget living deſires in them towards himſelf, and bring them to an eſteem of holineſs and righteouſneſs, that they may adorn the goſpel of Chriſt, by living goſpel-lives; for want of this, what diſhonour have men brought to God, and what reproach upon the goſpel. O! that people would come to hear the word preached, with deſire to profit by it, and ſay, Lord, do me ſome good this day, give me a powerful refreſhing viſitation at this time; give me ſome living experience of thy Almighty Power working upon my heart, that I may nor be led by this man's word, or that man's opinion; for if they miſtake, I ſhall be miſtaken: But if I build my faith upon what God in his word reveals to me, I ſhall infallibly know what I am to believe and practiſe, and I ſhall receive from God ſome good thing, and I ſhall <hi>know what is the good and acceptable will of God;</hi> I ſhall find that there is power in the goſpel <hi>for building me up in the moſt holy faith,</hi> and that <hi>it is mighty, through God, for the pulling down of the ſtrong holds of ſin and Satan,</hi> and I ſhall <hi>ſee the ſalvation of God brought near to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the goſpel becomes the power of God, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the hearts of men by the operation of the Divine Power, they may diſtinguiſh between that faith that is built upon the declarations of men, and that which is
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:020309_0182_0FAEF970A2CEDF98"/>
wrought by the revelation and diſcovery of the mind of God in their ſouls; this is that which we may bottom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have an anchor ſure and ſtedfaſt in our own ſouls; when I depend upon Chriſt, <hi>the rock of ages,</hi> both of this age, and all other ages, my faith muſt be placed upon him; and when I hear the word of a man, I muſt have an eye to God, that he will reveal his power in my heart; this will make me believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ingrafted word which is able to ſave my ſoul:</hi> I ſhall not only hear the word, but live in obedience to it. What ſignifies it to make a profeſſion that I have the light within, if I do not give obedience to it? For without that, it is all hypocriſy; all pretence to holineſs, or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, all mortification, is but hypocriſy, any further than we find the power of truth making an impreſſion upon our hearts and minds, bringing us to the obedience of faith.</p>
            <p>Let them therefore that profeſs righteouſneſs, live righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and they that hear the goſpel, live in obedience to it; and thoſe that profeſs to be Chriſtians, let them live like Chriſtians indeed: When every one comes to know within himſelf, ſo far as the goſpel hath ſhined upon him, that they have received the truth in the love of it, and love the truth as it is in Jeſus, and are obedient to the goſpel, they ſhall know the ſalvation of it. There is a diſcovery of God's power in the goſpel, and there is a believing of it, and truſting in it; this is that which belongs to a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, this is the beginning and the firſt ſtep to a Chriſtian life; we muſt believe in Chriſt; <hi>for without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> He that believeth, ſhould be careful to walk in the truth that he hath received, and then he ſhall have a teſtimony of the power and virtue of it in his own ſoul. This virtue and power, if he joins with it, hath the government of his heart and life, and gives him victory over the world, and the temptations of Satan.</p>
            <p>You know in the primitive times there were believers that not only held the faith, but <hi>loved by faith;</hi> and by that faith they got victory over all the allurements, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and vanities of the world. <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv, 7, 8, <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a crown
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:020309_0183_0FAEF9710AF35840"/>
of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, ſhall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love its appearing.</hi> I have got the victory and there remains an eternal weight of glory for me.</p>
            <p>My friends, this is our ambition, and all our labour among you, that you may be built up in the moſt holy faith; that you may be brought home to Chriſt, in all your meetings and gatherings together: You ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be enriched with faith, and to have your own ſtore-houſe filled with all the fruits of the Spirit, and not only ſeek for the knowledge of the truth, but be ſubject and obedient to what you know, otherwiſe by your religion you will but hurt yourſelves. And the apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Peter,</hi> i, 12, ſpeaks of knowing the truth, and of being eſtabliſhed in it, and of ſome that <hi>after they had eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, and the latter end with them is worſe than the beginning; for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</hi> There is a power goes along with the preaching of the goſpel, that will enable you to do what you know; the goſpel is a powerful doctrine, whether you know it or not, or whether you ſubmit to it or not, yet pray remember that God's <hi>people are a willing people in the day of his power,</hi> they are a certain ſort of people that are devoted to God, and ſubmit all their worldly honours, intereſts, profits and pleaſures, to the pleaſure of God, and deſire no other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or happineſs, but to enjoy his preſence and favour; they are ſatiſfied with this, and they are a happy people, being made <hi>a willing people in the day of God's power;</hi> they are willing to deny themſelves, to take up a daily croſs and follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and have <hi>ſalvation</hi> upon his terms.</p>
            <p>There are a great many profeſſors that have notions, and out-ſide appearances, but they want that virtue, and life, and power, that ſhould ſettle them in religion, and a love of the truth. The Lord that knows our hearts, knows that our labour and travel among you hath been deſigned for your good, and <hi>that our hearts deſire is, that you may be
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:020309_0184_0FAEF971CCD581D8"/>
ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> We would have peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſider, and attend and hear what God ſpeaks, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>Pray come and make it your work and buſineſs the reſt of the time you have to live, <hi>to work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> that when Chriſt comes, you may ſay, <hi>come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> purify me and ſanctify me, and prepare me to be preſented to the Father <hi>without ſpot, and blameleſs;</hi> the day is coming that this will be the deſire of every one of you.</p>
            <p>And it is the earneſt breathing and deſire of my ſoul, that every one of you may have an eye unto the Lord, and he will look down from Heaven, and have regard to the cry and the ſighing of the needy ſoul. God will ariſe, and find out the people that breathe after him, and that deſire to be reconciled to him, through the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt; the Lord loveth to find out ſuch a people, and I am glad to preach to ſuch a people the glad tidings of the goſpel, and to teach as God hath taught me; <hi>good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach and guide you in the way which you ſhould go.

before the Lord in this goſpel-day that ſhines upon you; love the appearance of God, and prize it, though it hath not been ſo glorious to you, as to ſome others, yet deſpiſe not the day of ſmall things: live in ſubjection to that grace that the Lord hath given you, and the Lord will give you more grace, and pour out his Spirit, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply his bleſſings upon you; the Lord hath <hi>begun a good work in you,</hi> and he will <hi>carry it on to the day of Chriſt,</hi> and will vouchſafe to bring the glorious day of his viſitation upon you.</p>

            <p>IT is man's great happineſs in this world to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, with the Lord that made him, from whom he hath life and breath here, and his eternal welfare hereafter; this doubtleſs every one will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one time or other, that peace with God is a great jewel, and the beſt eſtate and riches. It is the great deſire of every one that they may attain to this one time or other; and there is a great neglect of happineſs among the ſons and daughters of men, in not ſeeking of it, and not labouring
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:020309_0186_0FAEF97376F35E18"/>
to attain it while it is to be had; Oh! how many trifle away their time about ſliding and periſhing objects, and they know at the ſame inſtant that they are yet deſtitute of the favour of God, and peace with him. Oh, friends! the very thoughts and conſideration of the worth of this jewel, and of the miſery of being without it, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of our time while it is to be attained, might put every one upon a ſerious, diligent enquiry after the way and means whereby they might attain it, that ſo they might have a reſting-place for their ſouls, and ſatisfaction to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, that it ſhall go well with them, when time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>And they that come to this conſideration, and are reſolved in their hearts and minds, that they will labour after this, and ſet their whole endeavour after it, they will in the firſt place ſeek <hi>the kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof:</hi> Theſe do need a daily encouragement in their way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and there is nothing on the Lord's part wanting to ſuch ſouls, but that they may attain their deſire.</p>
            <p>But alas! this hath been, and is ſtill the miſery of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, they are ſeeking after peace with God, but they err in the way to it, they do not ſeek in that way, nor take hold of thoſe methods, by and through which God hath promiſed peace; you ſhall ſcarce meet with any body, but they would have eternal life and peace with God; we ſhall not need to perſuade people to with for, and to deſire to have peace with God when they ſhall come to die, and lay down their heads in the duſt. There is not a <hi>Balaam,</hi> but he deſires to <hi>die the death of the righteous, and that his laſt and way be like his:</hi> There is not a <hi>Scribe,</hi> or a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> or any that profeſs religion, but they are ſeeking eternal life. The Lord Jeſus did witneſs concerning them, that they were an envious, proud, perſecuting people, yet that they did ſeek after eternal life, and they pitched upon ſome methods and ways whereby they thought to get and enjoy it; but all this was error ſtill, they where out of the way of attaining it, and ſo are a great many people at this very day; they are in a ſtate and condition wherein they are never like to enjoy it; the methods and the ways that they have choſen to themſelves, to find eternal life by, and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:020309_0187_0FAEF9748203BF40"/>
to obtain peace with God, will never anſwer the end.</p>
            <p>And God hath been pleaſed to diſcover to us the many by-ways that people have choſen, and ſeek peace with God by; therefore we are willing at all times, to ſhew people their error in theſe great matters of higheſt concernment to them. If they did err in their way of ſeeking to obtain ſome earthly good, and miſſed their end, they know the price of it, it is but a loſs of ſo much, which if they had taken a right courſe, they might have attained; but it is an unſpeakable loſs, an ineſtimable loſs, if they loſe peace with God, and all the pains and labour they are at to obtain it.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, friends, conſider theſe things, they are of great weight, and you will ſay ſo one day or other; for, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>what will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> O! How ſad is it to conſider, that a man hath not made proviſion for his ſoul, that he hath not a place of reſt for his immortal ſoul, and that the arms of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt are not open to receive his ſoul, when his body can retain it no longer! If this be a man's ſtate when he comes to die, it had been better for him that he had never been born: Men may live and gather riches, and enjoy a plentiful eſtate; but if they be deſtitute of the favour of God, and peace with him, what will they do with theſe periſhing enjoyments? They cannot poſſibly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy themſelves with theſe tranſitory, viſible things; but if theſe perſons only mind their bodies, and neglect their ſouls, do they not <hi>live like the beaſts that periſh?</hi> The beaſt ſeeks after his meat, and when he finds it, he eats it with delight and pleaſure, and in a little while he lies down and dies, and there is an end; ſo it is with careleſs ſouls, that have no regard to their future ſtate; but they ſay, <hi>let us eat, and drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we ſhall die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! that every one of us did apply our hearts ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the conſideration of the weight of theſe things that concern our eternal ſtate; if perſons did this, then they might come to an enquiry into their own ſouls, what method and way is moſt ſafe for the attaining of ſo bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an end. For you know there are abundance of people, if you look up and down in the world, you will ſee
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:020309_0188_0FAEF974C8573548"/>
every body almoſt hunting up and down in ſome way of religion or other, and are engaged in religious performances: What is the matter? what would you have? We would have peace with God here, and everlaſting reſt hereafter in the kingdom of Heaven; that we would have. Thus have the nations been ſcattered and driven up and down in the purſuit of happineſs and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>There is a general belief amongſt people, that there is a Heaven, and a Hell, and that they muſt have their part in one of them; there are none that deſire a portion in the <hi>lake that burns with fire and brimſtone.</hi> Thoſe prophane wretches that cry to God to damn them, they do not mean what they ſpeak, they would be ſaved for all that; every one will cry at laſt, Lord have mercy upon me, if he hath but time to ſay ſo: Let us cry, Lord have mercy upon me now; Lord beſtow thy ſavour upon me; <hi>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon me;</hi> Lord touch my hard heart, and ſoften it and break it, by the power of thy Spirit; <hi>open mine eyes, that I may ſee the wonderful things of thy law;</hi> open mine ears, that I may hear thy voice. It is good for people to make uſe of time while they have it; whoſoever calls upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved, and God will <hi>pour out his wrath upon thoſe that call not upon his name.</hi> He that calls upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved; and God gives great encouragement to people to ſeek after him.</p>
            <p>What mean you by ſeeking after God? I have gone to church, and ſaid my prayers; I have gone in the way which my fathers have led me, and directed me, I hope I ſhall find mercy at laſt; I am a believer, I believe in Jeſus Chriſt that died for my ſins, and roſe again for my juſtification; I hope, through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, I ſhall be ſaved. What mean you by ſeeking after the Lord? Do not we all hear of him, and pray to him every day?</p>
            <p>Is there any thing more common than this, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpeak to one another generally about? as for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral knowledge of God, you and I may ſee to our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that a great many <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Lord, Lord, that are never like to enter into the kingdom of God. If all that take the name of God in their mouths, ſhould enter into the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:020309_0189_0FAEF976A1E087F8"/>
kingdom of Heaven, it would be a very foul kingdom: If all the drunkards and whoremongers of <hi>England,</hi> and all prophane ungodly perſons, that will take the name of God in their mouths, ſhould enter into the kingdom of Heaven, it would be a very unclean and impure king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; there is <hi>nothing enters</hi> there <hi>that is unclean, that is abominable, that loveth to make a lie.</hi> So that there muſt be ſome more peculiar people that ſhall have an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant entrance into the kingdom of God; and there muſt be ſomething that will entitle them to it. For you may remember our Saviour ſaith, <hi>no man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son ſhall reveal him.</hi> So much as may be known of God by works, you and I may know, without the revelation of Chriſt; we need not wait for this knowledge, we can have it by books; we can have it by Chriſt's revelation. Nothing would ſerve ſome in our Saviour's time, but eternal life; and our Lord Jeſus bids them <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures, for in them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you think to have eternal life, and they are they which teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify of me.</hi> Yet for all the profeſſion they made, he tells them, <hi>no man hath ſeen God at any time, neither ſeen his ſhape, nor heard his voice;</hi> they were ſtrangers to God, though they had a general knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>So it is at this day; there is a general knowledge of God, and people hope to obtain peace with God, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Their parents and their tutors have inſtructed them in the principles of Chriſtianity, and about the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God; but all this will not bring a man to a ſaving knowledge of God, and reconciliation with him: For a man that is as wicked as the devil can make him, knows theſe things, and yet may be a ſervant of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and do his work; he is not born again, and become a child, In all his external knowledge. Now he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to come to the true, ſaving knowledge of God, our Saviour hath told us, <hi>that none knows the Father but the Son, and him to whom the Son will reveal him;</hi> this is a ſure way to come to the true knowledge of God, by Jeſus Chriſt; he hath the key that openeth the heart, and he will bring us to the true knowledge of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Chriſt hath</hi> the key of David, <hi>which openeth, and
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:020309_0190_0FAEF9776DD6D918"/>
no man ſhutteth; and ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi> He can bring us to behold the glory of God in his own face; without him we are never like to come to the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
            <p>Poor man is in a lapſed, fallen ſtate, he is fallen into ſin, and is in a ſtate of alienation from God, and therefore he cannot come to him but by a Mediator; <hi>there is one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and he muſt make peace for him, elſe he will never have it: How then ſhall we come to Chriſt, if he is the only means, and there is no other by which we may come to the knowledge of God, as the ſcripture ſpeaks? Hearken to it, how may we come to Chriſt? I anſwer, you will never come to him; if he firſt come not to you, you will never be able to do it. It is not coming to Chriſt, when you ſay, you do believe that Chriſt died and roſe again, and aſcended up into Heaven, and ſits at the right hand of God, and lives forever to make interceſſion for his people, and to read thoſe words and doctrines which he preached up and down at meetings, and ſolemn aſſemblies; but if you believe that he is <hi>the eternal Son of God, and the author of eternal ſalvation to all that obey him,</hi> you muſt come to him, and entirely give up your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his glory and ſervice; without this, you cannot come to him, nor will he bring you to the Father: Chriſt is come near to us, he ſtands at the door of our hearts, and he ſtands and knocks: <hi>Behold!</hi> that is a word that calls for attention, for people to take notice of. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock;</hi> what doſt thou knock for? ſaith Chriſt, that thou mayeſt open the door of thy heart; <hi>for if any man open, I will come and ſup with him, and he with me, and my Father will come to him, and we will make our abode with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now people are loth to be at this pains and trouble, to open the door of their hearts to Chriſt, for they will not believe it is Chriſt that knocks, and that rebukes and checks them, when they refuſed to open to him; when they find ſomething within that reproves them for their ſin, and doth condemn them that they cannot be at quiet, they will never believe that this is Chriſt: How can this be Chriſt? they ſay, He is aſcended up to Heaven, and he is at the right hand of
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:020309_0191_0FAEF977C87FF2F8"/>
God the Father: Will you make me believe that this is Chriſt knocking at the door of my heart? I cannot believe it: But what ſaith our Saviour, <hi>unleſs you believe that I am he, you ſhall die in your ſins:</hi> For there is nobody elſe can help you out of them</p>
            <p>There is a two-fold conſideration that we are to have of Chriſt; one is, as he was <hi>made of a woman, made under the law;</hi> and another conſideration of Chriſt is, as he is the eternal Son of God. Men have very groſs thoughts of Chriſt, to think, that becauſe he is in Heaven, therefore he cannot be here too: They meaſure him by themſelves; they know becauſe a man is at London, therefore he cannot be at York at the ſame time. Thus theſe men object, if Chriſt is in Heaven, how can he be here? His doctrine and precepts are here, let us make uſe of them all; he will come again at the day of judgment; but this is a day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Doth not he judge you now? <hi>He is the judge both of quick and dead, and he is the ſearcher of hearts, and the trier of the reins;</hi> ſo that thou canſt not think an ill thought, but he will tell thee of it; he is nearer to thee than the wife of thy boſom, or thy huſband that is near to thee: Huſband and wife may think an ill thought, but they cannot tell one another of it; but Chriſt is one that comes ſo near thee, that thou canſt not conceive an ill thought againſt thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but he will tell thee of it.</p>
            <p>This is the Lord Chriſt, as a Spirit, a quickening Spirit, who is made manifeſt in the fleſh: <hi>He hath given to every man a meaſure of the Spirit to profit withal: The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared unto all men.</hi> Notwithſtanding the diſtinction of learned men between common grace and ſpiritual grace, this grace <hi>that brings ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath appeared unto all men.</hi> This manifeſtation of the Spirit and light within, we have from Chriſt. Theſe are the ways and methods that the Lord Chriſt hath taken to approach near to us. Now your own reaſon will tell you, if this be the way and means that Chriſt takes to approach near to us, we cannot take another way to approach to him: If Chriſt hath taken, I ſay, this way to approach to us, by the light and manifeſtation of his own Spirit, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth us of ſin: If this be Chriſt's way of coming to us,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:020309_0192_0FAEF97899996BC8"/>
there can be no other way of our coming to him, but by the ſame method of his grace. He ſaith, <hi>if you have the light, believe in the light.</hi> I have the light, I am enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is ſomething that diſcovereth my evil thoughts: Why muſt I believe in the light? That you may be children of the light, as our Saviour ſpeaks; they that are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the light ſhall have it for their inheritance; and they that are children of darkneſs, muſt have darkneſs for their inheritance: While we have the light, we muſt believe in it, and we ſhall be made children of the light: God hath ſent his Son, and the Son hath ſent his Spirit and his heavenly grace into our hearts, that we may draw near to him, and be directed how to attain acquaintance with him, and to do that which pleaſeth God, and come to be in union with him, and do the works of God. This is that which God requires of us, <hi>that we will believe on him whom he hath ſent;</hi> that we may embrace the light, and believe in the light, in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Pray what do you mean by believing? There is ſomething within me checks and reproves me for ſin, and calls me off from it, and bids me turn over a new leaf: Muſt I hearken to this? Is this that which you mean by believing? As to this degree of believing, they that reject it now, ſhall believe it heareafter; for all the world at laſt, and the damned in hell ſhall certainly confeſs that there was grace, and light, and means afforded to them, and they might have gone farther, and eſcaped that miſery that they are fallen into.</p>
            <p>But there is a more precious faith that I would have you partake of, a <hi>faith that worketh by love.</hi> Since the Lord hath been ſo gracious as to extend his mercy and love to me, I am ſo taken with the love of God, that I will be obedient to him; this faith that worketh by love, is the ſaith of God's elect; that by which we may obtain victory over our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and luſts, and over ſatan and the ſnares of the world; when we are come to cloſe with the grace of God, and to believe in Chriſt, this is well: But we muſt alſo yield obedience and ſubjection. Yet when faith hath brought forth obedience, you cannot be juſtified by it, you cannot be ſaved by your obedience, but Chriſt alone: <hi>He is the
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:020309_0193_0FAEF9799C8E9F88"/>
author and finiſher of our faith,</hi> and a Mediator from firſt to laſt.</p>
            <p>Now all that come to cloſe with the appearance of Chriſt in their own heart, they have laid hold of the method ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their coming to him. It is Chriſt they muſt hear; he is come ſo near to men that they may hear his voice, and hear him tell us our very thoughts. Why ſhould not I hear him when he checks me and reproves me for ſin? He comes near and tells me that I have done amiſs; Lord, I have done iniquity, I will do ſo no more. Thus Chriſt converſeth with his people, and doth not only check and reprove them, when they do that which is evil, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades them and enables them to do good. He is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, he is a middle perſon, and hath taken fleſh upon him, that he might reconcile them to God, that do believe in him.</p>
            <p>Now, when we come to have acquaintance with God, and have choſen him to be our God, he teaches us to do what is good, and reproves us for what evil we have done. Who can chooſe a better guide, to lead him into acquaintance with God, than Chriſt that is converſant with us, piercing into our thoughts, and ſpeaking to us? I may hear him with the inward ear of my heart; when I do evil he checks me for it, and tells me the thing I ſhould ſeek is of ineſtimable value; and if through my unbelief and careleſneſs I miſs of it, it had been better for me that I had never been born; now we are in the way of coming to receive the end of our faith, the ſalvation of our ſouls, <hi>let us not neglect ſo great ſalvation.</hi> No man can ſave himſelf, nor ſave the ſoul of his brother, nor find a ranſom, nor procure an offering for the expiating of his ſin; therefore let every one that would have his ſin expiated and pardoned, and cannot be ſatisfied and quieted, till he hath peace with God; let him come to Chriſt, the Mediator, and come with faith and truth in the inward parts, and ſubmit to him, and be willing to be ruled by him, then Chriſt will ſave him, <hi>and preſent him without ſpot and blemiſh</hi> to his father.</p>
            <p>Conſider that thoſe that are the people of God, are led by the Spirit of God. They miſs their way to reconciliation with God, that love any other way, or think to come to God any other way than by Jeſus, the Mediator, their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:020309_0194_0FAEF97A16227548"/>
will be loſt: Therefore I muſt exhort and perſuade you that are out of the way, that you would take God's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and come into God's way. The terms, I have told you, are made already; the bargain is not to make now; I will give ſo much to be at peace with God, or I will part with this or the other thing that is dear to me. No, the agreement is made between God and Chriſt, and his <hi>covenant is ordered in all things, and ſure;</hi> and his covenant ſtands ſure with none, but thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus. There was a covenant made with <hi>Abraham; in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> The promiſe is made to the ſeed, that is, to thoſe that are in Chriſt; the faithful are counted the ſeed; now the faithful are thoſe that are obedient to Chriſt, who is the ſeed of the promiſe, <hi>in whom all the families of the earth are bleſſed.</hi> They muſt come to Chriſt the ſeed, they muſt not rebel againſt him; they muſt come to him, and believe in him; be there never ſo many nations and families in the world, the promiſe is not to them, <hi>but to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the way for people to lay hold of, for their coming into acquaintance with God, which is of ſo great neceſſity before they die; they muſt come to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his Spirit in their own hearts. We need not go to this and the other learned man, and enquire of this and the other ſort of people; but we muſt cry to God for help and direction, and come unto him, and give up all the powers and faculties of our ſouls to him, to be governed by him: God will have ſervants that will be obedient to him; if ever we come to obtain ſalvation, we muſt have another maſter, <hi>one is your maſter, even Chriſt;</hi> I muſt come under the government of Chriſt, and he muſt lead me, and rule me, if I will be a child of God.</p>
            <p>When people come to ſee there is no effectual way, but ſubmitting to the grace of God in their own hearts, and yielding themſelves up to the dictates of the Spirit of Chriſt in their ſouls; when they come to this, there are many hazards and difficulties to be encountered with; there is the appearance of the croſs of Chriſt, and we
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:020309_0195_0FAEF97AD1BEA9E0"/>
muſt take up this croſs if we will follow Chriſt, and be obedient in all things unto him. This is that which will kill all my pleaſure, lay waſte all my religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy my hopes; I muſt be like a man that built a houſe without a good foundation; I muſt pull it all down again, and I muſt come to build up again upon a new foundation.</p>
            <p>Here many have turned aſide, the croſs of Chriſt hath ſeemed to them ſo ſharp, and hard and intolerable, that they could not bear it; they would not be at the charge of ſuch a religion; what, muſt I part with all my delights, and my beloved luſts and pleaſures, and all my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts in the world for Chriſt? I cannot part with theſe, theſe things lie in my way, I muſt rather loſe my ſoul than part with what is ſo grateful to me, and join with the light of mine own conſcience, and the truth in my inward parts; what, muſt not I have ſo much as liberty of thought? What, muſt my thoughts be regulated by that which is ſo croſs and repugnant to my mind? Muſt I throw out all evil thoughts out of my heart, and ſuffer none but good thoughts to remain there?

            <p>If there be in you any deſire of peace with God, that you may not go hence before you have attained it, take hold of the preſent opportunity; hardneſs of heart is a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate plague, it comes from a long obſtinate continuance in ſin; when we have <hi>withſtood the day of God's patience and long-ſuffering, and grieved the Holy Spirit of God; then God giveth us up to our own hearts luſts,</hi> becauſe <hi>we will not hearken to the voice of the charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely;</hi> when we ſtop our ears, and will not attend to the calls of God; when men will go on, and nothing can ſtop them, in the career of their luſts and pleaſures, but they will retain their carnal delight and friendſhip with the world; this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart is a deſperate plague; take heed of it, that it doth not overtake you, and bring ruin and deſtruction upon you: <hi>Conſider the patience and long-ſuffering of God, and

let his goodneſs lead you to repentance: Conſider God hath waited to be gracious to you, he hath exerciſed much long-ſuffering and patience towards you;</hi> whereas he might have cut you off long ago, and given you your portion with the damned in hell; but he hath hearkened to the Mediator that hath pleaded for you; he hath extended his patience and long-ſuffering to <hi>the wicked and rebellious alſo;</hi> and for this reaſon, the apoſtle tells us, that Chriſt is <hi>the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the patience and long-ſuffering of God hath been lengthened out to all, and we have not improved it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath been ſenſible of the inward ſtrokes and rebukes of God for ſin, and of the inward calls of his grace to bring us to repentance; but we have not regarded theſe calls, nor hearkened to the voice of God, ſo as to hear, that our ſouls might live; O! let us not put off our repentance any longer; but <hi>to-day, while it is called to-day, let us hear his voice, and harden not our hearts,</hi> but be of a tender heart; let our hearts be ſoftened, and tendered under the word of God, and under the ſtrokes of his judgment. If ever the Lord bring you under a tender frame, you will receive the word of God with meekneſs, and mix it with faith; then it will work effectually to the amendment of your lives; it will work faith in thoſe that are unbelievers, and ſtrengthen the faith of thoſe that believe. Then we ſhall have cauſe to bleſs the Lord, and praiſe and magnify his great name for his patience, long-ſuffering and mercy, which at this day he hath lengthened out, and graciouſly extended to us.</p>

            <p>THE inſtitution of the Chriſtian religion was for this purpoſe, that holineſs and righteouſneſs might be brought forth in the earth; that God, through his Son Jeſus Chriſt, might take delight in the ſons and daughters
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:020309_0197_0FAEF97E8CF064A8"/>
of men, that they might be reconciled to him; <hi>for that which the law could not do, by reaſon of its weakneſs, God hath had a purpoſe to do by his Son, and to him he gave all power in Heaven and Earth,</hi> that thereby he might be enabled to perform the great work of God, in eſtabliſhing righteouſneſs, and in bringing forth a holy people, to ſerve a holy God. This is the great bleſſing that is come to us, and to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, through our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, that came <hi>to turn every one from the evil of their ways.</hi> That is the way and method by which our Lord Jeſus accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end of his coming, and the will of his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Moſes</hi> and all his waſhings, offerings, and ſacrifices, could not make clean and purge the conſcience; and by all his offerings and ſacrifices, he could not reconcile us to God: <hi>But Jeſus, by his once offering himſelf did forever perfect them that are ſanctified; and by one offering, reconciled us to the Father,</hi> and ſo brings forth a holy generation unto God, through regeneration and the ſanctification of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the Lord hath been pleaſed in the riches of his grace to open this new and living way, for man's return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again into unity and fellowſhip with his Maker, the queſtion, my friends, that I would put to you on the behalf of God, is, for all of you to conſider, whether it is not beſt for every one of us to lay hold of ſalvation, to lay hold of that bleſſing wherewith the Lord hath bleſſed us, that ſo the principal inſtitution of Chriſtianity might not only be named and ſpoken of, but might come to be enjoyed and witneſſed in every one of our own ſouls; and that all might wait with expectation on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for fulfilling of this great work in themſelves.</p>
            <p>There is a general notion among people, that Heaven is a holy place, and that nothing that is unclean can enter into it, to have a habitation there, when time in this world ſhall be no more with us; and that time which we have given us, I am ſure is given us of God, as an opportunity of fitting and preparing us for his dwelling-place; and every day and hour of it ought to be employed in that great work, that ſo we might draw nearer and nearer to that ſtate and condition that ſuits and befits that holy dwelling where ſaints and angels, for evermore, praiſe the great and glorious God: So that I
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:020309_0198_0FAEF97F829BB980"/>
am perſuaded you believe, that you and all of us, are to be accountable to God for all the time he hath beſtowed upon us, whether we uſe it to the purpoſes for which he hath given it, or whether we miſpend our time upon thoſe things that are not profitable to us; and upon theſe conſiderations, we had need all of us to take heed to our preſent ſtate that we are come to, and are arrived at in the preſent time; as for the future time, that we all know we are not ſure of; and the future ſtate that we may hope to come to, there is no certainty of it, unleſs there be an improvement of the preſent time, and the opportunities of our preſent ſtate: Therefore every one ſhould apply their hearts unto the ſeeking of wiſdom and underſtanding, and unto God, that he may give us to underſtand our ſtate, and our preſent fitneſs or unfitneſs for the kingdom of glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and of that holy dwelling we hope to enjoy forever.</p>
            <p>If I will but turn my mind inward, to the ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my preſent ſtate and condition, I can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am fit or unfit to approach God's preſence; and if I find I am unfit, I muſt have recourſe to the divine working of that great power, which God hath ordained and appointed for this purpoſe; I muſt come to him to work all my works in me, and for me, according to his good pleaſure; and that he will never do, unleſs it be by croſſing me in my carnal pleaſures and corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for that which pleaſeth man, doth not pleaſe God: And God will not revoke the holy ſcriptures, that tell us, <hi>that they which live in pleaſure, are dead while they live;</hi> they that are indulgent to their own affections, and their own delights, and their own humours, they are not at all ready to pleaſe and glorify God; they are not fitted for it, therefore he never ſanctifies, nor brings any into a true Chriſtian ſtate, but through a daily croſs; ſo that if I am not already fitted and prepared to do that which is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, I may be fitted by taking up a daily croſs, to glorify God here, and enjoy him forever.</p>
            <p>What thoſe things are that you are to do, I need not tell you, nor what you have done. I judge no man: There is one that judgeth, he will tell you if you ask him, what your ſtate and condition is; he will tell the

drunkard, if he ask him, whether he is fit for Heaven; and alſo the proud and haughty perſons whether they are fit for Heaven: Let ſuch as are guilty of theſe or any other ſins, enquire of the oracle in their own boſoms, am not I fit for Heaven, notwithſtanding all this? He will tell thee no, there is <hi>no unclean thing ſhall enter there, nothing that defiles,</hi> nothing that hurts or oppreſſes; the proud, peeviſh, malicious perſon, that is hurtful to others, that hurts his neighbour, is ſhut out. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into Heaven any thing that defileth,</hi> Rev. xxi, 27. <hi>For without are dogs, and ſorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a lie,</hi> Rev. xxii, 15. None ſhall enter into the holy city of God, but thoſe that are purified and purged from all iniquity: Therefore God hath ſent his ſon Jeſus, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none elſe could do it: <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets could not do it, therefore he ſent Jeſus to <hi>bleſs us, in turning every one of us from our iniquities,</hi> and from our evil ways; one man hath this evil way, another that evil way: It is all one to him; his work is to turn every one of us from our evil ways.</p>
            <p>But why then (you may ſay) are ſo few turned from their evil ways throughout Chriſtendom, where Chriſt is believed in, profeſſed, read and heard; that yet ſo few are converted and turned? for we ſee great numbers of liars, ſwearers, drunkards, and unclean perſons among us, where Chriſt is cried up at a mighty rate, and yet peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not turned from the evil of their ways; there is ſomething ſure that is the reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>I would have all of you conſider what the reaſon of it is, that thoſe that profeſs to be Chriſtians, are not turned from the evil of their ways; for Chriſt <hi>hath all power in Heaven and Earth committed to him,</hi> and he is able to do it, and he was ſent from God on purpoſe to do it; but this is a certain truth, it is not done; and what is the reaſon of it? <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not;</hi> what is the reaſon? He hath cauſed his grace to appear to every man in the world, and yet they are not taught by it. Here is an object of faith for all, and God hath offered faith to all men, <hi>ſince he hath raiſed
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:020309_0200_0FAEF8B16104A6E8"/>
up Jeſus from the dead,</hi> yet men have it not: What is the reaſon that this nation, as well as other nations, have been puzzled about it, to find out things that are ſo plain in ſcripture, in relation to the love of God to mankind, and in relation to Chriſt Jeſus the Saviour, and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this work is wrought among us?</p>
            <p>Some ſay there is never a man in the world turned from the evil of their ways; they live in ſin, and they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fixed neceſſity of continuing in it, and lying under it all the days of their lives, for all this belief of the love of God, and the power of Chriſt, and the profeſſion of it: Some ſay there is never a Chriſtian in the world can live one day without ſin, but will defile himſelf with one thing or another; that the devil will prevail over men, and ſin mix itſelf with our prayers and alms, and all our holy duties; ſo that there is nothing clean; nothing pure that We can perform to God. There are others that are not ſo raſh in their judgment, and not ſo inconſiderate, but they will believe ſome men and women may come to a power and ability to withſtand ſatan, and reſiſt him in his temptations; and that there are thoſe that have been turned from the evil of their ways, but they are not; What is the matter? You have ſpent time about this, what is the reaſon you are not turned from the evil of your ways? The devil hath told the people in former days, that the reaſon why men live in ſin, is, becauſe God hath appointed it ſo to be: And that hath ſtopt the mouth of many a plain-hearted tender Chriſtian; they have cried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God under the weight of their ſin, and they ſee no deliverance after all their prayers and tears, becauſe they have been told they cannot do it, and that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it ſhould be ſo, and required them to do what they cannot do; and with ſome the cuſtom of ſin hath taken away the ſenſe of ſin, and they go on to perdition in their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>I hope, my friends, that God hath opened your eyes, and that you have better thoughts of God, than that he hath ſet you a work and a labour to do, and by his eternal power and decree, hath ordained that you ſhould never do it, but damn you after all. Conſider, there are men and women in
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:020309_0201_0FAEF8B1D209D410"/>
bondage and captivity, and God hath ſent his Son into the world to redeem them from all iniquity, and turn them from their evil ways; we are nor turned, what is the reaſon of it? I beſeech you in the love of God, be ſerious in this matter; ſerious you muſt be, one time or other; when you come to the tribunal of God, there muſt be a reaſon given, or if not, you muſt be ſpeechleſs; therefore find it out here. What is the reaſon that I am not turned from my evil ways, ſince God hath ſent his Son Jeſus to do it, and given him power to do it; why then is it not done?</p>
            <p>Some perſons upon enquiry, and after their ſearch, have brought forth this reaſon: They have alleged the great power the devil hath: The devil is ſo ſtrong, and hath ſuch a power to darken their minds, and enchant their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he injects and brings things into their minds before they are aware of it. I confeſs this, and I will ſay a little to it, I will confeſs as much as the argument will bear, that the devil hath great power, and a way of injecting things into the ſpirits and affections of people: He is God's enemy and ours too, and he lies in wait, and will do as much as he can againſt us, that no one ſhall get to Heaven; if we come thither, it ſhall be againſt his will: I have heard ſome magnify the devil's power to ſuch a degree, that he hath ſuch power over a man or woman, that he is able to keep them in ſin all their life, though God hath put forth the exceeding greatneſs of his power for their redemption: This is hard to believe, that the devil is ſtronger than Chriſt Jeſus: Well, as great as his power is, we are in a capacity of knowing a greater power; the apoſtle did comfort the Chriſtians, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the power the devil uſed with them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file them, and keep them from inheriting the kingdom of God, 1. John i. 4. <hi>You are of God, little children, and have overcome, becauſe greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</hi> I would have you believe this; I do believe it heartily, the devil only <hi>rules in the hearts of the children of diſobedience;</hi> and he that hath the Holy Ghoſt in him, hath one greater than he that is in the world: If you believe this, then the queſtion is thus far anſwered, that we have a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, a Deliverer, that is more able to redeem us, than the devil is to keep us in bondage: I hope we are pretty well,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:020309_0202_0FAEF8B329F77050"/>
now we know we have a keeper: We are aſſaulted with the devil's temptations, and they are powerful; how powerful? He hath ſo much power, as he finds in us an inclimation to yield and join with his temptations: If he comes with a temptation to a man or woman that hath no inclination to that thing he tempts them to; if they hate that thing, then there is an end of it: The devil's power lies in this, when he brings a temptation that I have an inclination to, then he hath a party within me; if that be rooted out, what ſignifies his power, let him bring ever ſo many temptations?</p>
            <p>There are many of you that underſtand what I ſay; if a temptation comes to a man to commit an act of uncleanneſs, if he be a chaſte man, there is no inclination in him to yield to it, or join to it, he hates it, it is an abomination in itſelf, and grievous and provoking to God, if he doth it; a man abhors it, then what powerful temptation is it? If it light upon a man of an unclean mind, that is defiled in his heart, he hath not only the devil, but his own luſt and corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to contend with; but if a man believeth in Chriſt, he relies upon him, and he will ſay, Lord, thou ſeeſt I am under temptation; here is a great and powerful temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I can never withſtand it, but I truſt in thy name and power, do thou ariſe and deliver me from it: Thus when God doth ariſe, his enemies will be ſcattered; tho' the devil's power be great, yet there is a deliverer that is ſtronger than he: The reaſon of mens being overcome, doth not lie in the greateneſs of the devil's power, but in the frailty of our nature.</p>
            <p>Some will ſay, that our natures are ſo frail, weak and depraved, that we can do nothing as as we ought to do; this is given for another reaſon, and there is truth in it, but that truth is but a deluſion; they would excuſe themſelves when they have yielded to a temptation, I am weak and frail, I cannot reſiſt the devil; though the devil is not ſtronger than Chriſt, yet he is ſtronger than I, he worketh with all his might, power, and ſubtilty to deceive me, and enſnare me, and overcome me; I am a poor, frail creature, therefore I muſt yield to him: This is a carnal reaſon; as tho' I were to grapple with the devil in mine own ſtrength, and to deliver my ſoul, as if God hath leſt me to myſelf: If thou ſay,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:020309_0203_0FAEF8B351494B00"/>
Lord, thou haſt ſet me to grapple with the devil, and to withſtand his temptations, Lord I am not able to do it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; God will anſwer thee, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, that is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto me by him;</hi> ſo that thou art not to overcome the devil by thine own power and ability: If any man reason thus, his reaſon is out of doors; for we are ſaved by Chriſt, therefore I cannot plead my own frailty, ſeeing God hath provided a <hi>rock</hi> for my defence <hi>that is ſtronger and higher than I,</hi> that I may truſt and rely upon.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee the frailties of our nature is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon, we muſt ſeek further for it yet; and when we come to ſearch narrowly, and to the bottom of our hearts, I will tell you here it reſts; it hath its centre in the perverſeneſs of the will that is in man, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of God; it is the oppoſition of our will to the will of God; we may talk what we will of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Chriſtianity, that we have a mind to be ſaved, and go unto God when we die, and to enjoy the happineſs of Heaven to eternity: We may talk thus; but as long as the perverſeneſs of the will continues, I am the cauſe of my own ruin; if I grow in a profeſſion, this perverſe will, will grow up with me under that profeſſion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any profeſſion; change your judgment and opinion as often as you liſt, this will go along with you; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the bottom of things will come to this, none can overcome the devil, nor be a diſciple of Chriſt, without a daily croſs. When people come to this, to ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking up the croſs of Chriſt, and denying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; when it comes to this, there are ſuch ſhifts and evaſions, and arts that men have to cover themſelves, to make themſelves and others believe, that ſuch and ſuch a thing is conſiſtent with the will of God, and that they may do it, and ſave their own ſouls; but they boaſt of their own deceit, and are glad that they can make a ſhift to deceive their own ſouls; ſo that there is no hopes of their ever being purged and cleanſed, and of having any holy work brought forth by them; but when a man comes to be ſenſible of his ſpiritual condition, and is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and honeſt, he will be ready to ſay unto God, if I
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:020309_0204_0FAEF8B63817C590"/>
be deceived in any thing, open mine eyes. Lord; if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge myſelf in any thing that hath a contrariety to thy holy will, Lord, I beſeech thee diſcover it to me; ſuch a man will lay aſide his own will, if it be contrary to God's will: Now here is one that is a very fit object for Chriſt to work upon; he will not be long before he be ſavingly convinced. When a man comes to the word, he is convinced of ſuch an evil in his conſcience, where nobody but God and himſelf were privy to it, or had any knowledge of it. It is diſcovered that he liveth in ſuch a practice as is contrary to the mind of God. God hath convinced thee, that thou loveſt it, and liveſt in it, and if thou wilt but break off that evil practice, that he hath ſent his Son Jeſus Chriſt to turn thee from every evil way, and to <hi>redeem thee from all iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This truth hath a ſavour in it; and if thou art ſincere and upright, there is nothing for thee to ſay or do, but to ſet thyſelf againſt every thing that is contrary to the mind of God, and thou wilt have light from Heaven ſent to guide thee and direct thee in thy way thither; if thou wilt but receive that grace that is freely given of God unto thee through Jeſus Chriſt, he will certainly purge thee and cleanſe thee from thy ſin, and turn thee from every evil way, notwithſtanding the perverſeneſs of thine own will and the power of ſatan; and he will work in thy heart by his grace, till it hath brought thee off from thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and wrought iniquity out of thee, and ſo bring forth a holy work to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> We cannot pleaſe God without faith, nor with it neither, unleſs it be the gift of God.

               <p>WE are met upon the moſt weighty affair that can be to every one of us, even to wait that we may have a true knowledge of the beginning, carrying on and perfecting the mighty work of redemption, that people may know that redemption is wrought in their ſouls; for every ones ſoul hath been loſt and captivated, and led away from the pure preſence of God; all have been alienated by reaſon of ſin, which hath been an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal wall of partition and hath excluded and ſhut out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy ſouls from the Holy God; all that have been defiled and polluted, they have been excluded from his dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, they have been driven out into the world, and the world hath become a world of miſery, and of diſtraction and confuſion to the ſons and daughters of men; there hath been <hi>anguiſh, tribulation and wrath</hi> upon all their ſouls, and an inſenſibility hath happened unto many, that they have not been apprehenſive of the great depravation they have lain under, and they have not been ſenſible of the glory of that ſtate and condition which they were to have enjoyed; and in that ſtate of inſenſibility they have not ſought after the Lord, but have been <hi>captivated and led away by divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> by which they have wounded their own ſouls more and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:020309_0209_0FAEF8BAD4F7FB20"/>And in ſuch a ſtate as this it is, that the Lord hath found us; he hath ſought us out, and he hath found us <hi>caſt out into the open field, and wallowing, as it were, in our own blood;</hi> and yet this hath been a <hi>time of love;</hi> and he hath manifeſted his love to us in this reſpect, in that he hath awakened us and brought us to a ſenſe of our depraved and deplorable condition, and given unto a remnant to perceive, that there is a <hi>more excellent glory,</hi> a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent enjoyment to be had, than any this world can afford.</p>
               <p>But a great many of thoſe whoſe eyes are ſo far opened, that they can ſee and diſcern a more excellent glory, yet they cannot receive it, for they are not in a capacity for the enjoyment of it; many have the glimmerings, and ſome little light of heavenly things, but they themſelves are earthly: Many perceive there is a holy life, but it is not theirs, for their own life is unholy, and yet they know there is a life that is holy and pure. Hereupon deſires are begotten, by the word of life in the ſons and daughters of men, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator; by him deſires are begotten in people that they might come to enjoy that life of holineſs, that they might not only ſee a better ſtate than what they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, but that they might come to enjoy it, and have it for theirs.</p>
               <p>There is a univerſal deſire in people that they might have eternal life, and they believe there is an eternal life to be enjoyed; but every one hath it not, and the reaſon is, becauſe they are not fitted and prepared for the enjoyment of it; for it is a kind of treaſure that is never put into an unclean veſſel; there muſt be a cleanſing and purifying, that ſo earthen veſſels may come to retain and hold this heavenly treaſure; and when it comes to this, that people muſt be cleanſed and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, here the world turns out to divers means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; ſome have gone to outward waſhings, outward cleanſings and obſervations of this and the other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and when all that hath been done, themſelves being judges, they were yet unclean; when they have done all that lies in their power and ability, towards their waſhing and cleanſing, and towards preparing themſelves,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:020309_0210_0FAEF8BB8F301B78"/>
they have found ſome ſecret teſtimony in their own conſciences that their hearts were ſtill unclean, and that there was defilement ſtill abiding and lodging in the ſecret of their ſouls; and this hath put a great many to a ſtand, what they ſhould do; when they have come to the end of all, they know not what to do: Many have cried ſecretly, what ſhall we do to be ſaved? For all that we can do, cannot ſave us. We have retained this, and the other doctrine, followed this and the other way, and made many obſervations; but all this doth not cleanſe our ſoul, nor <hi>purge our conſciences from dead works,</hi> this will not bring us to the inheritance of that immortal life that will give us ſatisfaction. We hear many ſpeak of ſatisfaction, and of <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory;</hi> but here is a weight and burthen ſtill lies upon our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Therefore, my friends, that all ſuch who are brought ſo far, as to be under ſuch a burthen and oppreſſion, might be informed and come to underſtand, where the true reſt is, and where that power can be found, that is able to anſwer thoſe tender deſires that are begotten in them; for this cauſe hath the Lord our God communicated and given the diſpenſation of the goſpel of his ſon, unto a remnant whom he hath ſanctified, that they might <hi>ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the weary ſoul.</hi> This is not a day to <hi>make a mock of ſin,</hi> this is not a day to make <hi>a covenant with death and hell,</hi> and to reſolve to go on in a wicked life, and to continue in it all their days.</p>
               <p>But yet there are a ſort of people that deſire to have a <hi>word ſpoke in ſeaſon</hi> to them when they are weary. How many are there in our age and generation, that one may reckon of this number, that are ſinners, and overcome by their luſts and corruptions, and by the temptation of <hi>ſatan</hi> and his inſtruments. But they are weary of it, it is a burthen to their ſouls, it coſts them many a bitter tear, many a ſigh, and many a ſad and ſorrowful thought in ſecret, that they ſhould have a ſight of a <hi>more excellent glory,</hi> and of a better life than that of their own, and yet know not how to get into it.</p>
               <p>My friends, that ſame divine word of life, by which any of the people of the Lord, in any age, were ever reſtored,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:020309_0211_0FAEF8BC635BD1A0"/>
redeemed and purchaſed again to the Lord; that word of life muſt have been at work in their hearts, and hath been at work in them, or elſe thou hadſt never been ſo far opened; there hath been ſomething that hath unſtopped thine ears, that thou mighteſt hear; and the reaſon of thy continuance in thy bonds, after thy knowing ſomething that might have freed thee, is, becauſe thou haſt not heartily cloſed with that which hath begun the work, which God, by his redeeming power, hath effected in the hearts of them that believe in Chriſt, and thereby an inclination is raiſed in people to ſeek after the Lord.</p>
               <p>You know what the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>it is not of us ſo much as to think a good thought.</hi> But this all people will grant is a good thought, when a ſinner thinks of turning to God, and leaving his evil ways, if he had power and ability, and cries out, if I knew how to ſtand againſt temptation, I would never ſin againſt the Lord more; this muſt be a good thought in thy mind: How came it there? Who is the author of this thought, you will ſay? This ought to be attributed to the love of God in Chriſt, that he hath convinced and perſuaded us; and that though there is ſin and pollution, yet he hath not ſo forſaken us, as utterly to caſt us off, he hath ſent forth <hi>his quickening Spirit, that is, the Lord from Heaven,</hi> that he might ſtir up and quicken people to conſider their condition, and bring them to a ſenſe of their preſent ſtate, that they may come into a better ſtate than they are in at preſent.</p>
               <p>If this may be granted, that the Spirit of God, and the grace of God, is the author of theſe deſires, then it will be granted at the ſame time, that every one of you ought to be ſenſible, that ſuch ſpiritual deſires ſtirring you, are from the motion and operation of the Spirit of God that hath raiſed them in your ſouls; and then I hope you will grant, that if you had but joined with that Spirit, and with the aſſiſtance of that Spirit, all things would have been poſſible thereunto.</p>
               <p>So that here is the firſt thing that I would have every one ſatisfied about in their underſtandings, whether they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally exempted from any ſuch touches and operations of God or no; for it is ſaid by ſome ignorantly, that a great part of mankind have never had any ſuch divine workings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:020309_0212_0FAEF8BD342A2428"/>
of God upon them, in order to their converſion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not in vain for you to conſider your ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for if you, or I, or any here, be under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that they never had, nor are ever like to have any ſuch divine operations or touches of the ſpirit of life, in order to converſion, then I am ſure you and I had better never have been born.</p>
               <p>If you will conſider with yourſelves, and lay aſide the diſputes of doctors and learned men, you may know the things pertaining to yourſelves. Things relating to others, I may let diſputes alone about them; but as for things relating to my ſalvation, I muſt have a certain knowledge of them. It concerns you, my friends, to know within yourſelves, by an infallible evidence of the Spirit of God, whether you have had ſuch divine touches, workings and operations upon your hearts, as have inclined you to ſeek the Lord. I hope I may believe there are none here but have in their hearts an anſwer; I have had ſuch touches and operations in me: This is great love from God; more than any tongue can ſet forth. You will be ready to ſay, I have not deſerved this; I have not ſo behaved myſelf towards my Maker as to deſerve that he ſhould wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and call upon me. <hi>When wilt thou turn, and amend thy life, and hearken to him that made thee? When wilt thou leave ſerving God's enemy, and ſerve him that is thy rightful Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now this is a great aggravation of our ſin to continue in it, and yet to have a belief that God is ſtill waiting upon us, and that he hath ſuch a kindneſs for us, as now and then to touch our hearts by the inward ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his ſpirit and grace, in order to converſion.</p>
               <p>Now when this is agreed, and men ſettle themſelves in the belief of this, you know what the conſequence will be. When I conſider with myſelf, I that have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe workings, have been rebellious, wicked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to God, yet the Lord is not ſo angry as utterly to caſt me off, but is ſtill waiting to be gracious, by the operation of his ſpirit, to gather me to himſelf, in order to ſanctify me, and heal my backſliding, to cure my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:020309_0213_0FAEF8C0C5EAD4E0"/>
and infirmities, and at the laſt to ſave me, and make me an heir of his eternal kingdom, what is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this love? Why, the next reſolve muſt be this; I will either rebel againſt his grace, and reſiſt his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or I will ſubmit to him; which of theſe is the beſt way, the ſafeſt way?</p>
               <p>Are there not a great many in this age, that are as ſenſible of the workings of God's grace for their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as ever you and I were; that are as ſenſible that God hath called them to holineſs and righteouſneſs, as any of us can be, and yet they have reſiſted the grace of God? They have ſaid in their hearts, we will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to this power, that will make us ſo holy, and ſo watchful, and ſo careful, diligent and obedient, for this very reaſon, becauſe it will croſs my intereſt, it will croſs my pleaſure, it will hinder my preferment in the world, and my reputation among men; and for this reaſon I will not bear this yoke. I would be glad to hope there are none ſuch here, that have made ſuch <hi>a covenant with death and hell,</hi> and yielded themſelves up to the devil, to ſerve him all their days.</p>
               <p>Let us, who are at this time, and at this meeting, under the operation of God's grace, and feel the Lord calling us by his grace, and working upon us by his ſpirit; let us enter together into a holy, ſolemn reſolution, that we will obey this good Spirit, and take him for our leader, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, though it ſhould be to a croſs: Thus people will think, they Will come to this reſolution, when the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is begun in their ſouls, and when they are convinced of their ſin, and their eyes are opened to ſee the way of holineſs; and though they never take a reſolution to walk in it, yet every one ſhall be convinced, and ſee there was a better way than their own, and be convinced by the grace of God one time or other, that in reſpect of God's working of it, it is beginning; but in reſpect of men that ſhould join with the operation of God, it is not beginning, for he hath no deſire to thoſe things which he doth not know, he ſtill depends upon himſelf; but when the ſoul comes to be ſatisfied, that it is the viſitation of God, and joins himſelf to him in a holy reſignation of his own will, and ſaith, this is the Lord, he
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:020309_0214_0FAEF8C2C3F01A38"/>
is come to work upon me, he is come to change and alter the frame of my mind: It is the Lord, let him do what he will; here is a mind brought to ſubmit to the grace of God, God is able to do that for him which he cannot do for himſelf.</p>
               <p>When people come to the right object of their faith, and act their faith upon that object, they every day find a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, a going forward in the work of grace, according to the work of grace in their ſouls; and there is a power that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them to believe; it is not for ſuch to cry, if they had power, they would do more; he that hath the ſpirit of grace, the Spirit of Chriſt, that had <hi>all power in Heaven and Earth given</hi> to him, to put it forth on purpoſe for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of men and women home to God; he that hath this object of faith before him, he will not look for power in his own will and affections to redeem him, he expects a power to be daily miniſtered and diſpenſed to him, as he hath need of it, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him, in all his trials and temptations: He cries, here is a temptation that will carry me away, O Lord help me, <hi>put forth the arm of thy power and ſave me,</hi> plant thy fear in my heart and deliver me, <hi>their eyes ſhall ſee their Saviour,</hi> ſaith the prophet.</p>
               <p>Thus when a man comes to be joined to the right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith, and doth exerciſe and put forth lively acts of faith upon Chriſt, his eyes ſhall ſee his Saviour; the light that ſhines into his heart, diſcovers to him the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and it alſo ſhews him a Reedemer at hand; his Saviour is nigh him, and he truſteth in him, and relies upon him, and ſays, this word of God is in my heart, and I do really believe, that although the temptation that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults me be ſtrong, yet it ſhall not prevail; whether it be the profits, the pleaſures, or the honours of the world. If I put my truſt in this power, I cannot go near the evil; I am a Chriſtian; I have entered into a covenant in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, that I will join with nothing but what God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of: Now when I have repreſented to my mind the temptation of the devil, and that evil which he ſets before me, and I know it is contrary to the mind of God, how can I go into that evil, and break my covenant with
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:020309_0215_0FAEF8C4B84B29D0"/>
God, after I have entered into covenant with him, to love him, ſerve him, and obey him? The power of grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch ſouls, the operation of grace, is ſo powerful, that the temptation comes and goes, and they are ſaved and delivered out of it, becauſe God helpeth them; but if they comply with the temptation, then <hi>tribulation, wrath and anguiſh,</hi> purſues all ſuch as are rebellious and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the will of God.</p>
               <p>Now this redemption is carried on gradually from day to day; the truth that thou believeſt, it operates by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; thou art delivered, firſt from one evil practice, and then from another evil work: But there is a great deal more; thou rejoiceſt and art glad, that thou art deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from one ſin; but thou wouldeſt be more glad to be delivered from them all. I ſpeak to thoſe that are ſerious for their immortal ſouls; when they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves delivered out of one evil, that they were ready to run into, they would be glad if they were redeemed out of every evil; that their croſſneſs and peeviſhneſs, their frowardneſs and wantonneſs were removed: They ſhould be glad to be delivered from all their ſins.</p>
               <p>What do you think, ſay ſome, that a man, while he liveth here, may come to ſee all ſin, all evil and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption brought under, and nothing but holineſs, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and truth remain in him; and that there ſhall be nothing but ſimplicity and innocence? Do you think that ſuch a thing can be?</p>
               <p>Why ſhould not I think ſo? You will grant me, that the power of grace is able to get ſuch power and victory over ſin and corruption, that you may come to hate it as much as ever you have loved it; if you grant me that, the conſequence will follow, he that gave me victory over ſin, can give me power over all ſin. All Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God's power is infinite; the ſcripture teſtifies, <hi>all things to be poſſible to God, with whom we have to do.</hi> If all things be poſſible to God, ſure this is poſſible; there is nothing ſo contrary to God as ſin; and God will not ſuffer the devil always to rule his maſter-piece, man. Mankind is God's maſter-piece, the moſt eminent creature in this lower world, made after God's likeneſs; and though
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:020309_0216_0FAEF8C55BBDE208"/>
the devil hath brought men into his own likeneſs now, yet nothing can be more contrary to the mind of God, than that the devil ſhould have the rule of us, for God would have the government of us himſelf.</p>
               <p>When we conſider the infiniteneſs of God's power, for deſtroying that which is contrary to him, who can believe that the devil muſt ever ſtand and prevail? I belive it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent and diſagreeable with the true faith, for people to be Chriſtians, and yet to believe that Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given, will ſuffer ſin and the devil to have dominion over them; <hi>there is no other name under Heaven by which I can be ſaved,</hi> therefore I have put my confidence in him: If the devil muſt have the rule of me here, then I cannot be ſubject to Chriſt in all things; I may go to meetings, but can never maſter the devil and his temptations; this is as inconſiſtent with the faith of a Chriſtian, as light with darkneſs, and Chriſt with <hi>Belial.</hi> If Chriſtians think themſelves true believers, then let them ſee how far their faith will reach, whether it be like that faith, <hi>which was once delivered to the ſaints,</hi> for by that faith their hearts were cleanſed, and they became free from ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 22. <hi>But now being made free from ſin, and the ſervants of God,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>you have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life;</hi> you were ſervants to ſin, but now you are free from ſin; ſo that this faith is but one, and if men have got another, it will do them no good: Take heed thou art not miſtaken about thy faith.</p>
               <p>I have heard ſome learned men ſay, that a believer is a ſervant of ſin, and he is ever like to be ſo; but he is not at the ſame time free from righteouſneſs, for he hath the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him, and God looks upon him as righteous in his righteouſneſs; there cannot be a more anti-apoſtolical doctrine, I may be a ſervant of ſin, and yet have the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs; I may be a ſervant of ſin, ſay they, yet Chriſt is righteous, he is the righteouſneſs of God, and he <hi>hath fulfilled the will of God, and hath purchaſed ſalvation</hi> for me, and he is the object by which I am made righteous.</p>
               <p>Conſider this, the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:020309_0217_0FAEF8C61112A2D0"/>
will never do me good, till I come to partake of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, till his righteouſneſs be made my righteouſneſs, in me and for me. Chriſt is made <hi>to us of God, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption;</hi> ſo that if a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, one that was a ſinner the other day, come, through faith in Chriſt, to have his heart cleanſed and purged, and true righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs planted in him, where ſin was planted, there ſin, through the blood of Chriſt, is cleanſed and purged away.</p>
               <p>So that Chriſt is made righteouſneſs to me, and not his righteouſneſs barely imputed and reckoned to me; <hi>Chriſt is my wiſdom,</hi> I am a fool without him; Chriſt is made <hi>righteouſneſs to me;</hi> for my good deeds and holy living cannot be acceptable to God till they be done in him, and commended to God by him; the proper work of faith is, to fix the ſoul on him that <hi>worketh all things in us and for us, that worketh in us both to will and to do, according to his good pleaſure;</hi> and it is the good pleaſure of God that we ſhould live in all righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>They that come to receive this faith at firſt, have to receive it from an inward feeling; they have the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the word of God in them; ſo the apoſtle reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons faith, not becauſe ſuch a man heareth, and ſuch a man believeth what ſuch a man preacheth, but <hi>faith is the operation of God;</hi> you may hear me, and a thouſand preach, and you may die unbelievers for all that, except you come to this, to know the operation of God, and the work of faith in you. How doth my heart cloſe with this? How doth my ſoul join with this? What virtue and power do I feel in myſelf? it may be others that preach, feel the power, but do I feel it? if not, I come but to a noiſe and ſound: If people feel not their hearts joining with the word preached, there comes no advantage to them; you read in ſcripture, that <hi>the word preached did not profit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it:</hi> This is your caſe, you come to meeting, and you love to hear the doctrine of truth preached; I tell you, and I will ſpeak plainly to you, unleſs you come to feel the operation of the word of truth in your hearts, you may hear the goſpel, and the word of life preached to you, but it will not profit you much.</p>

                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:020309_0218_0FAEF8C70D9A9EC8"/>How is it poſſible for a man to have a teſtimony againſt drunkenneſs, and yet be drunk? a teſtimony againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and yet be unclean? How can a man hear ſuch a teſtimony and believe it, and yet commit the ſin? He heard it, but did not feel the virtue of it within himſelf, and ſo he did not mortify the ſin that he was inclinable to; but they that come to join with truth, and <hi>with meekneſs receive the ingrafted word,</hi> they find the power and ability of it, they find how able it is to ſave their ſouls, they find how it worketh, not only juſt when they hear it, but it goes along with them, and dwells with them, and they find the virtue of it overſhadowing their ſouls, with the dread and terror of the Lord, not with the words that a man ſpeaks; I do not truſt to them, but here is the power and the fear of the Lord, which will preſerve my ſoul, and keep me in ſafety; this is that which will keep my mind fixed upon him, and keep my mind inward, that I do not gaze about me; ſo that every one may have an infallible teſtimony of what they have heard and known.</p>
               <p>I have known the doctrine of ſeveral ſects that have been among us, and the main thing that many have gone from one people to another about, is this, that they might know what ſuch a man holds forth more than ſuch a one, and they think the truth is more perſpicuous among ſuch a people than other people; if you examine the matter, it is this, who preached and proved his doctrine beſt. Alas! if they did all concur together, and did preach as certain and infallible doctrine as ever Chriſt and his apoſtles preached, this will all do thee and me no good, unleſs we know the power. You know there were thouſands that heard Chriſt preach, as you now hear me, and there were ſome ſo taken with him, that they went away, and ſaid, <hi>never man ſpake like this man.</hi> But were they all Chriſtians? Did they partake of life by him? No, ſome of them were ready to ſtone him.</p>
               <p>Now bring this home and conſider with yourſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are not ſome of you in the ſame ſtate; when you hear truth preached, there is an aſſent and agreement with it in your minds; but when a command comes to be obeyed, and a croſs to be taken up, and ſelf-denial to be ſhewn, or ſome encreaſe of trade lies in the way, let truth go where
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:020309_0219_0FAEF8C7AE78D9C0"/>
it will, you muſt follow your intereſt; there wants ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to fix you in the principle of truth, which is able to ſanctify you and perfect you, that you may be reconciled to God through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>They that are reſigned and given up to truth, it is poſſible for them that they may be ſatisfied; they have an infallible teſtimony <hi>of the ſpirit of truth witneſſing with their ſpirits,</hi> that ſuch a thing is bad, and if they might get the whole world to do it, they will not. What is profit and pleaſure to me? My pleaſure is at God's right hand, and my profit is to get grace, and to <hi>have an abundant entrance into God's everlaſting kingdom.</hi> Thoſe that have the true knowledge of Chriſt, they have profit and advantage, pleaſure and delight enough, which is hid from the world, and ever will be. They are for profit and pleaſure, which they may have with a good conſcience. Thoſe things which God affords them as bleſſings in this world, they deſpiſe them not, but take them with thankſgiving, and uſe them for his glory: But if they cannot have profit or pleaſure without ſinning againſt the Lord and their own conſciences, let thoſe who will, take profit and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>They that come thus to cloſe with truth, they have an infallible evidence within them; they do not conceive it is thus and thus, becauſe ſuch a man ſaith it is ſo; but they have an infallible evidence in themſelves. This is the mind of the Lord; God hath ſignified it by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſealed it upon my ſpirit, and I cannot but know it.</p>
               <p>What, do you profeſs infallibility? Yes, elſe I would hold my tongue; if I did not know what I aſſert infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, I would never preach more; truth may be many times concealed. A man may have wronged and cheated his neighbour, and he not know of it; this man goes away, and his neighbour doth not reproach him; but when he comes to lie down in his bed, he hath a ſting and a reproach in his conſcience, I know I have done him harm. Is not this infallible? Let me conſult ſome learned men, that I may know whether I have told a lie. I need not go to learned men and logicians, to know whether it was a lie; I am infallible in this, I know certainly it was not
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:020309_0220_0FAEF8C84F1EA2D0"/>
a lie; I have a certain evidence, and if a thouſand men tell me to the contrary, I will not believe them. If there be infallibility here, is there not then infallibility in the word of truth? Shall I queſtion it, or doubt it, if I have an infallible teſtimony of it?</p>
               <p>Tho' men have ever ſo little proficiency, if they have it upon ſure terms, and laſting foundations, let a thouſand men come with all their logical skill and ſophiſm, yet they can never remove a man from the witneſs in himſelf. The remnant that God hath brought to this foundation, they have a certainty and infallibility in their obedience, that they pay to the will of God, and in the comfort they have to the obedience of the law of God, <hi>which he hath written in their hearts.</hi> Let what will come, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be removed; for this exceeds all the precepts and doctrines of men; it is the precept and doctrine of Chriſt and his apoſtles. Let people read them, and endeavour to practiſe them: But here comes the teſtimony, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power by which the precept was given forth to them, and is now given forth again to thee and me, with the ſame livelineſs and power. Let us perform them as did the primitive Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Here now, comfort comes to flow forth from a ſettled foundation that ſhall never be moved. The winds have come and blown upon religion; let what wind will blow, that can blow, God hath built his church upon a rock, and it will remain unmoveable againſt all oppoſition; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that are founded thereupon. Hath God fixed and eſtabliſhed us in our ſociety with one another, and with our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? this is the foundation that God hath placed it upon. We deſire that all men may come to the ſame ſtability and ſettlement, and never more to be <hi>toſſed with the winds of doctrine, but be built upon Chriſt Jeſus, the Rock of Ages,</hi> the rock of our ages, the rock of us and our children. That God will carry us on in this ſociety, is the deſire of our ſouls, for ourſelves, and all our friends and countrymen. The way for you to be bleſſed, and to have an advantage for your immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls, by the teſtimony that hath been raiſed up, is, to have regard to the working of the ſame power, that
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:020309_0221_0FAEF8C90FC5DB68"/>
you may come to partake of the benefit of thoſe gifts and graces which God hath beſtowed upon his church.</p>

               <head type="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <date>March 14, 1687.</date>
               </head>
               <p>IT was the doctrine of the great maſter of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, while he was preaching and publiſhing, and making known the way of ſalvation among the ſons and daughters of men; he then preached and declared, that it was <hi>not bread only by which a man lived, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Now the way and means of man's preſervation in life, in a living ſtate, the method and courſe that the God of Heaven doth open to keep the ſons and daughters of men alive, is by this word: <hi>Every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> hath a miniſtration of life in it; and, therefore, all that are deſirous of the enjoyment of the immortal life, and of the preſerving and encreaſing of it, they are diligently to wait to be made partakers of this divine miniſtration. Outward bread is for outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but man is made inward as well as outward, he hath a ſoul as well as a body. Now Chriſt, to ſignify to us, what the inward man is nouriſhed and fed by, tells us, that <hi>man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So now in this our day, as well as in former days, it hath pleaſed God to give unto a remnant an experimental knowledge of the truth of this; that they have been
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:020309_0223_0FAEF8CD735C4508"/>
quickened and made alive by the word of God; that is, they <hi>have heard, and felt, and taſted of the word of life that was with the Father before the world began,</hi> that hath been divinely miniſtred to them, by the mercy of God, through Jeſus Chriſt; many <hi>that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, he hath ſaid unto them, live.</hi> He hath given unto many an inward ſenſe of their ſtate, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had it not; he hath brought many a one to feel ſin to be a burthen and an oppreſſing load, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before have taken pleaſure and delight in it. This is a great change that is wrought in a man's mind, that he ſhould come to be laden with that, burthened and oppreſſed by that, which was before his pleaſure and delight; yet this great change with been wrought in many a ſoul, by the operation of the word of God, of that inward word, that inward voice, when the Lord hath taken men in hand himſelf.</p>
               <p>There are many have taken ſinners in hand, and have gone about to convince them and convert them, but they were not able to do it; but when the Lord hath taken men in hand himſelf, when his Creator hath undertaken to deal with him himſelf, then the man cries out, <hi>I am a worm, and no man;</hi> then he cries out under the ſenſe of the judgment of God, then he cries out under the indignation of the Lord, which he hath kindled by his ſins, he cries out for mercy, then he prays for remiſſion, then he wiſhes that he had never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord; for the word that goes out of the mouth of God, hath a mighty force and power upon the ſpirit of a man, ſo that he is converted and changed by it; as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid of old, <hi>the word of God is pure, converting the ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now where any come to an experimental knowledge of the word of the Lord, of this inward voice, whereby God ſpeaks to the ſons and daughters of men, they have received thereby an infallible feeling of their own ſtate and condition; this is the firſt leſſon learned by it. They come to have a certain, infallible knowledge of their own ſtate, and they are ſure that they cannot be deceived; for it brings an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with it in their conſciences, ſo that whatſoever this word of life ſignifieth to a man, he hath the knowledge of the ſame thing evidencing it in his own conſcience, as the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:020309_0224_0FAEF8CD94B50298"/>
ſaith, <hi>if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things.</hi> Now here is a way found out for men to obtain divine knowledge by a divine means; for the Lord ſpeaks by his Spirit, and if men come to hearken to that voice, unto that ſpeaking, they perceive readily what it ſaith unto them: The Lord tells people as well now as in former ages, what he hath againſt them; and this every one in the cloſet of their own hearts, come to underſtand. We read in the book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> what our Lord Jeſus Chriſt appointed <hi>John</hi> to write to the ſeven churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that he had <hi>few things</hi> againſt ſome, and <hi>many things</hi> againſt others.</p>
               <p>Now that which is the deſign of our meeting when we are aſſembled together, is, that we may know what the mind and judgment of God is, concerning ourſelves: How ſhall we know that, unleſs we ask him, and come to wait upon him, and enquire at the oracle of counſel, that God hath appointed in the boſom of every man? For he ſignifies his mind unto the children of men, by that light and grace which Jeſus Chriſt hath planted in them, he hath <hi>enlightened every man that comes into the world,</hi> with an undeceiving light, and he <hi>hath miniſtered of his truth</hi> and grace to every man; though the man be bad and untrue, and in the dark, and there be darkneſs in him, yet <hi>the light ſhineth in darkneſs.</hi> The man may be a falſe man, yet there is true knowledge in him; if this man hearken to the voice of truth, when the God of truth ſignifies what his mind and judgment is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and his preſent ſtate.</p>
               <p>So that there is an opportunity offered, and if a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the word of truth, which is adminiſtered to his own mind, he cannot ſay ſuch a man hath deceived him, for it is truth itſelf which is ſignified to him which he believeth: For the truth is the object of his faith, and he believeth it of himſelf; he believe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that while he remains wicked in his unrenewed ſtate, he is out of the covenant of God, and in the high road to deſtruction, if he doth not get out of it, and return to God, and mind his duty: He believeth this, and he believeth the truth: It hath been ſo with many, it hath been ſo with us all; this is the firſt kind of faith and belief that ever we receive; for when truth ſignifieth to us
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:020309_0225_0FAEF8CEABC19960"/>
our fallen ſtate, our alienated ſtate, when truth ſignifies and diſcovers to us the partition wall of ſin and iniquity which we have builded up, whereby the glory and favour of God was hid from the ſoul, we believed this to be true; we would have been looked upon as heirs of God's kingdom, yet when we are come to hearken to truth, we find that we are children of the devil and do his works; ſhall a man believe this after he hath been forty years a profeſſor of Chriſtianity? If a man believe truth, there is no danger in believing it, tho' it be his own deſtruction that is threatened.</p>
               <p>Now the great thing that I would have uſhered into the hearts of men, is, that they may believe the truth for truth's ſake. If men will believe the truth, they muſt believe many things againſt themſelves, which they are not willing to believe; but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>no man can be my</hi> ſcholar, my <hi>diſciple, but by denying himſelf.</hi> I muſt deny myſelf, my pretenſions to Chriſtianity, my ſuppoſed ſaintſhip and title to the kingdom of God; now if I would be convinced that I am a wicked man, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane man, one that doth not live as becomes the goſpel, I muſt believe truth, the voice of truth being of infallible certainty; it is ſignified divinely, by the immortal word that cannot deceive us; this ought to be the reaſon why people ſhould believe the teſtimony of it, tho' it be againſt themſelves; they that do ſo, preſently come to find the effects of it, for they were in their ſins and treſpaſſes before, and ſo are ſtill; they were before in a kind of liberty, in a kind of eaſe and indulgence of themſelves, and ſtill their ſin remains in them, and they remain in it; but they are now under a ſenſe of ſorrow, under a weight, under a burthen, under an oppreſſion, which ſignifies they are alive, and quickened; for (if you take an outward compariſon) they remain not ſenſeleſs and dead; now lay what load you will upon a dead man, he will neither groan, nor grumble at it; but if becomes again to life, he cries take off the burthen, the weight and oppreſſion, that lies heavy upon me.</p>
               <p>This is the difference between being <hi>dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> and being brought to life and ſenſe again; this word of life that comes from the mouth of God, begets a ſenſe in every one that receiveth it; it is of great ſervice and uſe
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:020309_0226_0FAEF8CF166D2E30"/>
to all people to be acquainted with it, that deſire to be <hi>heirs of life eternal,</hi> that deſire to be <hi>inheritors of the kingdom of God:</hi> But how ſhould they come by it? They think by this and the other duty, and temporary performance, to obtain it; no, but if they will have life, they muſt have it from the God of life that created them, he muſt <hi>create</hi> them <hi>again to good works:</hi> They can have it but by one way, all muſt be brought to it that way; it cannot be by hearing a man preach; unleſs the ſpirit doth co-operate with the word of God, there is no poſſibility of being quickened, and neceſſity binds me to hearken and have regard to that one means: <hi>Now I ſay to you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſpeaking of people's way of living to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God;</hi> now when we come to underſtand this text, as ſpoken by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we did conclude there was a poſſibility of underſtanding and hearing that inward voice and word of truth in our own hearts, that God did ſpeak to us by his Son, Jeſus Chriſt, who enlightened us. Hereupon meetings were appointed at firſt, that the word ſhould miniſter life in them, and life to them that attend them; and to this day our meetings are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this purpoſe, that we may have the miniſtration of life and virtue, from Chriſt, the fountain of life and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by whom we were to be quickened and ſtrengthened, and by whom <hi>thoſe that are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes were quickened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I would have every one always to have a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the word of life, that ſpeaks in themſelves; for, if we ſpeak as we are <hi>moved by the Spirit of God,</hi> and utter thoſe things by verbal teſtimony, which God hath made known to us; if you have not an oracle in your boſoms, if you do not at the ſame time perceive an echo of truth in your own ſouls, this will do you no good, but be an empty ſound which will paſs away again; but the mind that is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſettled, in waiting upon God with an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that it may receive benefit in going to this and the other meeting; ſuch a one will ſay, I pray God bleſs this opportunity to me, that ſo I may receive benefit to my ſoul. Where people meet in this manner, they have not only an adminiſtration of doctrine from without, from this and the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:020309_0227_0FAEF8D0A5C3A5F8"/>
other inſtrument, <hi>but they have a miniſtration of the word of God in themſelves, by which a man liveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us not be led and hurried away with the grand error of the times, the great error of this age, and of the ages by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, that there is no poſſibility for people to underſtand and hear this voice of God, this inward voice. There are, ſay they, no immediate teachings now-a-days, no inſpirations now-a-days; they might as well ſay, that there are no conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions now-a-days. I will prove it from the holy ſcriptures, that there is no man in this age, is like to be converted to God, or redeemed from his iniquity, and brought to the knowledge of his Maker, unleſs he have it by the inward working of the eternal God: Not by man's preaching and inſtruction, nor by reading all the good ſermons that ever were preached, without the co-operation of the holy ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, which begets life in them that believe; and if theſe men ſay none can be converted, then we muſt all go headlong to hell, even they and all.</p>
               <p>Theſe Quakers may ſay what they will, there is no imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate teaching now-a-days, no man can know the mind of God, nor underſtand the ſcriptures; none can open them to you.</p>
               <p>But, bleſſed be God, this darkneſs is removed; this veil is gone over and taken away; the brightneſs of the glory of the goſpel hath expelled this darkneſs, and thouſands now-a-days do not only hear the miniſter reprove them, but they hear a voice within that doth reprove them for iniquity; and they find and feel a judgment and tribunal within themſelves, and that God hath an immediate way of counſelling and inſtructing them if they will hearken to him.</p>
               <p>You that are under any ſenſe of this, that are come to ſuch an inward ſenſe of the operation of the word of God, if you have heard it reprove you, exhort you, judge you and condemn you, conſider that this <hi>word</hi> proceeded <hi>out of the mouth of God,</hi> and not out of the mouth of any man. You hear the ſentence of God upon you in your own conſciences: Whence comes it? This is out of the mouth of God. Every word that comes out of the mouth of God, adminiſters life, ſenſe and conviction; and you feel it and receive it, and
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:020309_0228_0FAEF8D152EF9860"/>
you may have a more familiar acquaintance with it. There is not a day or hour that paſſes over your heads nor mine, but if we attend to this inward voice, we may know what it ſpeaks to us, by its counſels, doctrines, reproofs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and illuminations; <hi>for the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſsly,</hi> with an expreſs ſignification, unto the ſpirit of man; and if he be under a temptation to tell a lie, and he comes to a little pauſe or queſtion, whether he ſhall tell it or no; if he hearken to this inward word he will not pauſe long about it, but ſuch a ſentence will ariſe in him, as that in <hi>Joſeph, how can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> How can I ſpeak a lie, tell a lie, when in ſo doing I ſin againſt God? Here is a ſentence of truth, wilt thou receive it or no? No ſayeſt thou, I will venture to tell a lie; then ſhalt thou come into the rank of them that do <hi>deſpite to the Spirit of grace, and trample under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing.</hi> What ſentence ſuch ſhall have, at the latter end, you may read at large in the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>Now there is a great neceſſity that every one be perſuaded to hearken to this voice, not only at a meeting, but on all occaſions they have in the world. I hope I ſpeak to many ſerious and religious perſons that are enquiring about their immortal ſouls, what may be beſt for their ſouls, whether it is better to go on in wickedneſs, or leave off; and that reſolve and ſay, I would be glad to leave my ſins as well as you, if I had power, and to live a holy life. As for the want of power, (that you have not power) I do not wonder at it; for until you come to an exerciſe of faith, in that which hath empowered the people of God, in all ages, I wonder not that you have not power. You ſay I am ſo weak, that I am overcome before I am aware; the devil is ſo ſubtile and cunning with his temptations, that I am ſurprized and ſnatched into temptations, and overcome with evil before I am aware: <hi>He is like a roaring lion, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about continually, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> But whom can he devour? Can he devour thoſe that hearken and ſubmit to the word of God? If he could, then none could eſcape him; if the devil could pluck out of God's hands, then nobody would go to Heaven, nor never ſhall, if he have power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="unknown:020309_0229_0FAEF8D215372ED0"/>Where the devil finds any in their own hands, as ſuppoſe a religious perſon of this and the other religion, who never experienced any thing of this power of God, but truſteth to his duties and performances, this man is in his own hand; now ſuch a one the tempter hath power over: He can make him cheat his neighbour, and lead him into drunkenneſs and uncleanneſs ſometimes, and into the greateſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but if a man come into the exerciſe of faith and dependence upon God, and hath left truſting in himſelf and ſaith, I ſee I cannot preſerve myſelf from ſin, I ſee a neceſſity of putting my truſt in the Lord, and of waiting upon God's power to keep me: If the tempter come to ſuch a one, he cannot prevail, all the devils in hell cannot ſtir him one jot; the devil may tempt him, but he ſtands in the power of faith; he knows his name, and ſaith, <hi>get thee behind me ſatan;</hi> when the devil comes before him, and lays a temptation before him, he caſts it behind him; if the devil riſe up againſt him, he can chain him down, he can ſay in the name of the Lord, <hi>get thee behind me ſatan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why many are tempted, and not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; why many are tempted to ſin and not overcome: How comes it to paſs that we do not do every thing that we are tempted to?</p>
               <p>There is ſomething that keeps us; the devil is not ſo bad to tempt, but we are as bad in our own inclinations to yield to him; <hi>the heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked; who can know it?</hi> There is more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in it, than can be uttered. If people be tempted and not overcome, ſomething muſt preſerve them; if there be ſomething that preſerves a man from any evil, it can preſerve him from all evil.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why ſome people are led into temptation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and reſiſt it, is becauſe ſometimes the temptation ſuits not their inclination; ſometimes the reputation lies in the way, ſometimes one thing, ſometimes another: But when a thing they are tempted to, ſuits their profit and pleaſure, then away with the fear of God, and nothing ſhall hinder them; I will have my pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But they that underſtand the <hi>keeper of Iſrael,</hi> and come to know his power lying in their hearts, theſe always bring their

deeds and temper before him, and they come to him for a verdict and judgment, and they ask, doth this tend to the honour or diſhonour of God? Is it good or evil? The oracle of God in thy heart ſays do it not, it is evil, thou wilt <hi>kindle the indignation of the Lord againſt thee; what will it profit thee to gain the whole world and loſe thy own ſoul? or what wilt thou give in exchange for thy ſoul?</hi> Here is one at hand that can give counſel to all of us, at all times; this is he that we muſt advance; our labour and work upon the ſtage of this world, among the ſons and daughters of men, is to advance the virtue and great authority of the mighty Counſellor, Chriſt Jeſus; we do ſay and affirm, in the name of God, that the ſame light by which God <hi>hath brought us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, and from the power of the devil into the kingdom of his dear Son;</hi> the ſame power is extended to you, <hi>that you may he ſanctified and ſaved from your ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One ſect will ſay, my tenets are ſo and ſo, and our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are ſo and ſo, will you come over to us? You ſhall be a member of our church.</p>
               <p>Our duty is to come over to the grace of God that ſhines in our hearts; now we are witneſſes for God, <hi>that he doth not deſire the death of them that die, but rather that they would turn and live;</hi> for his word is gone forth, and his light ſhines, and his glory is riſen upon the nations, that they that inhabit the earth may fear him. <hi>Fear God, and give glory to his name, for the hour of his judgment is come:</hi> Do you know that to be true? That you may not be deluded, you ſhall certainly know that the hour of God's judgment is come.</p>
               <p>Thus when any one ſuffers himſelf to be led away with the evil one, when he feels after that a remorſe upon his own heart, he finds a ſecret judgment and tribunal ſet up in his own boſom, againſt whoredom, lying, drunkenneſs, fraud and other ſins, he knows be hath done amiſs; he is not going to a confeſſor, that will take off and remove the guilt from his conſcience; he hath offended the majeſty of the great God, and God hath ſignified it to him, is not judgment come, and hath not God ſet it up in his own heart? If through cuſtom in ſin thou loſeſt the ſenſe of his judgment, it is not becauſe God hath determined to take advantage againſt thee,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:020309_0231_0FAEF8D3949EB790"/>
but becauſe thou acteſt againſt thyſelf, and comeſt to be <hi>paſt feeling;</hi> thou waſt once under a ſenſe of theſe things, and thou waſt not <hi>paſt feeling;</hi> if thou at any time told thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents a lie, thou hadſt remorſe; but now thou canſt tell a lie, and not feel it, thou art <hi>paſt feeling;</hi> whoſe fault is this? The Lord would have brought thee to love the truth, but thou chooſeſt lying; if thou periſh, <hi>thy blood will be upon thine own head,</hi> the Lord is clear from it.</p>
               <p>They that receive the word of God have life. <hi>For man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> You are ſenſible of God's ſpeaking this word to you: I exhort you all in the love of God, that you would prize this manner of ſpeaking, and look upon it as the greateſt mercy that ever you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, that God hath not given over ſpeaking to you, and that conſcience hath not given over ſpeaking to you, and that the Spirit of the Lord doth yet <hi>ſtrive with you; he will not always ſtrive;</hi> you may be of that ſort of fools before you die, that <hi>make a mock of ſin,</hi> and be <hi>as trees twice dead, and plucked up by the roots.</hi> You that are ſenſible of this inward voice, prize it above all your mercies; health and wealth, and all other mercies, are not worthy to be compared to this voice of God ſpeaking in you: They that prize this, will never complain for want of power; they will find power in it; all the power in Heaven and Earth is contained in this truth that ſhines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. They that come to be exerciſed in this word, receive power from God, for God gives it to them; he gives them power by degrees (from being ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> ſons of the devil) to become <hi>ſons of God, even to as many as believe in his name.</hi> They that receive this truth, grow tender of a lie, of a vain word; they find themſelves grow tender, feeling and ſenſible. Here is a token that the God of life is quickening them; I am now tender of ſpeaking a lie to my neighbour; I will not do that thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I would not have another do to me; when you come to a tender ſtate, which is far better than a hard-hearted ſtate, you will have an evidence in yourſelves, that <hi>man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</hi>

                  <pb n="232" facs="unknown:020309_0232_0FAEF8D50F913EA8"/>Bleſſed are they that God hath brought into acquaintance with his word; of all nations and people upon the earth, they are a bleſſed people; though there are manifold bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that reach indifferently to all, <hi>the ſun ſhines, and the rain falls on the evil and the good, and on the juſt and unjuſt;</hi> yet this is a bleſſing that can only make the ſoul happy, that an intercourſe between it and its Maker is open; that there is an open intercourſe for the Lord to hear a man cry, and he to receive his word; all thoſe that God hath brought into covenant with himſelf by Chriſt, he hath made ſenſible of this intercourſe and way of God's ſpeaking to his people, which he ſpake to them by in former days: Take heed that this way is not ſtopt up; you know by what it was opened, and what will ſtop it up again; when you were in much trouble and grief, you cried to the Lord, and he delivered you: But if <hi>I regard iniquity in my heart,</hi> ſaid <hi>David, the Lord will not hear me:</hi> You cried to the Lord again, it may be, and he did not anſwer you; and the Lord cried to you and you anſwered him not, but hearkened to your luſts.</p>
               <p>Yet the Lord by his <hi>long-ſuffering and patience</hi> hath won upon a remnant, and hath brought them over to believe and truſt in his power, to remove out of the way that which hindered the intercourſe between God and their ſouls. What a great ſtir was there in removing out of the way the pride, corruption, enmity, looſeneſs, wantonneſs, and abundance more of evil things, that made the ſoul like a wilderneſs? What hacking and burning up was there? God's word, <hi>like a hammer,</hi> and <hi>like a fire,</hi> did break up and <hi>burn up theſe</hi> things; and the ſame word of God, like a ſword, did cut down thoſe ſins and luſts which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over you before: By this means God hath opened a way for you, to have acceſs to him, and for his word to have acceſs to you: When you come to the Lord in this way, you know you live by this word, and if you hear the word of the Lord ſpoken immediately to you, your joy and conſolation encreaſeth, and you have ſweet communion and fellowſhip with God and Chriſt, and with one another, by this covenant of life. How came you
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:020309_0233_0FAEF8D529AC1740"/>
into it? It was by removing a great deal of rubbiſh out of the way. If you ſhould let this rubbiſh grow up again, which kept you from the joy of the Holy Ghoſt, will it not do it again? If your pride, corruption, enmity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, looſeneſs and wantonneſs, if theſe be ſuffered to grow up in any of you, they will do as they did before, they will ſeparate you from the Lord and from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As the truth brought you to God and this heavenly fellowſhip with him, ſo if a wrathful mind and wanton ſpirit get up again, it will ſeparate you from God, and ſcatter you from one another, then you will live in the outward life, and die to the inward one and periſh: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you were told ſo.</p>
               <p>Every one that goes from this living word, and ſuffers any thing to ariſe of the old nature, ſo much as that riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo much will your way of intercourſe with God be ſtopt; ſometimes men cry to God, but they have a bar in their way; and they come for comfort to the throne of grace, but they cannot receive thoſe miniſtrations of joy and peace, which they deſire; <hi>their fooliſh hearts are dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and their minds blinded,</hi> and they will go on in darkneſs, and be left out of the holy covenant which God hath called his people to.</p>
               <p>You that God hath engaged to be his, by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his power, O live in a holy fear and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and know this, that let your underſtandings and gifts be what they will, you have nothing but what is given you; and what God hath given you, he can take away. <hi>Thou haſt decked thyſelf with my flax, and my wool, and with my ſilver and gold, and other ornaments, and followed thy lovers, therefore will I take them away from thee, and ſtrip thee of all thou glorieſt in.</hi> Thoſe that forget God, of whom they had theſe things, that forget their broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and the ſubjection of their ſpirits to God; if they forget this, let them know, that let their parts be what they will, they will certainly wither, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life will fail: You that have regard to your own ſouls, and do deſire heartily, at this time, to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and find that the Lord hath removed your dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and quickened and raiſed you to ſuch a degree and

No, but he giveth me a ſubſtantial river, that is the reaſon why I ſhall thirſt no more; it ſhall be in me <hi>a well of living water, ſpringing up to everlaſting life;</hi> bleſſed are the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of it; theſe are they that are ſatisfied concerning religion and doctrine; they are ſatisfied concerning wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; they are looking after no new things; when they meet together, they meet in the name of the Lord, and they have their eyes to him, who is a fountain, and they diſcern a brightneſs and a glory that is unſpeakable; and the glory that is ſpeakable, that appears many times thro' inſtruments, will not ſatisfy them; there is ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, which muſt ſatisfy; this will never do it; ſuch as theſe will never be ſatisfied with hearing and ſeeing, till they come to hear and ſee <hi>that which is unutterable,</hi> and then they are ſatisfied: Chriſt had preached many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the hearing of his diſciples, and there were a great many ſaid, <hi>that there was never any ſpake like him,</hi> or preached like him; yet one of them that was the neareſt to him, and moſt acquainted and intimate with him, after ſome years meeting and hearing of his ſermons, he cries out, <hi>ſhew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My friends, this comes near to many of your ſtates; many of you have heard long, and have heard the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able word of God, that which could be uttered, that which could be ſpoken forth, by the demonſtration of the Holy Ghoſt, by them <hi>that have received it of the Father;</hi> this you have heard long, and yet there are many of you, that if you come to a ſerious ſearch, you will find a want; you will ſtill find that you have not that ſatisfaction that puts you beyond doubt, beyond fear; there is ſomething that ſtands in the way, that hinders your enjoyment of the unſpeakable glory of the unſpeakable word, and this will never be removed, but by your innocent ſubmitting to the work of the power of God in your own hearts, that ſo you may not only be believers, but come to be
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:020309_0236_0FAEF8D86F4AD790"/>
really baptized, and then all is out of doubt; for our Lord ſaid, <hi>he that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> he doth not ſay he may be ſaved; but, he ſhall be ſaved,</p>
               <p>Woful experience hath told us in our days, that a great many have believed the truth, and yet they are never like to be ſaved, they <hi>have made ſhipwreck of their faith;</hi> but if they had been baptized, if they would have endured the baptiſm, if they would have been buried with Chriſt in baptiſm, they ſhould have been ſaved, every one of them; and now there are a great many that remain in the belief of the truth, and yet they are not baptized, they are not dead, not buried, notwithſtanding <hi>they have received like precious faith with us,</hi> that <hi>faith which is of the operation of God,</hi> and that <hi>is like precious</hi> in its nature to all that do receive it, and would work the ſame effect in all too, if it were not obſtructed; but notwithſtanding they have received faith towards the ſaving of their ſouls, yet their ſouls are captives, their ſouls are ſubject to luſts, and pleaſures, and vanities, and unto empty and fooliſh things, and to paſſions and corruptions, after they have received faith.</p>
               <p>For if you take one that is a believer of truth, that is overtaken with his luſt, and paſſions, and corruptions, he will commonly own that he believeth the contrary, he believeth that theſe things ſhould not be, that it ought to be otherwiſe: This is the ſignification of truth againſt untruth; if it ſhould be otherwiſe, why is it thus then? Why, he finds a life to ſpring up in that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, that is always contrary to the life of God, and at enmity with it: What ſhall I do? I believe the truth, I know it is an holy thing, it leads all that ſubmit to it to a holy life, and there is this and that unholy thing, this and that corrupt thing remains, what ſhall I do?</p>
               <p>It is an evident demonſtration that thou wanteſt the baptiſm of him in <hi>whom thou believeſt;</hi> thou haſt believed in Chriſt Jeſus that cometh after <hi>John,</hi> and was before him; and now having believed in him, thou wanteſt to be baptized by him, and for want of that, the pollution and corruption that was in thy nature in the time of thy
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:020309_0237_0FAEF8D8E8B32C98"/>
alienation, prevails ſtill upon thee, contrary to thy faith; and there is no coming to obtain this baptiſm, but by ſinking down into that which will ſlay thee, that which will kill thee: But there is ſuch a ſhifting to ſave ones life, there are ſo many twiſtings and twinings of people to ſave their lives, that at laſt they loſe them; but there are none that could ever find that life that is eternal, but thoſe that are willing to be given up to the dead, and ſubmit to this baptiſm, that is, by the Holy Ghoſt and by fire: Theſe only do come to life, they come to the reſurrection, for you never knew any that died this death but they roſe again; it is as impoſſible for death to hold any one down that is buried in this baptiſm, as it was impoſſible to hold Chriſt down, when he was in the grave; <hi>the ſame power that brought again our Lord Chriſt from the dead, the ſame power it is that quickens us,</hi> while we remain in theſe mortal bodies, after we have ſuſtained this death and crucifiction.</p>
               <p>But who can believe this ſaying? For <hi>this is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> Is it not enough that I am a believer, which makes me a Friend, and entitles me to a community among you; and as long as I hold the truth, and profeſs the truth, I am looked upon as one of your ſociety? This is very true; this doth entitle people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the outward privileges of the Church of Chriſt; but there is another inner court, that lies under the angel's reed (the meaſuring-reed) that is to be meaſured; the temple is meaſured, and every worſhipper in the temple is meaſured; there was an outward court, that was for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Church of God in general, from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; the outward court was not meaſured, that the Gentiles might come in; the unbaptized people, which were never regenerated, they might come ſo far as the outward court, but this did not entitle them to the privileges of the houſe of God, nor to any worſhip or ſacrifice that was accepted upon God's altar.</p>
               <p>It concerns you and me, my friends, to be ſerious about matters of this moment and importance, and not ſpend our days, and, as it were, ſpeak by rote, under an airy profeſſion, though of truth itſelf, without conſidering what
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:020309_0238_0FAEF8D9997C8D28"/>
progreſs you have made, what benefit you have obtained, and whether you are come not only to <hi>the ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> but to the very ſubſtance of the heavenly things; <hi>for the comers to the outward worſhip could never, with thoſe ſacrifices they offered, he made perfect; the comers thereunto were not made perfect, as to the things pertaining to the conſcience,</hi> ſpeaking there of the outward worſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> x, 1; but coming to the heavenly things, whereof the other was but a ſhadow, they made people perfect, as to the conſcience, and did bring them to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The apoſtle alludes to this baptiſm, for he ſpeaks in a figure of the <hi>eight perſons that were ſaved in</hi> Noah<hi>'s ark;</hi> then he brings down the allegory to chriſtian bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, not only the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> the fore-runner of Chriſt, that preached of Chriſt, but to the chriſtian bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm itſelf; <hi>by the like figure whereof baptiſm now ſaveth us,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle; <hi>not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience.</hi> What doth he mean by baptiſm ſaving us? He means, <hi>the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, through the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead;</hi> ſo that chriſtian baptiſm did bring along with it the <hi>cleanſing and putting away of all ſin out of the conſcience,</hi> that might bring them under doubts and ſcruples; and then there is an ariſing of Jeſus; the Saviour, in the conſcience, the Mediator that brought them to anſwer for them in the ſight of God; for if people be conſcious of ſin, and do leave off their ſin, this doth not yet cleanſe the conſcience; for there ſtill remains a conſcience of ſin; tis not the leaving off our ſin that makes our atonement with God, or that expiates our guilt, or doth away the guilt of the ſins that we have committed; but there muſt be a forſaking and a leaving off ſin by the virtue and power of the ſpirit, by which we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, not only to leave off ſin, but are guided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Mediator, <hi>whoſe blood alone reconcileth us to God, and cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> If I ſhould never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſin while I live, it is not this ſimply in itſelf that will make me have the anſwer of a good conſcience in the ſight of God; for there remains the guilt of ſin contracted in the days of unbelief, which is a bar and hinderance, that
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:020309_0239_0FAEF8DA5061FC28"/>
none can approach the Holy God, but in the atonement and ſalvation that comes by Jeſus Chriſt; for all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey the goſpel are accepted in Chriſt, and that upon the account of Chriſt's precious blood, that cleanſeth us from all ſin and unrighteouſneſs. Whom doth it cleanſe? Thoſe only that forſake their ſins, and by his power are brought to a holy life; they, by the virtue of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the cleanſing of his blood, come to have their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins removed from them, as far as the eaſt is from the weſt.</p>
               <p>But what is this to them that remain in their ſins? what is this <hi>to them that are not baptized for the dead? that have not put off the old man, nor put on the new man,</hi> but have only put on the name and profeſſion of Chriſt, and put on the outſide of him, his garment, but have not put him on, they are not <hi>created again in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, that they might walk in them?</hi> No Wonder there remains a conſcience of ſin in them, there is a bar that hinders them from the ſight of the glory of God, and from real and true ſatisfaction, concerning their atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reconciliation with God, and this hinders them from the enjoyment of <hi>that peace that paſſeth underſtanding;</hi> and it is no wonder, becauſe they are not come to this baptiſm that brings the <hi>anſwer of a good conſcience in the ſight of God;</hi> they are not riſen with Chriſt; how ſhould they? for they are not buried with him. <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us</hi> (ſaith the apoſtle) <hi>as were baptized into Chriſt, were baptized into his death; therefore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life,</hi> Rom. vi, 3. Here is a change figured out between them that had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken of the ſpiritual baptiſm, and were come again to the participation of life in the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, and thoſe that were not baptized.</p>
               <p>So it is now with every one that cometh to believe the truth, and make a profeſſion of it; there is a way caſt up, and there is a door opened for ſalvation; but the grand queſtion that every one ought to enquire about, and put to themſelves, is, what progreſs they have made

in this way? Whether they are baptized yet or no? whether they have <hi>put off the old man with his deeds, and put on the new man and the new man's deeds, which are righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs?</hi> They that find, that though they are believers, they are ſhort of this, they do alſo find that their ſhortneſs is their hinderance, their ſhortneſs in not coming up to the pattern that hath been ſhewed them, is their hinderance, ſo that they enjoy not the things here ſpoken of; the being under this ſenſe, and really ſitting under this ſenſe in a meeting, though there ſhould be no man ſpeaking to them outwardly, yet being come to this faith, and made partakers of this baptiſm, people would find in their own boſoms the hidden word of life mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering to their condition; they would have enough, there would not be a famine of the word unto them, nor they ſhould not need to be in expectation of going out to this or the other inſtrument, but they would be ſatisfied when they are met together with the preſence of the Lord, that the Lord is in the midſt of them, miniſtering unto them the word of life, in his operating and working, ſpeaking in a tongue that every one can underſtand, ſpeaking with a kind of voice and language, that every one may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his own ſtate and condition; and this is the way that God brought up people from the beginning, to the knowledge of heavenly things, and opening of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſalvation; we had it not of men, but of Jeſus our Lord; he was our great miniſter, we waited upon him, and truſted in him, and he taught us himſelf; he hath mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered to us at our ſilent and quiet waiting upon him, thoſe things that were convenient for us; we might well ſay, <hi>he gave us our food in due ſeaſon;</hi> he hath not only given <hi>ſtrong meat unto men,</hi> but hath miniſtered of the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of his word unto babes,</hi> that lived in ſincerity and ſelf-denial, loving God above all things; and he taught and conducted us in our way, this way of ſimplicity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til our underſtandings came to be opened, until our ſouls came to be prepared to receive the myſteries of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>In thoſe days there were ſome that ſtarted up in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that <hi>built their neſts on high, and took ſlax and
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:020309_0241_0FAEF8DE189CB478"/>
wool, and gold and ſilver, and decked themſelves with them;</hi> but the Lord found them out, and brought them down, and took the crown from their head, and cloathed them with diſhonour. So God doth from age to age; his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will begin at his own houſe: If you would <hi>grow in the grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then grow in humility and ſelf-denial, and keep a conſtant watch upon your hearts; examine your hearts, and <hi>commune with yourſelves upon your beds, and be ſtill;</hi> take heed leſt you ſin againſt the Lord, and provoke him. <hi>There were ſome that provoked the Lord of old, and they committed two great evils:</hi> What be they? <hi>They have gone away, and forſaken the fountain of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water;</hi> as much as to ſay, they have not their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon an inviſible power, as they ought to have: For I am a living fountain, and it is by an inviſible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that I am able to counſel, teach, direct, purify, and open their underſtandings; but they have forſaken me, that is one great evil; and the other is, they would not be without ſomewhat; <hi>they have forſaken the Lord,</hi> and they would have ſomewhat inſtead of God; <hi>they have digged to themſelves broken ciſterns, that will hold no water.</hi> And how many in this age have committed theſe two great evils!</p>
               <p>My friends, examine yourſelves; are there not many that have been guilty of theſe two great evils? They do not keep their cloſe dependence, truſt and reliance, upon the inviſible power of God, as they profeſs they ought to do, but are hurried away from it; ſome by the love of the world, ſome by luſts and pleaſures, ſome by paſſions, and others by worldly intereſts, are drawn away from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to do and ſay that which the power is againſt: Is not this a forſaking of the Lord the living fountain? What do they do then? Are they not for this and that, and the other man? for hearing this and the other man's word, and <hi>digging to themſelves broken ciſterns?</hi> And have they not their truſt and confidence in going to meetings, in commending this and the other way? Have they not their truſt in their profeſſion outwardly, when it miniſters no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their ſouls, ſo that they ſecretly wither for all
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:020309_0242_0FAEF8DEE09658A0"/>
this? If you had all the men and angels that were ever ſent of God, appointed to preach to you, they could not miniſter life to you, unleſs there be that faith that ſtands in the power of God. The faith that ſtands in any man's words, will not overcome your luſts; but the faith that ſtands in the power of God, <hi>purifies the heart;</hi> it will not ſuffer any unclean thing there. As for preaching, let a man preach againſt this and the other luſt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there it will remain for all his preaching, unleſs men know God's power and life, in which there is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for words and knowledge, and ſight and ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will never give people victory over their ſins.</p>
               <p>Therefore you know, every one who is ſettled muſt be ſettled where the foundation of religion is; it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meetings, and owning this and the other doctrine which is the foundation of our religion; God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his power to every one of us; God hath not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Spirit to preachers and prophets only, for then there would be a <hi>famine of the word,</hi> as was in <hi>Iſrael, the prieſt's lips only preſerved knowledge.</hi> If you did take away the prieſt, you did take away their knowledge. The prophets had the word of God, and they only ſpake the word of God. If the prophet was taken away, then the word of God was taken away. The Lord threatened to ſend a famine among them; they grieved and vexed, and killed and deſtroyed, the prieſts and prophets; therefore, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will ſend a famine among you, not of bread, but of the word; and they ſhall go from city to city, and enquire for the word of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it was in the Jewiſh church; if there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet they would go thirty, forty, or a hundred miles to him that had the word of the Lord; <hi>they ſhall go from city to city, to enquire for the word of the Lord:</hi> But bleſſed be God we are come to another day, for now the word of the Lord is manifeſted in the hearts of all that believe; they know the word: I do not ſay all that believe do preach the word, or ought to preach; but the word preacheth to them; they are not as <hi>broken ciſternt that can hold no water;</hi> when they find the word and hear it, they ſpeak it preſently; what is miniſtered to
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:020309_0243_0FAEF8E105C4DA38"/>
their own condition, that they tell to other folks; when people come to the bleſſing of this diſpenſation that God's word revealeth in their hearts, they then know what the ſignification of it is, they underſtand the doctrine of it, the doctrine preacheth holineſs to them; not that they ſhould preach holineſs and yet remain unholy; not that they ſhould preach humility, and yet remain proud: it preacheth holineſs, humility and ſingleneſs of heart to a remnant, that like good ſcholars and diſciples learn the leſſons and doctrine of the word of God.</p>
               <p>Now when thou haſt learned them well, and art come to ſee the effect of the word, and doſt bring forth the deeds and works which are the fruits of holineſs, <hi>perfecting holineſs in the fear of God, and with humility known and witneſſed in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and art not only meek in ſhow, but <hi>meek and low in heart;</hi> when people come to be meek and lowly, and of a clear conſcience, <hi>purged from all dead works to ſerve the living God;</hi> then if the Lord gives them a word of exhortation, of doctrine or counſel, it is very welcome, and it hath a ſavour through the bleſſing of God, and they come by it to be <hi>built up in their moſt holy faith,</hi> and this word is brought forth in holineſs and righteouſneſs in their lives, and ſhews itſelf in a life of holineſs; then thou wilt ſhine in thy converſation to all that thou converſeſt with, ſo that they may ſee thee to be ſuch a man or woman as haſt been with Jeſus, and learned of Jeſus, and received <hi>a word engrafted;</hi> when thou doſt receive the word into thy heart, there is the engrafting of it: If it hath not root there, then, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>my word doth not abide in you.</hi> If you feel ſomething of this inviſible word in your hearts, it brings you to a reſolution to ſerve God, and to keep yourſelves from ſin, and to anſwer the profeſſion which you make of God; this is the effect of the word of God, if it doth abide in you. Doth it abide? You ſhall know anon or to morrow, ſo ſoon as a temptation comes to ſtir you up to pride or paſſion, to fraud or deceit, then you will ſee whether the word abide: If it abide, you ſin not.</p>
               <p>This is ſcripture, a certain fundamental doctrine, that may be as ſafely preached as any doctrine: If the word abide
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:020309_0244_0FAEF8E125D8EB48"/>
in you, you ſin not; what of that? let the word go, and you will ſin, when ever you are tempted to it. <hi>I write to you young men, becauſe you have overcome the wicked one, you are ſtrong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.</hi> We ſhall ſee as ſoon as a temptation meets with thee, whether the word abides in thee; if it abide, thou wilt not ſin, but reſiſt the tempter. Set thy foot upon the temptation, and go over it, and thou wilt have the dominion; and this will make thee a free man or woman, and thou wilt <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> The apoſtle ſuppoſeth them free, and that they have got dominion; then <hi>ſtand faſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> It is a liberty not of luſt and ſin, but a liberty of the ſoul; the ſoul now is not at the devil's will and call.</p>
               <p>For it is a ſhame to the doctrine of Chriſtianity, that we profeſs things, and yet deny them in practice: We profeſs that there is a power in Chriſt to keep and preſerve us out of ſin, and we profeſs to believe this power is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them that do believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for their preſervation; that is, he will not withhold it from them: We profeſs theſe things in the face of the whole world; and yet when the devil calls one man to covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and another to defraud his neighbour, and another to defile himſelf, he is drawn away thereby; what hypocriſy is here to profeſs this, and act the contrary? I do not wonder that they that profeſs they cannot live a day without ſin, that they ſhould fall; but they that profeſs to believe there is power enough in Chriſt, and that it is offered to them, to live in ſin and yield to temptation, this is horrid wickedneſs. They that are of an upright, ſingle mind, would die before they would ſin, knowing that God is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and gracious, and willing to beſtow his power, and wiſdom, and grace, upon them that ask it; they would die rather than ſin againſt God preſumptuouſly: let it coſt me my goods, my eſtate, my liberty, or my life, <hi>how can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> They love God above all; you never heard them complain that they wanted power, <hi>for the Lord is at their right hand, and they
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:020309_0245_0FAEF8E251537C60"/>
ſhall not be moved.</hi> They cannot fall; though they are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they will not fall into temptation. They have power when they ſee the devil before them, to put him behind them; the nobility of their extract, of their new birth and regeneration, puts ſuch a temper and diſpoſition into their ſouls, that they ſcorn to be at the devil's command, as if they were his children.</p>
               <p>Oh! it is a noble and honourable thing to be a child of God, a very high dignity to be in ſuch an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, and to have a right to the heavenly manſions, <hi>to ſit down in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I would to God you were all ready for it, that you had the wedding garment on, that you might not be <hi>bound hand and foot, and caſt into utter darkneſs.</hi> What is the reaſon that you do not ſit down in this heavenly frame and temper, and draw the waters of ſalvation out of your own ſouls; could the Lord do any thing more than he hath done, and could his ſervants do any more than they have done for your help? Are not their labours demonſtrations of it? We have been <hi>as epiſtles of Chriſt written in your conſciences.</hi> We have been teſtifying that there is ſomething wanting in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the want of reſigning up themſelves to the baptiſm of the croſs. People are willing to be counted friends; but they are friends of God, <hi>that do whatſoever he commandeth them;</hi> that is the Chriſtian leſſon, not to ſay, I will be a friend to you, and a friend to the church, and to ſuch a ſort of people; but I will be a friend of God, and do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he commandeth me; whatſoever command God lays upon you, either to take up a croſs, or to deny yourſelves and follow him.</p>
               <p>Learn this leſſon, and you will be diſciples indeed, and members of the church too; not members of a church privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged outwardly only, but <hi>members of a church of the firſt born, and you will have your names written in Heaven;</hi> when one comes to have his name written in Heaven, he comes to know his name, it is a <hi>white Stone,</hi> not a ſpeckled one; they that have it, they know it, they are not ignorant of one another's names, that are written in this book; they have a fellowſhip that nobody can declare; their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is in that bread and that cup: This is a cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:020309_0246_0FAEF8E2A05E25E8"/>
indeed, and this hath bleſſed us, and will bleſs us. God will preſerve a people in this fellowſhip. You that are at a diſtance now, you muſt come nearer to him; God will chooſe a people by whom his name ſhall be magnified; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts,</hi> we cannot but deſire this for all, <hi>eſpecially for the houſhold of faith;</hi> we cannot but deſire their perfection, their growing up in the grace of God, that they might come to be partakers of Heaven. And in the next place, our love is to all people, every where; we would be glad <hi>that all were ſaved;</hi> they that deſpiſe us, when we are ſpeaking of heavenly things, ſpeaking like a child, like a ſtammering child, ſpeaking of the glorious excellencies of God, of the loving kindneſs of God, ſpeaking of thoſe things which God hath ſpoken to our ſouls, they that deſpiſe theſe things, we would be glad that they might be ſaved: If they were partakers of theſe things, they would be glad as well as we, and they would be more really happy in reſpect of this world, for the time that they are to live here; they would live a happier life, even in this world, and they would <hi>have everlaſting life in the world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains men thus to judge, that every one that hath received like precious faith,</hi> ought to anſwer that grace and faith which God hath miniſtered to them in a holy life and converſation, and every one who is a ſtranger to this thing, ought to be of an enquiring mind, and an open heart, to wait for the day when God will viſit them with the ſame grace; when you give up yourſelves to a daily croſs, as Chriſt's diſciples, you will not be running after any one to teach you to know the Lord, for you will all <hi>know the Lord, from the leaſt to the greateſt;</hi> I that have been but a little convinced, ſhall I know the Lord? Thou ſhalt know the Lord, thou that <hi>art dead in thy ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> thou that haſt not <hi>known the blood of cleanſing,</hi> thou ſhalt know <hi>the Lord</hi> to be thy <hi>judge,</hi> and thy <hi>law-giver,</hi> to teach thee how thou muſt live, walk and act; and is not that a good knowledge? This is the way they reckoned upon in old time, it is a notable expreſſion, <hi>the Lord is our judge;</hi> there is the beginning, he began there, judgment began <hi>at the houſe of God;</hi> thoſe
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:020309_0247_0FAEF8E352429368"/>
he brings into his houſe, he brings them under the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of his houſe, <hi>the Lord is our judge, he is our king and law-giver, and he will ſave us;</hi> this ſame exerciſe of diſcipline under judgment brought to them the faith and experience of his being their law-giver, and this brought them to a faith of the laſt ſentence, we ſhall be ſaved; and the Lord anſwers ſuch a-people, that he will bring ſalvation to them, <hi>ſalvation ſhall be for walls and bulwarks:</hi> Did the people of this nation but know ſalvation was brought near to them, and that it was their bulwark, there would not be a crying up this and the other rotten thing for a bulwark.</p>
               <p>We talk of a bulwark as well as others; we have a bulwark, bleſſed be the God of Heaven, made of better ſtuff than theirs; for it is the ſalvation of God which hath kept us from the pollution of ſin, and from a running <hi>into all exceſs and riot</hi> that others have run into; it hath kept us from the evil, it hath kept evils out of us, and we have found that certainly true, that <hi>all things work together for good, to them that love God, and fear God;</hi> that all the providences of God together, have all wrought for our good; and this is the bulwark that we have truſted in, and it hath ſerved hitherto, and it will ſerve us and our poſterity to the end of the world: This is a bulwark that will never be ſtormed, that will never be thrown down nor laid waſte: Though all the powers on earth, and all the potentates in this world ſhould agree together, they ſhall not prevail againſt it; we have <hi>ſalvation for walls and bulwarks;</hi> if I be within theſe walls, ſalvation is round about me; if I am got into this eternal bulwark, I am ſafe from the devil and his inſtruments; here is a bulwark to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon.</p>
               <p>Many wonder we differ with them in ſome opinions; we have that confidence in this bulwark, that we deſire not another; God will laſt and abide forever, ſo will this bulwark; all the care that I take, and all the care that you ſhould take, is to keep within theſe walls: Do not ſally out, if you go out, the devil is watching, and <hi>ſeeking continually whom he may devour;</hi> he will catch ſtraglers; if people will go out for profit, or for pleaſure, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:020309_0248_0FAEF8E412DA4B40"/>
the devil will catch them; how can ſuch people talk of ſalvation for walls and bulwarks? the devil hath got them in his ſnare, and they are caught in drunkenneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and other ſins; the reaſon is, they have gone out of their bulwark, they have ſallied out of their walls, for the devil could never have forced them out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O take heed,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>leſt there ſpring up in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God;</hi> as if he had ſaid, you are Chriſtians now, you are a people come to a good ſtate in Chriſt; but conſider you have no ſtrength to ſtand but in him; no power to keep yourſelves but in him; <hi>take heed,</hi> at all times, <hi>that there ſpring not up in you an evil heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, in departing from the living God;</hi> take heed leſt there ſpring up in you ſuch a thought as this; I may take this pleaſure, and the other profit; conſider that thou dieſt and withereſt if thou depart from the living God; take heed of taking liberty above the fear of God: It is not our talk of ſalvation for walls and bulwarks, that will do us good, but our keeping within theſe walls.</p>
               <p>I remember a notable ſaying of the apoſtle, which hath a great emphaſis in it, and a great deal of doctrine; he writeth to the church, after they were become a people of profeſſing Chriſtians, <hi>take heed leſt you come to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled by the ſerpent, as he beguiled Eve;</hi> he did not ſpeak of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> a wicked woman; but he ſpoke of <hi>Eve,</hi> a good woman, <hi>created after the image of God, in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and holineſs;</hi> they were come to a life of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, to a life <hi>that was hidden from ages and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi> You muſt look to yourſelves, and look upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as in the ſtate of your mother <hi>Eve,</hi> a woman brought forth in righteouſneſs and holineſs, that might have ſtood in that primitive ſtate, notwithſtanding all the ſubtilty of all the ſerpents in the world; but having hearkened to this old ſerpent, ſhe was beguiled; there grew up a conſultation in her reaſoning part; it may be ſo as he ſaith, I will try.</p>
               <p>So I ſay to you that are come to a ſtate of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in ſome meaſure to know the cleanſing power of God, that you have not believed in it in vain, but
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:020309_0249_0FAEF8E4D75626D0"/>
it hath effectually wrought ſome change and alteration in you, and is ſtill carrying on the work of your ſalvation. Many temptations will attend you, and many ſnares will be laid in your way; but God hath preſerved you to this day: I know the devil's wiles and temptations are manifold; they are fitted to every one's inclinations, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to every opportunity, and to every occaſion in this world: Men are tried every way by the tempter, to ſee which way he may enſnare them; he tries every way to <hi>enſnare and entangle the ſimple,</hi> that he may turn them to the right hand or to the left, that their ſouls may be deſtroyed and periſh.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſpeak to you by a more emphatical word, by a more familiar exhortation than this, <hi>take heed you be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled as Eve was:</hi> Many will be tempted as ſhe was, but I would not have you do as ſhe did, and yield to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Take heed that you do not defile yourſelves, but <hi>keep your garments white;</hi> you that have been waſhed and cleanſed, labour to <hi>keep yourſelves unſpotted from the world; this is pure religion and undefiled,</hi> that which hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened many a nation, and ſhall enlighten many of thoſe whoſe religion is to be undefiled, and to <hi>keep themſelves unſpotted from the world.</hi> I pray God encreaſe the number of them, that ſo the bleſſed work of ſanctification that hath begun in this way, may be carried on to his praiſe, and the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſouls, to the ſpreading forth of his glory, and the exalting of his name; that the ſtrangers which are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and deſolate, may be brought into his holy way, and walk in it; that we all, in a fellowſhip together, walking in that holy way, may through the eternal Spirit, offer praiſe and thankſgiving to God, who is worthy to receive glory and honour, power and dominion, forever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>IF I ſhould ſay no more, there is that in every one's conſcience that will make application; if he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, is none of his, you may ſay, whoſe is he then? If they be none of Chriſt's that have not his Spirit, whoſe are they? They are all his whoſe Spirit rules them, every one of us doth belong to him whoſe Spirit ruleth over us, unto whoſe power we are ſubjected. You know this diſtinguiſheth people in the world, one king knoweth his ſubjects from another king's ſubjects; they are under the obedience of this, that, and the other king or prince, his law is over them, they are ſubject to it; ſo here is a deciſion of all the people in the world, whom they belong to.</p>
            <p>We, all of us, I hope, do expect there will be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion at the day of judgment, and believe the things we read concerning it, that there will be a deciſion, and ſome will be placed on the right hand, and ſome on the left; ſome will have the ſentence of, <hi>come ye bleſſed,</hi> and others the ſentence of, <hi>go ye curſed;</hi> but now there is a way of finding out the deciſion of the matter before we go out of the world, before the day of judgment, when there will be no remedy, what then is, muſt be and abide ſo; now there is no need it ſhould continue ſo; if it be amiſs, it may be mended; if I do not belong to the right prince, if I be not under the right power and ſpirit, I may be, for now it is a day of grace, a day of mercy; I have been a rebel to the right prince, I may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and taken into favour; it is far better for people

            <p>The apoſtle, in laying down fundamental, apoſtolical doctrines, that were to be believed and taken notice of, and are in our age, ſo that we may ſay, <hi>things written of old time, were written for our learning;</hi> he makes this affirmation and poſition of doctrine, <hi>he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, is none of his,</hi> he doth not belong to him; tho' he be called a Chriſtian, he is not a Chriſtian, if he hath not the Spirit of Chriſt; it is but a name he hath got, he hath not that which makes him eſſentially ſo, for nothing can make a Chriſtian, but having the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt; therefore when they would vindicate their being Chriſtians, they prove it thus; <hi>for he</hi> (ſpeaking of God) <hi>hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, and we know the mind of Chriſt; we know him that is true,</hi> or we are in him that is true; theſe things, if they were right, if they were true, were evident demonſtrations that they were a ſort of men who depended more upon the Spirit and ſpiritual teachings, and ſpiritual guidance, than upon all the rules and methods of teaching that were in the world.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak of this, friends, becauſe you know as well as I, how averſe this age of ours hath been, to have any thing ſpoken of ſpiritual diſpenſations, or about ſpiritual teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; though a man hath been counted formerly a wiſe man, a learned man, or a man of parts, if once he come to ſmatter out a little about inward teaching, it is enough to ſpot him, and make him ridiculed of his acquaintance, as if there were no ſuch thing in the world: We have a book, called the <hi>bible,</hi> it is from one end to the other full of ſuch expreſſions, of being led by the Spirit; <hi>you have an anointing which teacheth you all things:</hi> The whole tenor of the New Teſtament is about ſpiritual teachings and divine operations, and of <hi>faith</hi> being <hi>the operation of God;</hi> and the Old Teſtament hath abundance of expreſſions by way of prophecy, that in the New Teſtament days, if people would look for the law of God, they muſt look for it <hi>in their hearts;</hi> and if they would know God, they muſt look to <hi>the Mediator, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> The
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:020309_0252_0FAEF8E74A09AFD8"/>
New Teſtament alſo directs us that way; Chriſtians ſhould be the moſt ſpiritual people in the world, that is the guide, the rule.</p>
            <p>But, ſay they, the ſcripture is the foundation of faith and manners, belief and practice; this is too often but diſſimulation, and I am afraid it is to be found in ſome; what, is the ſcripture the rule of faith? and may people believe what they find in ſcripture? Yes, but ſay ſome, it is beſt be aware for fear of error. What is in the ſcripture is ſerious, ſound and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and did Quakers, think you, never find in ſcripture that people were to <hi>wait for the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>pray in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>ſerve God in the Spirit,</hi> and that all religion that is not in power, is not available, did they not find it in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And you that are not Quakers, did you ever read the New Teſtament? How came it to paſs that ye never found theſe texts? But ſome people read and read the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament twenty times over, and mock and deride, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a man that ſhall ſpeak of the Spirit's teaching.</p>
            <p>I have admired at it, how intelligent men, to whom God hath given a competent underſtanding, ſhould be ſo blinded; they have learned to read Engliſh, and they have read the New Teſtament over ſeveral times, and the Old Teſtament too, and they have read thoſe ſentences of Chriſt's doctrine, that do ſo currently and unanimouſly ſpeak of divine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſpiritual operations, ſpiritual worſhip and ſpiritual religion, that muſt have ſome motion and ſtirring of the Holy Ghoſt to be the original of it, and that all others are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; doubtleſs they have read theſe things, but I have often deſired and do ſtill deſire that they would read it again once more, and try and ſee what God will do; he hath oftentimes made uſe of the holy ſcripture as a means to awaken people and to open their underſtandings, and let them ſee the mind of the ſpirit by which the ſcripture is written, and the next time if they can find ſcripture text and apoſtolical doctrine, to teach people to wait upon the Spirit, I hope they will leave ſcoffing and mocking.</p>
            <p>It hath been hitherto looked upon as an invention, to ſpeak of the <hi>teaching of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>waiting upon the Spirit,</hi> and being moved by the Spirit. This apoſtolical doctrine, prayer and worſhip, hath been looked upon as an invention
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:020309_0253_0FAEF8E996029CF0"/>
that we have brought in: To look for the Holy Ghoſt in that way that was never known to our fathers, is a fantaſtical conceit of the Quakers, ſay they: To tell people they muſt be led by the Spirit in divine things, as in prayer and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the like, that in theſe things they muſt wait for the Spirit, was there ever any man that was counted good for any thing that ever preached ſo, before they came? Do we read any ſuch kind of thing in ſcripture?</p>
            <p>O! the blindneſs that hath happened to this nation! I have conſidered, not without admiration, how the devil (he is a Spirit too, and a wicked one) how he ſhould have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to prevent our acknowledging the belief, ſenſe and feeling of the Spirit of God now-a-days; there are thouſands in this nation that have formerly believed that it was as impoſſible for a man to believe the divine motions and ſtrugglings of the Spirit of God in this life, as to raiſe their fathers and mothers out of their graves; ſome of their learned teachers have told us it is a whimſy and fancy, and that there was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o inſpiration of the Spirit now-a-days, but that it was a fooliſh fancy in us to wait for ſuch a thing, it is needleſs, ſay they; there was an immediate teaching in the apoſtles days, and they had the ſenſe of the Spirit of Chriſt working in them, to teach them to write letters and epiſtles to the church, which letters and epiſtles were written by the moving of the Holy Ghoſt, but we have no need of it now, the Holy Ghoſt hath brought order and government into the church, we have it now in black and white printed in our books, therefore ſay they, there is no need of the Spirit, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple need not be acquainted with the operation of the Spirit now-a-days, in regard they have it in their books what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhip they muſt perform.</p>
            <p>I grant them their due, that they have the direction of the ſcripture; I am able to underſtand that people are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, and pray to him, and are to meet together and to obſerve this and the other doctrinal precepts there laid down; I confeſs I can make ſhift herewith to frame out a form of religion, and if I do not miſtake in the opening and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the doctrine, I could make a right form too, but I am liable to miſtake, another man that underſtands Greek better than I, ſaith that the Greek word ought to be tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:020309_0254_0FAEF8EA10E77808"/>
ſo, and the form ought to differ in ſuch a reſpect; ſome ſay the only way of government is by biſhops, and the word bears it in the original, and another ſaith he hath ſtretched the word, for the word means preſbyter; another ſaith preſbyter ſignifies no more than choice of church elders and deacons, and ſuch like, and this is all out of one book, the ſettlement of biſhops, preſbyters, and elders.</p>
            <p>Here a number of form-makers all fall out about the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word; what remedy can any mortal man provide for this? We muſt not be killing and ſlaying one another about words; if I be an epiſcopal man and ſay the word ſignifies biſhops, I may be a wicked man ſtill; and if another ſay it muſt be preſbyter, he may be a wicked man too, and if another ſay it ſhould be paſtor, elders, and deacons, he may be a wicked man notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>Thus they have rent and torn one another about church government; what remedy ſhall we have for this, that theſe quarrellings and contentions about terms and words may come to an end? Could a man preſcribe a more certain remedy for all theſe miſtakes than this, if they had a meaſure of this Spirit which did work in the apoſtles when they wrote down theſe words, which the apoſtles had in writing them, then I ſay they could tell you what the Spirit meant, for the Spirit is the ſame and not changed, and the words are the ſame to a ſmall matter, ſo that if a man had that, he might end all the controverſy; but where ſhall we have a man that hath this Spirit to end the controverſy? There is none now-a-days ſay the Proteſtants, and ſay the Papiſts there is none but one that hath this infallibility; and many will not ſuppoſe that neither, for ſome of them ſay, that one man is as infallible as another man; there is a great diſpute whether any one man be infallible, or a great many men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are infallible about doctrine and worſhip: This might be cured all at once if we could come to this concluſion. Papiſts, Proteſtants and Quakers, here is an end of all out-ſide worſhip, <hi>he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his:</hi> If there be not Spirit in it, it is not Chriſt's religion and worſhip.</p>
            <p>So that they that jangle and bark and bite, are without, among <hi>dogs and ſorcerers,</hi> that are ſtrangers to the Spirit of
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:020309_0255_0FAEF8ED8CCCA450"/>
Chriſt; there is a ſpirit in them that denies the Spirit of Chriſt, there is a Spirit that rules in them that are without the Spirit, for nobody that I know of, acts things without a ſpirit, and without being moved. What, are good and bad all moved by the Spirit, and yet are there no motions? I have ſometimes turned the queſtion upon people, and asked them if there were no motions of the evil ſpirit, hath it no ſuch kind of influence that it can move upon our ſpirits, that we can ſenſibly feel ourſelves thruſt forth to ſuch an action? I never met any man that would deny it, they are ſo generally favourable to the wicked ſpirit; no man will deny but the devil hath a way of moving and ſtirring upon the ſpirit of a man, and to ſuggeſt to him ſuch an evil thing, and as I have ſometimes ſaid, it is ſo received an opinion, that when the malefactor comes to be arraigned at the bar for ſome grievous crime, they lay the foundation of the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch a day he was moved and inſtigated by the devil to do ſuch a thing; here is a ſettled motion for the devil, for him to influence peoples ſpirits, but no way for the good Spirit of God to influence mens ſpirits; here is nothing left us but a bad inſtigation; but to know inward motions to good things, it is not to be expected now-a-days.</p>
            <p>How ſhould ever the cunning ſerpent, that would have power over the beſt of us all, be ſaid to winnow us? Chriſt ſignified to <hi>Peter,</hi> a bold and reſolute diſciple, <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan deſires to have thee, and winnow thee as wheat;</hi> if the devil had power over every one, to make them his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and ſlaves, what remedy have we but we muſt all periſh and go headlong to hell with him, unleſs there be ſome way of reſiſting him? That is true, ſay people, the devil muſt be reſiſted; we find it in the New Teſtament, <hi>reſiſt the devil;</hi> this is a good exerciſe; but tell me one thing, when I go about to reſiſt the devil, muſt I reſiſt him in my own power? If I was to ſay you might do ſo, you would ſay I was an erroneous preacher, and well you might: This is an old free-will doctrine, that a man may reſiſt the devil by his own power, and eſcape his ſnares, and do the will of God: This hath been cried down by the doctors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and by moſt of all ſorts of Chriſtians; and for our parts, ſince the
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:020309_0256_0FAEF8EF63403F08"/>
Lord hath opened our mouths, we did never ſpeak a word in favour of it, as if we went about to reſiſt the devil in our own ſtrength; if we did, the devil would make fools of us: He that goes about to reſiſt the devil in his own ſtrength, will be entrapped and enſnared by him, in that men have a propenſity to ſin, and by his cunning and ſubtilty, may be led into a ſnare before they are aware.</p>
            <p>Thus it is agreed on all hands, that our power, as men, is too weak to reſiſt ſatan's temptation, ſo that you ſee we muſt have the aſſiſtance of the divine power, or all go to hell; there is no medium between thoſe two extremes, ſome extraordinary power muſt aſſiſt me, or elſe the devil will have me. If you will not admit of a ſupernatural power to come in to help me and you, we muſt all go to hell, there is no remedy: I will ſay my prayers, ſaith one; do ſo, yet in the beſt of your prayers there will be ſin; and <hi>if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</hi> I will go and hear ſermons, ſay you; the very man that preacheth will tell you, that hearing of ſermons will do you no good at all, unleſs there be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of God, ſo that you will be wrapt from one thing to another, and have diverſity of doctrines, and come to no fixedneſs; and while you concern yourſelves about doctrines, all the while the devil prevails upon you; as for the tongue, he hath the rule of that, and as for the hands, he hath the rule of them, and makes you do thoſe things that by his perpetual ſuggeſtions he moves you to; ſo that your going to church and ſaying your prayers ſignify nothing to bring you from under the wrath of God, and from the captivity of the devil: Hath not the devil thoſe in captivity that go to church, and ſay their prayers, and give alms? Theſe are things that you can do by your own power, the ſaying of your prayers, and faſting, and giving of alms, theſe things thou mayeſt do, the devil will not hinder thee, for he knows that theſe will not bring thee out of his clutches, nor out of his chains and fetters.</p>
            <p>There is but one way and means by which the devil may be effectually reſiſted, that is by taking to our help <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Chriſtians, and many of them did afford their help in the work, by counſel, by perſuaſion, by exhortation and by doctrine, but all this did not do; and the reaſon was this, becauſe the devil was too ſtrong for me, and ſo he was for them. As long as you go for help to this and the other place, until you find one ſtronger than the devil, expect no deliverance or help from any thing in the world, but lay aſide <hi>all confidence in the fleſh,</hi> in any many man on earth, or in all the doctors words and beſt preaching you ſhall hear, lay aſide your confidence in them, they will never do you any good in this reſpect, for they will never break your chains off; many are loaded with them, but ſome, I hope, are <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> and feel the weight of ſin, I pray God increaſe the number; though it be a ſtate of ſorrow, it is better than the ſtate of <hi>fools,</hi> that <hi>make a mock of ſin;</hi> I would have you weary and heavy laden with your ſins, and brought into this ſtate, to ſee yourſelves captivated by the ſtrong power of darkneſs, and to ſee you are unable to deliver yourſelves out of it by your own power.</p>
            <p>For me to fall into the hands of a tyrant that is ſtronger than I, and no man to deliver me, how ſad would it be. If I could find a man ſtronger than this tyrant, and that would kill him, I ſhould be his ſervant, and have a better maſter: No man can kill this tyrant, that hath led me captive and made me a ſlave; if he ſay, be drunk, I muſt be drunk; if he bid me ſwear, I muſt ſwear: This is the ſlavery that the devil hath got his ſervants into, that whatſoever he ſaith, that they muſt do, if he bids them do it: <hi>O! wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me?</hi> I cannot deliver myſelf, and no man can deliver me; I would be acquainted with all Chriſtians, if they could help me; I would try all religions that are this day in the world, to ſee if there be help for me: Many are oppreſſed with ſin, and they go to and fro, to ſee what help can be given them, to free them from the bondage that the devil hath them in: This ſort of people are to be pitied, and the ſouls of all good people will pity them, for ſuch as theſe ſeek the living among the dead; they ſeek that to redeem them that cannot redeem them: We have ſought, ſay they, for power and ſtrength from them that had
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:020309_0258_0FAEF8F0D00597D0"/>
not enough for themſelves, they were captivated as well as we, and all this becauſe we came not to him that is ſtronger than the devil. You will take the ſame courſe, and ſtay till grey hairs come, and you go down to the grave with ſorrow, unleſs you come to one ſtronger than the devil, and then truſt in him, believe in him, and expect deliverance by him. The reaſon why people do not expect deliverance is, becauſe theſe two things are ſhut out of their belief.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They believe not that a ſinful life will carry them to deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They think there is not any poſſibility in this world to live any other than a ſinful life.</p>
            <p>The devil hath brought men to this paſs, that they live as eaſily in a ſinful life, as a fiſh in the ſtream: We are in the way, ſay they; when we were baptized, we were initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into the Chriſtian church, we were baptized with the ſign of the croſs, that ſhews we are ſoldiers of Chriſt and bear his badge and banner upon us; and the man ſaid at that time, I was made a child of God and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven; if this be not true, then I am cheated and deceived, for I am to believe this to be true; the church hath affirmed that theſe things are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and to queſtion the veracity of the church, is to queſtion all.</p>
            <p>I would queſtion whether thouſands find the truth of it. When thou wert baptized, there was a kind of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and bargain made for this child of God and heir of eternal life, that he ſhould forſake the devil and all his works, and the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and the ſinful luſts of the fleſh: And there is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity given that this child ſhall never ſerve the devil and ſinful luſts, and never be proud, but ſerve God and keep his commandments: Now this ſecurity being taken, then they ſuppoſe that this child will certainly be an heir of the kingdom of God. It is very true, ſtand to thy church; if this ſecurity that is taken for a child be but effectual, then there is no doubt of being a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven. But if this ſecurity fail, is the church to blame if men's hopes to eternal life fail? Was it not my condition, that thou ſhouldeſt
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:020309_0259_0FAEF8F18FC6BA10"/>
forſake the devil and all his works, and the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and the ſinful luſts of the fleſh, and if thou break the bargain, and thy part of the covenant, and miſs of eternal life, who is to blame? Look to the ſecurity, ſee that thou forſake the devil and all his works, and the pomps and vanities of the world. But thou mayeſt rather ſay, I have enjoyed as many of them as I could; and for the luſts of the fleſh, I have enjoyed as much of them as I can; and what, doſt thou believe thyſelf to be a child of God and an heir of the kingdom of Heaven, notwithſtanding?</p>
            <p>If I promiſe to deliver a man any particular kind of goods, upon the payment of ſo much money, if I fail in delivering the goods, he will not deliver the money; a man muſt forſake the devil and all his works, and never luſt after the pomps and vanities of this world; that is a child of God, let us ſee him grow up, and if he goes on to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this covenant till he die, I do not at all queſtion but he will be an heir of eternal life; but when all this is broken, and the ſecurity ſignifies nothing, and the man is given up to ſerve the devil, breaks all God's holy laws, erreth and ſtrayeth from the way of God's commandments like a loſt ſheep, and graſps at the pomps and vanities of the world, as much as he can, and thinks he gets no more than comes to his ſhare; and when he ſhall indulge the luſts of his fleſh, this is a child of the devil; he is a child of that Spirit that was a liar from ths beginning. Never talk of being a child and an heir of God's kingdom, ſuch a man is in fetters, he is to go along with the devil and his angels, and there is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for them, and a kingdom of darkneſs, and he muſt have his portion with them in everlaſting miſery: <hi>Tophet is prepared of old for all the workers of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What for thoſe that are baptized? Yes, but do not you deny baptiſm?</p>
            <p>No, not I, I would have men and women baptized with a baptiſm that will do them ſome good. Some have ſeen the vanity and weakneſs of this kind of baptiſm, and called it baby baptiſm; and therefore would go and be baptized and plunged in the water over head and ears, but they came up again with the ſame heart and mind, and the ſame polluted ſoul. <hi>John</hi> baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judea</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="unknown:020309_0260_0FAEF8F2713AB8E0"/>
came to be baptized of him: There were a ſort of baptized perſons then that crucified the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that never did them harm in his life, but much good.</p>
            <p>This baptiſm had never an apoſtolical patron, but there is another baptiſm that is ſo infallible a baptiſm, that if a man were ſurely baptized withal, he was ſure of Heaven, he would never need any other aſſurance of Heaven than to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt: The lip of truth ſpeaks of him, <hi>he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> He ſhall be ſaved in ſpite of the devil and all his temptations, in ſpite of perſecutions and the ſtumbling-blocks laid before him. Here is a baptiſm worth a man's while, worth all his labour, if he could obtain it; <hi>he that cometh after me,</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire;</hi> here is a baptiſm belongs to Chriſtians, an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ordained. Far be it from us to deny baptiſm; but we would light of the right, ſince there are ſo many ſorts: This baptiſm is ſo right and certain, that it aſcertains a man of his ſalvation, but it is done by <hi>the Holy Ghoſt and with fire:</hi> If it be by the Holy Ghoſt, then it is far enough off from us; for there is no Holy Ghoſt in our days, ſay ſome, ſo this baptiſm is ceaſed, and inſpiration is ceaſed. If the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> be the matter of baptiſm, the thing being failed and ceaſed, the conſequence cannot follow; thou and I cannot be baptized becauſe there is no working of the Holy Ghoſt in our days; ſay ſome, this baptiſm is <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire;</hi> with fire for burning up our corruptions, and purifying our hearts. But the Holy Ghoſt hath done working upon men, ſay they; why then there is an end of baptiſm: A man is hungry, and when his time comes to eat, he hath no victuals, yet he ſits him down as if he did eat; will this feed and nouriſh him? So men now-a-days, they have a baptiſm wherewith they are baptized; but baptiſm with <hi>the Holy Ghoſt and with fire,</hi> is the right bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, therefore do not baptize until you find the Holy Ghoſt, this will be far better; this is the baptiſm that they which come to know it, are ſure of ſalvation by it; for by this baptiſm, they are borne up and tinctured in their ſouls with the Divine Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, proceeding from the Father and the Son, till they receive his likeneſs, and ſo die unto
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:020309_0261_0FAEF8F43825BBC8"/>
ſin: <hi>As many as were baptized, were baptized into Chriſt's death.</hi> The apoſtle openeth it, <hi>in that he died he died unto ſin once, but in that he liveth he liveth unto God; ſo that they that were baptized, were baptized into Chriſt's death; and you that are dead unto ſin, how ſhould you live any longer therein?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe that were baptized lived without ſin; can that be true, that no one lived without ſin but Chriſt only? Yes, ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>you that were free from ſin, are alive to righteouſneſs;</hi> their life ſtood before in ſin, and now that life is taken away by baptiſm, and they are alive to Chriſt, and he that liveth he liveth to God. He that comes to be partaker of the firſt reſurrection, if he live ten, twenty, forty, or a hundred years, he liveth to God, he liveth no more in the pomps and vanities of the world, and the ſinful luſts of the fleſh, but <hi>he liveth unto God.</hi> This bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, whoever comes to be baptized with it, ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that we do not deny baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But we hear ſay, that you deny the Lord's ſupper. We have never had ſuch a thought, God knows; there is nothing that our ſouls long after more; but people have been making a kind of work of their own, they have loſt a reality, and make ſhadows, as children do, who when they ſee things made in the houſe for ſervice, they will make the like in ſand and clay. People do not not ſee what a great thing it is to attain to the ſupper of the Lord; as things come into an evangelical opening, we ſpake then more lively and freſhly of things. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man open to me, I will come in and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> For the underſtanding of this text, go and examine, and ſearch all the commentators you can find, and ſee what the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men ſay of it; ſee if they do not apply this to the inward call of the Spirit and grace of Chriſt, to let him into our hearts; and would one think that thoſe that wrote theſe things ſhould be againſt the ſpiritual diſpenſation of things? They ſay that this knocking at the door of the heart ſignifies the call of God's Spirit at the door of the heart. There are two ſorts of ſinners that God knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the door of their hearts; one is, a man that is
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:020309_0262_0FAEF8F49251BE38"/>
weary of his ſin: For his part, he wiſheth that he might never ſin more. As ſoon as he perceives the knock, and is called upon to let in the grace of God, to help him againſt temptation, he freely opens his heart to receive it, and ſaith, with all my heart I will entertain and welcome the grace of God; glad I am that God hath had ſo much patience towards me; and ſince God offers his grace, I will embrace this grace of God above all pleaſures, and I will take it into my heart; the grace of Chriſt is the greateſt jewel that I know. Honeſt <hi>Paul,</hi> he took this courſe, and prayed, Lord take away this tempter; here is a temptation that troubleth me, and I am not willing to yield, for all the devil follows me with it; <hi>he cried unto the Lord, and beſought him three times, earneſtly,</hi> to take away the temptation; and the Lord anſwers him, <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> What matter if the tempter buffet thee, and trouble thee, haſt thou not received my grace into thy heart? Thou art a believer, and thy truſt is in me, and <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> Let the tempter do his worſt, keep thou to the grace of God, and thou wilt withſtand and overcome the temptation when it comes.</p>
            <p>If a man openeth his heart and receiveth Chriſt when he comes, then you ſhall find ſuch an alteration in that man, that go and try him with the ſame temptation which prevailed over him the laſt week, it will not do ſo now; though he be as weak as water, and as prone to corruption and iniquity as before, yet now having a faith begotten in him, that the grace of God will defend him, he keeps out of the devil's ſnares. Now this man truſting in this grace till his ſin and iniquity be purged out, now is the time to spread the table; there is a clean heart, and the heavenly gueſt is now come, and the dainties of the kingdom are brought to him for his nouriſhment. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will come in and ſup with him, and my Father a ſo will come, and we will ſup with him, and he with us.</hi> This never happens to any body ſo long as the table and heart is ſoul; for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt be clean, and the devil and ſin thrown out, and then will the Lord confirm and ratify, and ſeal the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; ſo that here is a ſeal with a witneſs. When a man hath this teſtimony of the love of God, that God is
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:020309_0263_0FAEF8F6CC56A930"/>
reconciled to him in Chriſt, then Chriſt will come in, and he will bring his Father, and they will ſup with him; and this is that which will give complete ſatisfaction to ſuch a ſoul.</p>
            <p>All the tongues of men and angels are too ſhort to ſpeak of theſe things, as they are in themſelves, but they are all manifeſted by the Spirit. All the myſteries of the kingdom of God, are manifeſted by the Spirit of God; now to ſay there is no Spirit to be regarded now-a-days, that is as much as to ſay, we muſt never regard the kingdom of God, <hi>for no man can diſcern the things of God but the Spirit of God,</hi> no man can tell what they be; <hi>as no man can know the things of a man but the ſpirit of a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt look to this and the other form, and mark, and methodize them, for we can know nothing of the things of God themſelves.</p>
            <p>I hope you are all of another judgment, and believe that this is a trick and cheat of the wicked one; people do find the Spirit and will feel it if they will wait upon the motions of it. I do not only mean when you are here together, but when you are ſeparated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when you feel the motions of this good Spirit, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, and make them yours. This Spirit is a gift that is given; ſo may a ſhilling or a piece of bread be held forth to a poor creature, but if he receive it not, he may periſh for all that; it is not his, tho' I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to be his, and have ſeperated it from my other ſubſtance to be his. If he receive not what I offer and would give him, he may periſh for all that.</p>
            <p>Here is <hi>grace and truth comes by Jeſus Chriſt, and God hath offered it to all men, in that he hath raiſed up Chriſt from the dead; the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared unto all men;</hi> but all men have not received it, therefore all men have it not; and they that have not the grace of Chriſt, and the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt, are none of his;</hi> but it doth not follow that they never will be none of his. When they have received the gift by Chriſt, and ſay, I will be his ſheep or lamb, they will come into his favour by that gift, and ſhall partake of the good things of his Father's kingdom; but till they have received this
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:020309_0264_0FAEF8F6E7F76648"/>
gift, they are not the better for it, they have not any benefit by the death of Chriſt; they have no help, no benefit by it, except it be the patience and long-ſuffering of God, who for Chriſt's ſake bears with their weakneſs, and waits to be gracious, and for Chriſt's ſake offers them favour; but they are not come to the poſſeſſion of it, till they open their hearts, and receive the grace of Chriſt; then they are convinced of Chriſt's end, and that there is a poſſibility of enjoying the Spirit of God, and of being taught and led by it.</p>
            <p>Take this along with you, that it is your abſolute and indiſpenſable duty to wait from day to day upon the great God of Heaven, <hi>the giver of every good and perfect gift,</hi> that you may have that bleſſed gift, that you may have the aſſiſtance of a greater power than your own to lead you out of ſin into righteouſneſs, that through Jeſus Chirſt you may be acceptable to God.</p>

            <head>SERMON XXIII. CHRIST <hi>the</hi> WAY, <hi>the</hi> TRUTH, <hi>and the</hi> LIFE.</head>
            <head type="sub">Preached at GRACE-CHURCH-STREET, <date>April 18, 1687.</date>
            </head>
            <p>I Fear the high places are not taken away; it hath been ſo in all ages, and it is manifeſtly ſo in this day; where the heart is not rightly prepared for the Lord, there the high places are not taken away: For all the high places in the time of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s idolatry, they were ever ſet up when they departed from the Lord, and all the high places now they are up in a time of ignorance of God; when people have forgotten the Lord, then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themſelves, then pride, and arrogance, and every evil way prevails upon us; but when men come to ſeek the Lord with uprightneſs, that brings down their high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, that brings every one into humility; for every one comes to be convinced in themſelves that none can find
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:020309_0265_0FAEF8F7E663F8F0"/>
the Lord, but as they are brought to be humble; nay, indeed, none ſeek after him aright but ſuch, none have the promiſe of finding him but the humble.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is the duty of every one that is a real en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer and ſeeker after God, to know the right prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, to know themſelves in ſuch a frame of ſpirit, that they may ſeek in hope, that they may have a right and juſt expectation of finding him whom they are ſeeking after; for this hath been the reaſon that a great many have been fruſtrated in their endeavours, and in their purpoſes of ſeeking after the Lord, they have not been rightly prepared for him to manifeſt himſelf unto them, they have not known the <hi>preparation of his ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary;</hi> there was a peculiar preparation that was requiſite to thoſe that drew near unto the ſanctuary of God, they were hallowed, that is, made holy, ere they drew near to the holy place; but alas! this hath been greatly neglected in our days, unholy people with unholy minds have been ſeeking after the Holy God, they have been enquiring after a holy way, and were not prepared to walk in it, there was nothing raiſed in their minds, that was fit to walk in that way.</p>
            <p>For ſo long as men or women ſtand in unity with their luſts and concupiſcence, with the ſpirit of this world, and the way of it, they are not capable of receiving that which ſhould lead them into the way of holineſs; nay, if it appears to them, they cannot receive it, for it is with them as with other gueſts, there be other lovers already let in, which employ the powers and faculties of their ſouls, ſo that if the moſt beloved of all, the moſt excellent, if <hi>the chiefeſt of ten thouſand</hi> do appear, they cannot <hi>ſee a comelineſs in him.</hi> The prophet ſpeaking of this ſtate and condition of men, did propheſy concerning our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>when we ſhall ſee him there is no comelineſs in him why we ſhould deſire him,</hi> and ſo it hath happened to a great many now-a-days, though the truth hath appeared to them, yet they have not looked upon it as a pleaſant way, as a way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, but a way to be ſhunned if poſſible. What ſhifts have a great many people made to keep themſelves, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, out of the way of truth, arguing for this and that,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:020309_0266_0FAEF8F850039430"/>
and diſputing for one way and another that was out of truth's way, out of the way of holineſs. What was the meaning of all their arguments, but to tell us they might be happy, they might be ſaved, though they did not come into truth's way, and walk in truth's way? And though they did abide in thoſe things, that were contrary to the teſtimony of truth in their own hearts, yet it might go well with them.</p>
            <p>This is the ſtrength of the arguments of all ſorts, of all perſuaſions in the world, that have been arguing themſelves out of the truth, and would argue us out of the truth too, and would take the liberty to do thoſe things which are not agreeable therewith; but now the reaſon of this is becauſe the preparation is wanting, they are thoſe that have no need of truth, and that have no need of God, and of a Saviour; but think they can make ſhift without them; he is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the chiefeſt to them, they can abide in the high places, they can <hi>call upon the name of the</hi> Lord, and they can <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the groves, and in the high places</hi> both together, like thoſe nations that were brought to inhabit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Iſrael when the ten tribes were carried away, they ſent for prieſts to teach them, they ſent back to the king of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to ſend them ſome prieſts, to teach them to worſhip the God of their country, and when the prieſt came to teach them, he taught them the ceremonies of the law, and the divers obſervations that the Jews uſed to practiſe in that country, and ſo they grew into a formality of ſerving the God of <hi>Iſrael, they called upon the name of the Lord, and every nation worſhipped their own Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is this nation, and the nations of Europe, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited with ſuch a people that are called by the name of the Lord, but every one worſhipping their own Gods; one makes gold and ſilver his God, another makes his pleaſure his God, another his honour, another this, that, and the other luſt, and they bow down to them, that is, they yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their luſts, concupiſcence and corruptions, that they ſtand in unity with, but they call upon the name of the Lord too; they do apply themſelves to ſome kind of form of worſhip, which they ſay is unto the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and inviſible God; but alas! they come not to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:020309_0267_0FAEF8F91553CB08"/>
of God by this. All that the prieſts could do that the king of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſent back, could not bring the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to the knowledge of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they only brought them to a report of ſuch a God, that had ſet up ſuch a law: They had the report of it, and for fear that the lions ſhould tear them in pieces, they would enter into that form, but they worſhipped their own Gods ſtill.</p>
            <p>So it is now, people do not come to the knowledge of the true God, the living God, by entering into any form of religion; for inſtance, prayer, hearing of any ordinance or church-fellowſhip, theſe give not men the knowledge of God, there is but one way to come to that, but one only. Men have found a great many, it is paſt your skill and mine to reckon up the many ways that men have found out upon the face of the earth, how they might come to the knowledge of God, and to peace and reconciliation with him; but they have only played the fool, and ſpent their time in vain, eſpecially they that own the ſcriptures of truth to be a true and faithful record of the mind and will of God, they play the fool abominably; for the ſcripture that they give ſo much reputation to in their profeſſion doth teſtify the way is but one, and there is no other way for people to be reconciled to God, than by coming into Chriſt; to be found in him, to be regenerated and born into his nature, and have his qualities put upon them, <hi>that as he was pure, they may be pure; that he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified by him, may become both one, and ſo be reconciled to the Father through him.</hi> This you know is the common profeſſion of Chriſtendom, or at leaſt of our nation. And in other nations, the common profeſſion is, there is no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator but one, no Reconciler but one. Indeed ſome others hold there may be other Mediators, and that there are others that may contribute to them by their mediation, and by their prayers and merits, but the generality of the nations are otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Now for people to fall out, and ſay, my way is beſt, and thy way is not beſt, and to fall into conteſts about many ways, when the ſcripture concludes there is but one way, is not well; we had better all agree about this doctrine, that there is no poſſibility of reconciliation with God, ſince we are
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:020309_0268_0FAEF8FAC19092E0"/>
fallen out with him, and ſince ſin hath made a ſeparation, there is no way of being reconciled again to God, but by and through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; nor by him neither, unleſs we receive of his Spirit to quicken us; nothing can quicken us, enliven us, or recommend us to God, but the Spirit of Chriſt operating and working in our hearts, that he may prepare us for the Father's kingdom.</p>
            <p>If people would agree upon this, there would be an end of all labour, and toil, and jangling about the right way, for the conſequence and concluſion would be this: That the man who doth not know himſelf the ſanctifying power of the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, he is out of the way to reconciliation with God, let his form and profeſſion be what it will: If therefore he be reconciled to God, it muſt be by and through the Mediator, and he will never recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to the Father till he hath made him a temple to let in the Spirit of Chriſt, to work in his heart, to fit him for the kingdom of God: And men have no other way to come to it; for though they be zealous in every prayer and form, it ſignifies nothing to any great purpoſe, their hope will be fruſtrated; <hi>there is no other way,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>of coming to the Father, but by me; I am the way, the truth and the life.</hi> If I am out of the truth, I am out of the way; and if I am out of the way, then I cannot come to the end of the way. This is plain reaſoning among men: If I tell a lie, that is out of the truth: If I have vain communication, or deceive or wrong my neighbour, that is out of the truth; if I am in that which is manifeſted in my conſcience to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth, I am out of the way; though I be ſtrict in that way, as to profeſſion, yet I am out of the way to God, I am out of the truth; there is no way to God but by Chriſt, who is the way, the truth and the life; whoever is out of him, is out of the way; which made the apoſtle ſay, <hi>that his labour, endeavour and deſire was, that he might be found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſneſs, but having on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many men think to recommend themſelves to God by their righteous, juſt and honeſt dealings, and doing wrong to nobody. This is good in itſelf, but doth not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to God, unleſs it be done by the righteous and
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:020309_0269_0FAEF8FB6434D068"/>
holy Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, unleſs it be of his working; he muſt have the working of righteouſneſs and truth in us; he muſt plant it, and it muſt grow by his working, if it be acceptable to the Father; <hi>for without me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> A man out of Chriſt, a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his Spirit, may do ſomething, but nothing avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the well-being of his ſoul, 'till he have reconciliation by Chriſt Jeſus: If he be reconciled to God, this Mediator muſt be the Reconciler, and he muſt fit and prepare him for reconciliation with the Father.</p>
            <p>All the diviſions, ſorts and ſects of religion, muſt all come to an end; if this meaſuring line be laid to them, they all appear too ſhort; and there is nothing will do a man good, but that religion that obligeth and ties him to the good pleaſure of God, through the Spirit of the Mediator, which he feels working in him, by which he is raiſed from death to ſome degree of life: When he is ſenſible what a burthen ſin is to his life, that godly life which he hath, he is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with every ſin, and oppreſſed with every vain thought, and every vain word, if he be not in ſome meaſure quickened, he is not ſenſible of this burthen; but being quickened, he is ſenſible of the burthen that lies upon his life, by reaſon of his ſin; and then, being under the weight of his ſin, he calls to God for his aſſiſtance; he cries to God to help him; he now knows that he hath ſtriven and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain. O God of all grace, if thou vouchſafeſt not help to my ſoul, if thou doſt not interpoſe by the aſſiſtance of thy grace, I cannot overcome this ſin. There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual cry to God for divine aſſiſtance, and as they cry to God for aſſiſtance, he miniſters aſſiſtance to them, by which they are able to overcome the enemy of their ſouls, and all temptations when they come: And when a man finds ſuch divine aſſiſtance, his faith is ſtrengthened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and ſo he <hi>fights the good fight of faith,</hi> and at laſt gets the victory; victory over his ſin, and his own luſts, and concupiſcence, and victory over the aſſaults and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the adverſary, and at laſt he comes, through the grace of God, <hi>to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly in this preſent world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="unknown:020309_0270_0FAEF8FC0CE4C418"/>Now when people do thus, it is by the grace of God. This life of righteouſneſs, ſobriety and godlineſs, is not the effect of their labour and exerciſe, and of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours herein, but it is the effect of the holy Spirit that hath been the teacher. When you ſee a man has become a good ſcholar, eminent in all ſorts of learning, you will conclude he did not attain to all this of himſelf, he did not learn this and the other language, this and the other art and ſcience of himſelf; no, he had ſome judicious and able maſter and teacher, who communicated of his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledge to his diſciple and ſcholar: This is the efficient cauſe of his improvement. Now if a man, by the grace and the Spirit of God, and the teachings of it, live a holy, godly life, this is the effect of ſomething; he did not always live ſuch a life, how comes he to live ſuch a life now? Is it by his own induſtry, labour and exerciſe? No, it is by being exerciſed, taught and led by the Spirit of God; ſo that it is the effect of the grace of God that he ſhould live ſuch a holy life, this is the meritorious cauſe of it, as he is a creature, and by this only acceptable to God in Chriſt the Mediator.</p>
            <p>Thus a man comes to be juſtified and accepted, not becauſe he is a godly man, but is made ſo by the Spirit of God: <hi>You are not under the law,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>but under grace:</hi> You are under the teachings of it, under the directions of it: Grace can reprove people; for that grace and that truth that comes by Chriſt, and manifeſts itſelf as a light in the hearts of tranſgreſſors, reproves their ſin, and calls them out of it; it reproves them for it, and exhorts them to leave it, both at one time; ſo that we muſt acknowledge all our righteouſneſs, holineſs and obedience to be of God, and all that we do in order thereunto, as it is done by the teaching, by the influence and operation of the grace of God given us in Chriſt Jeſus; it is the effect of him who is our Mediator, he worketh it in us, and for us, of his good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>If we be juſtified, we are not juſtified for a righteous, holy life, and for our obedience; but we are juſtified through Chriſt, who worketh a godly life in them that believe, ſo that a man is not juſtified by any other way or means; and all
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:020309_0271_0FAEF8FF849EEC20"/>
other ways a man takes of being reconciled to God, are vain and fruitleſs, and have been ſpoken againſt by all that were moved by the Holy Ghoſt in the New Teſtament. Saith the prophet, <hi>what, ſhall I come before the Lord withal?</hi> I am fallen under death and ſin, and in a ſeparation from God, I would fain be reconciled to him; what ſhall I do to be reconciled to God? He goes about to reckon without Chriſt, and without faith and holineſs. <hi>Shall I take a thouſand rams, and ten thouſand rivers of oil?</hi> Shall I come nearer ſtill? <hi>Shall I make an offering of the fruit of my body, for the ſin of my ſoul? Shall I offer my firſt-born to God,</hi> that I may not be rejected and brought to a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from him? Thus men when they come to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, do feel in themſelves that all this is to no purpoſe: The anſwer comes, thou mayeſt live, but all thy contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances about making an offering are vain: <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man! what to do.</hi> It is not thy finding this way and that way, viz. thy rams, and thy oil, and thy firſt-born; it is no way of thy deviſing and imagining that can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile thee to me, <hi>I have ſhewed thee, O man, what is good.</hi> What is this that is ſhewed? It is compriſed in a ſhort compaſs, <hi>it is to love mercy, to do juſtice, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Will this ſerve without offering rams and oil, and offering my firſt born? This will do if thou canſt but <hi>love mercy</hi> when it is ſhewn thee; that is, embrace mercy, and love it. He hath ſhewed mercy to all men; then love it and receive it; <hi>do juſtly,</hi> leave every thing that is unrighteous, and do that which is juſt in the ſight of God, but do not boaſt of thy juſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but <hi>walk humbly with thy God;</hi> here is the whole duty of man. Here is no dependence on dead works, or my own exertions, in order to my juſtification.</p>
            <p>Indeed the conſideration of theſe kind of leſſons do corrupt ſome men, and put them upon doing this or that, and upon forbearing this or that, and hath brought many to confeſſion and great abſtinence, and put them upon great doings, thinking this would anſwer the juſtice of God; I have loved mercy, and given all I had to the poor. If I do juſtly, and abſtain from this and the other liberty, if I walk humbly, that is, if I humble myſelf by
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:020309_0272_0FAEF9016A673598"/>
this and the other manner of pennance and contrition, then I do what God requires, and then I have pleaſed God.</p>
            <p>Now all that have gone this way to work, to do juſtly, and love mercy, and to make themſelves humble, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves in ſuch a low manner, they have miſſed the mark. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man! what is good;</hi> that it is impoſſible for fallen man to anſwer this himſelf; he may be convinced of his duty to do juſtice, but by his own power and ſtrength he cannot do it; there are ſo many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from without, and ſo many from within, ſuch a propenſity in nature, that will prevail againſt all the bonds of charity that he can make.</p>
            <p>Therefore is <hi>help laid upon one that is mighty;</hi> without the grace of God that comes by Chriſt Jeſus, a man can never do right, though convinced: Tho' the Lord hath ſhewed him what is good, he ſhews us that we are unable of ourſelves; he hath taken care to ſend his Son: <hi>God hath ſo loved the world, that he hath ſent his Son into the world,</hi> that he might help thoſe that have need of help, that every one that is in diſtreſs might have an eye to Chriſt, <hi>the author and finiſher of their faith;</hi> when men have a reference to their faith in Chriſt, this makes their duty acceptable; I cannot do it except the Lord ſtrengthen me; therefore I will have reſpect to the Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus, who was ſent for a light into the world. God ſends forth his grace for every one to lay hold on, who generally believe, that tho' they are unable to do what God requires, yet he will enable them to do it; <hi>for as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God,</hi> tho' they were the devil's children before; <hi>he is the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and forever.</hi> He abides always the ſame in his grace to men, he is in his operation to them the ſame; he offers grace to them that are in a frame of mind to receive it; they may know that his power will give them ability, and that whatſoever they do of themſelves will prove fruitleſs, becauſe it is not done in Chriſt's name and power, and ſo not acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>The greateſt thing that we are to be concerned about, if we will be religious, and concern ourſelves about divine matters, about the kingdom of God and the world to come,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:020309_0273_0FAEF90278B97430"/>
is, to ſee what frame of mind we are in at preſent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the high places are taken away, whether we are not exalted in our own conceits of knowledge and wiſdom, and reckon not to be beholden to him for his grace. If we be highly conceited, and think we can ſtand upon our own legs, the high places are not taken away: Men are not in this ſtate prepared to ſeek the God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; therefore, let every one turn to God, and ſee how it is with you; ſee whether there be a mind brought low enough to be ſubject to Chriſt, and to the gracious teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>A man may ſay, I can make a ſermon, I can make a prayer and exhortation, and I can make a book, and ſend it abroad, I can do all this by my own parts and abilities; ſo thou mayeſt, and mayeſt make it all full of good words, but thou canſt never make it acceptable to God; for <hi>without me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> Thou muſt have the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Chriſt, elſe thou canſt not make a good prayer, nor a good book, nor any thing good; God eſteems <hi>the very plowing of the wicked to be an abomination</hi> to him. Where the mind is not exerciſed by the Spirit of God, if he ſhould pray from morning to night, and ſpend all his days in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it will do him no good. <hi>If I,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard iniquity;</hi> you may think I am a man in favour with God, a man after God's own heart; <hi>yet if I regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer.</hi> What ſignifies prayers and ſermons, made of good words, if they come not from a heart ſeparate from iniquity? If it be not ſo, it will do no good at all, in point of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God.</p>
            <p>O let the fear of the Lord enter upon every heart! wait all to feel the Divine Power of the Lord, that brings down every high thought, that ſo you may look to the preparation of your hearts, that is a right preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when the people are ſo low, ſo broken and ſo tender, that they are nothing in their own eyes, but what the Lord will make them to be; then they are as clay in the hands of the potter, they are faſhioned by his hands, and made the <hi>workmanſhip of God in Chriſt Jeſus, the
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:020309_0274_0FAEF902D4281C48"/>
one Mediator between God and man.</hi> They muſt bear the likeneſs of Chriſt Jeſus, bear his Heavenly image, they muſt have his qualities, and have the ſame mind in them that was in him: <hi>I do always that which pleaſeth my Father,</hi> ſaith the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Indeed he hath the doing of things in the hearts of men, and God is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, and where men have the doing of them themſelves, they are thrown back as dung in their faces; where any rightly deſire juſtification, where men have a right preparation of heart, ſo to ſeek the God of their fathers, as to find him and be accepted of him, it is through Jeſus Chriſt, in whom he is well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>In all your aſſemblies, prayers, exerciſes and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you muſt be ſeparated and drawn off from your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer lovers, and you muſt be joined to him that God hath ſent to be a leader and a guide unto you, then you will find daily his aſſiſtance; and as you have aſſiſtance from him, you will find acceptance with God, and he will ſhew you the Father, and that, and nothing elſe, will ſatisfy the ſoul hungering and thirſting after God. <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us.</hi> So when Chriſt, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, comes to have wrought ſo far as the purifying of the ſoul, and the ſanctifying thereof, and thereby fitted it for his glory, ſuch holy ſouls ſhall behold his glory; <hi>for the Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That you may be brought to this ſtate, and kept and preſerved in it; that the Heavens may rain down fatneſs upon you, and that you may feel the living virtues that flow from Chriſt to every member, is the labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of the ſervants of God, for their own ſouls, and the ſouls of others that are in unity and fellowſhip with the Holy Spirit.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THERE is nothing will make people live to God, but that which they receive from God. For as all men are by nature in a ſtate of death, ſo there muſt be ſomething beyond nature to make them alive again; and this is what every one ought to wait upon God for, that you may feel ſomething that is ſupernatural, and that you may be acquainted with God's gift; <hi>the gift of God,</hi> ſaith the ſcripture, <hi>is eternal life.</hi> Many find a life in this world, that is not the gift of God. The life that people have in ſin, it is not the gift of God; the delights and pleaſures of this world are become a life unto them. The world is that to which every one muſt die; they that are not dead to that, they all live to themſelves, they do not live to God, for none can live to God, but by the life that comes from him. That which people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of man, gathers them unto man; that which they receive of God, carries them to God.</p>
            <p>So men have made gatherings, and have communicated of what they have to one another, and by virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, have made them a people: Many men have gathered many people, many churches, and they live to them that gathered them; they do not live to God, for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſomething from God, but all they that come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gift of God, they die to the world, and they come to live ſuch a life as the world doth not love, doth not care for, and hath no pleaſure in: <hi>If you were of the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the world would love you; but becauſe you are not of the world, they hate you.</hi> How ſhould this be underſtood, were not they ſome of the men of that generation? How doth he mean they were not of the world? <hi>Why, I have taken you out of it,</hi> ſaith he; and yet they were there ſtill, and they were named by certain names, the ſons of ſuch and ſuch men; yet for all that,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:020309_0276_0FAEF904599E1330"/>
they were not of the world; and that which differed in them was, being made partakers of that life which the world knew not.</p>
            <p>And ſo there will be an enmity in the world againſt the life of holineſs; they will hate any body that lives in it; and as it was then, ſo it is at this day, they that are of the world, they hear and receive thoſe things that are of the world, from the men of this world; but they that are of God, they hear them that are of God, and they receive the things of God, and their greateſt comfort and joy that they have is in their communion with God in Chriſt Jeſus, through whom, as through a conduit, the bleſſings of the father are miniſtered to them, and through whom, as from the fountain of life, their life is renewed from day to day.</p>
            <p>But theſe things are hid from the world, <hi>from the wiſe and prudent of it;</hi> they cannot dig into the depth, nor aſcend to this height; they cannot <hi>comprehend the length and the breadth of the things of God, which are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> they may reach unto ſomething of the love of God, that is in the creation; they can tell when the ſun ſhines upon them, and when the rain falls upon their fields; and when it falls in due ſeaſon they call it a bleſſing; and while the covenant with winter and ſummer remains, they look upon it as comfortable, and perhaps ſometimes will beſtow a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I thank God for it.</hi> All theſe things are beneath us, and <hi>there is neither love nor hatred known by them all. I ſaw the wicked, ſaith one, I beheld his dwelling place, and he flouriſhed like unto a green bay-tree,</hi> and was wicked ſtill, notwithſtanding all this.</p>
            <p>But now, they that ſee where they live, that live to God, they can ſay, that their leaf never withers, but they <hi>bring forth their fruit in due ſeaſon;</hi> but he did not ſo. But the wicked man <hi>that flouriſhed like a green bay-tree, behold I looked, and he was removed, and his place was no more to be found:</hi> There came a blaſting upon all his bleſſing and his flouriſhing came to an end; his riches periſhed, and his good things paſſed away from him. But the man <hi>whoſe delight is in the law of God,</hi> and makes it his pleaſure both night and day, he is <hi>like a tree planted by the rivers of water, whoſe leaf never fades, and brings forth his fruit in due ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="277" facs="unknown:020309_0277_0FAEF90528E39EF0"/>But this is hid; there is no body in the world but would have ſomething of this life too; they would be ſure of eternal life, but they would not die to the other life, they would not be crucified to the world, they would not be ſeparated from their lovers; if they could get into the ſtate of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, an hour or two before they die, when they are ſure they ſhall die, it would pleaſe them; but to live that life that is to God, is to die to the world, and to part with that they have, their comfort, their joy, their peace and honour, and all their worldly enjoyments in it, before they can come to receive the gift of God, they think is hard: But they that look after it, and have a mind to find it out, without parting with the world's life, they deceive themſelves.</p>
            <p>Do not you ſee how men have deceived themſelves in theſe days? They have ſought after the kingdom of God till they are ſcattered in their own way; they are quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling about their own way, as if they never had any ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be their rule: They cry the ſcripture is their rule; this is the way to eternal life, ſaith one; and this is the way, ſaith another; and the one and the other ſay all theſe ways are falſe ſaving their own; and all theſe contenders about the way to eternal life, they all ſay the ſcripture is the rule.</p>
            <p>And yet the ſcriptures ſpeak of the way too, and tell us the way plainly, the way to reſt, peace and life eternal. If the ſcriptures had been ſilent in it, and had ſaid nothing but of genealogies and hiſtories of armies and wars, it had been ſomething; but the ſcriptures of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpeak of a certain way to eternal life, and ſay it is the way of holineſs, <hi>a way ſhall be caſt up for the redeemed and the ranſomed of the Lord to walk in, and the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man, though a fool, ſhall not miſtake in it.</hi> Though he never took a degree at the univerſity, he ſhall not err in it; though he be a fool in the account of the world, and never underſtood Greek or Latin, yet he ſhall not err in this way.</p>
            <p>The way that leads to the kingdom of God, is called the way of holineſs; but while many have been reading in their books, they have been contending for a way of unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; no wonder then they have been quarrelling about
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:020309_0278_0FAEF906019BB288"/>
it, and have all miſſed it, and that in the main point of all: Let them make a way, which way they will, and frame it ever ſo wiſely, according to the beſt wit they have, be it a way that hath all material qualifications that ſhould make it a way of holineſs, theſe men may walk in it, but they will never find the way to the kingdom of God, though they have ſought it out: Go to one place and another place, and ask them what is your way? Our way, ſay they, is the right way, the moſt ſure and certain way that can be found for people to walk in: But whither will it lead me? It will lead thee to the kingdom of God: That is it I would have; but will it lead me to holineſs? No, never in this world, thou muſt never come to holineſs; do the beſt thou canſt do here, it is but ſin; the beſt day's work thou makeſt is but ſin; the beſt child of God on earth cannot live a day without ſin: Do you hold out that in your way? Yes; then I have done with that, and muſt go to another people.</p>
            <p>So many have gone many ways to the kingdom of God, and when the upſhot is come, they have found every way a polluted way, a ſinful way; I know this way will never lead me to God; ſin firſt led me from God; I had been well enough as I was created at firſt, if I had never ſinned againſt God; a ſinful way will lead me from God. It is againſt common ſenſe, and againſt rationality, to ſay we did firſt go from God by ſin, and muſt go to God again by a ſinful way. Who will believe that ſuch a way will lead men to God's kingdom? and that any way will lead men to God, that will not lead them to holineſs?</p>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me;</hi> though a man keeps cloſe to meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ordinances, and duties, and performances, iniquity it ſeems remains ſtill; there is no rooting it out in this world. This continuing and remaining with a man, makes all his performances, and duties, and prayers unacceptable to God; they are all turned back again upon him, and caſt as dung upon his face, and true enough too; ſo that here is no coming unto God in this way; the comers thereunto know well enough they are not reconciled to God, if they are men that are conſcientious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="unknown:020309_0279_0FAEF90A9DC2B2B8"/>There are a ſort of people ſo ſtupid and ſordid in their judgment, that if a man tells them they are reconciled to God, they will believe him though conſcience reproves them a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hundred times a day. If the parſon of the pariſh ſay, that he hath made <hi>this child an heir of the kingdom of God and an inheritor of eternal life;</hi> I know ſome have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it forty years after, and have born themſelves up upon this man's word all their life: Do you think there is any danger of me, that in baptiſm was made an inheritor of eternal life, and an heir of the kingdom of God? God hath not appointed ordinances in his church for nothing.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not of ſuch ſordid hard-hearted people, that never entered into themſelves to know how it was with them, whether they are converted; but I ſpeak of ſober conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious people, that do not deſire to be cheated in a point of ſalvation, though they have been deceived a great while, they may be undeceived: Then they muſt take this for certain doctrine, that nothing can reconcile them to their Maker but that which takes away ſin. <hi>God hears not ſinners,</hi> he will never be reconciled to a man in this world, as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but there are many thouſands (bleſſed be God) in this age, as well as in other ages, that were ſinners, and reconciled to God through Chriſt, and had remiſſion of ſin; but never any man in his ſin was reconciled to God, though he did believe the truth, if he did not come to the ſanctification of the ſpirit, he could never be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God.</p>
            <p>So that there hath been, in all ages, a way of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God in the hearts of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to prepare them for the ſinleſs kingdom, for that glorious kingdom, into which nothing that hurteth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth or corrupteth, can enter. And becauſe we cannot enter with corruption and defilement, he hath appointed the miniſtration of his Spirit to work out that which might hinder the cleanſing of us from ſin, that we might <hi>have an abundant entrance into his glorious kingdom;</hi> ſo that whilſt they ſay there is an impoſſibility of living without ſin, I had as lief they had ſaid, there is an impoſſibility of entering into the kingdom of God; for never any ſhall come into the kingdom of God, but thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; for there is no purgatory after death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="unknown:020309_0280_0FAEF90BE12951A0"/>The Papiſts have a better conceit than the Proteſtants in that reſpect: The Proteſtants conceive ſin to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled at the point of death; and they ſay, all the ſins of believers, all the guilt of ſin, after we are believers, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, forgiven and done away, by the death of Chriſt upon the croſs; we will have it, if we can get it. If men can imagine a way into the kingdom of God, they will have one. They believe that a man may ſin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract no guilt; and that he may ſin till his dying day, and then all ſin ſhall paſs away, and he ſhall enter into God's kingdom. The Papiſts ſay none can come to Heaven till they be purged from ſin; and they ſay God hath appointed a place for that purpoſe, and perſons muſt go into pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and they muſt lie there till they are purged, and purified, and fitted for Heaven. Now, ſay the Proteſtants, truly; there is no ſuch thing, we find no ſuch thing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſcripture, therefore ſuch a thing as this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; for the apoſtle ſaid, <hi>we have declared to you the whole counſel of God,</hi> and he ſpeaks not a word of purgatory in all the New Teſtament. The Proteſtants have got a way to help themſelves, and the Papiſts, alſo, to help themſelves, and both lie under danger: As for the Papiſts, if their prieſts miſtake, and there be no ſuch place as purgatory, then they muſt be brought back to the doctrine of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which declares, <hi>that as death leaves us, ſo judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall find us; and as we ſow ſo we muſt reap; if we ſow to the fleſh, then of the fleſh we ſhall reap corruption.</hi> Then the Proteſtants, likewiſe, if they miſtake in ſaying, a man may act ſin and yet contract no guilt, then they muſt be brought back to the doctrine of the ſcriptures, that tell us, <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth muſt die: If a righteous man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his righteouſneſs, and doth that which is evil, his righteouſneſs ſhall be remembered no more, but in the ſin that he hath committed he ſhall die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſound doctrine: I had rather truſt the doctrine of the prophets and apoſtles than the doctrine of all others, either Proteſtants or Papiſts; and had rather depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their doctrine for ſalvation, that were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, than upon thoſe doctrines that ſay, there is no inſpiration now-a-days. Some conceive this ſcripture
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:020309_0281_0FAEF90CD20CED08"/>
may be interpreted thus and thus; and others conceive it means ſo and ſo, but we muſt, ſay they, ſubmit to better judgment: I am a fallible man, I ſubmit it to better judgments. Now when people are concerned for immortality and eternity, to have ſuch things diſhed out in ſuch a manner, what ſouls are ſo dull but they would beſtir themſelves, and conſider and look about them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go hence, and how it ſhall go with them when they are gone?</p>
            <p>We are now to work out our own ſalvation, that is on our part: None ever have wrought out this ſalvation, it is wrought out on God's part already, and it is to be made ours; he that is our Saviour, he <hi>hath ſuffered for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtification; he was made to us, of God, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now wiſdom ſignifies the opening of the counſel of God; righteouſneſs ſignifies the ſubjection of our wills to the will of God; ſanctification ſignifies obedience to the Spirit of Chriſt. Sanctification ſignifies obedience to ſomething; to what? what ſhall we be obedient unto? what is our rule? <hi>He that is led by the Spirit of Chriſt, he is his; but he that is not led by the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his;</hi> ſo that it is plain, ſanctification ſignifies obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Spirit of Chriſt, and redemption ſignifies buying again, or ſetting free from bondage.</p>
            <p>We know when our friends are in captivity, as in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, or elſewhere, we pay down our money for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; but we will not pay our money if they be kept in their fetters ſtill. Would not any one think himſelf cheated, to pay ſo much money for their redemption, and the bargain be made ſo that he ſhall be ſaid to be redeemed, and be called a redeemed captive, but he muſt wear his fetters ſtill? How long? as long as he hath a day to live.</p>
            <p>This is for bodies; but now I am ſpeaking of ſouls, Chriſt muſt be made to me redemption, and reſcue me from captivity. Am I priſoner any where? Yes; <hi>verily, verily, he that committeth ſin,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he is a ſervant of ſin,</hi> he is a ſlave to ſin: If thou haſt ſinned, thou art a ſlave, a captive, that muſt be redeemed out of captivity; who will pay a price for me? I am poor, I have nothing,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:020309_0282_0FAEF90D4FC3ACD0"/>
I cannot redeem myſelf, who will pay a price for me? There is one come, who hath paid a price for me; that is well, that is good news, then I hope I ſhall come out of my captivity. What is his name, is he called a Redeemer? So then I do expect the benefit of my redemption, and that I ſhall go out of my captivity. No, ſay they, you muſt abide in ſin, as long as you live: What benefit then have I by my redemption? I could have been in captivity no longer; if I had not been redeemed, I muſt wear my ſhackles and fetters ſtill, and be ſubject to my old maſter and patron, and when he will have me be drunk, I muſt be drunk; and when he will have me be unclean, I muſt be unclean.</p>
            <p>Thus many profeſt Chriſtians there be (you ſee it with your eyes) that will tell you they believe all the articles of the creed, and they have been baptized into the Chriſtian faith, and can rehearſe all the principles of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and perform the duty of Chriſtians in going to church, ſaying their prayers, and giving alms too it may be; they are ſuch as would be called Chriſtians, they would be called ſo, yet they <hi>are not redeemed from their vain converſations;</hi> for what makes their ſhackles and fetters about them? When their old maſter bids them be drunk, they will be drunk; and when he bids them commit whoredom, or lie, or cheat their neighbour, they will do it: You do believe the devil leads you to this; you will not ſay the Spirit of God led you to it. If one demand, how did you do it? You ſay, the devil prevailed upon me: What, hath the devil power over men after they are redeemed? What ſort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is this? Then comes in the old ſhift again, we are redeemed from the puniſhment of our ſin, but not from the act of it.</p>
            <p>Now if thoſe that are called ranters had told me this tale, it had been like them; but when doctors of divinity tell us this tale, it is ſo unlike divinity, that it is <hi>carnal, ſenſual and deviliſh.</hi> To tell believers they are redeemed from the puniſhment of ſin, but not from the act of ſin; that this is the benefit which we receive from Chriſt's ſufferings; that we may ſin on, free coſt; that there is no guilt contracted by it; will any man or woman, that underſtand they have a ſoul, venture their immortal ſouls on this divinity? I
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:020309_0283_0FAEF90E156B5278"/>
hope not. They will not venture their ſoul on this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-doctrine: I hope God will awaken the conſciencies of people, that they will not hazard their ſouls upon ſuch a carnal, deviliſh foundation; that if the devil ſhould preach, he could not preach a worſe doctrine than this, to perſuade Chriſtians they may live in ſin, and ſin will not hurt them, nor impair or break their peace with God, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with him.</p>
            <p>I will tell you how it hath been with me; in my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, if I had ſpoken a vain word, or a falſe word, I had contracted ſuch a guilt thereby, that I was aſhamed to draw near to God, to pray to him; I knew he would not hear liars, I knew there was no way to be accepted without repentance and amendment of life. I believe others have met with the ſame dealing from God, by the ſecret ſtrokes of conviction that have come upon their hearts, when they have ſinned againſt God.</p>
            <p>So that I am ſtill of the mind, that the perſons that depend upon this kind of doctrine, do at ſometimes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſickneſs comes, and death looks them in the face, or in times of common contagion or peſtilence, at ſuch a time they have a weight of guilt upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; for this doctrine will not ſupport them at death, but that then they believe they have contracted guilt, or committed ſin.</p>
            <p>I have wiſhed many times that the Lord would open the eyes and hearts of the people of this city and of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſee how miſerably they have ventured their ſouls. Will merchants in this city ever venture their goods at ſuch a rate as men commonly venture their ſouls? What, will they venture their goods in a ſhip without a bottom, before ſhe goes to ſea? Now this doctrine hath not a foundation; ſhall I believe a perſon that tells me I do not contract guilt, when I feel it upon my heart; when I commit whoredom and drunkenneſs, and cheat my neighbours, ſhall any one perſuade me that I do not contract guilt?</p>
            <p>O friends! we are ſpeaking of great matters; it is about eternity, that we are ſpeaking, it is about the hazard of eternal happineſs; therefore I pray, let every one be ſerious, and conſider what I ſay, for I ſpeak in God's name, and on

your behalf: Men are to come to a true ſearch in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what a life it is that they live. Many ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the <hi>doctrines and precepts of men,</hi> and they buoy themſelves into conceits of ſalvation; let them examine whether it be a life that hath its ſupport from the Spirit of God; this is material for every one to conſider. There are none can live to God, but by the life they receive from God; <hi>the grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men.</hi> Now here is an univerſal doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
            <p>There are a ſort of men in this city and nation that tell us, that ſaving grace is given only to the elect. Saving grace is given to <hi>all men;</hi> but you muſt conſtrue thoſe words, <hi>all the elect,</hi> where they are ſomewhat injurious, and would caſt off the condition of the text, if they make a diſtinction in the latter part of the ſentence, for it will not be good ſenſe: <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath appeared to all the elect, teaching us to deny all ungodlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. Here is <hi>us</hi> taken out of the <hi>all.</hi> The ſame grace, that is our teacher, appears to be the teacher of others, though they <hi>turn it into laſciviouſneſs.</hi> The grace is the ſame, though they make many ſchool-diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between common and ſaving grace. The apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it, by telling what grace he means; <hi>the grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation, appeareth to all men,</hi> and that is <hi>by teaching us;</hi> what doth it teach? I pray conſider it; it teacheth us <hi>to deny all ungodlineſs and all worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Where is ſin now, if a man be taught by this grace, and the dictates of it. Can a man live in ſin, and yet live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly too? Can a man live in ſin, and yet deny all ungodlineſs at the ſame time? Where have men's underſtanding been, that cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their mother tongue, and conſider ſenſe? Where are men's underſtandings that will ſay, I may <hi>deny all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> and yet follow the luſts of my own heart? You would think I ſpeak nonſenſe if I ſhould ſpeak thus; and yet we have been put off with ſuch nonſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ſtuff as this. We muſt pray to God to ſend <hi>his holy Spirit into our hearts, to enable us to live godly, righteous
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:020309_0285_0FAEF90FD1BDCF20"/>
and ſober lives,</hi> and at the ſame time believe that we ſhall never do it, but that it is a buſineſs of impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>Now when men come to lay theſe things together, and when they conſider between God and their own ſouls, how it is with them, many are amazed to think they ſhould ever be put off with ſuch incongruous, diſagreeing, and diſſonant things, that are not conſiſtent with one another.</p>
            <p>But do you think it is poſſible for any man to live without ſin? Yes, or elſe I would ſay it is impoſſible for any to be reconciled to God; for God will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to ſinners, as ſuch; for his bargain and covenant is made of ſuch kind of articles. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Ceaſe to do evil; learn to do well,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then come and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; tho' your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; tho' they be red as crimſon, they ſhall be as wool,</hi> Iſaiah i, 16, 17; ſtill theſe are the terms, <hi>put away the evil of your doings,</hi> then patience, mercy and long-ſuffering, ſhall be extended to you; <hi>God will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold;</hi> what, from thoſe that ſay their prayers, or go to the church or meeting? No, but <hi>but no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly;</hi> Pſal. lxxxiv, 11. Theſe are the men.</p>
            <p>And when the Lord diſtinguiſhes by his prophet whom he would have among them, he ſpeaks of a ſort of people that called upon the name of the Lord; <hi>thoſe that feared the Lord, and ſpake often one to another;</hi> that is, of the goodneſs of God; they were a ſort of people <hi>that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the word of God;</hi> a ſort of people that did not do as others did, hunt after pleaſures, riches, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the world, but to be acquainted with the inward word that wrought upon their hearts; <hi>in that day that I make up my jewels, they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Whoſe ſhall the others be? Thou wilt own theſe for thine, but whoſe ſhall the others be, that think not upon thy name, and tremble not at thy word? There is a place for them too: <hi>Tophet is prepared of old, made both wide and large; the fuel thereof is fire and brimſtone, and much
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:020309_0286_0FAEF91156E92878"/>
wood, and the breath of the Lord kindleth it.</hi> This is for all that are wicked, and that work iniquity.</p>
            <p>This is in the Old Teſtament; then comes the New Teſtament, in <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Revelations;</hi> there is a ſeparation again: There are a ſort of people which are called the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and the angel was commanded to go and meaſure the temple, and thoſe that worſhipped therein: The outward temple was not meaſured, but left for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to tread in, and left without the meaſure; <hi>for without are dogs and ſorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lie.</hi> And then the Lord ſpeaks to his prophets in the Old Teſtament again; <hi>if thou put a difference between the precious and the vile, then thou ſhalt be as my mouth unto them;</hi> but if thou huddle them altogether, and <hi>ſew pillows under elbows,</hi> then thou ſhalt not be as my mouth.</p>
            <p>So that in all ages God aimed at a ſeparation of the ſtate and condition of his people; and one ſort of people were purified, through the ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth; and another ſort were unſanctified and unpurified, and remained in their ſin; and the end of Chriſt's coming into the world, it was to call people to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; <hi>he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and to leave off their ſin. <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God, to as many as believed on his name.</hi> Whoſe ſons were the other? They made as high a rattle of profeſſion as the other: He tells them who is their father, <hi>you are of your father the devil;</hi> and he did orderly prove it, and that was thus; that they did the devil's works, <hi>ergo,</hi> they were the devil's children. It was Chriſt himſelf, the greateſt doctor of divinity that ever was in the world, that ſpake theſe words: And this is the manner of logic whereby he argues with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to make them believe that they were the devil's children; they that do the devil's works are the devil's children; but <hi>you do his works,</hi> therefore you are his children; ſo they ſought to kill him, they could not bear ſuch arguments.</p>
            <p>If one ſhould go and ſearch out a people in this city and nation, and ſee one man of this religion, another of
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:020309_0287_0FAEF911CFDF6290"/>
that religion, and pick them out, and uſe this argument with them: There is a man profeſſeth high, he profeſſeth a light within; if you look upon his deeds they are dead and dark, why then he is one of the devil's children: If you put me to prove this, I ſay he doth the devil's works, he is an extortioner, a deceiver, and a drunkard and unclean perſon, and doth the devil's works, and ſo is none of God's children. And ſo go to another ſort and uſe this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is ſafe enough, you can never fail in this kind of argument which Chriſt uſed; and if people would uſe it with themſelves, and think themſelves no better, then we ſhould have people confeſs themſelves the devil's children.</p>
            <p>None come to be God's children, till they come to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their loſt eſtate, their deplorable condition; that they are fallen from God, and through ſin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity are got into a nature that is at enmity with God; then they will cry out, <hi>who ſhall deliver me from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death,</hi> and childſhip of ſatan, this heirſhip of wrath? I am an heir of an inheritance; I am an heir of wrath, and I would fain part with this inheritance and heirſhip, and have an <hi>inheritance with the ſaints in light:</hi> We ſhall never know this, till we come to divinity without ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and without tricks and quirks, and come to Chriſt's reaſoning. He that doth the devil's work is the devil's child; then they will confeſs this is of the devil, and the other is of the devil. This is an evil work; and I ſee that I have need to be brought into another condition.</p>
            <p>When people come to an acknowledgment of the truth, and of their own condemnation, then they are one ſtep towards redemption and ſalvation. No one ever took a ſtep towards their ſalvation, till they acknowledged their own condemnation. <hi>He that ſanctifies, and they that are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, are all of one; and they that are joined to the Lord, are one Spirit. An evil tree,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi> When Chriſt ſpake this, he ſpake it to men and women, and he ſpake it of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and not of trees: And when he ſaid, <hi>no man can gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thiſtles,</hi> he ſpeaks of a generation of men: As if he had ſaid, this thorn muſt be tranſlated and changed into another nature before it can
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:020309_0288_0FAEF91442B33D08"/>
bring forth grapes; and this thiſtle muſt be changed into another nature before it can bring forth figs.</p>
            <p>There muſt be a change in the nature of man before there can be a change of the fruit and effect of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; <hi>whatſoever he ſows, that he ſhall alſo reap; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man doth in the body, he muſt give an account thereof at the day of judgment; for the books will be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and men judged according to the things written in thoſe books.</hi> If there be a book for thee and me, I will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thee there is a great deal in it; there is a recorder and a clerk for the book, which God hath opened in every man's conſcience; and there is ſet down every man's tranſgreſſions and his ſins: Saith one, <hi>thou haſt written my tranſgreſſions as with the point of a diamond;</hi> thou haſt engraven it ſo deep, that it ſeems impoſſible that it ſhould ever be blotted out again: Some have had their ſins ſo deeply engraven in their conſcience, that they have thought they would never be blotted out, they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as with the pen of a diamond.</p>
            <p>When people ſee and conſider that they have ventured their ſouls upon ſuch ſlight grounds, I hope they will be awakened to ſeek after righteouſneſs; when they ſee there is nothing good in them: Where there is any thing good, it is God that hath given it to them. Some will ſay, if I be perverſe, corrupt and wicked, I cannot help it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt be beholden to my Maker to help me, elſe I muſt never be helped. Now, becauſe God knows that we are helpleſs, <hi>he hath laid help upon one that is mighty,</hi> that is, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and Chriſt <hi>hath ſent forth his Spirit into the world to convince the world of ſin, and to lead his people into all truth:</hi> And this grace that comes by Jeſus Chriſt hath been ſo univerſally ſhewed, and ſo univerſally extended to all men, that I never met with a man yet that had none of it: But let them be as bad and as dark as they could, yet the light of Chriſt ſhined in that darkneſs, into the darkeſt heart, that ever I met with in all my life: He ſheweth men, that <hi>his light ſhineth in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the darkneſs cannot comprehend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the work that God hath ſet us about, and the ſervice which he requires at the hands of many of
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:020309_0289_0FAEF915EC243390"/>
us, is to turn men from their own darkneſs unto the light of Chriſt their Saviour, and from the devil's power, that hath enſlaved them, to the power of God that can redeem them; and yet we are far enough from that which they call <hi>free will;</hi> it is God's will <hi>that every one ſhould be ſaved:</hi> But ſome will not be ſaved, they will keep their own wills and not reſign them up to God; they have a free will to go to deſtruction. As for ſalvation, if they will obtain it, they muſt part with their own wills, and they muſt take a yoke and burthen upon them, before they can be ſaved: If people can have their wills, they will not take Chriſt's yoke upon them: He that will be Chriſt's diſciple muſt deny his own will and take up his daily croſs; theſe are the terms of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, no man, by all the power he hath, can redeem himſelf, and no man can live without ſin.</p>
            <p>We will ſay amen to it: But if men tell us, that when Gods power comes to help us, and to redeem us out of ſin, that it cannot be effected, then this doctrine we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with, nor I hope you neither. Would you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it if I ſhould tell you, that God puts forth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do ſuch a thing, but the devil hinders him? That it is impoſſible for God to do it, becauſe the devil doth not like it? That it is impoſſible that any one ſhould be free from ſin, becauſe the devil hath got ſuch a power in them, that God cannot caſt him out?</p>
            <p>This is lamentable doctrine: Hath not this been preached, this doctrine of impoſſibility of living without ſin? It doth in plain terms ſay, though God doth interpoſe his power it is impoſſible, becauſe the devil hath ſo rooted ſin in the nature of man. Is not man God's creature, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he new-make him, and caſt ſin out of him? If you ſay ſin is rooted deeply in man, I ſay ſo too; yet not ſo deeply rooted but Chriſt Jeſus is entered ſo deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the root of the nature of man, that he hath received power to deſtroy the devil and his works, and to recover and redeem man into his primitive nature of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs; or elſe it is falſe, that <hi>he is able to ſave, to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him.</hi> We muſt throw away the bible, if we ſay that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:020309_0290_0FAEF916D646A6E8"/>
for God to deliver man out of ſin. Is not Chriſt entered into the root of our nature? And hath he not taken upon him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> after the fleſh? Hath he not entered into the root of all men's natures, and <hi>taſted death for every man, that he might quicken every one that is dead in ſins and treſpaſſes?</hi> All theſe things ſpeak the love of God to mankind, in order to their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid to theſe things, theſe clouds of error and darkneſs that have overſpread the nation; yet, this I ſay, if one were to ſpeak of it ever ſo long, it muſt be by the eye that God gives you, that you muſt ſee it; it is he that opens the hearts of men as he did <hi>Lydia</hi>'s: If there had not been the power of God that reached her heart, <hi>Paul</hi> could not have opened it.</p>
            <p>When all is ſaid that can be ſaid, the counſel of God which hath ſounded in your ears, is recommended to you, that every one may retire in quietneſs and ſtilneſs of mind to wait for the feeling of that quickening power of the Spirit of Chriſt that is ſent into the hearts of men; that it may open your eyes to ſee your preſent ſtate; then you will ſee a better ſtate, a further ſtate, and when you ſee with your inward eye that your ſtate is not ſo good as you would have it to be, then truſt and rely upon the all-ſufficient and powerful operation of God's Holy Spirit to mend your ſtate, and give you power over your corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to go on from one ſtep to another, towards the cleanſing and ſanctification of your ſouls, ſo that you may receive ſomething from God to enable you to live to God; for all that you receive from men will only make you live to men, but that which you receive from God, will help you to live to God; that will purify you and ſanctify you, <hi>and make you clean through the word:</hi> So through the word you will come to cleanneſs, purity and holineſs: And when you are come to the way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you may believe you have got into the way of God's kingdom, and never till then.</p>
            <p>It is not enough to make a profeſſion, but we muſt live up to the profeſſion of that religion that we make; it is not holding this tenet and the other tenet, and ſaying, this miniſter, I am ſure, preacheth the truth; thou mayeſt be
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:020309_0291_0FAEF9170DBB9C18"/>
a child of the devil for all that. I now ſpeak indifferently to all people, without reſpect to any ſort: They that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are walking towards the kingdom of God, and yet their way is not a holy way, they have cheated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and deceived their own ſouls, and they had need look about them and take heed what they do; the glaſs is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and time is haſting away, and our life may end we know not how ſoon. It is good to prize and improve time, while you have it, and bring your deeds to the light; ſee what reproofs, inſtructions, counſels and openings you have met with from the Lord, and ſee how you have anſwered and been obedient to them, and ſo you will come to take a ſound and infallible account of your condition; and if it be not ſo good as it ſhould be, wait upon the Lord to mend it; he that made you can mend you, he that made your ears, muſt unſtop your ears to hear the word of God.</p>
            <p>To that power that carries on the works of ſanctification and redemption by his word, to that word I muſt leave you, and to his ſpirit I commit you. This word will be with you, and if you part not with it, it will not part with you; it will go with you to your houſes, and to your ſhops, and to your beds; it will lie down with you at night, and riſe with you in the morning: To that end, Chriſt is a leader and governor, and the captain of our ſalvation, to lead the van, and carry you on in the way of ſalvation; and <hi>as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as follow Chriſt, and are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the children of God.</hi>

            <p>THE ſheep of the true fold hear the voice of Chriſt, the good ſhepherd, and know the voice of ſtrangers too: But, ſaith he, <hi>the ſtranger they will not follow.</hi> This ſcripture hath been a mark of diſtinction in all ages, that
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:020309_0292_0FAEF917D509F898"/>
hath been peculiarly beſtowed upon the people of God, that they have had a diſcerning knowledge to make a certain diſtinction between them that were of God, and thoſe that were of the world: <hi>Now they that are of God hear us,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle.</p>
            <p>Now, that you may all find in yourſelves this peculiar gift of God, to be able to underſtand and <hi>diſcern between the precious and the vile,</hi> that you might know the miniſtration of life from the miniſtration of death, you muſt all be gathered inwardly into that which you have received of God; for they that are only exerciſed with gifts and parts, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements that appertain to this world, they have been always ſubject to deluſions, apt to be led away into a by-path and crooked way, <hi>that leads to deſtruction:</hi> But they that are under the government and direction of the gift of God, they have been able thereby to make ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of voices, and of ſounds, that they have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the deluſions of the age.</p>
            <p>This was the difference of old between the prophets of God and the falſe prophets, between the apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the falſe apoſtles; the difference was not ſo much in their words, for they had in a great meaſure the ſame words; if the true prophets uſed to ſay, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> the falſe prophets would ſay ſo too; if the true prophets declared againſt ſin, the falſe prophets likewiſe would do ſo; for the falſe prophet ſtole his word from his neighbour: But the greater matter by which the people of the Lord were preſerved, was, that hidden and divine wiſdom they received of God, by which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the voice of the ſpirit from the voice of ſtrangers, from the voice of them that were of the fleſh; and that was the cauſe that the Chriſtians in the primitive days did not adhere to, and follow thoſe falſe apoſtles that came to them in their own names, and held <hi>a form of godlineſs, but denied the power of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they among them in whom their witch-crafts did enter, they went away from the ſpirit, and ſought to be <hi>made perfect in the fleſh;</hi> they went to the outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and to the <hi>beggarly rudiments of things that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with the uſing,</hi> and from <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

               <pb n="293" facs="unknown:020309_0293_0FAEF918C9046538"/>And as it hath been in thoſe ages of which we have read, ſo it comes to paſs in this our age, in which a diſpenſation of the ſpirit of truth is manifeſted and revealed unto the children of men; there is a remnant that have received the teſtimony of eternal life, and have believed the teſtimony, and waited on him of whom the teſtimony is born, not to have life by the teſtimony, but <hi>to have life in him;</hi> ſo they receive their life by the miniſtration of the Spirit of Chriſt, and they live to God, and others who have received no life from him, but have a life in the words, and ſounds, and noiſes and terms, and diſtinguiſhing phraſes of things, their life lies there, they live not to God but to themſelves, their glorying is not <hi>in the croſs of Chriſt,</hi> but in the words and outſide of things; ſo that every one had need, at ſuch a time as this, to approve their hearts unto the Lord; who knows the inſide of people's profeſſion, the inſide of their religion, that knows how the heart is concerned towards God, and what they ſay and do upon the account of his ſervice, ſo that all that are met together might come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more and more of the life and virtue that ſanctifies the ſoul of him that receiveth it.</p>
            <p>For, alas! my friends, it is not the gathering together of the moſt excellent words about religion, and about worſhip and ſervice, which will approve any man in the ſight of God; that is but the painting of a ſepulchre, and covering the rottenneſs that is in many; but the Lord ſees into the inſide of every profeſſor, and whoſoever <hi>names the name of Chriſt and departeth not from iniquity,</hi> they do but take his name in vain, and contract a guilt upon their own ſouls; ſo that every one that ſeemeth to be religious, ought to enquire whence their profeſſion ſprings; if it ſprings from a real poſeſſion of a meaſure of that which ſanctifies the life, and ſhews itſelf forth, in its working and operation, many times abundantly more, than it doth in word and profeſſion; it manifeſteth itſelf in holineſs and righteouſneſs, to the honour of God; it is the aim and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of all ſuch to exalt the name of him whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, by holineſs and righteouſneſs ſhining forth in their works, for it will never ſhine through words alone; many good words may be ſpoken, yet God not glorified, but his
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:020309_0294_0FAEF91AB9200218"/>
name may be diſhonoured by them; but whoſoever comes to feel that which is life in themſelves, they know what will honour God, they feel the birth immortal that is of God, of his own begetting by the word of truth.</p>
            <p>This living birth is that which brings forth living praiſes; the other is but fleſh, <hi>that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> and it glorifies the fleſh, and when the fleſh is moſt of all glorified, moſt of all exalted, it is then but <hi>as the flower of the field,</hi> it is then <hi>cut down and withereth; the ſun of righteouſneſs</hi> ſhines with the beams of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory of God, and cauſeth it to wither and come to naught,</p>
            <p>So friends, let your minds be gathered inward, that you may be able in your own ſelves, by virtue of the divine gift of God, to diſtinguiſh between the voice of the true ſhepherd, and the voice of a ſtranger, ſo that your minds may not follow a ſtrange voice, that you may follow the Lord with your whole heart, <hi>with a full purpoſe of heart;</hi> for there is a real word of propheſy diſcovered in the inward parts, which doth <hi>diſtinguiſh between the precious and the vile</hi> in every one's particular; and that which is precious in one, it anſwereth to that which is precious in another; and that which is vile in one, it anſwereth to that which is vile in another.</p>
            <p>For there is an inward and ſecret <hi>myſtery of iniquity,</hi> as well as a myſtery of godlineſs. <hi>The myſtery of godlineſs</hi> is when <hi>God is manifeſted in the fleſh;</hi> the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is, when the wicked one is making himſelf manifeſt, and appears and diſcovers himſelf in the fleſh, that he may riſe up and glory in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Now the eternal truth, which never changeth, this is that which giveth a diſcerning, this hath always put a difference between the true and falſe prophets, the true and falſe apoſtles, and between the true and falſe miniſters; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference hath not been ſo much <hi>in words as in power,</hi> as the apoſtle ſpeaks concerning ſome in his days, that had endeavoured to deceive, and to draw men aſide from the ſimplicity of the goſpel; <hi>when I come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will know.</hi> Now, he does not aſſert, that he will pay particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to their words, whether they were judicious or no;

for he ſays, I will not know their words, but their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. How ſhould he know their power if he were not in the power himſelf? Now this divine power, as every one acquaints himſelf with it, it worketh unto the ſanctification of them, when they have fellowſhip with the ſtirrings and movings of all others that are partakers of it: This is that which will eſtabliſh and confirm your minds in the true faith and ſimplicity of the truth, that you turn not aſide to the right hand or to the left. If you have regard to the principle of divine truth that you have received from God, then you can receive confirmation from any one that hath a meaſure according to it. There is a <hi>meaſuring line,</hi> and the <hi>reed of the ſanctuary,</hi> that <hi>meaſureth the temple and all that dwell therein,</hi> that meaſures them with one reed and one meaſure, and every one anſwereth to that meaſure, according to the ſtature and degree of growth of the grace of God they arrive to; and now they are come to a fixed foundation.</p>
            <p>Others there are in the world, that have laid their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon this creaturely help, and the other creaturely help, upon this man, and the other man; but now true Chriſtians come to have their foundation, their rooting and building upon Chriſt Jeſus, upon that word of life that firſt of all gathered their minds into a deſire after holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, into a deſire after acquaintance with God that made them.</p>
            <p>You that are true Chriſtians can remember, how you were begotten, and that which did beget you; that word of God that is incorruptible, that is immortal, that was not of a dying quality, that need not be ſupported by this, and that, and tne other means, but it hath its ſupport in itſelf, it hath its nouriſhment in itſelf, and it grows up in itſelf, and every one that receiveth it they grow up in it, until they come more and more to partake of the life and qualities of it; <hi>that as he is, ſo they may be in the preſent world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is never known, but where the word of God hath its free paſſage: Many have <hi>taſted of this word of God,</hi> and by taſting of it, have been acquainted with the <hi>power of the world to come;</hi> they knew well enough the power that would bring forth another world, a <hi>new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:020309_0296_0FAEF91B91B6BE88"/>
and a new earth,</hi> and righteouſneſs in it; many have felt the power that have never continued to ſee the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, never continued to ſee and witneſs what this power would work; going aſide from the power of the world that was to come, they have never ſeen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, but <hi>their fooliſh hearts have been darkened again, and their imaginations have grown vain,</hi> and they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to themſelves a falſe liberty to the fleſh, and their wills have been ſtrong, and have prevailed over them; that though they had taſted of the powers that did belong to the world to come, they never ſaw the working and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that power to bring to paſs that which by ſight and viſion they did behold.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is needful for every one of you, in every ſtate and condition the Lord hath brought you into, to keep yourſelves in a deep humility; to know the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, temptations and trials you are under, and to exerciſe your minds, not only on account of what you have got over, but let every one know the ſta<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and condition in which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they are labouring; for when ſome come to look at what ſufferings and difficulties they have got over, they are apt to be exalted above meaſure, and lifted up in their minds; let every one conſider what is their preſent ſtate and work; their help lies in that condition. Some have always a foundation of their faith preſent with them, that they may feel the object of their faith where they hope for help, where they hope for comfort and ſtrength to be preſent with them.</p>
            <p>Now every one that believeth in the word of God, their care is, that they may know this word of God, that they may hear it, feel it, and behold the beauty of it under the exerciſes of it; how it conducts and leads, how it coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth and adviſeth, that ſo, in all things they are to paſs through, they may not be as thoſe that have run into it; as thoſe that do this and that of their own wills, but may be properly followers of ſomething.</p>
            <p>I go into this, or that, or the other thing, not to do mine own will; I do not run into it, but I am led into it; my leader goes before me, the word of God, that hath conducted me and led me: I am a follower of God
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:020309_0297_0FAEF91D318E37E0"/>
in all his diſpenſations, and in all his leadings and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; I am to follow him, for he teacheth me his way, he inſtructeth me in the true way: The beſt of all his ſcholars and diſciples, they are to be led and guided into that work and ſervice they are to do, that they may run into no irregularily or abſurdity, for he will lead you into holineſs, righteouſneſs and humility, where all become the ſervants of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſervants to one another: There is a mutual concord and harmony in the work of this ſpirit, in the ſervice of this power, where every one finds what they are appointed and directed to, and all the members of the body of Chriſt know they ought not to be disjointed and rent, and ſeparated one from another, but <hi>tied together in joints and bands, to edify one another in the love of God;</hi> ſo that here is one ſpirit that hath been the guide of this one people in all ages.</p>
            <p>Many people have been guided by many guides, and they have been ſcattered, divided and ſeparated one from another, and have been under this, that and the other name; but all God's people have been guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, that univerſal Spirit that is one with God. In the Old Teſtament times, and the New Teſtament times, they were all led by the univerſal Spirit of Chriſt, and they were <hi>of one heart, and of one mind, ſerving the Lord;</hi> there was a concord and unity among them; and if at any time any diſcord or diviſion happened, it was becauſe the <hi>roaring lion that goes about continually ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> had found ſome or other that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and draw into his ſnares and gins; for there are ſome that he may, and ſome that he may not. Who are they that this roaring lion may deſtroy? The devil knows who thoſe are that he may prevail upon; he knows that thoſe which are in the hands of God are out of his reach: <hi>My Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is greater than all, and none ſhall pluck them out of my Father's hands;</hi> yet doubtleſs thoſe that are in the Father's hands are tempted and tried, the roaring lion goes about ſeeking to devour them if he might; a man that he devours, he ſwallows up with prejudice, enmity, covetouſneſs and pride, and he will lead him into any evil thing; he hath many gulphs to ſwallow men up
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:020309_0298_0FAEF91DF9609558"/>
in, but if he meet with one that is kept in God's hands, he knows ſuch a one is out of his reach, and he is not able to catch him.</p>
            <p>If he meet with a man that he can prevail over, as he did over our father <hi>Adam</hi> and mother <hi>Eve,</hi> ſuch as are in their own hands, that ſtand upon their wit and parts, and knowledge and eloquence; thoſe that ſtand upon theſe things as their foundation, they are in their own keeping; theſe are they whom he may devour and catch, and enſnare in one or other of his gins, and ſwallow them up in one of his gulphs and temptations: But ſeeing God hath opened and manifeſted theſe things by his Spirit, and ſeeing the ſecret wiles of <hi>ſatan</hi> are diſcovered and made known by the ſhining of his light, how ought every one that is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever of the truth, to depend upon God for his protection, and be careful that he goes not out of his Father's hands, that he never truſt himſelf to his own keeping for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and preſervation, leſt he meet with a temptation that may ſwallow him and devour him.</p>
            <p>I remember our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when he was upon earth, he put his diſciples in mind of what happened long before, <hi>remember Lot's wife:</hi> You may take notice of her, the power of God took hold of her and brought her out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and was leading her to a place of ſafety, but ſhe had ſomething of <hi>Adam</hi>'s apoſtacy in her nature, ſhe looked back, and was turned into a pillar of ſalt. Our Saviour was pleaſed to make uſe of this paſſage that happened ſome hundreds of years before, to ſhew how ſhe failed of coming to the place of ſafety, though ſhe was led out of <hi>Sodom</hi> by the hands of one of the angels of God. O! remember her, ſhe was turned into a pillar of ſalt, and this remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to this day.</p>
            <p>If we remember where our ſafety is, and from whoſe hands we muſt expect it, we need not go to look at <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife. We have ſeen many in our days that have ſtood fair for redemption, they have had a power revealed to them, that is able to redeem them, and ſave them to the uttermoſt; but afterward by exalting themſelves above this power, and taking the government of themſelves into their own hands, they have robbed God of his glory, and he
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:020309_0299_0FAEF91F8C3E1820"/>
hath withdrawn himſelf from them, and then it was with them as with <hi>Soul,</hi> when the Lord departed from him, <hi>the evil ſpirit entred into him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have before our eyes from day to day, thoſe that have known the beginning of the redemption of God's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and have been in a great meaſure brought out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and out of the way of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they have had opened to them <hi>the myſtery of the kingdom of God</hi> for their encouragement, but at laſt they have taken and arrogated thoſe gifts to themſelves, and looking upon themſelves as far excelling others, magnifying their parts as if they were their own, when they were the gifts of God. Then the Lord hath left them, to let them ſee whether they could ſtand of themſelves, and they have fallen, and been taken in the gins and ſnares of the devil, who, <hi>like a roaring lion, is going about continually, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, my friends, it greatly concerns us all to know what refuge we have to fly to, in a time of trial; we have a time of trial now, tho' not a time of external ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perſecution, and enduring hardſhip yet upon us, to try our faith and truſt in God; yet we have no reaſon to be ſecure, carleſs nor remiſs in our preſent duty, <hi>nor to put the evil day far from us,</hi> but to be in the exerciſe of humility and watchfulneſs as becomes Chriſtians; for there is now as much danger and peril in this time of liberty and tranquillity, as there was before.</p>
            <p>If any one in the time of perſecution and ſuffering hath ſaid within himſelf, I had better give over and part with the truth, and forſake the ways of the Lord, and give over my teſtimony for his name, for I ſhall be undone and ruined in the world; this man by his carnal fears hath loſt his teſtimony.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe if a man in this time of liberty and freedom of ſerving the Lord, and bearing teſtimony to his name, if he ſhall not entirely truſt in the Lord, to carry him on in his work and ſervice, and continue his dependence upon him, and wait for the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit of God to work in him <hi>to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> this man ſhall loſe his teſtimony, as well as the other: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let every one of you keep up a dependence upon God's
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:020309_0300_0FAEF851591D7950"/>
Holy Spirit for carrying on the work which he hath begun in your ſouls; conſider what work it is that Chriſt is now at in every one of you; I know what his work was when I was firſt convinced, he was burning up and hewing down every thing that hindered his carrying on the work of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and redemption, and firmneſs and ſtability in the covenant of life and peace.</p>
            <p>And now our meeting together ought to be in the name of Chriſt; I hope it is ſo with moſt of you: I hope it is not to ſee and hear what this or that man ſaith, but to know within yourſelves what part of the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is carrying on, that you may join with him, and <hi>be a willing people in the day of his power,</hi> and ſay as <hi>Paul, Lord, what will thou have me do?</hi> If thou wilt have me part with my all, Lord here it is, I offer it up; and if thou wilt have any ſervice done, Lord here I am, <hi>ſpeak, for thy ſervant heareth;</hi> let there be in every one of you an attentiveneſs, and an humble waiting upon the Lord, and ſay as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>behold, as the eyes of ſervants look unto the hands of their maſters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hands of her miſtreſs, ſo our eyes wait upon the Lord our God until he have mercy upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever a Chriſtian hath his dependence upon God's wiſdom and power, ſuch a one ſhall never want wiſdom, the Lord will give him wiſdom to preſerve him againſt all the wiles of ſatan; and he ſhall never want power, for the Lord will enable him to fulfil and perform what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of him; he ſhall be repleniſhed with judgment and underſtanding, ability and power, to direct him into the good ways of God, and to enable him to walk in them.</p>
            <p>It is the earneſt deſire of my ſoul, that every one of you may be exerciſed in thoſe things which are profitable for you, and which may be comfortable to your friends and brethren; that you may all grow up into a ſtability and ſtedfaſtneſs in the good ways of the Lord, that you may not be ſhaken and toſſed with every ſtorm and tempeſt; that when there comes a time for the trial of your patience, and fortitude and courage, you may not be toſſed to and fro like children, but <hi>be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> that ſo living in all holy
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:020309_0301_0FAEF851D76E7578"/>
obedience <hi>and patience, and continuing in well-doing,</hi> you may have a conſtant ſupply of ſtrength and power from God miniſtered unto you by his Holy Spirit.</p>

            <p>THERE is no man can truly worſhip God, till he comes to a meaſure of certain knowledge of him; for all the worſhip in the world where the veil of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſtill prevails upon the mind, is all abominable; there is no acceptance with God: There muſt be a knowledge of God before there can be a true worſhipping of him; for they that worſhip before they know God, <hi>they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they no not what;</hi> they worſhip a God they have heard of, but do not know; ſo every one that would be a true Worſhipper, muſt firſt come to that which giveth a true knowledge, that raiſeth up a certainty in the mind, <hi>this is the Lord, we will truſt in him; this is our God, and we will ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that all people might come to this certainty of knowledge, therefore it is that <hi>God hath ſent forth his Spirit,</hi> that the things of God might be communicated by the Spirit of God, for without the aſſiſtance of this Spirit, men ſeek after the knowledge of God in vain; if they ſeek after the knowledge of God, they cannot find it, and if they ſeek after the worſhip of God, and after acceptance with God, they cannot find it; ſo that all religion, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous performances, that people are exerciſed in, where the ſpirit of truth hath not the beginning, they will all prove fruitleſs in the end.</p>
            <p>There are wiſe men in the world, who have employed
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:020309_0302_0FAEF852979F0AF8"/>
their wiſdom to find out the true God; but God in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath ordained, that the world by all their wiſdom ſhall not know him; ſo there is an end of all their labour: How ſhall they know him then? As <hi>none can know the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man that is in him, ſo none can know the things of God, but the Spirit of God;</hi> ſo that they that reſiſt the guidance, direction and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Spirit of God, are like unto thoſe that would enter into a houſe or palace, and remember not the door that leads into it.</p>
            <p>People would fain come into the divine knowledge and into the underſtanding of divine myſteries, but they would come by it another way; they would ſtudy for it, they would learn it by arts and ſciences, they would attain it by their own induſtry; and herein they labour to excel one another. If there comes a man among them that tells them, friends you are all out of the way, then they are angry, and inſtead of enquiring what is the way, they are angry that their way muſt be rejected. Friends, you will never come to the knowledge of God but by the Spirit of God; then they mock, and then they ſcoff and ſcorn the doctrine of the Spirit, for the teaching of the Spirit hath been the common ſcorn and deriſion of our age.</p>
            <p>It is ſo in our day with many; if they cannot come to the knowledge of God any other way but by the Spirit, they would deny to make uſe of that, to be ſubject to that, and theſe put their truſt in their own power and induſtry, to find out the myſtery of the knowledge of God; <hi>ſo they are ever learning, but are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth: How ſhould they?</hi> How can a people come to a knowledge of the truth, without the <hi>ſpirit of truth that reveals it?</hi> Can any come to the knowledge of Chriſt unleſs <hi>he that ſent him reveals him?</hi> Where are people's books? where are their bibles? where is their rule (they call it ſo) that all their endeavours for many ages have proved fruitleſs in reſpect to the knowledge of God?</p>
            <p>This is but your ſay ſo, ſome may ſay; how doth it appear that we have not attained to the true knowledge of God? and to the true worſhip, and to the true religion?</p>
            <p>I will tell you how it appears; for all, in all ages, that
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:020309_0303_0FAEF8535401AC70"/>
have attained to the knowledge of God, they have been <hi>made partakers of his divine nature</hi> and his divine qualities; they have brought forth a ſort of fruit in their lives and converſations, that hath been of the ſame nature, it hath been holy and divine. They have known the ſanctifier, and they have been a ſanctified people, ſo they have become one with him, and have ſhewn forth the beauty of holineſs in their lives, that is a demonſtration that may ſhew the knowledge of God, for without it they live another life, an unholy one, a corrupt one, a life of ſelf-love, a life of pride, vanity and enmity, and that they never had from God, but from another root; a life of iniquity and ſin, it came from another ſeed; ſo that they are ſtill without the knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>And again, all that have come to the knowledge of God, they have truſted in him; that people cannot do now-a-days, except here and there a few that do know him; the generality of the age they cannot truſt God; they muſt have ſomething elſe to rely upon, and truſt to, for in him they cannot truſt. Now the Lord ſaid by the prophet of old, <hi>they that know my name will truſt in me;</hi> that is enough if people know God, <hi>whom to know is eternal life, even to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> This is life eternal; if people were come to this divine knowledge, they would never take care or ſtudy for any refuge, or ſet up this, or that, or the other thing to lean upon. A rich man he truſteth in his riches, one truſteth to one thing and another to another, but they would truſt in the living God, and he ſhould be their God and their rock, and they would venture their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns upon him, both in this world and that which is to come, if they did but know him. People may talk as much as they will, but he can never, properly, be ſaid to be my God, and thy God, till we caſt our care upon him, and can venture our concerns upon him, both in this world and that which is to come; and can ſay, he is our God, and our reliance and dependence is upon him.</p>
            <p>Now this is the effect and conſequence of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; ſuch as come to partake of it, they ſhall have no need to be bid to worſhip him. You ſhall have
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:020309_0304_0FAEF8578D20B7C0"/>
no need to make a law, that this people ſhall worſhip the God that they know; there needs no law to command the people of God to worſhip him; his <hi>law is written in their hearts;</hi> and they that know him, will worſhip him. There was never any man on earth, that had the knowledge of the true and living God, that needed be put upon worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him, that needed a law to oblige him to it; for the very knowledge that is given of God through Chriſt, this brings forth naturally an adoration of the inviſible power which men put their truſt in; it produceth an adoration that is true worſhip; it cauſeth an humble reverence of that power; it brings the ſoul upon its knees, as it were; it brings the ſoul to ſtoop and bend, and bow upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God, as his God: It raiſeth his expectations to receive counſel, and judgment, and underſtanding, from him, as the fountain of wiſdom; and hereby people are taught to worſhip in the right divine knowledge.</p>
            <p>But to tell men of the worſhip of God before they know him; though you make as many laws as you will to force them to worſhip that God they do not know, yet you can never do them any good, nor make their worſhip accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, nor make them devout; you can never bring devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor divine adoration into their hearts, by all the laws that you can make.</p>
            <p>But there is a ſpirit of life that ſets the ſoul at liberty from its former bondage to ſin and ſatan; and when this law comes to be revealed in my heart, what ſaith this law? Worſhip God, give honour and glory to him. This law ſaith, ſubmit thyſelf to him that redeemed thee, thou art his, thou art no more thine own; this law being written in the heart obligeth a man to a true worſhip, and to <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit and truth,</hi> for this man hath done imagining among the Heathen, that there <hi>are Gods many, and Lords many:</hi> He hath done imagining what God is, and where he is, for he is now come to know him; he is inſtructed beyond the beſt ſcholar in <hi>Athens,</hi> let him be ever ſo mean and deſpicable in the world; if it be ever ſo poor a lad or laſs, they are beyond the beſt ſcholar in <hi>Athens;</hi> for the beſt ſcholar there came only ſo far as to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their fellow ſcholars: Some of them were for <hi>Mars,</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="unknown:020309_0305_0FAEF85B760B2CB0"/>
and ſome for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſome for one God and ſome for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Theſe ſcholars, by ſome beam of divine light ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, had come to perceive that the influences that were in <hi>Mars, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and other planets, they received them from an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power, that is, God. They denied not that theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets had power and influences given to them; ſometimes they are called heavenly bodies; the sky, or canopy of Heaven; and ſun, moon and ſtars are called heavenly bodies, they have power and influences; but this was given them, and that power muſt be greater than theirs from whom they receive their power, virtue and influence, even that God who is the maker of all things. The ſcholars at <hi>Athens</hi> underſtood ſo much, as to ſee there was a God greater than the planets which the nations worſhipped; they thought that God was to have an altar as well as <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and thoſe other Gods, and therefore they built an altar <hi>to the unknown God,</hi> whom they igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly worſhipped.</p>
            <p>If thou and I are come to the knowledge of the true God, then we muſt know more than theſe ſcholars of <hi>Athens,</hi> who erected an altar <hi>to the unknown God:</hi> When the apoſtle came to preach divinity among theſe ſcholars of <hi>Athens,</hi> who were maſters of arts and ſciences, he preached to them, ſaying, that <hi>unknown God, whom ye ignorantly worſhip, him declare I unto you;</hi> we do not need to declare to you the Gods of the nations, for you worſhip them, but to declare to you the unknown God whom ye ignorantly worſhip; theſe were the great ſcholars of <hi>Athens</hi> that the apoſtle ſpake to: What doſt thou declare of God? <hi>He is the God that made the world and all things therein, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, and dwelleth not in temples made with hands, neither is worſhipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing, ſeeing he giveth to all life and breath, and all things, and hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell upon the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitations, that they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us; for in him we live, move and
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:020309_0306_0FAEF85B9FB67C08"/>
have our being; for as certain alſo of your own poets have ſaid, for we are alſo his offspring; for as much then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or ſilver, or ſtone graven by art and man's device.</hi>

            <p>Here is a way of learning, you need not turn over books any more; if I would know the true God, I muſt know who gave me life and motion, and who created me, he is not far from me; and how ſhould I find the knowledge of him? <hi>feel after him, if haply you may find him; for he is not far from any of us; in him we live, and move, and have our being;</hi> we cannot live without him one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he giveth life, eſſence and power, to all creatures in Heaven and Earth; we muſt have him with us, or we cannot live; I die as ſoon as my life departs from me, ſo do you; if my breath and life continue with me, it is by the power of him that giveth it, in whom I live, and move, and have my being; ſtill it is in him that firſt gave it.</p>
            <p>Here all the great ſcholars and philoſophers were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled to feel after him; ſo are all people now-a-days: This is our buſineſs, when we go to preach the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God to them that want it; our commiſſion runs not, that we muſt read ſuch a book, ſuch an author, and turn over ſuch a leaf, and there you ſhall have a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and a fair demonſtration of the attributes of God, of his wiſdom, power, goodneſs, mercy, omnipotence and omniſcience; our commiſſion runs not that way, but our commiſſion runs thus; that we <hi>turn people from darkneſs to light; and from the power of ſatan to God;</hi> to turn their minds from that which may hinder the knowledge of Chriſt, from darkneſs, blindneſs and ignorance; God is not far from them; perhaps they might find him, if they did ſeek after him.</p>
            <p>There are a ſort of men now-a-days (ſuch as were in former times) that <hi>ſay unto God, depart from us, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the knowledge of thy ways;</hi> ſuch a ſort of people are dark, and blind and ignorant, and are like to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo, that ſay to God, depart from us; God is come to them, but they bid him depart from them: We are
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:020309_0307_0FAEF85CD56781E8"/>
ſent to theſe people that are dark and ignorant, and have not the true knowledge of God, though they have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of notions, hear-ſay knowledge, learning and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; our buſineſs is to convince them of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>and to turn them from darkneſs to light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are a people that have mocked and ſcoffed at us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years; what, ſay they, is there a light within? Muſt we go to the light within? Hath every body a light within?</p>
            <p>Yes, I believe ſo; and you muſt believe ſo too, if you will believe the ſcriptures. <hi>Chriſt is the true light,</hi> and he hath <hi>enlightened every man that cometh into the world.</hi> If he did light them, how did he do it? I will tell you, ſay they; he ſpake a great many gracious words, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body hath writ them down. What, will this prove the light within? Becauſe we have got a New Teſtament, and Chriſt hath ſpoken a great many gracious words, and they are written down and recorded, doth this prove the light within? No, people might have been in darkneſs ſtill, for all the books of the New Teſtament, and the Old Teſtament too, and for all the books in the world; for they would never have conveyed light into the hearts and conſciences of men, if God had not placed it there.</p>
            <p>Indeed theſe books may be inſtrumental, and God doth make uſe of them as a means for the conveying of light and grace, and working of true converſion; but the holy ſcriptures cannot do it of themſelves, unleſs there be a co-acting and co-operation of the Spirit of Chriſt with them; without this ſpirit they cannot convey ſaving light to us; how prove you then a light within? The apoſtle tells you, if you will believe him, 2 Cor. iv, 6; <hi>God, who commandeth the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo that every one that retireth into himſelf, will know quickly, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his error, and confeſs that there is a light within, and that by this rule, becauſe there is ſomething in the heart, that makes manifeſt that which is reprovable; if they do or ſay a thing reprovable, that which manifeſteth a thing is light; that which manifeſteth dark words or works, is light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="308" facs="unknown:020309_0308_0FAEF85D1DE2B9F0"/>Now when they have found this <hi>light within,</hi> the next queſtion in controverſy is, whether this will give men ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient light for the true knowledge of God; whether this be ſufficient to bring a man to life and ſalvation?</p>
            <p>I am of that judgment, that it is ſufficient; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it heartily, and preach it boldly in the name of the Lord, that the light that ſhines in your hearts, ſhines there to give you the true knowledge of God, in the face of the Mediator, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. You cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, you will ſay, for you have had this ever ſince you was a child, and you know not the leaſt good it hath done you; all our learned men and miniſters, go to what ſort you will, they ſpeak very ſlightly of it; this light within is nothing but natural conſcience, a poor light, it is but an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> that will miſlead us. But let me tell thee, the reaſon why it doth thee no more good, is, becauſe thou haſt been looſe and wanton, and vain, and wouldeſt not receive the reproofs of it; reckon up the time, and call to mind, when thou didſt receive the reproofs of it, then it did thee ſome good, and brought thee to remorſe, and brought anguiſh and ſorrow, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into thy mind, and brought thee to a right ſenſe of what evil thou hadſt done; but if thou didſt not regard it, no wonder it did thee no good; its reproofs and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were like the ſeed ſown by the high way, <hi>the fowls of the air gathered it up,</hi> and it did not grow; that is, the devil plucked it up, and then the ſoul lay as ſeed that brought forth no fruit to God, and the devil might have what advantage he would.</p>
            <p>I will tell you the reaſon why ſo many learned men, men of great abilities, ſpeak ſo ſlightly and meanly of it, becauſe it hath done them no good, inward nor outward, that they know of: How ſhould it do you good when it hath done them none? The reaſon why it doth them no good, is becauſe they do not believe in it; and did Chriſt ever do any body good that did not believe in him? <hi>He gave</hi> men <hi>power</hi> indeed <hi>to become the ſons of God,</hi> the greateſt good that they are capable of; but it was <hi>to thoſe that believed on his name:</hi> Were all they the ſons of God that heard Chriſt preach? No, ſome were
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:020309_0309_0FAEF85DD7B8F7B0"/>
the devil's ſons; our Saviour tells them, that they were of <hi>their father the devil, and they did his works;</hi> they came to meetings and heard Chriſt preach; he diſcourſed to them, but it did them no good, for they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his name.</p>
            <p>And then it appears in the next place, that if this light be taken heed to, and if men come to be taught by it and receive inſtructions, they would then have it all for nothing, they would have it all for God's ſake; all the counſels and underſtanding of divine myſteries, all the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, and all their knowledge of God would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without charge: What then would become of the trade of preaching Chriſt, and the attributes of God; then their ſilver-ſhrine-trade will be ſpoiled, and then their <hi>Diana</hi> is gone; and this light hath done them no good inwardly becauſe of their unbelief; and it doth them no good out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, becauſe it ſpoils their preaching trade, becauſe it teacheth men for nothing, but teacheth them, for God's ſake, the <hi>light of the knowledge of God, that ſhines in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> wherein are the openings of the myſteries of the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>So that if any come to know the virtue and the power that turneth men from darkneſs to light, they are come to another ſtate, and <hi>turned from the power of ſatan to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God;</hi> and when the power of God is revealed in them, then they ſay, <hi>this is my God;</hi> now I know the true God; they ſpeak as thoſe that are acquainted with him; <hi>this is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> It is not to know him at a diſtance, but as always preſent: The ſoul comes to be acquainted with God, as familiarly as a man is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his friend, and better too: A man that is acquainted with his friend, only knows ſome things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to him; but thoſe that are acquainted with their Maker they know <hi>the whole counſel of God,</hi> ſo far as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to their peace; therefore it was not in vain ſaid of old, <hi>acquaint thou thyſelf with him, and be at peace:</hi> Be but acquainted with that inward power that knows thy thoughts, and then nobody need to preach a ſermon to thee of the omnipreſence of God; nobody need make
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:020309_0310_0FAEF85E9AE97B08"/>
thee a doctrine of it, and offer reaſons and motives for thee to believe it; it is all fooliſh labour; I know that God is with me, and near me; I feel him in me, and with me, at my down-lying and up-riſing; when I am in my ſhop and about my buſineſs, he is with me in all places; and ſuch a man is alſo well inſtructed about the omniſcience of God; God's knowing every thing; I have learned that ſince I came to know him, all the doctors in <hi>Europe</hi> can tell me no more than I know in that point; <hi>the Lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth all my goings, and numbereth all my ſteps; Lord, thou makeſt manifeſt the thoughts of my heart, thou ſearcheſt my heart, and tryeſt my reins.</hi> Here is God's omniſcience and knowing all things. Here is divinity growing out of the life.</p>
            <p>Then the wiſdom of God is infinite; ſo are all God's attributes infinite, incomprehenſible and unſpeakable, they are all ſo in him, but he makes manifeſt a meaſure of his wiſdom; he brings a man from being ſuch a fool as he was before, to become a wiſe man; he was ſuch a ſot and fool as to become drunk and tumble in the dirt; he could not ſtand upon his legs, but now he is become wiſe and ſober: Another was ſo fooliſh as to defile himſelf and wallow in his uncleanneſs; now ſuch a man comes to true wiſdom, it begins in the fear of God, <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom:</hi> What doth his wiſdom do? It keeps him out of the dirt; it makes him live, firſt as a man then as a Chriſtian, <hi>to live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly, in this preſent world:</hi> It leads him into the knowledge of the myſteries of the kingdom of God; <hi>to know and comprehend with all ſaints, what is the heighth, and length, and breadth, and depth, and to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge:</hi> This is more than bare ſobriety and moderate living; ſuch are taught to live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and godly, to live by faith, and to be led into the <hi>knowledge of the myſtery of the kingdom of God;</hi> to know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to their juſtification. This is the learned and the wiſe man; he hath got the ſubſtance as well as the ſhadow; he hath the marrow as well as the bone; he is reconciled to God, through Chriſt; he hath <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins through Chriſt Jeſus, that died for him and roſe again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="unknown:020309_0311_0FAEF85F88DB26A0"/>When you come to be partakers of this, it will do you good; notions will not do it; when you come to know God for yourſelves, and underſtand him for yourſelves, to know him as your Saviour and Redeemer, that hath reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued you from the ſnares of the wicked one; whoever doth this, they will worſhip God; when they have this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, they will bow to him, they will be like thoſe of old that ſaid, <hi>he is our judge, he is our law-giver, he is our king, and he will ſave us:</hi> There aroſe a teſtimony in the hearts of good people of that age, that God was their judge that judged them, their law-giver that directed them, how they ſhould make their way to him; that he was their king, and ought to rule them, for he muſt ſave them.</p>
            <p>So when people come to know God for themſelves, to be inwardly acquainted with God for themſelves; when a company of theſe ſouls meet together, when they have been at this ſchool, and learned this leſſon of divinity, they then ſit down and wait upon the Lord, that God <hi>that ſearcheth the heart and trieth the reins,</hi> and obſerveth how they do ſervice for the honour of his name, and they receive ſpiritual gifts from him to their edification and comfort, and they receive judgment from him when they do any thing contrary to his mind.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Miniſter of the Sanctuary which the Lord hath pitched: If men have a church, as they call it, they muſt have <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Thomas</hi> for their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: We know who is the miniſter of ſuch a place; but here is a miniſter ſet up in God's ſanctuary, this <hi>prieſt's lips ſhall preſerve knowledge.</hi> All that come to God's church are taught of this prieſt, he is a high one, <hi>the high prieſt of our profeſſion,</hi> we have not ſuch another; he is not ſet up by a carnal commandment; his induction came not from any prieſt in this world, but his induction came from the God of Heaven and Earth; his Father ſet him up for a prieſt; he comes by a Heavenly induction and commiſſion, <hi>he is a prieſt forever, after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck,</hi> not after the order of <hi>Aaron:</hi> If you come to God's church, you may hear this miniſter.</p>
            <p>Some have called a houſe of ſtone, or wood, a church,
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:020309_0312_0FAEF8605DC66BD8"/>
but that will not do now, therefore there are people that know better than they, who ſee churches gathered of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones; men and women are gathered to theſe churches. Now the apoſtle ſaith, the church is in God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: If you will come to church you muſt come to Jeſus Chriſt, the church is in God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the general aſſembly, the congregation of his faithful people. What do you mean by a church? Ask a learned man, that underſtands Greek and Hebrew, what is the meaning of the word? A church, ſaith he, is the congregation of the faithful, it is an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the faithful people congregated together. Where muſt they meet? they muſt meet in the <hi>general aſſembly of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> were come to that church, though they lived many hundred miles aſunder, in <hi>Aſia, Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Bythinia: You are come to the general aſſembly of the firſt-born;</hi> there is a prieſt, there is <hi>the high-prieſt of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is a prieſt after the order of Melchiſedeck, not after the order of Aaron.</hi> How long is this prieſt like to ſtay in his prieſthood? Forever; <hi>he is a prieſt forever, not after a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endleſs life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prieſts that were after <hi>Aaron</hi>'s order, they could not continue: Death ſnatched one away, then they muſt have another prieſt; but here is one that hath a prieſthood higher than the Heavens, by the power of an endleſs life: Here is the prieſt of God's church, and the teacher of God's people; ſo that when God's people come to church, that is, to God the Father, there Chriſt teacheth them, according to the old propheſy, <hi>I will teach my people myſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have laboured to bring people to this teaching, that they might come to the knowledge of the living God. Now there needs none to teach them, <hi>for they are taught of God;</hi> bleſſed be God, <hi>our labour hath not been in vain, we ſee the fruit of our labours, and are ſatisfied.</hi> We have been labouring to bring men to know the Lord; now <hi>all ſhall know the Lord, from the greateſt to the leaſt,</hi> and bow before him, and worſhip him; they hear that <hi>their
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:020309_0313_0FAEF860D917A908"/>
high prieſt's lips ſhall preſerve knowledge.</hi> If they do amiſs, he chaſtiſeth them for it; if they do well, then he comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them by his Spirit: Now our labour is, that all may be brought to this, and that every one may know the Lord, and may fear him and ſerve him, and worſhip him in his temple: Our bodies are a temple for that uſe, to worſhip God in; <hi>know you not that your bodies are temples of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> you muſt worſhip in yourſelves, you muſt go into yourſelves, you muſt know the exerciſe of the grace of God in yourſelves, and the workings of the ſpirit of truth in yourſelves, and that your ſouls in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be bowed to the power of the ſpirit, and that your worſhip muſt be in the ſpirit; you muſt pray in the ſpirit, and give thanks in the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Though thoſe that ſet up worſhip in the church, talk of divinity and religion in every part of it, yet the ſubſtance of all the ſhadows of the law are fulfilled in the goſpel; the ſubſtance of all the modes, and rites, and forms of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are fulfilled in the goſpel-way: So then let every one compare and examine their ſtate, and conſider how the caſe ſtands between them and their Maker, what knowledge they have of God, and what truſt they have put in him, that ſo they may be perſuaded and prepared to come within the pale of this church. But you muſt firſt come out of the world, elſe you can never come into that church that is in God; if you be in the world, you muſt go to the world's church, and be the members of the world's church; and you ſhall have this for your pains, the world will love you; but if you come out of the world's church into God's church, the world cannot love you.</p>
            <p>Be as good as thou wilt, thou canſt never be ſo good as Chriſt Jeſus, and they loved him not, becauſe he was not of the world; <hi>if you were of this world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the world would love its own; but ſince you are not of the world, I have taken you out of it, therefore the world hates you; if they do ſo to the green-tree, what will they do to the branches? are you better than I?</hi> ſaith our Saviour; <hi>the ſervant is not greater than his Lord:</hi> Thoſe that are the diſciples of Chriſt muſt be content to <hi>be perſecuted, reviled and hated for his name's ſake;</hi> for thus they treated him
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:020309_0314_0FAEF86326764C58"/>
who <hi>was holy, and harmleſs, and undefiled,</hi> who gave them a good example, and who did them no hurt, but did them good; yet the world hated him, and it is but reaſonable to expect that you ſhould ſuffer from the world in the ſame manner, and bear it at their hands.</p>
            <p>If you come to this church that is in God the Father, <hi>and Jeſus the Mediator, the church of the firſt-born that are written in Heaven,</hi> and come out of the world's church, then the world will be about your ears; all the world will ſet themſelves againſt this church, againſt the woman that ſhall bring forth a birth, that ſhall rule over the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>There appeared a great wonder in Heaven, a woman cloathed with the ſun, and the moon under her feet, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her head a crown of twelve ſtars, and ſhe being with child cried, travelling in birth, and pained to be delivered. And there alſo appeared another wonder in heaven</hi> (a terrible thing) <hi>and behold a great read dragon, having ſeven heads and ten horns; and the dragon ſtood before the woman that was ready to be delivered, to devour her child as ſoon as it was born: And ſhe brought forth a man child, that was to rule all nations with a rod of iron, and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.</hi> When the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was ready to devour this birth, God took it into his own care, in ſpite of the devil and all his inſtruments, and he will ſave the child and preſerve the woman; <hi>he that ſits in Heaven will laugh</hi> at his enemies and defeat them. There is a place appointed for the woman in the wilderneſs, where ſhe is preſerved by the Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the ſerpent; but ſhe muſt come out again after ſome time, in ſpite of the devil and all his inſtruments, of all his dragons and ſerpents: The woman muſt come out of the wilderneſs, and the man-child muſt come down with great power, to rule the nation.</p>
            <p>This hath been accompliſhed, ſay ſome, above fourteen hundred years ago; and if you will take their word, the church hath been come ſo long out of the wilderneſs. But the church that they ſpeak of, hath it not wanted holineſs and righteouſneſs? Hath it given <hi>glory to God on high,</hi> with <hi>peace on earth and good will to men?</hi> No,
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:020309_0315_0FAEF863C8561438"/>
their church hath lived in tyranny and barbarous cruelty, and ſhedding of blood. They ſay the church was in the wilderneſs in <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s time, and when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came to the empire then ſhe came out of the wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>If it had been a holy church, we ſhould have ſeen the man-child come down from God, and holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs would have <hi>run down like a mighty ſtream,</hi> and truth would have filled the whole earth. All theſe things have not yet been fulfilled, for we have ſeen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of truth fallen in the ſtreets; they have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and troubled, and thrown into priſons and dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but there is a better church ſomewhere to be found.</p>
            <p>I read of the holy church, the lamb's wife, the ſpouſe of Chriſt that hath been hid ſomewhere, a great while, in ſome corner or other in the wilderneſs; but ſhe will come forth again out of the <hi>wilderneſs, leaning upon her well-beloved:</hi> She doth not come leaning on this prince and the other potentate: She comes not out of the wilderneſs leaning on captains, generals and armies, but leaning on Chriſt her well-beloved, the immortal, inviſible power of the Son of God; ſhe truſteth in it.</p>
            <p>All the other churches, I have read of, they have leaned upon one prince or potentate, or one emperor or another, and they have relied on theſe great men as on their bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark; but this church that comes out of the wilderneſs, will come leaning only upon her well-beloved, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the author and finiſher of her faith; ſhe will put her truſt in him, for he will deliver his church from all her enemies: And though the ſerpent caſt out of his mouth water as a flood, after the woman, that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the flood, yet the Lord will cauſe the earth to help the woman, and the earth ſhall open her mouth and ſwallow up the flood which the dragon caſt out of his mouth. Let the dragon do what he can to deſtroy the woman and her ſeed, ſhe knows what her beloved can do, he will command the earth to open and ſwallow up the flood, and ſhe ſhall go dry through it.</p>
            <p>How happy are they that lean upon Chriſt their well-beloved! The church of Chriſt in all ages hath leaned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and he hath founded his church upon a rock, ſo
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:020309_0316_0FAEF8676B1FEEA8"/>
that the devil and all his inſtruments, and the very <hi>gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt her.</hi> The members of this church have Chriſt Jeſus for their teacher, and they receive counſel and direction from him: He is their prieſt and teacher, and he teacheth them by his ſpirit and his word, which he hath placed in their hearts, and given them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to know him that is true: Chriſt's word you muſt keep to, if you will be true ſcholars. This is true divinity; if you will have the myſteries of the kingdom of God communicated and opened to you, <hi>give heed to his word,</hi> and that truth <hi>that is in your inward parts:</hi> Attend to that light and that grace that is manifeſted in your hearts, and the Lord will ſhew you more of the power and efficacy thereof; and <hi>if you be faithful in a little, he will make you rulers over much;</hi> live anſwerable to the underſtanding and knowledge that God hath given you, and if you be faithful in a little, he will communicate more and more of his mind and will to you; and if you be led by the ſpirit of truth, you will truſt in it, and hearken to it, and underſtand the language of it in your own hearts; and if you be <hi>a willing people in the day of God's power, God will work all things in you and for you, and work in you both to will, and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi>

            <p>IT is our great concern, while we are in this world, to promote the glory of God, and to <hi>work out our own ſalvation,</hi> to endeavour, as much as in us lies, to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and to help one another to be ſenſible of the love of God to us: This is the only thing that can give us true comfort, to have a ſenſe of the love of God to us in Chriſt

Jeſus: There is nothing more certain than that all of us are partakers of the love of God, which is imparted to us daily, and we live not a day without it; but we may, if we have not a care, live many days without it, and without the comfortable ſenſe of it; and that is the reaſon, that a great many of the ſons and daughters of men, do ſhew forth in their lives, ſo little love to God, becauſe they have ſo little ſenſe of his love to them; for the apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> that had attained to a great knowledge and experience in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, plainly declareth, that the reaſon of that love that we have to God is, <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> and I do not believe that any man can have any true love to God, that is not ſenſible of the love of God to him.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe temporal bleſſings that we enjoy in this life, as health and ſtrength, and our very breath and being, and well-being, that every day and hour are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, they are from the love of God to us, and the lengthening out of our lives and vouchſafing us opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the good of our ſouls, are evident tokens of God's love and good-will to us. Where theſe things are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and regarded, men live <hi>like the beaſts that periſh,</hi> and regard not him that made them, but go on in diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, and diſhonouring of his great name, and heaping up wrath upon their own ſouls: And thus doth every man, while he remains in his natural ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for there is in every man by nature the ſeed and root of all ſin and rebellion againſt God, which makes him return evil to God for the good he doth to us.</p>
            <p>And I believe we are all of us ſenſible, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of the depravity that is fallen upon all mankind, and of that enmity to God, and that averſion that is in men to the doing the will of God, and that impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and inability that is in every man to the reforming of his ways, and the changing of his heart, and leaving off his corrupt and vicious inclinations, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine help and aſſiſtance of the grace and Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Now they that are thus far ſenſible of their alienation, by nature, from the Lord, and are alſo ſenſible, that the time they have here, is the only time they have for their preparation and being fitted for that everlaſting kingdom,
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:020309_0318_0FAEF86A56B09800"/>
which we all would enjoy; how ought this to affect the mind of every one, that while they have time, they might prize it and improve it, and come to an inward ſenſe of the love of God, that ſo they might have a love raiſed in their hearts again to God? For people will never be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto God, till they love him, nor ever love him, till they are ſenſible of his love to them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, that which is the means and way of God's making himſelf known to the ſons and daughters of men, that means, and that way, every one ought to embrace; every one ought to be acquainted with it, and have the exerciſe of their minds in it, that ſo we might come to the knowledge of God, and might know, by an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and ſenſible feeling, the kindneſs of God to us.</p>
            <p>And truly friends, they that are minded to ſpend their time, and exerciſe themſelves, in the conſideration of the mercy and kindneſs of God, they have work enough for their whole life-time, to conſider and contemplate the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold mercies of God beſtowed upon them; for we have our life and breath from him, whom the whole world obeys, and ſerves; God, that made all living creatures, hath created us, and preſerved us; he hath had long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and patience towards us until now, and he is yet mindful to do us good, which is evidently manifeſt by the invitations and promiſes he hath made us, and the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Holy Spirit that he hath made us acquainted withal.</p>
            <p>For who is there in this aſſembly, that God hath not made ſenſible of the tenders of his grace, and invitations to repentance and reformation, that they that live looſely and vainly in the world, might turn to the Lord with all their hearts, and conſider their ways and doings? God <hi>hath waited to be gracious</hi> to the ſons and daughters of men, and his mercy and patience hath been beyond all human patience, beyond the patience that ever you did beſtow upon any, this the Lord hath beſtowed upon you; therefore I entreat you, in the love of God, let this conſideration ſink deeply into your ſpirits, that you may be affected with the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and his <hi>patience towards you,</hi> and his <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> while you have been ſinning againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="unknown:020309_0319_0FAEF86A8DB88708"/>But ſome will ſay, how ſhall I know this? After what manner may I experience this love of God to me? How may I be ſure that the Lord hath a love for me?</p>
            <p>My friends, it is not only temporal kindneſs that we enjoy from God; it is not only the lengthening out of our days, that is an evident token of the love of God to us; but there is a demonſtration and manifeſtation of it, that is univerſally extended to the ſons and daughters of men, in that he hath ſown his word in them, and hath ſown his truth and his grace in their hearts, that every man, tho' he may be ever ſo wicked, ever ſo fooliſh and vain, yet he hath many times checks and reproofs in his own heart: I know it, and I doubt not but you do.</p>
            <p>Pray whence comes that principle which doth ſtop you in a courſe of ſin, and check and reprove you for ſinning againſt the Lord? If you attend to it, and conſider it, you will find it proceeds from God; it comes from him, from him comes our life and breath; then people ſhould be incited to receive the grace of God; the favour and mercy of God which he hath beſtowed upon them, in order to their ſalvation. The ſcripture tells us, that <hi>grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If thou haſt any good, it came by Jeſus Chriſt; and if thou haſt any truth, it came by Jeſus Chriſt, who is the fountain of truth, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the grace of God; it is he by whom God hath made himſelf known to the ſons and daughters of men; it is Chriſt alone, that <hi>God hath ordained to be a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and man, that ſo he might be the miniſter of an everlaſting covenant,</hi> which we are brought into with God; ſo that now people ſhould come to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the way and means that God hath ordained for their redemption, namely, that he hath given Jeſus, that great and unſpeakable gift of his love and kindneſs, to the ſons and daughters of men; here is <hi>grace and truth,</hi> that came by Jeſus Chriſt: How is it come? It is come into my heart. Tho' ſin, and luſts and corruptions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, have a place in many, yet Chriſt hath a place too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>he hath made his grave with the wicked, and was numbered with the tranſgreſſors;</hi> he was like the ſeed that lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the clods, and is the leaſt of all ſeeds, yet when it
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:020309_0320_0FAEF86B50857248"/>
comes out of the ground, it riſeth high, and ſpreads abroad its branches, and brings forth fruit; this love of God, this unchangeable holy truth, is in every one; why then ſhould not every man be ruled and governed by it?</p>
            <p>But ſome men will ſay, is truth better than falſhood, and grace better than luſt and corruption?</p>
            <p>You may ſee that, by the light that is diſcovered in the inward parts: Let every man turn inward to the grace of God, turn to that light that ſhews itſelf in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſee what it will do for us: This is the doctrine that the apoſtle was ſent withal; he was ſent with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>to turn men from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan to God:</hi> Why did he do it? It was for this end, that men <hi>might have remiſſion of ſin, and that they might come to an inheritance among them that are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by faith in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord;</hi> ſo that this goſpel is the ſame that it ever was, though men have divers ways of preaching, and ſeveral methods and ways of declaring the truths of the goſpel; bleſſed be God the apoſtolical doctrine is preached again, and the bleſſed goſpel hath the ſame power attending it that was in former days, and may have the ſame effect; and that this may be the portion of every one of you, is the end of our labour. And we have in our eye but two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to diſcharge a good conſcience in the ſight of God, who hath given us his word to preach, and <hi>to turn men from darkneſs to lights and from the power of ſatan to God;</hi> that we might keep ourſelves free from the blood of all men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another end is, the deſire that God hath plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our hearts, <hi>that all men every where might be ſaved;</hi> this is God's will; if any be damned it is their own will, and the devil's will; this is God's will, <hi>that none ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance</hi> and be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſaved. Now in this work of your ſalvation, we would have regard to him that ſent us to preach the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting goſpel, and we would diſcharge ourſelves faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and <hi>be made manifeſt in your conſciences,</hi> that the benefits of the goſpel might come to be yours; that you might anſwer the purpoſe of God, in ſending Chriſt to be
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:020309_0321_0FAEF86C1346B528"/>
the Saviour of mankind; you muſt turn from ſin to God, and then you will find the bleſſing that comes by Jeſus, which is <hi>to turn every one from his evil ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may read this in a book, and you may alſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read it in your hearts: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath given you light to diſtinguiſh between good and evil; if you do good, you may make a comfortable reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yourſelves, and this will be your rejoicing, <hi>the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your conſcience</hi> on that account; but if you do evil, though all men do juſtify you and commend you, yet you will be condemned in yourſelves; ſo that you have that in yourſelves which diſtinguiſheth between things that differ in their nature and kind, and you have a little enlightening by the knowledge and underſtanding you have received concerning the things that are pleaſing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God; if after you know this, you will go on in a way diſpleaſing to God, he will at length be too hard for you, and plunge you down into the abyſs of his wrath to all eternity.</p>
            <p>After perſons are ſatisfied and enlightened with the light of Chriſt, and come to the experience of things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they will love the light and walk in the light; but there are many in this age that have read the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures plentifully, and yet ſtill go on in a way of ſin, they cannot love the light that reproves them; <hi>he that doth evil he hates the light, and the dawning of the day is as the ſhadow of death to him,</hi> and it brings nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon ſuch perſons, ſo that they do not love the light, though it is evident they have it and enjoy it; and it ſhall be their condemnation whether they will or no; if they do not love the light and embrace it, it will never be to their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>God hath given Chriſt <hi>to be a light to the Gentiles, and his ſalvation to the ends of the earth. He is the light that enlightens every man that comes into the world;</hi> the apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells you the genealogy of the word of God; <hi>in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God; and the ſame was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made; in him was life,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:020309_0322_0FAEF86CCE05FF10"/>
and the life was the light of men;</hi> the life of the eternal word was the light of men; what men do you mean? I anſwer, <hi>he is the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> He extendeth his light to every man, but it is condemnation to every man ſo long as he continues to be a ſinner againſt God: <hi>This is the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that light is come into the world, and men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all men are by nature dead in ſins and treſpaſſes; after our firſt parents fell into ſin they were dead to God; <hi>in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die;</hi> when they had eaten the forbidden fruit, they did not die as to outward appearance, but they died as to that communion they had with their Maker; in this dead ſtate lie all the ſons and daughters of Adam; but, as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>though they be dead, they ſhall live again; Chriſt is the Lord from Heaven, a quickening Spirit;</hi> this is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our faith that hath been extended and offered to mankind ever ſince the fall; <hi>there is no name under Heaven,</hi> no other power or ſpirit <hi>by which a man can be ſaved;</hi> this great Mediator, the eternal Son of God, is <hi>the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world:</hi> Faith in Chriſt is the ſame that ever it was, notwithſtanding the many forms of worſhip among the ſons of men; ſome of God's ſetting up, and ſome of men's ſetting up; yet among all theſe, the object of faith is the ſame, and ſaith the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the 11th chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that little book of martyrs, the apoſtle there gives you a catalogue of the mighty things that have been done by the faith of God's people; he begins with <hi>Abel; by faith Abel offered a more excellent ſacrifice than</hi> Cain, <hi>by which he obtained witneſs that he was righteous, God teſtifying of his gifts; and by it, he being dead, yet ſpeaketh; by faith</hi> Enoch <hi>was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God tranſlated him, for before his tranſlation, he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God;</hi> and ſo the apoſtle there goes to <hi>Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Moſes: And what ſhall I ſay more,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for the time would fail me to tell of</hi> Gideon, <hi>and of</hi> Barak, <hi>and of</hi> Sampſon, <hi>and</hi> Jeptha, <hi>of</hi> David, Samuel, <hi>and of the prophets, who
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:020309_0323_0FAEF86D929C38A0"/>
through faith ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of lions, and quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</hi> All theſe great and noble things were done by faith; it was the aſpect their ſouls had upon Chriſt the Mediator between God and man; it was their truſt and reliance upon God through Chriſt the Mediator that did ſupport and uphold them in all they did and ſuffered. This faith is ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p>There are many faiths in the world beſide, but they will prove but the faith of hypocrites. Some have a faith, that if they do this and the other work, they ſay you may truſt your ſouls upon theſe good works; but this is not the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithful. But ſome called Chriſtians are gone ſo far in the doctrine of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that they think they can do enough for their own ſalvation, and for their friends and relations too; that there may be more merit ſtill over and above, that others may have benefit by the merit of their works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But this is not the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and other ſaints, by which they wrought ſuch wonders in the world. I would not have men truſt at all in their own works for ſalvation, but truſt in Chriſt alone, who <hi>is able to ſave, to the uttermoſt, all that come to God by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome will object that we are taught the doctrine of faith in Chriſt, and juſtification by him.</p>
            <p>Well, for my part, my tongue ſhall as ſoon drop out of my mouth, as oppoſe the doctrine of being juſtified by faith in Chriſt. But, let me tell you, this may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied: If a man believe that he is juſtified by faith in Chriſt, and yet knows, in his own conſcience, that he is condemned, he believeth a lie; he is ſeduced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. A man cannot be juſtified by Chriſt, when the Spirit of Chriſt condemneth him: Such a one, when he comes to lay down his head upon his dying pillow, all his faith will fly away. I have met with ſome inſtances, lamentable inſtances, of thoſe that were called Chriſtians, that have made a profeſſion of religion, and at laſt have laid down their heads in ſorrow. If this be your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:020309_0324_0FAEF86FD3076238"/>
conſider, while you have time, that you may die in peace.</p>
            <p>Now the propoſition and tender of the love of God to mankind, hath always carried that limitation with it, that every one in the world ought to obſerve; if a man hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, he muſt be ruled by him: It is contrary to all manner of reaſon, that the devil ſhould rule a man, and Chriſt be his Saviour: The whole tenor of the New Teſtament is againſt it (pray read it as oft as you pleaſe, for it is a good exerciſe) you will find the true Chriſtian's faith to be this, that he that hath faith in Chriſt hath an operation upon him for the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his heart, and purifying and purging his <hi>conſcience from dead works, that he may ſerve the living God;</hi> though he hath been a ſervant of the devil, it will make him leave his former ſervitude, and bring him under the influence of another law, <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, which will make him free from the law of ſin and death.</hi> The apoſtle ſets down the ſeveral conditions he had paſſed through; <hi>I was alive without the law once;</hi> he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a man, a brave man, a man of underſtanding, that had profited among the Jews; I was alive, having reſpect to that law which ſhould have been my governor; <hi>but when the commandment came, ſin revived and I died.</hi> He had read the law, the commandment, many times, and had been at the reading of it in the <hi>ſynagogue;</hi> but there was a comming of the commandment which he had not been acquainted with; there was a writing of the law of God in his heart; when he came to this inward work upon him, where was then the life he lived? <hi>When the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came ſin revived, and I died:</hi> There was a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing life he formerly lived, but he was ſlain by the power of the commandment, it laid him in the duſt as a ſlain man; when he was in a ſlain condition he found out that law in him that was the law of ſin and death, and this cauſed a combat and a war in him; <hi>I find a law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me; for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the law of God in the inner man; but I ſee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other law in my members warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin,
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:020309_0325_0FAEF8718C14A6C0"/>
which is in my members:</hi> Now this brought him to a pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpirit, into a ſenſe of his miſerable condition, and then he cries out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſome people in this day, they are like the apoſtle, they have a <hi>law in their members warring againſt the law of their minds; the good that they would do they do not,</hi> and they can go no further: But the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did reach further, though he did not in that ſtate know deliverance, yet he had a faith that he ſhould be delivered, and that he ſhould not be miſerable all his days. Thus having led the <hi>Romans</hi> into the ſeveral ſtates through which he paſſed, he brings them to a further ſtate, <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the law of ſin and death: And now there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> How ſhall we know this? <hi>They walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> was come to that ſanctified ſtate, that ſtate of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty which Chriſt Jeſus will bring all thoſe unto that believe in him.</p>
            <p>Holy men, in former days, did experience and find a great ſtrife and warfare in their own hearts, they would all do well, and <hi>exerciſe a conſcience, void of offence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards man;</hi> but there is a law of ſin that wars in their members; if we yield to it it leads to ſin and death; but if we yield ourſelves to the <hi>law of the ſpirit of life,</hi> there is a power that is derived from the Mediator, that will tranſlate the ſoul <hi>out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs</hi> and ſin, which the devil is the prince of, <hi>and bring it into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There muſt be a real change wrought in us before we can come to God, and to fellowſhip and communion with God, which alone can make the ſoul happy. Let this be the exerciſe of every one of us to adore and magnify the great mercy and the kindneſs of God, that he hath not withdrawn his ſpirit from you, but hath placed a monitor in your boſoms that calls upon you to <hi>ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well,</hi> and to conſider that <hi>the wages of ſin is death:</hi> Here is a ſin, I may commit it; there is a temptation before me, but I know there is a bait and
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:020309_0326_0FAEF872A6F38EC0"/>
a hook; I may ſwallow it if I will, but if I do, it will be my ruin: Would I come to eternal death, and have my portion with liars and wicked perſons in the kingdom of darkneſs, <hi>where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched?</hi> Or would I have my portion with ſaints and angels? If I would have my portion with the bleſſed in the kingdom of God when I die, I muſt walk in the way that leads to it; but the <hi>gate is ſtrait and the way nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and few there be that find it;</hi> labour then to be one of thoſe few.</p>
            <p>But what ſignifies our labour (ſome may ſay) if we can <hi>do nothing that is good, not ſo much as think a good thought?</hi> What ſignifies our labour? All the labours and endeavours in the whole world cannot make a man happy.</p>
            <p>I now ſpeak to a people to whom God doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe the help and aſſiſtance of his grace and Spirit, and the viſitations of his love and power; you muſt now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do ſomething; if a man endeavour, with the help of God he may do a great deal of good, and ſhun a great deal of evil: Though all our endeavours, in our own power and ſtrength can ſignify nothing, yet they are required by God, and by joining them with his grace, and laying hold of opportunities, by divine aſſiſtance, we may do what God will accept. But if a man do any thing in his own power and ſtrength, whether prayer, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, meditation, or any other duty, he had as good let it alone.</p>
            <p>I would conſider you as thoſe that God hath followed with his grace and the manifeſtation of his ſpirit; this is given to every man <hi>to profit withal,</hi> and every man hath opportunity to work with it; but he muſt <hi>work while it is day, for the night cometh when no man can work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let every one of us that are now met together, labour to be ſenſible of the love of God to us, and love him above all, and expreſs our love by a willing and perſevering obedience, that we may have the <hi>love of God ſhed abroad upon our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and offer up living praiſes to him through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his Father: To him be glory and dominion forever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is a general doctrine in the world, that no man by any means can ever be ſet free from ſin in this life: This is univerſally received among almoſt all Chriſtians, in all churches; and though they differ ever ſo much in other things, yet they agree in this; ſo that this doctrine hath got a ſway in the world, and it is accounted a great deluſion and a hereſy, and a grand error for any to queſtion the truth of it.</p>
            <p>Now while a man is of that belief, that there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of living without ſin, and of breaking down the kingdom of ſatan in any one ſoul in the world, how can men hope or believe that righteouſneſs ſhould prevail in the heart of one man? There is neither king nor beggar, nor biſhop nor a goſpel miniſter, but the devil muſt have a rule and government in him, ſo long as he lives in the world. As long as this is believed, it is not poſſible that the other belief ſhould take place; it is madneſs to think that I muſt be under the rule and government of ſatan if I am under the government of the Son of God. And it is ſtill greater madneſs to ſay, that Chriſt and the devil are both my governors and rulers: It is prodigious folly and madneſs to ſpeak after this manner.</p>
            <p>This belief prevails over all men; over the wiſe, and mighty, and noble, and learned, that they can never be freed from the power of ſin in this world, but that the devil will lead them into ſin every day; let men be ever ſo ſober, ever ſo abſtemious in their lives; let them ſpend ever ſo many hours in prayer every day; let them come to meetings and hear ſermons, and write them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them, and do what they will, here is a bar of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief that lies in the way, that makes men <hi>depart from the living God,</hi> and his power, and loſe the benefit they ſhall receive from Chriſt: And therefore they go to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

it another way, that is, to have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them, and they ſhall be pure and holy in the ſight of God, when they are polluted in their own eyes; and when they ſee their daily failings, infirmities and corruptions, yet God may not ſee them; but that he ſees them holy, juſt and righteous in his Son.</p>
            <p>What ſtrange kind of doctrine is this? I muſt preſume that God will ſee me in his Son, Jeſus Chriſt, when I never was in Chriſt: How can this be? <hi>He that is in Chriſt, is a new creature; old things are done away, and all things are become new:</hi> But if there be old things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill, and I am not become new, ſhall I preſume that I am in Chriſt, and that God will ſee me in his Son? When people come to uſe the underſtanding that God hath given them, they will look upon themſelves as barred out by their unbelief, that the nations have drunk in; and it is as ſweet to them as the honey and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-comb.</p>
            <p>But, bleſſed be God, many have vomited it up already; If they would have placed this doctrine upon man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ability, I would have ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to it. I know there is none of us all have a natural ability and power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his own ſoul from ſin and ſatan; but when they come to place it upon God, that though the <hi>Lord make bare his arm, and reveal his power;</hi> though they come to have the grace of God, that ſtill they could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſin, this hath blaſphemy at the bottom of it. The other reflected upon man's power; this reflects upon the power of God Almighty: That the devil hath got ſuch a power over us, that God hath not power over us, nor can have power and dominion over us, ſo that of a whole nation he cannot have one man to ſerve him.</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid in anſwer to this: When men are once willing to ſerve God, they will be willing to leave the ſervice of the devil. There is no way to anſwer that good wiſh, but by wating upon God for the revealing of his power: I pray God that when you come to a meeting, you may ſay, Lord, let thy power go forth upon my heart; let thy arm be made bare, and deliver me from the power and dominion of ſin. Some will ſay they feel God's
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:020309_0329_0FAEF8751C8456B8"/>
power in a meeting; I feel the power of God working upon my heart, in order to the taking away ſin and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and giving me victory over it, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If they feel this power of God upon them, it is their duty to believe it and depend upon it: If I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, I muſt wait for the dictates of it, and believe that I ſhall be able to do <hi>all things through Chriſt that ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens me:</hi> Then faith will come forth into works, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a living faith.</p>
            <p>You may remember what the apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>as the body without the Spirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo.</hi> As ſoon as a man comes to join with the mighty power of God, he will be able to withſtand temptation: If he comes into evil company, he will deny them and not comply with them; he will find then ſomething of a power and ability to ſerve God; though he is not come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet he is walking in the way of holineſs, and <hi>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forward towards the mark of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> He will ſay, I have got a little nearer than I was towards the place where I would be, towards that life which I would live and die; then let death come when it pleaſeth God, it ſhall be welcome.</p>
            <p>This is the wickedneſs of many in the world, they will not live ſuch a life as they would be willing to die in. They cannot come at it unleſs it be given them to believe, for it is the gift of God; they muſt come to their governor and leader, which goes before, to the gift of God, which is eternal life; then let death come when it will, if I have the gift of eternal life.</p>
            <p>It is a miſerable thing to think that there are many that have not laid hold of eternal life: It is manifeſted, that we may lay hold of it, there is a hand of faith joining with it. When a man comes to lay hold of eternal life, this life will purify him and ſanctify him, at leaſt by degrees, till he be wholly ſanctified in body, ſoul and ſpirit: This is that which the apoſtle writes in one of his epiſtles, <hi>your ſalvation is nearer than when you at firſt believed.</hi> When they firſt believed, their ſalvation was a pretty way off. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes ſalvation to be the end of their faith and hope.</p>
            <p>When a man comes to be delivered from his ſins, he ſhall ſerve God without fear; but when a man comes to
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:020309_0330_0FAEF875D38E8BC8"/>
live by faith, he ſhall overcome; he is a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt, and he muſt fight valiantly under his banner, till he gets a victory over all his enemies, and then his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is much nearer than when he at firſt believed.</p>
            <p>I would I could ſay ſo of ſome of you; for I fear your ſalvation is farther off: Some go ſtraggling here and there, as ſheep not having a ſhepherd; this is that which my ſpirit is exerciſed with. You that are travellers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the kingdom of God, it is the wonderful grace and mercy of God, that ever it ſhould come into your minds to ſeek the kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. They that have obtained this mercy from God, ſhall receive and enjoy other mercies, better mercies; <hi>bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs:</hi> That is one mercy; but there is another mercy, they ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; they ſhall be ſatisfied: When a man comes to this, he muſt take up a daily croſs, and exerciſe ſelf-denial; but if he follow Chriſt, he ſhall be ſatisfied; he ſhall then have nothing but peace and joy; he ſhall then ſing praiſes and glory to God in the higheſt, and to the Lamb for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>There is none can underſtand the glory that is laid up for thoſe that take up their croſs and follow Chriſt, and love his appearing. This is the greateſt bleſſing that God doth give unto his people, <hi>he hath ſent his Son Jeſus to bleſs us, and turn us from our iniquities.</hi> This is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing indeed. Take heed that you do not admit of any new terms: Do not think to bring God Almighty to new arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the terms are declared and concluded on already: If you will obtain the bleſſing, you muſt be turned every one of you from your iniquities: The terms are already made, the law of God muſt be <hi>written in the heart and inward thoughts,</hi> and you muſt cloſe with that power that will write the law in your hearts, and by travelling towards the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, you will ſee the coming of that kingdom in you.</p>
            <p>It was the joy of my ſoul, that I ſaw the kingdom of Chriſt would be ſet up in my heart, before it was ſet up there; then I ſaw the Lord's wonderful work, and there was a great alteration in me, when the Lord was pleaſed to wean me
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:020309_0331_0FAEF876C8432C60"/>
from the world's breaſt, and take off my heart, and wean it from worldly luſts, from the world's joys, and pleaſures, and faſhions, and the world's honour and reputation: I ſay the Lord was pleaſed to wean me from theſe things, and brought me to a holy reſignation, to give up my heart to him: If I have joy, it muſt be from the Holy Spirit; if I have pleaſure it muſt be in the preſence of God, who <hi>in the multitude of my thoughts within me</hi> made his comforts <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my ſoul;</hi> and if he bring not comfort to you, you will never have it; you cannot expect it till you do believe; and when you have faith, you can feel the kingdom of God within you: There muſt be the new birth, the work of regeneration, for <hi>except a man be born again he cannot ſee the kingdom of God;</hi> there muſt be a tranſlation from death to life, there muſt be a turning out of the old bottom and a fixing upon a new bottom, upon <hi>Chriſt Jeſus the rock of ages;</hi> there muſt be a ſubjection to his holy power and government, elſe you cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Many have gone on in a profeſſion many years, and never ſaw the beauty of it; and every little trifle in the world hath diverted them, and drawn them away. This and the other pleaſure hath drawn away their hearts, they have ſeen the glory of the world, which hath captivated them: But thoſe that make a profeſſion of the truth, and have ſeen the beauty and glory of the kingdom of Chriſt, they ſhould, be ſhy of returning to the world again, for the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>it happened to them according to the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, the dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire; it had been better for them never to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them:</hi> They made a profeſſion, and were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a viſible church, and had a name to live, but they were inwardly dead, the ſight of the kingdom of God is not given to ſuch, but unto babes, that have a divine birth, and <hi>that deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby. God hath hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them unto babes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeak to thoſe who are here this day, that would receive ſome kindneſs from God, and that deſire the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:020309_0332_0FAEF8775D036610"/>
of his ways, and that the myſteries of his kingdom may be revealed to you, let your minds be retired and you ſhall find the great things belonging to your peace made known to you. We have ſpoken much of this, but I would not have you know it only by our ſayings, I would have you go into yourſelves, to ſee whether God hath not beſtowed this grace and bleſſing upon you: If God hath given you grace, do not <hi>turn it into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> do not abuſe the grace of God. What is it that you do when the grace of God hath convinced you, that ſuch and ſuch a thing is ſin, and if you do it, it will turn to your ruin? Dare you venture to commit ſin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you are convinced of it? O take heed of doing <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite to the ſpirit of grace,</hi> and of <hi>grieving the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby you are ſealed to the day of redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh that the weight of this conſideration might lie upon you, and that a holy dread and awe of God might be wrought in your hearts, that you might be kept from ſinning againſt God. You know there is a general out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry againſt preſumptuous ſinning, ſinning againſt light: Why ſhould not we all cry out againſt it? It is a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing for any man to ſin againſt his knowledge and conviction; if any of us have been guilty of ſinning aganſt light, let ſuch a one ſay, I have done iniquity, I will do ſo no more, but enter into covenant with the Lord, and ſay, O Lord, ſo far as thou haſt revealed thy will unto me, I will obey it; I will delight to do thy will, O God, tho' I croſs mine own will. Whatever I croſs I will not croſs God's Holy Spirit, by which I may be ſealed to the day of redemption; I will never do this though I hazard my chief intereſt in the world: This is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a true Chriſtian, and I pray God make you all of this mind.</p>
            <p>And now my friends, you that deſire to ſee this great work wrought in yourſelves, commit the whole work to God, and trouble not yourſelves about it. I am ſure God will carry on his own work, and bring down the devil's kingdom, and rebuke that unclean ſpirit that is gone forth over the whole nation, and pour out abundantly of his Holy Spirit to carry on a glorious reformation. This I
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:020309_0333_0FAEF878F0D25638"/>
believe God will certainly do, from what he hath wrought in my own ſoul. I know not what inſtruments are to be employed in the work, I leave that to the Lord; but the kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be advanced, and it ſhall be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and a beſom of deſtruction ſhall ſweep away all his enemies from the earth, and the wrath of God ſhall burn againſt them; but there is an obduration hath been upon the nations of the world, and ſomething hath ſtood in the way in all generations.</p>
            <p>But, however, I am ſure we all may well ſay, that Chriſt is the <hi>Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of them that believe.</hi> He hath ſaved this city and nation from the plagues and vengeance that hang over us. Many years the Lord hath ſpared us, and waited to be gracious for a long time, to ſee if we will at laſt turn to him. How long the Mediator will intercede on our behalf, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; there is a time when the long-ſuffering of God will come to an end, God hath brought a ſcourge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nations round about us, and the flames of his wrath hath kindled upon them, and deſtruction hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken them; how ſoon it may be our lot, we know not; all our money, our ſilver and gold, and valour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, will not be able to ward it off, if the Lord but blow upon us. It is even at the door; there is but one way to ſave us, and that is turning to the Lord, and crying to the Lord for the continuance of his mercies and long-ſuffering, and patience towards us. In this cry to the Lord, let us all unite, that are lovers of the nation, and let us join our earneſt ſupplications in this work, ſeeing the Lord hath made us the monuments of his mercy and preſerving goodneſs.</p>
            <p>We have been continually ſurrounded with war and blood, and flames and deſtruction; and the cry of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans hath been heard from other nations. And while they have been conſumed with flames, and deluged in ſtreams of blood, we have ſat under our own vines and fig-trees; but judgments hang over the nation, and whether they will fall or not, the Lord knows: But what ſhall we do for the good of our nation, and cities and families, but labour every one, in the fear of God, to reform our lives,
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:020309_0334_0FAEF8798D3009A0"/>
and to take heed that we ſin not againſt the light, left we die, and periſh in the middle of thoſe terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that hang over us.</p>
            <p>Let us turn from our evil ways, and depart from all iniquity, that the kingdom of Chriſt may be ſet up in ourſelves. It is the righteous in the nation that the Lord looks at, and for their ſakes he will ſpare a nation. If there be a people among us that walk in humility, and lament and mourn for the abominations committed in the midſt of us, God will have regard to them, and he will hear the cries and the ſupplications of a praying people.</p>
            <p>Friends, you that cannot make uſe of ſword and ſpear for the ſaving of a nation, you may do good by your prayers, and turning to the Lord with an unfeigned heart, and let your ſincerity appear before him. If I would take a common prayer-book in my hands, and pray ever ſo devoutly and ſolemnly, if I be not ſincere, what will that do? Or, if I pray without a book, or if I pray without a form, or reject the form that others have made for me, what will this avail? But the <hi>cry of the poor, and the ſighing of the needy, and the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous, hath availed much</hi> for the ſaving of this nation many years.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I exhort you all, as you love the nation, and as you love yourſelves, and your families and relations, ſin not againſt the Lord; for he is now ſetting up righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, equity, and juſtice, and it ſhall prevail in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God hath been pleaſed to gather in many, that have been enemies, that are now turned from ſin to God, and led by the truth: And it is their greateſt joy, that now they are no longer ſervants of ſin, but are now become the ſervants of God.</p>
            <p>Now truth will prevail, and righteouſneſs go forth as the morning ſun, and we hope the Lord will ſhew mercy to us for the glory of his own name, though we are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy people: It will be matter of joy and gladneſs to us, if the kingdom of God be come; then we may ſay our prayer is anſwered. We have often prayed, <hi>thy kingdom come, and thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> If the will of God be done, then I can do mine own will no longer, then I can be led away by ſatan no longer; the devil will
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:020309_0335_0FAEF87B49404170"/>
have little power, if I do God's will on earth, as it is done in Heaven; then praiſes will ariſe in the hearts of every one that delights to do the will of God, and God will carry on his work for the glory of his own name, and for the redemption of his people, that Chriſt may be <hi>preached for ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>ALL people that would worſhip God and meet together for that purpoſe, they had need have a great reverence upon their minds, and a holy fear upon their ſpirits, that when they enter into the houſe of the Lord, and draw nigh to the living God, they might not <hi>offer the ſacrifice of fools,</hi> but may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to God that which may be acceptable to him. For all worſhip, and all religion, and all offerings and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever were offered to God by any people, they have had a return unto the offerers and worſhippers, either of acceptance or rejection. Many you know have been rejected tho' they have offered, and many have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, and their offerings have been <hi>a ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſavour in his noſtrils;</hi> and, I hope, we are all of that mind, that we would be glad to have our worſhip, and ſervice and offerings to God, accepted in his ſight, and that our preſent aſſembling together might be for the better, and that every one might have an anſwer of peace, and of acceptance in their boſoms; but that can never be unleſs men be qualified and prepared in their drawing nigh to God, and in all our offerings and worſhip that we perform, our hearts be prepared <hi>according to the preparation of the ſanctuary,</hi> the preparation of God's dwelling and holy place.</p>
            <p>The worſhippers muſt be holy; there muſt be the fear of God, and a reverence of the great God upon their minds,
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:020309_0336_0FAEF87C5780B558"/>
before people can offer an acceptable ſacrifice unto him, as the holy apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 6: <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is;</hi> which ſignifies, that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration ought to be in the minds and hearts of people that would draw nigh to God; or perform any ſervice or worſhip to God, they muſt have the knowledge of the God whom they worſhip, they muſt firſt <hi>know that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Here is a qualification for worſhippers, for religious perſons; as they expect when they meet together to find the Lord in the midſt of them, they muſt be qualified accordingly, there muſt be an awe upon their minds.</p>
            <p>I am in the preſence of God, I have an expectation from God, that he will open his abounding treaſury, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſome good unto me, or elſe to what purpoſe do people draw nigh to God? It is becauſe they would have ſomething of him; but they muſt come in an humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning frame; <hi>he giveth grace to the humble.</hi> It is the lofty, the proud, thoſe that exalt themſelves, the fat and the full, that want nothing. <hi>Theſe,</hi> ſaith the prophet, <hi>the Lord beholdeth afar off.</hi> A proud man or woman cannot draw nigh to God, the Lord looks upon them afar off; nor do they partake of thoſe divine and heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and bleſſings, and counſels and inſtructions that the humble mind hath the promiſe of and will certainly enjoy, <hi>the humble, God will teach, he will inſtruct the meek in his way;</hi> but what is this to the lofty mind? What is this to one that is exalted, and conceited and puffed up, and reckons himſelf full and wanting nothing, while he is ſwimming in the ſtreams of pleaſures of this world, and ſavours only the things of the earth, the pleaſures of a ſenſual mind? Theſe perſons are not hungry, and ſo they are not fed; they are not thirſty, and ſo they never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that which can ſatisfy the ſoul. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt pronounced a bleſſing upon them that hunger and thirſt; but what is that to them that are full and lack nothing?</p>
            <p>So my friends, in this and all other religious aſſemblies, a great care ought to be upon every one, that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together to wait upon the Lord may be in that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and fear, and that hope and expectation at the hands
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:020309_0337_0FAEF87C9CB15258"/>
of God, that they might be bettered by it, or elſe they all loſe their labour, as <hi>Cain</hi> did; he would be an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he offered ſacrifice, but was not accepted; becauſe his mind and heart was not right before the Lord, his ſacrifice was rejected. It was before he had killed his brother; he had great guilt upon him, before he had killed his brother; he wanted the qualification of well-doing; <hi>if thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? But if thou doſt not well, ſin lies at thy door.</hi> He was got into evil doing, and an evil mind hindered his acceptance with God; ſo it doth with all men and women in the world that meddle with religious worſhip, and ſacrifice to God, if they meddle with evil doing. There muſt be a taking off the mind from the evil of ſin and corruption, and the mind muſt be brought over to ſomething that they have received from God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they can be accepted.</p>
            <p>You know the general doctrine of all Proteſtants is, that we have no acceptance with God but through Jeſus Chriſt; we have no way to pleaſe God, nor can do any thing that ſhall be acceptable in his ſight, but thro' one only Mediator. Now if I ſhould go to worſhip God, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any religious duty without reſpect and deference to the ſenſe and participation of the virtue and power of that only Mediator, how can I be accepted? And it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God out of his infinite love to mankind, to ſend this great Mediator into the world, that every man that comes into the world is made a participant of ſomething of the life and virtue of that Mediator. So you read, <hi>John</hi> i. 4. <hi>in him was life, and the life was the light of men, the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> and that with reſpect to men whether they are good or no, both good and bad, though all men are bad by nature: So that tho' they are children of wrath, and heirs of eternal damnation in their natural ſtate, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin, yet for all that this one Mediator, in whom this light hath ſhined, hath ſent forth his light among the ſons and daughters of men, that is, the light of men, that enlightens every one. So there is an offer made of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that preſents itſelf to the view of every man that is good; if he apply his mind to it, he may have that good
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:020309_0338_0FAEF87D547BC258"/>
that comes by Jeſus Chriſt; he may draw nigh to God; as bad as he is, he hath ſome good, that God hath beſtowed upon men good and bad. There is no man ſuch a liar, but he hath ſome truth in him; there is no man ſo ungodly, but he knows that which is pure and holy, that which hath reproved him, checked and convinced him of his ungodlineſs. This preſents itſelf to the view of every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and calls them to repentance.</p>
            <p>Now for men to make a ſhew and pretence to worſhip, and not have regard to the glory of God, how can they draw nigh to God, or God draw nigh to them? Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in my name, I will be in the midſt of them;</hi> but if people meet together in their ſin and wickedneſs, if they have a looſe and vain mind, and intend to go on in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and ſin, if they meet, they meet not in Chriſt's name, but in the devil's name, and he is in the midſt of them, and he works and <hi>rules in the hearts of the children of diſobedience.</hi> So that this hath been the ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why abundance of meetings upon this account have been fruitleſs as to the benefit of their ſouls, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of people have been fruſtrated as to their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they have not met with that in which the bleſſing is, and to which the promiſe is made. The promiſe is not made to people that the devil rules; there is no promiſe to ſuch but the promiſe of eternal wrath to be executed upon them, with the devil and his angels to all eternity; if you can make that a promiſe.</p>
            <p>The promiſe of life and ſalvation which is recorded by the prophets and apoſtles, it hath always relation to the ſeed that are in covenant with God. In this the covenant ſtands, ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> xvii. 7. <hi>I will eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations, for an everlaſting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, that is, with Chriſt Jeſus the Mediator. It is he that brings to God, thoſe that truſt in him and come to him, <hi>he that cometh to him, he will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> they that do not come to Chriſt, are caſt off already. All men, by nature, are caſt

away already; if any of them will be ſaved, it is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, <hi>who is able to ſave, to the uttermoſt,</hi> and to make peace for them, and of twain to make one new man; and to make peace between God and the ſoul.</p>
            <p>There is a neceſſity for all people, that have any ſenſe of their natural ſtate and condition, that according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have no title to the kingdom of God, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God. By nature they cannot make a claim to righteouſneſs and life; they connot reconcile themſelves to God by all their works; ſaith the prophet <hi>Micah, will the Lord be pleaſed with a thouſand rams, or with ten thouſand rivers of oil? Shall I give my firſt-born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul? He hath ſhewed thee, O man! what is good: And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and love mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and walk humbly with thy God?</hi> They that will be ſaved, muſt lay hold of ſalvation in that way and method that the Lord God of Heaven and Earth hath preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He hath preſcribed a way for every body to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he would not have any one to periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, and obtain everlaſting life. God hath made a way that will ſerve every body alike; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands as well as ten; and all the world as well as one man. Now the way that God hath made, is turning out of the ſtate into which they are fallen, and forſaking that governor that rules in the hearts of the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and cloſing with Chriſt, whom God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to reign in every ones heart. People in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom will ſay, they have cloſed with Chriſt. Do not you hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, on the terms of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? It is not crying, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but doing the will of God; the terms are, <hi>all men muſt believe in Chriſt, the eternal Son of God;</hi> and through the power of that faith they have in him, he comes to rule over them, and they become ſubject to him. And if a beliver be not ſubject to Chriſt, he is all one as if he was an unbeliever; <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, or uncircumciſion, avails not any things but a new creature; and faith which worketh by love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The covenant doth not ſtand in meer words; if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to ſuch articles, then I am a Chriſtian; if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:020309_0340_0FAEF87FA6FADDD8"/>
all the articles of the creed, then I am a Chriſtian, and a child of God. If a man will ſay, I believe, his ſay ſo is not ſufficient. The condition of the covenant that God hath made, is, that Chriſt ſhall rule and have the government of thoſe ſouls that he preſents to God: How ſhould it be otherwiſe, ſeeing he is not to preſent any to God that are unclean? Chriſt hath no commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to preſent any to God in their uncleanneſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. He that believeth, muſt be cleanſed and purified by him: If ſo, then that cannot be done, but by ruling over them. If they had the rule of themſelves, they would be polluted, and be like water, whoſe current is ſtopped with dirt and mud, not running in its own proper ſtream. People will commit ſin, when they have the rule of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but when Chriſt preſents people to God, and when they come to be led by him, they are cleanſed and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
            <p>When the apoſtle deſcribes true faith, he doth it by this quality and property of it, <hi>it purifies the heart.</hi> All other faith is <hi>but the hope of the hypocrite;</hi> but real faith is <hi>the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God,</hi> faith the apoſtle; and that faith worketh in an unclean heart to the cleanſing of it, and in an impure heart to the purifying of it: If the heart comes to be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then it muſt needs follow that the converſation muſt be pure alſo. No one doth an ill work, or ſpeaks an ill word, but it is from an evil heart. Now if the <hi>axe come to be laid to the root of the tree,</hi> and the word of the Lord operate in the heart powerfully, if ever ſo much evil be in it, the axe when laid to the root of the tree will cut it down; the power of God will execute judgment upon every thing that is contrary to him; Chriſt is <hi>holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and undefiled, and ſeparare from ſin and ſinners;</hi> and though he extend his life and virtue to the life and ſoul of the moſt wicked man in the world, it never joins with their uncleanneſs, but keeps immaculate and undefiled in the heart of the worſt of men.</p>
            <p>Now this immaculate power that comes from Chriſt, it will <hi>purify the hearts</hi> of men, and preſerve them from evil thoughts, words and actions. This is the manifeſtation of the one Mediator that they muſt be governed by, elſe they
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:020309_0341_0FAEF880E49D94B8"/>
cannot be preſented ſpotleſs to God the Father. There is a neceſſity of coming to a Saviour otherwiſe than by words and profeſſion; we muſt come to him and heartily join with him; we have all joined with the devil, he hath ſuggeſted, moved, and inſtigated, and people have followed his inſtigations and motions; there is no man but is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of a deviliſh motion, why not then of a divine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Though now it is become a bugbear to ſay, we are moved by the Spirit of Chriſt, why not by that Spirit, as well as by the ſpirit of the wicked one? No man doubts but that there are motions of the devil which they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, that ſometimes they have joined with him, and ſometimes they withſtand him. What is the reaſon that men ſhould join with evil motions? There is no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. The reaſon why you and I withſtand the motions of the devil, is becauſe we find another motion conveyed into our hearts by the Spirit of God; if a man hath one motion to commit uncleanneſs, he hath another motion to keep himſelf pure; if he hath a motion to ſpeak a lie, he hath another motion to ſpeak truth; there are two movers at the ſame time, in the ſame heart, which ſhall we join with? Shall I join with the devil's motion? If I find any thing of the love of God in my heart, it will conſtrain me to mind the good motion, and make me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the evil motion; ſo that the moving of the Spirit of God is not ſuch a wonder.</p>
            <p>There are none who have not had bad motions in them, and they have alſo motions of the Spirit of truth; they have met with evil motions, and they have admired them too much, then it is time to repent; if there be a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between a motion of the Spirit of truth, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit of error, then I may boldly ſay, it is our duty to join with the Spirit of truth, and not with the ſpirit of error; if there be a deſire in us <hi>to be ſaved from the wrath to come,</hi> then the way to be ſaved from God's wrath is to be ſaved from the cauſe of it; take away the cauſe and the effect ceaſeth. The cauſe of God's wrath being kindled againſt man is ſin, for God had no wrath againſt man when he firſt made him; for he made him after his own image, and gave him power to continue in
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:020309_0342_0FAEF881596B4F18"/>
that holineſs and righteouſneſs, wherein he created him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he fell, and was caſt out of paradiſe, and an angel was ſent <hi>with a flaming ſword that turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</hi> Thus man fell under the wrath of God by his ſin; but how ſhall I have the wrath of God allayed? By breaking off from ſin, and returning to God again.</p>
            <p>This looks like a covenant of works, ſay ſome; do you ſay I muſt break off from ſin, and ſo eſcape the wrath of God?</p>
            <p>Yes, I do; but no mortal man can break off from ſin but by joining with the Mediator, <hi>he is the author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation, he worketh in us to will and to do, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth us to work out our own ſalvation;</hi> it was ſin that drove man out of paradiſe, and brought upon him the wrath of God. Sin is the devil's work; now that Chriſt might be a Saviour to us, he will deſtroy the devil's work; <hi>for this purpoſe,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>the Son of God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> Now the devil was not the deſtruction of man ſimply in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but by tempting him to ſin, which is the devil's work; and Chriſt <hi>was manifeſted, to deſtroy the devil's work;</hi> that propenſity to ſin that is in the nature of man, which makes him rebel againſt the mind and will of God. Chriſt the eternal Son of God became man; he took the nature of man, that he might bring man again to his primitive ſtate, wherein <hi>he was created after the image of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how doth the devil perform his works? doth he do his works coercively? No, he uſeth no irreſiſtible force. But doth Chriſt the Mediator work coercively, with an irreſiſtible power and force, to bring a man again to God? No, no more than the devil did to beguile man from God. Man might have ſtood and continued in his ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency if he would; he might join with evil, and yield to the temptation of the devil, if he had a mind; he knew if he gave over his mind to evil, he ſhould be ruined; and it proved ſo. Man was reſolved to try what it was to yield to the devil, and obey him. He told them that if they did eat of the forbidden fruit they ſhould be as Gods, but they became more like the devil; this they got by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:020309_0343_0FAEF882EA3BBCB0"/>
obedient unto him, not that the devil laid an irreſiſtible force upon them, you ſhall eat of the fruit of this tree; but there was only a preſentation of it to them, and with that he prevailed, and ſo came to the deſtruction of mankind.</p>
            <p>Chriſt the Mediator, in order that he may preſent us to God, comes himſelf and preſents his commands to us, and his command is, that we muſt break off from that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude and ſubjection that the devil hath brought man into, and there muſt be a ſubjection unto Chriſt; we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and hearken to the word of God, and break off from ſin; but where is the power? If God would have me holy, let him make me holy; if he would have me pure, let him make me ſo, and give me ability to do that which of myſelf I cannot do; when it pleaſeth God to give me grace and captivate my will, I ſhall become a good Chriſtian. Now here is a great miſtake, that people ſhould think they muſt wait for an irreſiſtible power to bring them back to God; there is a preſentation of love and mercy, and earneſt invitations, and the long-ſuffering and patience and goodneſs of God's long waiting upon ſinners. <hi>God, who commanded light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 Cor.</hi> iv. 6. What ſhall I do with the light that ſhines into my heart? I will ſhut mine eyes againſt it; I love darkneſs rather than light, and evil more than good; this light will lead me to holineſs and righteouſneſs, I will quarrel with it, it comes to bereave me of my comforts in this world, of my merry companions, and of all my bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, I will not hearken to it. Alas! for theſe; <hi>this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had no ſin, but now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the goſpel preached by Chriſt himſelf; here is the preſentation of an opportunity for every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to return again; but I muſt be in the way of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, by joining with that which preſents to me holineſs, righteouſneſs, chaſtity and humility, that preſents
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:020309_0344_0FAEF8834DCF08C0"/>
and offers to the ſoul all the virtues and graces that are in Chriſt, and ſhews it the light and grace that comes from Chriſt. Now this light and grace ſhewing itſelf to my ſoul, I have a view of. Haſt thou a view of it? Haſt thou ſeen purity, humility, ſobriety, meekneſs, and ſelf-denial, and an heavenly frame of ſpirit in thyſelf or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe? How doſt thou like it? I like it not at all; I love to have honour and dignity, power and dominion, and my elbow-room in the world; I love not this meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility and ſtrictneſs of life, that a man muſt have a care what he ſpeaks, and ſet a watch upon his lips, and upon his heart, tongue, and hands, I do not like this kind of life.</p>
            <p>If thou doſt not like a good life, ſomebody will like it, and live in it; and notwithſtanding all thy vapouring, thy hating, and deſpiſing it, when people come to live this kind of ife, they will outlive thee; thy proud life, they reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and thy having elbow-room in the world, will at laſt come to be limited; the hand of God is againſt it, and it will bring down the pride of man. When thou comeſt to lie upon thy dying pillow, expecting every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to expire, and breathe thy laſt, then thou wilt ſay, O that I had been more ſerious, and lived more like a Chriſtian; lived a godly life, and given up my heart to God, and been more watchful over my thoughts, words and actions! There is ſuch a friend of mine, that hath lived better than I; if I had lived ſuch a life as he hath lived, I ſhould have had more comfort; and they that are deſpiſers of the godly, tho' they do not like ſuch a life now, they will like it then.</p>
            <p>Friends, you that are lovers of your ſouls, and meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that you may become better, and have expectation and hope, that you ſhall receive comfort and benefit by your meeting together, I tell you, as a ſervant of God, and a lover of yours, it is but a little while, and you will wiſh that you had choſen the moſt holy, harmleſs, innocent life, that ever you ſaw yourſelves, or heard of from any body elſe; and you will wiſh that you had been more watchful over your thoughts, words and actions. There is a day, a day approaching, when we muſt give
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:020309_0345_0FAEF88544DC52E0"/>
an account for every thing that we have done, <hi>whether good or evil;</hi> you muſt give an account for your curſed debauchery; for your ſwearing, lying, and inordinate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; you muſt give an account for every vain thought, and every idle word.</p>
            <p>If this will certainly come to paſs, how ſhall I prevent theſe idle words and evil actions? <hi>Wherewith ſhall a young man cleanſe his way,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt? <hi>By taking heed thereto, according to thy word.</hi> I am not as thoſe that ſay <hi>lo here and lo there:</hi> I do not ſay, you muſt come and learn truth of me, but if you find it, you muſt find it in yourſelves: What if I live in the truth? That will not ſerve <hi>thee;</hi> and if I be a holy man, that will not ſanctify <hi>thee;</hi> thou muſt hearken to truth's ſpeaking in thyſelf; thou mayeſt hear it ſpeaking in thine own heart; you may hear it call you to righteouſneſs and holineſs; and if you hear it, you may do it too, if you pleaſe; for there is a power that goes along with it.</p>
            <p>I know enough, thou wilt ſay, but I cannot do what I know; I have not power. What ails thee that thou haſt not power? If I had power, then would I abſtain from all ſin, and break off from my evil ways; but the devil throws this object and the other object in my way, and by his temptations he doth enſnare me, I have not power to reſiſt: Would you have me do more than I can do? and as long as I have not power I am to be excuſed.</p>
            <p>Now here is a device of the devil to keep people in his net ſtill. If men would be true to themſelves, they would not be long without power: If thou art convinced of the evil of thy ways, and that it is thy duty to break off from ſin, there is a power offered to thee, that, if thou joineſt with, thou mayeſt overcome all temptations, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thy ſin: I would have you all prove, and ſearch, and ſee whether I ſpeak truth or no; I am perſuaded there is not a man or woman here but they have ſometime ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from an evil work, which they were tempted to. How were you reſtrained; becauſe you knew it was an evil work, you durſt not do it; the devil had not a coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power to force you to do it; I knew it was an evil thing, and I joined with that in my mind which diſſuaded
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:020309_0346_0FAEF88651D7EAB8"/>
me from it; and I prayed to God to give me power to abſtain from it. The devil tempted thee on ſtill, who helped thee againſt the temptation? God reſtrained thee by his grace. Will not he be a preſent help unto thee? <hi>he is the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and forever;</hi> depend upon him ſtill, and he will be always ready to help thee, and ſupport thee, and ſtrengthen thee, and thou ſhalt be kept from ſin in an hour of temptation: Conſider that all power in Heaven and Earth is given to Chriſt, and if he be able to keep thee thou ſhalt not fall into it; <hi>thoſe that come unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>none ſhall pluck them out of my hands, and my Father is greater than all.</hi> If thou comeſt unto Chriſt, <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt thee out,</hi> and if thou depend upon him, he will preſerve thee, and <hi>none ſhall be able to pluck thee out of his hand.</hi> If thou join with the truth, and with that which is holy, thou ſhalt have ſtrength and ability to withſtand temptation and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; and (I may ſpeak with reverence) Chriſt hath bound himſelf to thoſe that truſt in him; <hi>thoſe that keep the word of my patience, I will keep them in the hour of temptation.</hi> If I keep waiting upon his power, that is ready to help me, and have a mind to be purified and ſanctified, and to have righteouſneſs brought into my ſoul, and have mine eyes unto God, and my expectations from him, he <hi>will work in me to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here people have a fixed foundation for their faith; but there is no working at this rate without bearing a daily croſs. There are a great many can receive the truth in words, and receive doctrines, and tenets, and that with delight; but there is no practiſing holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without a daily croſs and ſelf-denial. There are a great many who have come to truth, as far as it ſtands in words, but when it comes to ſomething that they muſt do, to ſpeak the truth, and live in the truth, they meet with ſo much of the temptation of the devil, ſo much luſt and corruption, and ungodlineſs in themſelves; they meet with ſuch evil things that their ſouls join with and yield to, that they cannot go on in the ways of holineſs, unleſs they look up to Jeſus, and have an eye to their Saviour,
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:020309_0347_0FAEF8870CF0E978"/>
and take up his croſs and follow him. Whatſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, ſufferings, and perſecutions they endure, they muſt have a godly reſolution to follow the Lord Chriſt, and ſay, I will obey his commands, he ſhall have the rule and government of my life, and be the guide of my way; whatſoever ſtands in my way, I will take up my croſs and deny myſelf; without this there is no good Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity in the world.</p>
            <p>There are a great many that ſeem to be religious and are profeſſors of the truth: We all know there are many profeſſors of the truth in notion, and with ſome zeal will talk of it; but they do not know how to live and walk in the truth, they do not live uprightly and honeſtly in it; they do not keep their words; they do not live juſtly and honeſtly with all men, nor do unto others as they would have others do to them: They can tell how to ſpeak and act; then why do they not do it? They have got a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they are above the croſs of Chriſt, and ſelf-denial is far below them. People will not live in the truth.</p>
            <p>This is wanting in the whole world: If we look around we ſhall find a great many are illuminated; there is abundance of knowledge and underſtanding among profeſſors, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of learning, and great numbers of learned men: What is the reaſon that oaths, and curſes, and all manner of wickedneſs run down the ſtreets like a river; there is pride, and wrath, and envy, and revenge, and violence to be found among us, as if it would draw down vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. They have heard preached in pulpits much of holineſs, humility, patience and meekneſs, <hi>that a meek and quiet ſpirit is an ornament of great price:</hi> Men have heard much preaching againſt pride, prophaneneſs, and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, and uncleanneſs, but they have heard it <hi>like a tale that is told,</hi> not much concerned about it, and have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en little credit or regard to what they have heard of theſe things. Why are people ſo wicked? The reaſon at laſt reſults in this, <hi>men are lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God,</hi> they are <hi>not the ſervants of Chriſt, but ſerve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts, and pleaſures, and are led captive by the devil, at his will;</hi> and ſo they go on in iniquity. No laws can
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:020309_0348_0FAEF887CEA3A670"/>
reſtrain and curb them, when the law of Chriſt is not written in their hearts; but when men come to ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſelf-denial and taking up the croſs, this will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a reformation.</p>
            <p>This is what I labour for, and all good men and women will do it: It is time to try for reformation. Vain faſhions, and garbs, and pride have been cried up, why ſhould not we cry for reformation before the wrath of a provoked God is kindled againſt us, and his vengeance poured down upon the nation? We muſt reform our lives. How ſhall men reform, you will ſay? By getting the <hi>law of God within their hearts,</hi> that is pure, and holy, and heavenly, that will be <hi>as a light to mens feet, and a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn to their paths:</hi> Now till people come to this they will go on in ſin and iniquity, till they be ſwept away with ſome overflowing and dreadful judgment.</p>
            <p>So that, my friends, in the fear of God, and out of love to you, I ſeek that you may be brought to God, through Chriſt; that you may live in the love and fear of the Lord, and, when you come to die, you may have reſt and peace for your ſouls. There is no reſt for thoſe that are evil-doers; <hi>there is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> The ungodly <hi>cry, peace, peace,</hi> and talk of peace, but there is no peace for them, but they ſhall have for their portion <hi>tribulation, and wrath, and anguiſh;</hi> this ſhall certainly come upon every one that doth evil. It is no matter what religion you are of, if you do not obey the truth, but live in unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now, friends, my exhortation to you all is, that you will return to the truth in your own hearts, and do it while you have time. I am not perſuading people to love my opinion, but to love God's truth in their own hearts, to love it and obey it, and you cannot do this unleſs you reſolve to take up a daily croſs, and be followers of Chriſt, who is gone before to prepare a place for them that are his true diſciples; and then he will preſent them to God, <hi>as holy, harmleſs, and undeſiled,</hi> for theſe are heirs of that everlaſting kingdom, <hi>which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>

            <p>THE deſire of all nations is come; that which all people deſire in their own way, is come in God's way; for all nations and all people on the earth deſire eternal life; they would all be happy in the other world, and in order thereunto, they have fitted themſelves with divers ways and methods, in which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to themſelves the enjoyment of eternal life; but by reaſon of the darkneſs that is in them, they have erred in their ways, they have been ſcattered, they have been driven and toſſed hither and thither, and can never agree about the way that leads to eternal life.</p>
            <p>This comes by reaſon of the great darkneſs that is over the ſons and daughters of men in general, in which they have loſt their way, and are endeavouring to find it again: But the ſubtle adverſary led them out of the way, and as long as he leads and they follow, they will never find the right way: The great calamity that is come upon the world in this reſpect, is very greatly to be lamented; for when the eye of the mind is opened, to behold the univerſal ſtate of mankind, and to ſee how they are ſcattered hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither, and often left in confuſion, by the craft and deluſion of the wicked one, and that none of the ways that they have found, are like to bring them to the propoſed end, becauſe they are defiled, becauſe they are, unholy; this hath bowed down the ſpirit of the Lord's ſervants many times, and a great cry hath ariſen in the hearts of thoſe that have ſeen the fruition and enjoyment of life eternal; O, that the ſons of men might hear! and O that they might conſider their ways before they come to their latter end! for mark friends, this you may take for a certain doctrine, and a ſure rule in judgment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all the ways that the ſons and daughters of men walk in; <hi>if they be unholy, they will be unprofitable;</hi> the

way of the Lord was, and is, and ever will be the way of holineſs, and the people that walk therein, they were, and are, and they will always be a holy people; now the ſons and daughters of men have not gone to meaſure their way by this rule, but the greateſt endeavours that ever have been in the world, from the beginning (the greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that men did undertake) were to ſee how near they could approve their doctrine and practice with the ſcriptures of truth, and that hath been the bone of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that they have ſtumbled about from one generation to another, one crying my way is right; and here they have been contending, diſputing, and jangling and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one with another, and could never agree, and could never come to that underſtanding, which is given by the Holy Spirit, that moved holy men to write the Holy Scriptures of truth; if they had, it is manifeſt they would have agreed, for this one ſpirit muſt agree with itſelf, and will give judgment according to its own righteous judgment: Men being alienated from the life of God, by evil works, and by the ſuggeſtions of ſatan, they have not known the way of peace, and have not come to that which is the deſire of all nations, as now in the fulneſs of time, the Lord God eternal, who created the Heavens and the Earth, the ſea and the fountains of water, he hath looked down and beheld the miſerable calamitous ſtate of the ſons and daughters of men, and he hath ſeen how they have been ſcattered and driven to and fro by idle ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and how every one hath indulged himſelf in his own way, though unholy and impure; and it is becauſe of the darkneſs of the night of ignorance that hath been over the people; and therefore in his infinite love and mercy, he is riſen, and hath brought forth his light and his truth, that the nations might be enlightened, that they might come and ſee with a divine eye that the truth is but one, and the way but one, and all that do really deſire to be inheritors of eternal life, muſt come to walk in that way. So that people are never brought back again out of that way wherein they have been ſcattered and driven about, till they come to ſee the way they practiſe to bring forth iniquity; they ſee there is no light to be had in
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:020309_0351_0FAEF88A13F490F8"/>
them, they ſee the anger of God kindled, and the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God poured out by reaſon of ſin and unholineſs.</p>
            <p>Now when they come to be convinced by the light of Chriſt Jeſus of their diſobedience, then they come to feel and find a principle, a ſeed and root that gives them a law which they ſhould obey, and hear the right law-giver, and have reſpect unto him: Here is the revelation of Chriſt Jeſus by his Spirit, and this extends itſelf in its operation and working to the ſons of men, to them that are afar off, as well as to thoſe that are nigh; therefore our continual exhortation, from time to time, according as the ſpirit hath given us utterance, is not ſo much to make profeſſion of this and the other doctrine of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as to perſuade all men every where, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the light, and hearken to the voice of the light in their own conſciences, that they hearken to that which is purely of God in themſelves, as we know, whoſoever comes to love the light of Chriſt Jeſus, wherewith they are enlightened, it would diſcover doctrine to them, and make known faith and practice too; it will lead them in the way everlaſting, it will open their underſtanding far above all preaching this and the other doctrine and tenet.</p>
            <p>What ſignifies it to ſhew colours to the blind, or to ſpeak words to the dead; till men come to have their ſenſes opened, that they may diſcern things belonging to the ſpirit of truth, the carnal man cannot underſtand the things of the goſpel of Chriſt, the carnal man is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be; there muſt be ſomething done in the ſoul, to bring it out of its car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, and bring it to ſomething that is ſpiritual, before it is capable of underſtanding the things of the ſpirit: Therefore when our minds can witneſs what we came hither for, when we meet to ſerve and worſhip God, we ſhall have a hope to receive ſome illumination, ſome refreſhment, ſome comfort, or ſome knowledge of things divine; it is in vain to attend religious doctrines with an irreligious mind. It is my judgment of charity, that every one that comes hither, hath ſome expectation of illumination in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, ſome gift, or ſome inſtruction; this they may receive from the God of Heaven, by the miniſtry of thoſe
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:020309_0352_0FAEF88CE5CA7BF8"/>
who muſt be the mouth of God, to ſpeak to them in his name: When people are thus prepared, and their minds fixed to hear the truth; if they do not find it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they come not to a ſenſe of the word of life in their own hearts, their hearing cannot give them life. We are commending ourſelves to every man's conſcience; let your minds be turned inward, ſearch and conſider, is there a light that enlightens every man that comes into the world? Is there a deſire of eternal life manifeſted in me? Is there that in me that puts me upon obedience to God, to mend my life and converſation, that I might be recommended to God? Is there ſomething in me that checks me when I ſpeak amiſs, and do amiſs? I do appeal to the witneſs of God in you; if that be ſo, then believe me for the word's ſake, the teſtimony of God in your hearts.</p>
            <p>Let us next conſider, whether we had beſt agree on this concluſion, that God hath enlightened us, and whether we had not beſt obey that light; this is the beſt way, let us put the queſtion, and wait for an anſwer from ourſelves. There is much indeed to be ſaid on the other ſide: If I ſhould hear and obey that by which I am enlightened, if I ſhould hearken to the reproof of my own conſcience, I ſhould loſe a great deal of the pleaſure and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the world, I ſhould loſe a great deal of the profit which I gain in my trade and calling, and of the delight and pleaſure I have with my neighbour.</p>
            <p>This is not to be denied; I would have things put in the balance; I grant you will loſe ſome pleaſure, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly gain, and the friendſhip of the world; but pray conſider, and let us go through the account: If thou obeyeſt this light of Chriſt Jeſus, this is God's way of drawing thee nearer to himſelf, to make thee an heir of his eternal kingdom; whereas by thy indulging thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts, thou wilt loſe thy immortal ſoul; if thou ſhouldeſt gain the whole world, and loſe thy own ſoul, what will it profit thee? Thou ſhouldeſt conſider, why I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened; how comes it to paſs that my nature is evil, and I am fallen from my primitive ſtate, from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and from the enjoyment of his preſence, and communion with him? How comes God to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:020309_0353_0FAEF88E93ECEBF0"/>
of me, and to enlighten me and kindle in me a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of returing to him? why ſhould he do this for me? Thou wilt never find a reaſon in thyſelf of this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary kindneſs, of this ſingular mercy of God to thee; it is becauſe his mercy moved him, and it was his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ſtirred him up: He hath ſent his Son Jeſus Chriſt into the world, that men might have light in and through him, and have it abundantly. The mercy of God is a fountain from whence all this flows to us; if this prevail not upon thee, no argument will: What, was it meer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, meer grace, that God was not willing to ſee me pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and run headlong to deſtruction? He was loath to execute his wrath upon me, therefore he found out a way by which I might return to him. This made a good man cry out, behold! what manner of love is this, wherewith the Father hath loved us? Here is the grace of God; here is the good will of God; here is the way; a way, what way? A way of coming to God; a way of being again reconciled unto God, whom we had provoked by our ſins; a way of enjoying eternal life again, after we had loſt all pretence to it.</p>
            <p>The next queſtion is, who will walk in the way that leads to eternal life? We would all have eternal life; it is the univerſal conſent of all nations; all would have eternal life; but the queſtion is, who will walk in the way that leads to it? Some of the nations round about, and many in this nation, they will walk in their own way, and yet they would have eternal life; but their way muſt be of the ſame nature and quality with the life they would have; if the way they walk in be not of the ſame nature and quality, it will not lead to it. Let every one exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their way; let every one examine their progreſs, and their lives and footſteps in this world; if they ſow to the fleſh, they ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; and if they ſow to the ſpirit, they ſhall of the ſpirit reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; a ſuitable fruit to that life they live, and the way they walk in. If we conclude with reaſon; with pure, found reaſon, we muſt conclude it is better for us all to walk in the way of holineſs; and we ſhall have more reaſon to believe that we ſhall have life eternal, than in
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:020309_0354_0FAEF8901BB60E20"/>
walking in an unholy way, therefore we ſhould be reſolved to walk in the way of holineſs; and if people are brought to this, it is an eaſy thing to draw them to confeſſion: You ſay true, it is better to walk in a holy way than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy way; but alas! we have not power ſo to do; we are feeble, weak, dark and ignorant; and we have many luſts, temptations and impediments, lying in our way, that it is not poſſible for any to walk in that way; we know the way, we underſtand the way well enough; you would have us walk by the ſight of Chriſt, and the dictates of our own conſciencies, then we ſhould never be condemned for any thing we do, but we ſhould ſtand in an openneſs of acceſs to God; when a man ſinneth againſt God, ſin lies at the door; but they that ſin not, have an acceſs to God. Alas, theſe things cannot be done! What can a poor creature do that wants power?</p>
            <p>My friends, this excuſe muſt go no further; let us try and conſider in the preſence of God this day, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful God that is the aſſiſter of his people; let us try how far this will go, I have no power of myſelf; all good men grant it to be true, you have not power to walk in the way of holineſs: But let us ask another queſtion; doth God require of thee and me to walk in the way of holineſs, and doth he deny power to us to walk in it? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk in the way of holineſs, but by the operation of his power working in us, unto the extinguiſhing of the life of ſin and corruption, that hath hindered us all this while; God knows we cannot do it ourſelves. Chriſt tells his diſciples, without me ye can do nothing, nothing good, nothing that is right. This being concluded on, all power comes from God; the next queſtion is, how, and which way muſt we receive power from God greater than our own power? Which is the way of people's receiving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from God? You have read how people came to have power; <hi>to as many as believed, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God.</hi> What ſignifies this to them that do not believe? If believing be the way to obtain pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is nothing to thoſe that do not believe; there faith is neceſſary, in the firſt place, for obtaining of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: This is a great myſtery, ſuch an odd ſaying, that the
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:020309_0355_0FAEF890D1814320"/>
world knows not what to make of it: Believers, we are all believers; I believe the truth of the principles of the Chriſtian religion, and I believe all the articles of the creed: To talk of believing at this time of the day, we have believed this twenty, or thirty, or forty years, but the firſt act of faith is yet to be done after your ſenſe: It is true, with the greateſt part of the nation; the firſt act of faith is not yet begun, for their faith is men's faith: We are for the faith that was delivered to the ſaints; it is the gift of God, it comes from the operation of God; ſo that I may conclude, whoſoever remains a ſtranger to the operation of God, he is a ſtranger to the true faith; and they who eſtrange themſelves from that which God worketh, are ſtrangers to the operation of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, till people's minds are turned to Chriſt, whom God hath ſent, who is appointed to be for ſalvation to the ends of the earth; till men come to reduce the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of the ſoul and body to him, as the captain of their ſalvation; till they come to be thus reſigned, they cannot come to the true faith.</p>
            <p>Now when God worketh this reſignation in us, a man will reflect upon himſelf and ſay, alas I have been mine own keeper too long, I ſee I have gone off from God, now I will return to him, and reſign up myſelf to the Lord, that he may work in me what he pleaſeth to work: When men come to this reſignation of ſoul, they have faith given them, they muſt believe God will never leave them nor forſake them, but he will magnify his power in their weakneſs; I will reſt my ſoul upon him, and caſt my care upon him that careth for me; it is not faith bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in words, and in the articles of the creed, but it is a <hi>faith in the Son of God, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given;</hi> I may expect a ſhare of it, he will give me a little, if I come to him for it; and if I be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a little, he will give me more; the reaſon why you want power, is, becauſe you want faith; and the reaſon of your want of faith, is, becauſe you want a reſignation to the will of God; you will be your own carvers, and your own keepers and guides. When you come to this reſignation to the will of God, God will give you power,
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:020309_0356_0FAEF89186958430"/>
and then you will find him the God of all grace; you are what you are by the grace of God, and by his power, and by that power you will obey his will: Here is faith that giveth glory to God, to that God that takes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy man and makes him holy; how doth he this? By his holy ſpirit, which is as fire that burneth up that which is corruptible; then the man is well (I ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dictates of the ſpirit) when he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by Chriſt Jeſus, the Mediator between God and man, the Mediator of the new covenant, who maketh our peace. That you may come to the knowledge of the day of the Lord's viſitation, is what our ſouls labour and travel for, that you may be in the unity of the ſame ſpirit after the deſire of all nations is come; he is come to you, that you may all ſay within yourſelves, <hi>ſalvation this day is come to our houſes, and into our hearts.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <date>June 10, 1688.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THE Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the light, life and virtue that can only ſatisfy. Chriſt is all in all.</p>
            <p>There is nothing can ſatisfy the ſouls of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, unleſs they feel life and <hi>virtue</hi> to flow from Chriſt Jeſus; and this, whether it flow inſtrumentally or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, always comforteth; it always refreſheth the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart.</p>
            <p>Therefore all they that deſire ſatisfaction to their ſouls, that meet together upon that account, they ought to have their eyes turned to the Lord, that they may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to underſtand the miniſtration of the ſpirit, whether in themſelves, or through any other. For while they are exerciſed outwardly, and the dependence of their ſouls is upon that which is outward, there remains a <hi>veil</hi> upon the mind, that they many times hear excellent things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the kingdom of God, but they underſtand them
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:020309_0357_0FAEF89251CFB910"/>
not, becauſe they are alienated and eſtranged in their minds from <hi>that</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in themſelves, that ſhould give them an underſtanding. We never pretend to give people an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, we have always ſaid, that is the work of God. We have ſpoken many things of the <hi>kingdom of God,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things have been revealed to us by his holy ſpirit, and the ſame ſpirit hath given us utterance, to ſpeak of the great things of the law of God; yet many, that have been conſtant hearers of theſe things, remain ignorant, and are inſenſible, becauſe they are not exerciſed in their own meaſure of the grace and light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by which they ſhould receive and underſtand them.</p>
            <p>This hath made me often lament the caſe of many of the people of this city and nation, who are daily hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the word of God preached, and retain it not in their hearts: The ſowers are gone out to ſow, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny receive it in the <hi>high-way-ground;</hi> the way that every thing can paſs in, there they receive the word ſown, and the devil catcheth it away; and though they have heard excellent things, of the ſtrength, ability and power of God, that he miniſtreth to his people, they remain ſo weak and ſo feeble, that they are blown away with every blaſt of the adverſary, with every temptation, and with every ſnare and gin that is laid for them, they are catched, and enſnared, and taken; and ſo theſe come to meetings again and again, one year after another: I might ſay unto you, wherefore do you come? It may be you may ſay, we deſire to be ſatisfied; we deſire ſatisfaction for our ſouls. Do you ſo? Then I tell you, you may come all the days of your life, and want it, and lay down your heads in ſorrow at laſt for all that. For all the words in the world will never communicate that heavenly life and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which brings true ſatisfaction to the ſoul, unto any, except to thoſe that have an exerciſe in their own mind and ſpirits, in that which they have of God; they muſt firſt be brought to know the way they ſhould walk in, and to believe that is the way: When people believe this is my way, the light within is my way, the grace of God is my way; that ſearches and tries my heart, that is my way I muſt walk in, ſpeak in, and think in, and do all
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:020309_0358_0FAEF893117928E8"/>
that I have to do in; when I believe this is that way, then this belief obligeth men to take heed to their ways, to their footſteps. And here they that are thus exerciſed, are in a tender care every ſtep they take in their way; and ſo perhaps they may receive great benefits by hearing the reports they do daily hear from thoſe that were in the way before them, and have travelled further in it, than they ever yet have done. The experiences of the ſervants of the Lord, are daily helpful to them, and they are daily comforted, ſtrengthened, and confirmed, to hear how they have ſped, that have travelled through their condition, and through their preſent ſtate; the helps and advantages they have met with, will do thee good, and comfort thee: But what is this to thoſe that are not in the way, that have not faith in the way? Tho' they have a clear belief of the doctrine and way itſelf, yet they are not exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to walk therein; for they do but as the reſt of the world, ſaying, this good man, and the other good man, made a good ſermon. Why was it good? Not for any good they found by it, but becauſe he raiſed his doctrine well, and proved it from the ſcripture, therefore we are obliged to believe it.</p>
            <p>But now this good doctrine, if it be ever ſo good, and ever ſo firmly proved, it brings forth no fruit to the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, ſaving in them that believe, ſaving in them where there is an exerciſe in the fear of God, where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are concerned for their ſoul's ſatisfaction. For they that look for true ſatisfaction by this, or that, or the other way of the world, they ſpend their days without ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo at laſt they die in ſorrow; and ſo it will be to the end of this, and all ſucceeding generations.</p>
            <p>And therefore, my friends, though I confeſs it is not a grief to me, but a joy, to ſee people willing to hear the truth, and to come together in great aſſemblies; tho I ſay, this is not a grief, but a joy, for I am not about to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them that do ſo: Yet I muſt be plain with you; I know what I ſay, and you will know it too one day, that all this meeting together, and gathering in great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and hearing what is preached to you, with ever ſo great delight to your minds, it will do you no good,
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:020309_0359_0FAEF8961BBD7C78"/>
unleſs you believe in the grace of God, that hath been miniſtered to you through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And when people come to this foundation, and build on it, and grow every day more and more diligent in the exerciſe of their minds towards God, and examine their way, and examine their footſteps, how they have walked yeſterday, how they have walked this day, and how their minds are exerciſed at this preſent time, whether they have anſwered the grace of God; when they come to be thus exerciſed, they will look upon themſelves as bound in duty to give account to God every moment, for their thoughts, words and actions. When they are thus exerciſed, then let them come to meetings in the name of God, and hear the experiences of them that have gone before them, and treaſured up ſayings in their hearts for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they will find this will be a help to them: But if people go and build a religion upon the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this and that man; nay, were it upon the ſayings of Chriſt himſelf and his apoſtles, if they were here to preach to them, and build a religion upon their words, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and doctrines, without the operations of the Spirit of God upon their hearts, inclining them to holineſs and righteouſneſs, this religion will do them no good: By this, to make the beſt of it, they might make a ſhift to reach to a form of godlineſs; people conforming themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, to the outward precept or command from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, it might amount to a form of godlineſs; yet it might be ſuppoſed and granted, that the power of God, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of divine life and virtue, where it comes, it doth ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and ſeaſon the mind, and bring men into an awful reverence of the living God, their Maker, that they might ſtand in awe, and not ſin againſt him; for here is the life of religion.</p>
            <p>This hath a great difference from the manner of building men in religion, that many have been acquainted withal. They tell us, our fathers before us were built up in theſe forms, and modes, and methods of religion; they received ſo many doctrines, ordinances, ſacraments and articles; and when theſe are received, believed and profeſſed, there's a ſaint for you, there's a child of God, and a member of
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:020309_0360_0FAEF897ADEB0528"/>
the church. How came he to be ſo? He was inſtructed in all the principles of the Chriſtian religion, and ſubject to all the ordinances of the church, ſaith one; and ſaith another, he could ſpeak excellently concerning the doctrine of our religion; therefore he is certainly a child of God, and a member of Chriſt; but all this acceptation of the principles of the Chriſtian religion, of doctrines, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and ſacraments; all this will not amount to the purifying of the heart, and cleanſing and purging of the conſcience; nay, it would not come to a far leſs matter, to the bridling of the tongue; but they would be in a paſſion upon the leaſt provocation, and upon the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and diſtaſte given them, their tongues would run over into wrath, and into wantonneſs, and prophaneneſs; and upon any occaſion and provocation given, their corrupted words would prevail, and lead them into deceit and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous practices; and though the fruits and works of the old man remain, yet they will follow the principle of the regenerate, as far as they conſiſt in words.</p>
            <p>If our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſay, <hi>except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</hi> then this old corrupt birth will preach a ſermon upon this text, and profeſs it. How many have taken upon them to preach a ſermon, upon ſome excellent ſayings of Chriſt, that never knew what regeneration was; for the <hi>new birth</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hath a <hi>new life;</hi> but they have lived the life of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corrupt fallen man, and yet preach a ſermon upon regeneration: Thus the miniſter hath done, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have believed him, and have been gathered into ſuch and ſuch a church; for moſt put themſelves into one church or other; they have been covenanted Chriſtians, members of a church; but they have wanted that which makes a Chriſtian, a religious man, <hi>viz. the anſwer of a good conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A true Chriſtian, he is bound to be an obedient child unto God, that begat him of his own will, by the word of truth; and ſuch a one may be in expectation of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of peace from God, through Jeſus Chriſt, in whom he hath believed, and by whom he is reconciled to God. If you take away this new birth, and this new nature,

and an anſwer of peace, from God to the ſoul, then tell me what the Chriſtian religion is, more than the religion of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> that worſhip ſtocks and ſtones? All the reſt is but talk, and men are never a whit the better for it: One man may excel another in talk and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: A debauched man many times hath been able to talk at a great rate, and to ſpeak notable things; and ſome have been ready to ſay, it is a pity a man of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts ſhould lead a wicked life: But alas! if ſuch a one can talk of the power of God ſtill, and the devil hath power over him; or if he ſpeak highly of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, yet he himſelf plays the fool abominably; ſo that by ſuch a kind of life, and ſuch a kind of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, people never attain to ſatisfaction; after forty, or fifty, or ſixty years ſpent therein, they muſt after all, lay down their heads in ſorrow, when they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant keepers to the church, and ſayers of their prayers, and receivers of the ſacrament, and ſtedfaſtly believe the articles of the creed, and make profeſſion of all the parts of the Chriſtian religion; yet after all, they muſt lay down their heads in ſorrow: Why, what is the matter? what did they want? They wanted faith in the power of God, that ſhould enable them to overcome their ſin, and live in obedience to God; and they wanted to their outward profeſſion, the <hi>anſwer of a good conſcience, and juſtification through Chriſt the Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They talked of redemption through Jeſus Chriſt, but were never redeemed from their ſins: This is ſo evident and plain, that there is no ſpeaking to the contrary: If you ſee a drunkard, or a ſwearer, or an unclean perſon, and if he ſhall preach, and make an excellent ſermon of the redemption that there is in Chriſt, and therein tell you, what great benefits they receive by Chriſt, that are true believers; and that Chriſt is a Redeemer, and redeemeth them from the curſe of the law, and from the guilt of ſin, and reconcileth them to God; ſo that he that was under the curſe of the law, and an heir of wrath, is now a child of God: Now if you come to examine this man, and ask him, whether he is redeemed, and delivered from ſin, ſo that ſin hath no more dominion over him, he will
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:020309_0362_0FAEF899D3862758"/>
tell you, no: What not redeemed, when thou haſt been a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever thus long? Art thou ſtill under the bondage and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of ſin? Then thou art under the government of ſome other maſter than Chriſt; ſome other maſter hath rule over thee, if thou art not redeemed from thy ſwearing, lying, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and uncleanneſs; if thou art led to theſe things, thou are under the power and government of ſome other maſter than Chriſt. Now this hath ſtartled people, when they have been thinking, that they have been baptized perſons, and profeſſing Chriſtians, and they have flattered themſelves with a groundleſs confidence, let me die when I will, this night, or to morrow, I ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt; I am an heir of the kingdom of God: Let me tell thee, thou diſhonoureſt the name of God by thy preſumption.</p>
            <p>When people come to examine matters, and read over the book of their conſciences, and ſee what ſervants they have been to the devil, how the devil hath led them up and down at his will, thoſe that were covenanted Chriſtians, followers of Chriſt; when the devil hath ſaid to them, follow me, then ſayeſt thou I will; when the devil ſaith, follow me to this and the other evil thing, I ſee I cannot reſiſt; I cannot withſtand the temptation; I was overtaken, and ſurpriſed, and led away by ſuch an allurement, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by it: I pray thee leave off profeſſing, for thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; he and his diſciples did not ſo: He was tempted as thou art, and his diſciples were tempted as thou art; ſo were Chriſtians of old time; and Chriſtians that live in the preſent time do meet with many temptations, but they are not at the devil's beck and call, as thou art.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in one paſſage of his life, we find came to be awakened and ſtartled: There was a light from <hi>Heaven</hi> ſhone about him, he heard the voice of Chriſt ſpeaking to him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>who art thou Lord?</hi> and the Lord ſaid, <hi>I am JESUS whom thou perſecuteſt; it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks;</hi> and he trembling and aſtoniſhed ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts, ix. 4. He was brought to this paſs after his convincement, but before that he was overcome and led captive; and when he would do good,
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:020309_0363_0FAEF89BB0A1B500"/>
evil was preſent with him: <hi>To will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is preſent, but how to perform I know not;</hi> but he did not call this a happy ſtate. He did not ſay then, I am in a good condition, When I am led captive by the devil at his will: The good that I would do, I do not, and I am carnal, and ſold under ſin: He doth not ſay, this is a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I am ſatisfied with it; ſee what he calls that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; he gives it a more right name than many do now-a-days, that ſay, this is the ſtate of God's children; that the beſt of all God's children have not power to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, and overcome all their corruptions, that they ſin in their beſt duties, and can do nothing but ſin, and that ſin mixeth itſelf in all their holy duties and performances: Many of their miniſters tell them, that if they think they can perform any duty without ſin, they deceive themſelves, and run the hazard of being accurſed. But they learned not this of Chriſt, but of ſome other matter. Paul gave this ſtate another name; I would you were as wiſe when you are in this ſtate and condition. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me?</hi> I ſee a wretchedneſs in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; I ſee, if I be not delivered out of it, I muſt periſh to all eternity. This is not a ſtate to live in; who can live at eaſe in ſuch a condition as this? Who can but cry out, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin and death? Alas! we hear no ſuch cry now among prieſts or people, and ſeparate congregations: I fear this cry is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt among us, unleſs it be ſome few that hear the voice of God, and feel ſuch a ſtroke of the divine power as <hi>Paul</hi> did, and anſwer to the heavenly voice. I confeſs that I myſelf have heard ſuch a cry, and have been ſenſible of my woful captivity and bondage, by reaſon of ſin. And though I had a mind to do good, I could not do it; it was my deſire that I might ſin no more, I would not ſin againſt the Lord, if I could avoid it; and when I would do good, I found that evil was preſent with me; but I was far from ſitting down there, and ſaying, this is the ſtate and condition of God's people; it is as well with me as it was with the apoſtle Paul, therefore I will ſit down in this ſtate: The people of God cannot find ſatisfaction in ſuch a ſtate as this; though I confeſs, that God's peculiar
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:020309_0364_0FAEF89C8872E338"/>
people at firſt: came to this ſtate, for their conviction; and the opening of their minds, and enlightening their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to ſee the evil of their ways; but they do not come to this ſtate, as to their reſt, and then perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are in the condition of the children of God; but they give their ſtate a right name, and cry out, <hi>O wretched wan that I am!</hi> what a miſerable condition am I fallen into! I did not ſee it before: Now my eyes are opened, now my underſtanding is illuminated, now I ſee that the corruption of my nature prevails againſt the grace of God; and when I would join with the grace of God, and the motions of his Holy Spirit, the enemy is preſent to lead me away; I am not now in a happy ſtate, but I am ſo far advanced that I am convinced of my miſerable and wretched ſtate and condition; if ſome way or other be not found for my deliverance, I ſhall never ſee the face of God with comfort. Then ariſes that cry, <hi>who ſhall deliver me?</hi> Thus the apoſtle <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> vii.) ſets forth the ſtate of his convincement, and how miſerable a condition he was in: Then he goes further, and tells you how it was with him: <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> O! I have cauſe enough to thank God, I am not a wretched man now, I am not carnal, ſold under ſin; I am not led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the devil at his will now. Why how ſo? the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath ſet me free from the law of ſin and death.</hi> Here is ſomething to glory, and to comfort the ſoul in: The law of the Spirit of life triumphed in his ſoul, and delivered him from the law of ſin and death, and redeemed him from the power of ſin, and made him ſerve God with freedom and liberty. <hi>I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> I would have all come to this, to thank God; not only in words, but in reality, in deed and truth. For one may teach a <hi>parrot</hi> to talk over theſe words; but it is the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, that will make you free from the law of ſin and death.</p>
            <p>This is a hard leſſon, therefore you muſt go home into your own conſciences, before you can make a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things, and give a right anſwer to yourſelves. The law of the ſpirit of life will ſet thee free from the
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:020309_0365_0FAEF89CD9DC77D8"/>
law of thy paſſion, and of thy pride and covetouſneſs, and ſenſuality, and the law of thy carnal inclinations. Art thou ſet free from theſe?</p>
            <p>Now when people come to examine themſelves, they have no way to flee to, but they muſt take up a daily croſs, and truſt to the Lord Jeſus for their deliverance; who hath enlightened them, to ſee their wretched and woful ſtate; and illuminated their underſtandings, that they might come to him, in order to their being delivered from the dominion of ſin.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the world think this is a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and therefore do not hope to be ſet free from the bondage of their ſins. Which of theſe ways is it that thou takeſt? I am afraid many of you have taken the wrong way: I judge no one in particular, but I ſpeak this in faithfulneſs and love to your ſouls.</p>
            <p>If there be any <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that are ſenſible of their ſins, and in a captivated ſtate under ſin and ſatan, who have deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ever being for at liberty, and have ſaid, it is a vain thing to expect it; for ſome learned men have told them, that there is no deliverance from ſin in this world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in vain for me to ſtrive, in vain for me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage myſelf in a continual care and conflict, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual warring and watching againſt ſin; for this deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance can never be obtained in this life: It is in vain to ſeek for a thing that can never be found, and to ſtrive for that which can never be obtained. If there be any ſuch here preſent, I have this to ſay to them, that the Lord, in his infinite mercy, hath done two great things for you, to help you out of this deſpair, of obtaining a full deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the bondage of your ſins.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God hath placed a witness for himſelf in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, in your conſciences. Let me ask you, have ye not got victory over many ſins and temptations, that you have been aſſaulted with, from your childhood to this day? I might challenge any perſon in this aſſembly, when a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath been preſented before you, hath there not been ſomething within you, to tell you of the danger of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with it? Hath not thy conſcience warned thee, and called upon thee, O take heed, do not this evil thing, do
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:020309_0366_0FAEF89D986F95B0"/>
not cheat thy neighbour, do not commit this ſin; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drunkenneſs, or uncleanneſs, or whatſoever ſin thou waſt tempted to: Now, didſt thou join to that voice in thine own conſcience? And did it not help thee over the temptation? And when thou didſt eſcape the ſin, waſt thou not glad of it? and didſt thou not rejoice that thou obtainedſt victory over it? Satan laid a ſnare, and an opportunity before me, to commit ſuch a ſin; but I did not join with it, and now I am glad of it. It was not only the devil's fault, for he came to his own, but there was an evil inclination in my heart to it: How came it to paſs thou didſt not do it? I knew it was a ſin againſt the Lord. How didſt thou know that? I knew in my conſcience, that if I did it, I muſt ſin againſt light, and againſt conviction, and againſt grace received; and that was the reaſon I did not do it. Thus thou acknowledgeſt thine own conſcience help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee againſt the temptation.</p>
            <p>Now I appeal to all your conſciences, that hear me this day, whether God hath not done this kindneſs for you; and there is none here but hath been ſome time helped out of temptation? I do not believe that ill of any, that they comply with all the temptations they meet with, but the light in their conſciences hath ſhewn them the evil of ſin, and they have been kept out of it, and they have been glad of it afterwards.</p>
            <p>Now this is one great kindneſs, which God hath done for every one of you, in order to help you out of this deſpair of being delivered from your ſins.</p>
            <p>Deſpair in the common notion of it, is that which makes a man doubt of his eternal ſalvation: <hi>I ſhall go to hell when I die; there is no mercy for me.</hi> This deſpair hath ſo wrought upon people, that many have loſt their wits, and common ſenſe, and at laſt made away with themſelves; many have been diſtracted and undone in this world, while they lived in it, and at laſt have diſpatched themſelves out of it. And there is another deſpair; a deſpair of getting vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over their corruptions, and obtaining a freedom from ſin: This latter deſpair, this nation is generally fallen into; though the effects of the other deſpair is lamentable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the effects of this will be as bad one day, if not
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:020309_0367_0FAEF89EA2923C28"/>
prevented by rectifying that miſtake men lie under. Why ſhouldeſt thou deſpair of the power of God to help thee, and of the grace of God, and of the good will of God for thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance? if thou wilt not join with the grace of God, and the power of God that is ready to help thee, and give deliverance from thy ſins, the conſequence will be dreadful at the laſt. Therefore believe in that grace of God, which hath helped thee againſt ſome temptations, and given thee victory over ſome ſins, that it will, if thou faithfully join with it, give thee victory over all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider God hath done another kindneſs for thee, he hath ſent his <hi>light and truth</hi> into thy heart, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage thee in a war againſt ſin: There are a great many faithful ſoldiers of Chriſt, that have fought this battle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and have obtained the <hi>victory,</hi> and they will tell you, they never went out to war in their own names, but in the name of the <hi>Lord</hi> JEHOVAH: When they relied upon him, and in meekneſs and fear waited upon him, he gave them power to overcome; and they were made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and <hi>more than conquerors;</hi> for they have overcome thoſe enemies, that ſometimes overcame them; and Chriſt hath fixed and ſettled them in this conqueſt, never to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more. Here is both an outward and an inward evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: The outward evidence will do you no good, till you come to lay hold of the inward evidence in your own hearts; then the outward evidence that God ſends, will be ſerviceable to you.</p>
            <p>Therefore, my friends, I tell you (as I ſaid before) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſatisfy the ſoul, but the virtue and life that flows into it from the fountain of life; here is the way to it. If you ſhould hear of a treaſury, and ſtore of bread laid up for all that are willing to come to it; if you knew not the way to come to it, and were ready to periſh with hunger, what a cry would there be among you! If a man ſhould come and tell you where there is ſuch a <hi>treaſury of bread,</hi> when you are ready to periſh with hunger, and tell you the way to it is intricate and narrow, but that he himſelf hath been there, and that he can tell you the ready way to it, and that he himſelf had relief and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and great plenty beſtowed upon him, and that he
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:020309_0368_0FAEF89F14C74660"/>
would bring you thither, O how welcome would ſuch a one be to you! O that you were as wiſe in ſpiritual things, and as much concerned for your ſouls, as you are for your bodies, and would take the advice of Gods miniſters! They would turn you to the light within; the grace of God in your own hearts, which you are partakers of; and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you in the name of God, deſire you to follow the duties of your own conſciences, and you will come quickly where there is bread enough. By that light within, you will ſee your ſtate is not ſo good as you imagined it was. This <hi>oracle</hi> within, is that which you muſt live with, and dwell with; you muſt go home with it, and lie down with it, and you muſt riſe with it, and follow the dictates of it; if you do ſo, before the week be out, you will have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to tell me, if I ſhould come and ask you, I have got more victory over my ſins, by following the dictates of the light of the grace of God within my own boſom, than by all my reading, hearing and praying, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming other duties.</p>
            <p>Make a trial of this, and you will find the preſence of God with you, and that he is a God at hand, and not afar off; and if you buckle on your ſpiritual armour, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of your ſalvation will not be far off, but be preſent before you.</p>
            <p>Therefore keep your eye unto Jeſus, the author and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of your faith, and you will be <hi>able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens you;</hi> and you will be able to conquer thoſe ſins and temptations that have conquered you.</p>
            <p>May the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, break down the body of ſin and death, and bring you into the glorious liberty which God hath prepared for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

            <head type="sub">Preached at DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <date>July 17, 1692.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THE people of God in former ages, did <hi>often think upon the name of the Lord:</hi> I would it might be the daily practice of all that make profeſſion to be the people of God in our days, to think <hi>often</hi> upon the name of the Lord. This you know is an inward exerciſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and known to none but God; he only knows when you are met together, whether you are thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name, whether the exerciſe of your minds is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his power, or upon whatſoever elſe your minds are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. They whoſe exerciſe and deſire is, to feel God's power, and to be acquainted with his name, the Lord is nigh to them, to reveal his mighty power, and his name to them, and they are a people that partake of his goodneſs and of his virtue, and have an experimental knowledge of the divers adminiſtrations of both his judgments and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to their own ſouls, and ſo they can proceed from thinking to ſpeaking of the goodneſs of God from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that they have in themſelves, that the Lord is good to them.</p>
            <p>For all that ſome do in their manner of ſpeaking of God and his goodneſs, and crying up the name of the Lord, it is all worth nothing, it is but noiſe: But every one that partakes in his own ſoul of ſomething of the divine virtue and goodneſs that flows from God inviſibly to him through Jeſus Chriſt, he hath aſſurance in himſelf that he ſpeaks the truth: It is not meer words, made ready to his hand, but it is his own knowledge and experience of that which God hath wrought in him by his own Spirit; there are none that think upon the name of the Lord, and his power, and the working of it, but they are able to ſpeak of it effectually and truly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="370" facs="unknown:020309_0370_0FAEF8A0AB401520"/>I know it hath been, and is the practice among many, that they are able to ſpeak of God's goodneſs from what they find in the writings and ſayings of ſome that lived before them, that did bear an honourable teſtimony of God's goodneſs in their religion; and they learn to ſay it over again in their particular age: But what hath this tale that they have told, wrought? This report they have made, how God was with the Chriſtians of old, the primitive Chriſtians and martyrs; they have told a tale of theſe things, and what hath it effected? It hath either brought forth Chriſtians, or it hath not.</p>
            <p>The way for people to be grounded and ſettled in divine knowledge, is for every one to ſpeak what they know: And if they know nothing of theſe things, to ſay nothing of them. And the way for them to come to receive divine knowledge, is, by thinking, by meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by conſidering of that converſe that God hath with their own ſouls; for there is a way provided for all men to converſe with God that made them: Every man and woman may ask queſtions of him, and may have anſwers from him, if they have patience enough to wait for them; every ſoul here preſent, that with ſeriouſneſs of mind ſhall ask of God what their ſtate and condition is, if they were to die preſently, God will tell them, he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them; he will ſhine unto them by the <hi>light of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and let them know whether they are <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bonds of their iniquity</hi> ſtill, or whether they are redeemed out of it, and brought into covenant with himſelf: But will you believe his anſwer? I would have no man go about to ask ſuch a queſtion of God unleſs he hath a mind to believe the anſwer that God giveth him. To what purpoſe ſhould men ask, if they <hi>ask amiſs?</hi> If they ask without faith, they do not believe except the anſwer pleaſe them.</p>
            <p>Many, in our days, have put up their petitions and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, that he would diſcover to them the ſtate and condition of their ſouls: The Lord hath anſwered them, and notwithſtanding all the profeſſion that they have made of his name, and of their faith in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and of the work of redemption, yet he hath often declared
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:020309_0371_0FAEF8A14C3B0310"/>
thou art ſtill unredeemed, thou art ſtill in thy ſin, and luſts, and concupiſcence prevail over thee; thou art ſtill in bondage. This is God's anſwer to many; but there is ſomething ariſeth in their minds, that they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe this; I would think better of myſelf than this: What if thou doſt think better of thyſelf? Thou art never the better, <hi>for the word of the Lord ſtands ſure.</hi> There is no removing of it; there is no denial of the truth. If this truth condemn thee, all the world cannot juſtify thee; and this truth by which God condemns the ſinner is in the ſinner's own heart: What will he do with it? It is in the ſinner's conſcience; it doth not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him by book, out of this chapter and that verſe, out of this author and the other author, but he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by God's true and faithful witneſs, in his own conſcience. Thou wilt not believe it; but if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt not this, then thou remaineſt in thy unbelief of the truth; and nothing elſe but believing it can ſave thee; no counſel elſe can deliver or redeem thee.</p>
            <p>So that the beſt advice and counſel that I can give a people in this caſe, is this; that when they come to ſuch a religious meeting as this is, they would come with a mind prepared and fitted to think upon the Lord; to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name, and the way by which he brings people to himſelf; for no man can be called a child of God, that doth not partake of his nature. If a man be ever ſo wiſe, and rich, and great in the world; if he be a prince or an emperor, without this he is a <hi>child of wrath.</hi> Now if theſe children of wrath meet with ſomething that convinceth them; if they are touched and become a ſenſible people, then crowns and diadems are nothing to them. Such a one will ſay, if I be a <hi>child of wrath,</hi> a captive to ſin and my own luſts and concupiſcence, yet for all that I will go to a religious meeting, where I hope the word of God will be preached; I hope to meet with ſomething there that will do me good; and I have a deſire that I may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of a natural ſtate, from being <hi>a child of wrath, to be brought into the kingdom of God.</hi> If I have this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in me, God that made me, wrought it in me; for by nature <hi>we cannot ſo much as think a good thought.</hi> When
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:020309_0372_0FAEF8A3348528F0"/>
men think of being better, and of amending their ways, and doing their ſouls good, theſe are very good thoughts in themſelves. When ſuch thoughts are begotten in any men's hearts, I would have them to aſcribe them to the grace of God, and nothing elſe. Preachers may do much where theſe deſires are begotten; but it is not in their power to beget theſe deſires.</p>
            <p>Many have come to a meeting with looſe, prophane and wandering minds; and though many good things have been ſpoken to them, it hath not reached ſo far as to beget good deſires, their hearts have been ſo alienated from the grace of God in themſelves, which is the great ſuperior worker, to which we are but ſervants and miniſters; there is none can beget any thing, but he in whom all power is. They that are under the power of darkneſs, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil begets in them wantonneſs and vanity, prophaneneſs and hardneſs of heart. Some go away from a meeting without being touched and perſuaded, and they have no good hope of being better: But where people are really touched in their ſpirits, with a deſire after ſomething that will do them good, they muſt come to the fountain of good, the God that made them, and they muſt think upon him; if they cannot <hi>ſee his glory, and hear his voice,</hi> yet they can think upon him. This is the leaſt duty of a Chriſtian, to <hi>think upon the name of the Lord,</hi> when their minds are exerciſed about divine matters, about the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their poor ſouls. If I die this night, what will become of me? This and that ſin I have committed; how ſhall I be able to anſwer to God for one of a thouſand of all my looſe thoughts, words and actions? They that come to a conſideration of this, and a due ſenſe of their ſtate and condition, though it is ſuch a ſtate that they do not like; though it is not ſuch as it ought to be, yet notwithſtanding it may be better; they may be brought out of it into a better condition.</p>
            <p>Now this is the duty of all, to wait upon God, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all good, that they may receive ſomething from God, for <hi>every good and perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights,</hi> the Father of thy light and my light, that light comes to us from the Father of lights: If
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:020309_0373_0FAEF8A430313820"/>
we have any perfect gift beſtowed upon us, it is beſtowed by God; therefore you will grant that we are all obliged, from the greateſt to the leaſt, to wait upon him, if we have the leaſt expectation from God, by meeting, otherwiſe we had better keep away.</p>
            <p>But I am apt to judge that the moſt here are come with ſome deſire, that if it pleaſe God they may receive benefit by their meeting: Where ſhall they have it? They ſay, if ſuch a man preacheth, then I can edify much by him: This is a great miſtake; for, let who will preach, there is nobody can receive any benefit, but it muſt be from the Lord, as the fountain of good; for the beſt preachers in the world are but inſtruments in the hands of God; if God doth not bleſs his labours, the preacher can do nothing to the ſouls of people; he can ſound the truth in their ears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but he can reach no further, God only ſpeaks to the heart. If thou mind the preacher and not God that made thee, all his preaching will do thee no good; it may indeed help thee to a notion or ſpeculation, but that comes not to the inſide, that will be no better, the inſide wants mending.</p>
            <p>There are great deformities, ſcars, ſpots, ſtains, wounds and lameneſs upon the ſouls of men, by reaſon of their ſins, luſts and corruptions; and there wants a remedy, and there is no phyſician of value but God that made us after his own image. The devil hath brought in deformity, he hath made one proud, another cruel, another wanton, another an oppreſſor, another malicious; this is all the devil's work: <hi>And for this end Chriſt Jeſus came into the world, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> He came to deſtroy pride, malice and luſt; theſe are the devil's works, that Chriſt came to deſtroy: Why doth he not do it? He will deſtroy all the devil hath wrought in every man that will be ſubject to him: Can a chirurgeon ſet a bone, if the patient be not ſubject to his hand?</p>
            <p>But this is far beyond all compariſon; Chriſt hath <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all power in Heaven and Earth,</hi> yet he always looks for a willing people; he ſends the day of his power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a people, and he worketh upon their hearts by an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible power; he makes them willing to be helped, and
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:020309_0374_0FAEF8A4553D06E8"/>
and healed, and cured, and then he cures them. I dare ſay, there is not one here that is willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and to ſubmit to Chriſt to be ſaved and redeemed by him, but he will do it; <hi>he that is willing and obedient, ſhall eat of the good of the land,</hi> and ſhall know the good of redemption. See whether it be come to a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; here is univerſal grace offered; for the <hi>light of Chriſt Jeſus enlighteneth every one of you;</hi> it ſhews you your loſt ſtate and condition: When we ſee our condition bad, that it is not as it ought to be, who would not have it better?</p>
            <p>What means prayer, that Chriſtian duty? What ſhall we pray for? Muſt not people be ſenſible in themſelves what they ſhould pray for, before they come to pray? And what is it that will make them ſenſible but the light and grace of God? They ſee their own wants when God worketh faith in their hearts, and they believe that God can ſupply thoſe wants. Why ſhould I go to a beggar, to pray him to give me an hundred pounds? I believe he cannot do it, therefore I will not pray to him for it: Now neceſſity brings people to prayer, but there muſt be faith in him to whom we pray, that he is able to ſupply our wants, and relieve our neceſſities. Upon this account the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> He muſt firſt know that there is a God to come unto, and then that he is a rewarder.</p>
            <p>Here is the foundation of all true religion and true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; they that go to God and ſay their prayers, and join with others in ſaying their prayers, if they have no ſenſe of God, they had as good hold their tongues, for their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to no purpoſe: They that pretend to believe in God, without an experimental power of God working upon their hearts, their belief is not worth a ſtraw; without their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the power of God, all their belief is nothing; but if they know that God hath ſuch an operation upon them, that no man or woman in the world can diſcover that to them, that God diſcovereth, then they know that God is <hi>the ſearcher of hearts and the trier of the reins,</hi> Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, xvii. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="unknown:020309_0375_0FAEF8A514F74B58"/>Suppoſe I know that there is a God, and at the ſame time I believe that he will never hear me; that I am a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate creature, and that he hath caſt me off forever, and that he hath ſealed condemnation upon me, to all eternity. What reaſon hath ſuch a one to pray? This is a deſperate condition. But while we believe there is a God, and that <hi>he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> it is not in vain to pray; yet there is ſomething antecedent too to prayer; there is knowledge, and faith by reaſon of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that God is a rewarder: He that hath this, let him pray in God's name. But what muſt he pray for? He muſt <hi>not offer the ſacrifice of fools;</hi> he muſt have regard to his lips; if it be mental prayer, he muſt pray for that he ſtands in need of; it is for ſomething he prays, that God hath revealed by his Holy Spirit; this he ſtands in need of; it is ſomething that he needs; it is power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come corruption, and power overcome temptation, that he ſtands in need of; he ſtands in need of a Mediator to procure for him the pardon of his ſins: Theſe things he ſtands in need of, then let him pray; <hi>he that is afflicted, let him pray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if a man or woman go to prayer, they muſt pray to God, in the belief of his goodneſs and mercy, that he will beſtow ſome bleſſing upon them, that may be for the better, that may be for their good. When they come to a meeting, to worſhip God, and hear the word ſpoken outwardly, they muſt pray for ſomething that may be for their good; Lord give me ſomething that may ſupport my ſoul, and ſomething that may enable me to withſtand temptation. People ſhould have their minds thus exerciſed, and they ſhould think upon the name of the Lord according to their particular neceſſity; they ſhould pour out their ſupplication to the Lord: This is ſuch worſhip as God looks for, and ſuch as he is pleaſed with; he will deliver thoſe that thus pray to him out of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that they ſhall not prevail over them: One man's temptation is of one ſort, and another's of another ſort; but they are all delivered by the grace of God, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over them, upon their prayer to God; for they find by experience that <hi>he is a God hearing prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="unknown:020309_0376_0FAEF8A5D6375120"/>Now, when we have prayed, what is the next work? It is to wait for an anſwer of our prayer. I prayed the other day to God for power to withſtand ſuch a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when that temptation comes again I do expect that God will anſwer my prayer. Doſt thou ſo? Then I pray thee have an eye to the ſame grace of God that convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, and ſhewed thee the temptation; and have thy faith exerciſed upon that grace of God, and thou wilt find it ſufficient for thee, I will warrant thee: Let the devil come with a temptation ever ſo ſuitable and ſubtil, keep thine eye upon the grace of God, and it will deliver thee. This was the caſe of <hi>Paul; when a meſſenger of ſatan was ſent to buffet him, he beſought the Lord thrice:</hi> The temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation did attend him, and God gave him an anſwer of his prayer; <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, let the devil come with ever ſo much power he ſhall never overcome thee.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak to thoſe that are well skilled in this kind of work, and have met with ſharp temptations, and ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they have been overcome by them, and at other times they have withſtood them: What is the difference; why, one while they are looſe and careleſs, and did not pray for the aſſiſtance of divine grace; another while they kept cloſe to it, and were delivered.</p>
            <p>Therefore when you come to meeting, with a deſire to receive benefit from God, with your expectations God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to receive comfort from the hands of the Lord, let your eye be upon him, and the working of his grace in your own hearts, and hearken to that voice that is within you, and it will be more effectual than mine. If you find the work of grace in you to be the ſame thing that I ſpeak of, then believe me for the truth's-ſake; believe me becauſe you find the ſame work and teſtimony within your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And I am perſuaded there is no one here, but ſometime or other have withſtood that temptation which they have met withal. Pray tell me how they did it? Why, the temptation came unto me, and it pleaſed God to ſhew me the evil of it, that it was a bad thing if I yielded to it. How didſt thou reſiſt it? had not the devil a coercive power over thee, to force thee to it, whether
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:020309_0377_0FAEF8A698DD8A20"/>
thou wouldeſt or not? That God that ſhewed me the evil of it, delivered me from the evil; I was not judged and condemned in myſelf, becauſe I found myſelf delivered from it; there are none of you, if you would not be lazy and idle, but you might be delivered every day, and have experience in your own ſouls, that when the devil comes and tempts, the Lord is at hand to deliver you by his grace and power.</p>
            <p>So that the only way for people to be preſerved from ſin and iniquity, is to have a reverent reſpect to that grace of God which they have already received. I would have that vain conceit, that hath long reigned in the world, taken out of your head. When you ſee a wicked husband, wife, or child, you ſay, if they had grace they would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I ſay they have ſome degree of grace already; God hath ſent forth his grace and truth, to <hi>teach men to deny ungodlineſs,</hi> ſo that I would not pray that God would give my husband, wife, or child, or friend grace, but that he would break their hard hearts, that they may ſubmit to the grace of God that is already beſtowed upon them. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is not a perſon here that is utterly void of all grace; but they walk not according to it, they trample upon it: For every one being endued with a meaſure of grace, through Chriſt, our duty therefore is to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential regard to the grace of God, that we have received.</p>
            <p>What grace have I received from God, may ſome ſay? I have received ſo much grace from God (thou mayeſt truly ſay) that I can tell when the devil brings a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me; when he tempts me to uncleanneſs, theft, wrath, malice, or to deceive my neighbour, I have ſo much grace that I can tell I am tempted in ſuch a reſpect; the grace of God ſhews me this is a temptation of the devil: But the queſtion is, whether I am ſubject to the grace of God, and love his grace better than the profit or pleaſure of a temptation? It comes as a bait, but the devil cannot make me do that which he tempts me to; it is not in the power of all the devils in hell, or of his ſervants on earth, to make me do this evil thing: The light of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhews it to be a temptation. Now I am free and at my choice, whether I will love the profit and pleaſure
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:020309_0378_0FAEF8A823C12AF0"/>
that comes with the temptation more than the grace of God: I believe there is no one that hath been tried by a temptation, but they can ſay ſo: I leave it to him <hi>that ſearches and tries all your hearts, and knows your thoughts,</hi> to judge whether you joined with the temptation, that you might have the profit and pleaſure of it, or joined with his grace, that thereby you might have reſiſted the temptation: You that have done the one and the other, tell me which is the beſt bargain; when you have joined with the temptation, that you might have the profit and pleaſure that came along with it; or when you joined with the grace of God, that ſhewed you the evil and danger of the temptation. The ſame God ſpeaks to you that ſpake to <hi>Cain, if thou doeſt well, ſhalt not thou be accepted? and if thou doſt not well, ſin lies at the door.</hi> If thou haſt yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a temptation, <hi>ſin lies at the door,</hi> there is a breach made between God and thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>The ſame man at another time, having ſmarted ſo deeply for it, being judged by his own conſcience, when he meets the temptation again, he ſaith, let the profit or pleaſure go where it will, if I yield to this temptation I cannot go to God but as a criminal to a judge; let the profit or pleaſure be what it will, I will not join with this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Can the devil force thee to comply with this temptation? No, if thou be true to the grace of God in thy own heart, it will make thee able to reſiſt the ſtrongeſt devil in hell. Chriſt hath purchaſed for the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men a power to withſtand the devil's power, and all his devices and temptations, and you ſhall obtain vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and have dominion over them. If you have a mind to grow in this dominion, when the devil comes to tempt you, reſiſt him, and you ſhall, through the power of Chriſt, be enabled to overcome.</p>
            <p>If ſatan tell thee of the profits and pleaſures of this world, remember <hi>that the world paſſeth away, and the luſt of it,</hi> but peace with God endures forever: By the grace of God you will be able to overcome the devil and all his angels. This power is given to all that believe and obey the goſpel: If you would have benefit by it, you muſt be exerciſed in reſiſting of temptation, and have regard to the
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:020309_0379_0FAEF8A92D9AD1E8"/>
grace of God, and the workings of it in your own hearts; and then you will be able to ſay, when a temptation comes, promiſing profit and pleaſure, <hi>how can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Turn your eye to God's <hi>favour, which is better than life, and you will be more than conquerors;</hi> you will ſay the fear of God ſeized upon my ſoul, and the grace of God came to my aſſiſtance, and was as a bulwark againſt temptation. Here praiſes will go up to God; here will be occaſion for thee to ſpeak good of his name. Remember what <hi>David</hi> ſaid; <hi>my ſoul, praiſe the Lord, that hath delivered me from the horrible pit.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> and the ſaints of old praiſed God in their day, and why ſhould not we? They breathed forth living praiſes and thankſgivings for the deliverances wrought for them; and ſhall not we do it?</p>
            <p>Now this cannot be done without thinking upon his name, the name of that God that made us: Here I live in the world, I live and breathe ſtill, I have health, and ſtrength, and an eſtate, how came I by all this? Did I make myſelf? No, there is a God that gave me life, and breath, and being; he holds forth the hand of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to gather me to himſelf, and to <hi>redeem me from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, that I might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs, all the days of my life:</hi> If I believe this, I ſhall rejoice in him, and love and praiſe him, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait upon him for the accompliſhment of his work. <hi>He deſireth not the death of ſinners:</hi> If you believe the Almighty, <hi>it is impoſſible for him to lie, all things are poſſible</hi> to him except that; he ſaith, he <hi>would not the death of him that dies:</hi> What would he have then? He would have you <hi>turn and live:</hi> What means doth he uſe? What I would have done I would uſe means to accompliſh it. You would ſay, what means hath he not uſed? What is it that God doth more wiſh for than that men would repent, <hi>return and live,</hi> and be happy forever? He hath created them, and given them life and breath, and continued his grace to them, that they might have time to prepare for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and he hath given his good ſpirit to inſtruct them, <hi>but they have rebelled againſt him.</hi> He hath ſent forth his word, the goſpel of ſalvation, which hath been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:020309_0380_0FAEF8A9948111B8"/>
to them; and <hi>he hath waited to be gracious, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed much patience and long-ſuffering</hi> towards them; ſo that I may ſay, what means hath he omitted? <hi>He hath planted them as a vineyard, in a very fruitful hill; and he hath fenced it, and gathered out the ſtones thereof, and planted it with the choiceſt vine, and built a tower in the midſt of it, and made a wine-preſs therein, and he looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, and it brought wild grapes. Judge, I pray you ſaith the Lord, between me and my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard: What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all your unfruitfulneſs, the day of your viſitation is continued, the Lord is willing to ſhew mercy to your ſouls. This is all the Lord your God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of you, that you would think upon his name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him and truſt in him, and wait upon him for the operations of his grace in the uſe of his ordinances, and your attendance upon them, and hearkening to his voice, and obeying it, and ſo <hi>to hear that your ſouls may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will affirm, that there is none of you here preſent, whether you be Quakers or no, but you may meet with The divine operations of the power of God in your own hearts, if you will regard it, and when you meet with theſe operations and regard them not, I cannot help it; if you will reſiſt the good things of the Spirit of God, I cannot help it; if you will be of that mind, <hi>always to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt; if as your fathers did ſo do ye,</hi> then you muſt all periſh, both you and your fathers; there is no eſcaping but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to Chriſt Jeſus, and his quickening Spirit; if there be any divine operations that you meet with in your own hearts, let me perſuade you to ſubmit and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them; for I know the devil is near at hand; and when people meet with divine operations in their ſouls, that humble them and bring down their pride, and convince them of the danger of their condition, he lies in the way and ſuggeſts ſome poiſonous thing that takes off the edge of theſe operations, that, they may diſlike them: It is true, they meet with the convictions of ſin; but they reckon they have that faith and belief in Chriſt, that doth in the ſight of God obliterate all their ſins that can be laid to
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:020309_0381_0FAEF8AA60455E28"/>
their charge, both paſt and to come. If I would look, ſay they, to the divine operation, or any thing wrought in me, it were enough to make me mad; I look wholly to the merits of Chriſt; my mind is wholly fixed upon him who is <hi>the author of eternal ſalvation;</hi> his meritorious ſufferings and obedience can obliterate and blot out all my ſins.</p>
            <p>My friends, I tell you, many a poor ſoul hath ſplit upon this rock by undervaluing the divine operations of the Spirit upon their hearts; they make a falſe and wrong applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the merits of Chriſt, which indeed are ſo great that nobody can overvalue them; but we muſt not make a falſe application of them, <hi>for this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil;</hi> he takes away the guilt of ſin, not that you might live in it ſtill: Whoſoever believeth in Chriſt, ſhall have power over their ſins and not be under the dominion and power of ſin; <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but under grace. But God be thanked, you were the ſervants of ſin; tho' you have obeyed from the heart, the form of doctrine which was delivered you: Being then made free from ſin, ye became the ſervants of righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. vi, 14, 18.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt ſay, I am guilty of a great deal of ſin already, what ſhall become of me for the guilt I have contracted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we confeſs and forſake our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us from all ſin;</hi> 1 John, ix, 9. Here is a true appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſt, his merits and righteouſneſs; when there is a confeſſing of ſin to God, and a forſaking of it, here is an offering and a ſacrifice made to God by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the expiation of ſin; he hath by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood purchaſed the pardon of all my ſins, <hi>that he might preſent me to God without ſpot or blemiſh;</hi> here is a true application of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; but how can I apply it to myſelf while I live in ſin?</p>
            <p>Here God's witneſs in the conſcience of a ſinner pleads againſt the ſinner; when he endeavours to believe that his guilt is taken away, and all his ſins, paſt, preſent and to come, are pardoned, while he continues to live in ſin, and ſin hath yet dominion over him.</p>

               <p>MOST glorious Lord God! wonderful is thy great power over all, which thou haſt revealed and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in this thy bleſſed day. Thy arm, O thou Almighty God! is ſtretched forth; thou haſt touched a remnant with a ſenſe of thy divine love, whom thou haſt gathered unto thy name; thou haſt revealed thy great ſalvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou haſt made glad the ſouls of thy children; thou haſt endeared thyſelf unto us by the diſcovery and manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thy abounding love, who didſt love us, when we were ſtrangers, and didſt preſerve us when we were enemies, and brought a glorious day of viſitation upon us, and opened our eyes to behold the light thereof, ſo that we were a people engaged to ſpeak good of thy name. Thou haſt declared and manifeſted to the ſons and daughters of men thy good will, and thy univerſal grace that thou art daily extending to them, that all may be made partakers of the riches of thy houſe, and of thy great ſalvation which by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt thou haſt ordained.</p>
               <p>And, O thou powerful God of Life: ſince the day that thou firſt gathered us, thou haſt been with us, thou haſt been our guide, and our eyes have been towards thee for inſtruction, thou haſt taught us and led us in the way in which thou wouldeſt have us to walk; thou haſt led us, O Lord, in the way everlaſting with the poor, the humble and the meek of the earth; and thou haſt placed our feet, O Lord, near the everlaſting mountain, which thou haſt exalted upon the high kills of the earth, and thou haſt revealed the glory and the ſplendor of thy houſe, thy holy dwelling place, and haſt raiſed breathings in the hearts of thy people, that they may dwell in thy courts forever: And now, Holy Father! thou haſt gathered a remnant, and brought a peculiar people to truſt in thy name; but ſtill we do all that we do by thee; thou muſt be our keeper, thou muſt be our preſerver, therefore we wait upon thee; we expect all from thy hand, therefore our applications are unto thee, that from day to day, and from time to time, we may find thy living preſence in the midſt of us.</p>

               <p>O Lord! let the mighty operation of thy power bow down all ſtout and ſtubborn ones, that have rebelled againſt thee, and that have withſtood the tenders of thy grace, and the motions and ſtrivings of thy Holy Spirit: Thou art able to bow them, and to break their ſtony hearts; thou art able to ſpeak effectually to their ſouls, and to make them ſubmit themſelves to thee.</p>
               <p>Holy and living Father! let the progreſs of thy word and goſpel be great in our day; let it have a free courſe and ſpread itſelf mightily to thoſe that believe not, to beget a feed of faith in their ſouls, that they may believe in thy name, and truſt in thy power, and wait to ſee the great work of redemption wrought for the ſalvation of their immortal ſouls, before the day of their viſitation goes over.</p>
               <p>Powerful God of Life! thy little remnant which thou haſt redeemed, keep them by thy power, and preſerve them in uprightneſs and cleanneſs of mind; preſerve them in the places and ſtations wherein thou haſt appointed them to dwell, that ſo in all the trials, and tribulations, and diſtreſſes, that may come upon them, they may be quiet and ſtill, and in patience poſſeſs their ſouls; and let them have ſtrong conſolation in that everlaſting covenant which in thy Son thou haſt made with them, and revealed to them; and let them not he moved and toſſed with the hurries of this world, with the tumults and diſorders that evil men make in it, and the ſtorms and the tempeſts that are raiſed; but let their hearts and minds be ſtayed upon thee, that they may know how to behave themſelves towards thee and one another, and towards all that are without, and thereby glorify and magnify thy great name by the beauty of holineſs ſhining in their converſations, which may reach the conſciences of

men, that all that ſee them may ſay, theſe are the plants that the right hand of God hath planted, and ſee the fruits that are brought forth from that root of life revealed in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Powerful God of Life! carry on thine own work in this city and the whole nation, and in other places among the people which thou haſt choſen and gathered to thyſelf out of the world.</p>
               <p>Powerful God of Life! remember thoſe that groan in ſecret, making their moan to thee, that they cannot lay hold of thy ſalvation for their ſouls: Prepare them for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation that their ſouls are breathing after: They are night and day wreſtling with thee by earneſt prayer, but what will all their wreſtling ſignify, except thy word and the power of thy grace aſſiſt them, and teach them to lay hold of thy ſtrength, that they may fight the good fight of faith, that they may get the victory, and rejoice in thy ſalvation, and ſee the glory of it? Thou ſeeſt how the children of men are working and contriving divers ways for their own ſalvation; make them to know that all their own ways and inventions are in vain.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed God of Life! confound the devices of the ungodly that ſeek to lay waſte thy heritage; and all thoſe that thou haſt gathered by thy word, do thou preſerve them, that they may ſerve thee with ſincere and upright minds all the days of their lives; and offer up daily thankſgivings and living praiſes to thee, the true and living God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent, through thy eternal Spirit, who alone art worthy, God over all, bleſſed forever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
