            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE OF THE EDITORS.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>following piece was intended to convey to the late meeting of</hi> DELEGATES <hi>the sentiments of one of their body, whose personal attendance was prevented by an accidental illness. In it the sources of our present unhappy differences are traced with such faithful accuracy, and the opinions entertained by every free American expressed with such a manly firmness, that it must be pleasing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and may be useful to future ages. It will evince to the world the moderation of our late convention, who have only touched with tenderness many of the claims insisted on in this pamphlet, though every heart acknowledged their justice. Without the knowledge of the author, we have ventured to communicate his sentiments to the public, who have certainly a right to know what the best and wisest of their members have thought on a subject in which they are so deeply interested.</hi>

            <head>A SUMMARY VIEW, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>RESOLVED, that it be an instruction to the said deputies, when assembled in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress with the deputies from the other states of British America, to propose to the said congress that an humble and dutiful address be presented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, begging leave to lay before him, as Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate of the British empire, the united complaints of his Majesty's subjects in America; complaints which are excited by many unwarrantable encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and usurpations, attempted to be made by the Legislature of one part of the empire, upon those rights which God and the laws have given equally and independently to all. To represent to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty that these his states have often individually made humble application to his imperial throne to obtain, through its intervention, some redress of their injured rights, to none of which was ever even an answer condescended; humbly to hope that this their joint address, penned in the language of truth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested of those expressions of servility which would persuade his Majesty that we are asking favours, and not rights, shall obtain from his Majesty a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful acceptance. And this his Majesty will think we have reason to expect when he reflects that he is no more than the chief officer of the people, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the laws, and circumscribed with definitive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to assist in working the great machine of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, erected for their use, and consequently subject to their superintendance. And in order that these our rights, as well as the invasions of them, may be laid more fully before his Majesty, to take a view of them from the origin and first settlement of these countries.</p>
            <p>To remind him that our ancestors, before their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration to America, were the free inhabitants of the British dominions in Europe, and possessed a right which nature has given to all men, of departing from the country in which chance, not choice, has placed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013351_0005_0F90F2E974B10380"/>
them, of going in quest of new habitations, and of there establishing new societies, under such laws and regulations as to them shall seem most likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote public happiness. That their Saxon ancestors had under this universal law, in like manner left their native wilds and woods in the north of Europe, had possessed themselves of the island of Britain, then less charged with inhabitants, and had established there that system of laws which has so long been the glory and protection of that country. Nor was ever any claim of superiority or dependence asserted over them by that mother country from which they had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated; and were such a claim made, it is believed that his Majesty's subjects in Great-Britain have too firm a feeling of the rights derived to them from their ancestors, to bow down the sovereignty of their state before such visionary pretensions. And it is thought that no circumstance has occurred to distinguish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially the British from the Saxon emigration. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was conquered, and her settlements made, and firmly established, at the expence of individuals, and not of the British public. Their own blood was spilt in acquiring lands for their settlement, their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes expended in making that settlement effectual; for themselves they fought, for themselves they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and for themselves alone they have right to hold. Not a shilling was ever issued from the public treasures of his Majesty, or his ancestors, for their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, till of very late times, after the colonies had become established on a firm and permanent footing. That then, indeed, having become valuable to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain for her commercial purposes, his Parliament was pleased to lend them assistance against an enemy, who would fain have drawn to herself the benefits of their commerce, to the great aggrandizment of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and danger of Great-Britain. Such assistance, and in such circumstances, they had often before given to Portugal, and other allied states, with whom they carry on a commercial intercourse; yet these states never supposed, that by calling in her aid, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013351_0006_0F90F2E9CB651D40"/>
submitted themselves to her sovereignty. Had such terms been proposed, they would have rejected them with disdain, and trusted for better to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their enemies, or to a vigorous exertion of their own force. We do not, however, mean to under-rate those aids, which to us were doubtless va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, on whatever principles granted; but we would shew that they cannot give a title to that authority which the British Parliament would arrogate over us, and that they may amply to repaid by our giving to the inhabitants of Great-Britain such exclusive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in trade as may be advantageous to them, and at the same time not too restrictive to ourselves. That settlements having been thus effected in the wilds of America, the emigrants thought proper to adopt that system of laws under which they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto lived in the mother country, and to continue their union with her by submitting themselves to the same common Sovereign, who was thereby made the central link connecting the several parts of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire thus newly multiplied.</p>
            <p>But that not long were they permitted, however far they thought themselves removed from the hand of oppression, to hold undisturbed the rights thus acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the hazard of their lives, and loss of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. A family of princes was then on the British throne, whose treasonable crimes against their people brought on them afterwards the exertion of those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and sovereign rights of punishment reserved in the hands of the people for cases of extreme necessity, and judged by the constitution unsafe to be delegated to any other judicature. While every day brought forth some new and unjustifiable exertion of power over their subjects on that side the water, it was not to be expected that those here, much less able at that time to oppose the designs of despotism, should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from injury.</p>
            <p>Accordingly that country, which had been acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by lives, the labours, and the fortunes of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual adventurers, was by these princes, at several
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013351_0007_0F90F2EA762651E8"/>
times, parted out and distributed among the favourites and <note n="*" place="bottom">1632 <hi>Maryland was granted to Lord Baltimore, 14, c. 2. Pennsylvania to Penn, and the province of Carolina was in the year 1663 granted by letters patent of majesty, king Charles II. in the 15th year of his reign, in propriety, unto the right honorable Edward earl of Clarendon, George duke of Albemarle, William earl of Craven, John lord Berkeley, Anthony lord Ashley, sir George Carteret, Sir John Coleton, knight and barronet, and sir William Berkeley, knight; by which letters patent the laws of England were to be in force in Carolina: But the lords proprietors had power,</hi> with the consent of the inhabitants, <hi>to make bye-laws for the better government of the said province; so that no money could he received, or law made, without the consent of the inhabitants, or their representatives.</hi>
               </note> followers of their fortunes, and, by an assumed right of the crown alone, were erected into distinct and independent governments; a measure which it is believed his Majesty's prudence and understanding would prevent him from imitating at this day, as no exercise of such a power, of dividing and dismember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a country, has ever occurred in his Majesty's realm of England, though now of very ancient standing; nor could it be justified or acquiesced under there, or in any other part of his Majesty's empire.</p>
            <p>That the exercise of a free trade with all parts of the world, possessed by the American colonists, as of natural right, and which no law of their own had taken away or abridged, was next the object of unjust encroachment. Some of the colonies having thought proper to continue the administration of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the name and under the authority of his Majesty King Charles the First, whom notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his late deposition by the commonwealth of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, they continued in the sovereignty of their state; the Parliament for the commonwealth took the same in high offence, and assumed upon themselves the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of prohibiting their trade will all other parts of the world, except the island of Great-Britain. This arbitrary act, however, they soon recalled, and by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013351_0008_0F90F2EBE51B0600"/>
solemn treaty, entered into on the 12th day of March, 1651, between the said common wealth by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, and the colony of Virginia by their house of burgesses, it was expressly stipulated, by the 8th article of the said treaty, that they should have "free trade as the people of England do enjoy to all places and with all nations, according to the laws of that common wealth." But that, upon the restoration of his majesty king Charles the second, their rights of free commerce fell once more a victim to arbitrary power; and by several acts <note n="*" place="bottom">12. c. 2. c. 18. 15. c. 2. c. 11. 25. c. 2. c. 7. 7. 8. W. M. c. 22. 11. W. 3. 4. Anne. 6. G. 2. c. 13.</note> of his reign, as well as of some of his successors, the trade of the colonies was laid under such restrictions, as shew what hopes they might form from the justice of a British parliament, were its uncontrouled power admitted over these states. History has informed us that bodies of men, as well as individuals, are susceptible of the spirit of tyranny. A view of these acts of parliament for regulation, as it has been affectedly called, of the American trade, if all other evidence were removed out of the case, would undeniably evince the truth of this observation. Besides the duties they impose on our article of export and import, they prohibit our going to any markets northward of cape Finisterre, in the kingdom of Spain, for the sale of commodities which Great Britain will not take from us, and for the purchase of others, with which she cannot supply us, and that for no other than the arbitrary purposes of purchasing for themselves, by a sacrifice of our rights and interests, certain privileges in their commerce with an allied state, who in confidence that their exclusive trade with America will be continued, while the principles and power of the British parliament be the same, have indulged themselves in every exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which their avarice could dictate, or our ne<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

               </gap> in America, to the double and treble of what they sold for before such exclusive privileges were given them, and of what better commodities of the same kind would cost us elsewhere, and at the same time give us much less for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013351_0009_0F90F2EC0871F8D8"/>
what we carry thither than might be had at more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ports. That these acts prohibit us from carrying in quest of other purchasers the surplus of our tobaccoes remaining after the consumption of Great Britain is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; so that we must leave them with the British mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant for whatever he will please to allow us, to be by him reshipped to foreign markets, where he will reap the benefits of making sale of them for full value. That to heighten still the idea of parliamentary justice, and to shew with what moderation they are like to exercise power, where themselves are to feel no part of its weight, we take leave to mention to his majesty's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other acts of British parliament, by which they would prohibit us from manufacturing for our own use the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles we raise on our own lands with our own labour. By an act <note n="*" place="bottom">5. G. 2.</note> passed in the 5th year of the reign of his late majesty king George the second, an American subject is forbidden to make a hat for himself of the fur which he has taken perhaps on his own soil, an instance of despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism to which no parrallel can be produced in the most arbitrary ages of British history. By one other act <note n="†" place="bottom">23. G. 2. c. 29.</note> passed in the 23d year of the same reign, the iron which we make we are forbidden to manufacture, and heavy as that article is, and necessary in every branch of husbandry, besides commission and insurance, we are to pay freight for it to Great Britain, and freight for it back again, for the purpose of supporting not men, but machines, in the island of Great Britain. In the same spirit of equal and impartial legislation is to be viewed the act of parliament <note n="†" place="bottom">5. G. 270.</note> passed in the 5th year of the same reign, by which Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican lands are made subject to the demands of British creditors, while their own lands were still continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable for their debts; from which one of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions must necessarily follow, either that justice is not the same in America as in Britain, or else that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish parliament pay less regard to it here than there. But that we do not point out to his majesty the injustice of these acts, with intent to rest on that principle the cause of their nullity; but to shew that experience confirms the propriety of those political principles which exempt us from the jurisdiction of the British parliament. The
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013351_0010_0F90F2ECC3475EE8"/>
true ground on which we declare these acts void is, that the British parliament has no right to exercise authority over us.</p>
            <p>That these exercises of usurped power have not been confined to instances alone, in which themselves were interested, but they have also intermeddled with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the internal affairs of the colonies. The act of the 9th of Anne for establishing a post office in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica seems to have had little connexion with British con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, except that of accommodating his majesty's ministers and favourites with the sale of a lucrative and easy office.</p>
            <p>That thus we have hastened through the reigns which preceded his majesty's, during which the violations of our right were less alarming, because repeated at more distant intervals than that rapid and bold succession of injuries which is likely to distinguish the present from all other periods of American story. Scarcely have our minds been able to emerge from the astonishment into which one stroke of parliamentary thunder has involved us, before another more heavy, and more alarming, is fallen on us. Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day; but a series of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions begun at a distinguished period, and pursued, unalterably through every change of ministers, too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove a deliberate and systematical plan of reducing us to slavery.</p>
            <p>That the act <note n="*" place="bottom">4. G. 3. c. 15.</note> passed in the 4th year of his majesty's reign, entitled "An act for granting certain duties in the British colonies and plantations in America, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>One other act <note n="†" place="bottom">5. G. 3. c. 12.,</note> passed in the 5th year of his reign, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled "An act for granting and applying certain stamp duties and other duties in the British colonies and planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in America, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>One other act <note n="†" place="bottom">6. G. 3. c. 12</note> passed in the 6th year of his reign, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled "An act for the better securing the dependency of his majesty's dominions in America upon the crown and parliament of Great Britain;" and one other act <note n="§" place="bottom">7. G. 3.,</note> passed in the 7th year of his reign, entitled "An act
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013351_0011_0F90F2ED75C8A570"/>
for granting duties on paper, tea, &amp;c." form that connected chain of parliamentary usurpation, which has already been the subject of frequent applications to his majesty, and the houses of lords and commons of Great Britain; and no answers having yet been condescended to any of these, we shall not trouble his majesty with a repetition of the matters they contained.</p>
            <p>But that one other act <note n="*" place="bottom">7. G. 3. c. 59.</note> passed in the same 7th year of the reign, having been a peculiar attempt, must ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire peculiar mention; it is entituled "An act for sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the legislature of New York." One free and independent legislature hereby takes upon itself to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the powers of another, free and independent as it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; thus exhibiting a phoenomenon unknown in nature, the creator and creature of its own power. Not only the principles of common sense, but the common feelings of human nature, must be surrendered up before his majesty's subjects here can be persuaded to believe that they hold their political existence at the will of a British parliament. Shall these governments be dissolved, their property an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, and their people reduced to a state of nature, at the imperious breath of a body of men, whom they never saw, in whom they never confided, and ever whom they have no powers of punishment or removal, let their crimes against the American public be ever so great? Can any one reason be assigned why 160,000 electors in the island of Great Britain should give law to four millions in the states of America, every individual of whom is equal to every individual of them, in virtue, in understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in bodily strength? Were this to be admitted, instead of being a free people, as we have hitherto sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and mean to continue ourselves, we should sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be found the slaves not of one but of 160,000 ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants distinguished too from all others by this singular circumstances, that they are removed from the reach of fear, the only restraining motive which may hold the hand of a tyrant.</p>
            <p>That by "an act <note n="†" place="bottom">14. G. 3.</note> to discontinue in such manner and for such time as are therein mentioned, the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and discharging, lading or shipping, of goods, wares, and merchandize, at the town and within the harbour of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013351_0012_0F90511486E964D8"/>
Boston, in the province of Massachusetts Bay, in North America," which was passed at the last session of British parliament; a large and populous town, whose trade was their sole subsistence, was deprived of that trade, and involved in utter ruin. Let us for a while suppose the question of right suspended, in order to examine this act on principles of justice: An act of parliament had been passed imposing duties on teas, to be paid in America; against which act the Americans had protested as inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative. The East India Company, who till that time had never sent a pound of tea to America on their own account, step forth on that occasion the assertors of parliamentary right, and send higher many ship loads of that obnoxious commodity. The masters of their several vessels, however, on their arrival in America, wisely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to admonition, and returned with their cargoes. In the province of New England alone the remonstrances of the people were disregarded, and a compliance, after being many days waited for, was flatly refused. Whether in this the master of the vessel was governed by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, or his instructions, let those who know say, There are extraordinary situations which require extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary interposition. An exasperated people, who feel that they possess power, are not easily restrained within limits strictly regular. A number of them assembled in the town of Boston, threw the tea into the ocean, and dispersed without doing any other act of violence. If in this they did wrong, they were known and were amenable to the laws of the land, against which it could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that they had ever, in any instance, been obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diverted from their regular course in favour of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular offenders. They should therefore not have been distrusted on this occasion. But that ill fated colony had formerly been bold in their enmities against the house of Stuart, and were now devoted to ruin by that unseen hand which governs the momentous affairs of this great empire. On the partial representations of a few worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less ministerial dependants, whose constant office it has been to keep that government embroiled, and who, by their treacheries, hope to obtain the dignity of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish knighthood, without calling for the party accused, without asking a proof, without attempting a distinction
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013351_0013_0F905115792A2BA8"/>
between the guilty and the innocent, the whole of that ancient and wealthy town is in a moment reduced from opulence to beggary. Men who had spent their lives in extending the British commerce, who had invested in that place the wealth their honest endeavours had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, found themselves and their families thrown at once on the world for subsistence by its charities. Not the hundredth part of the inhabitants of that town had been concerned in the act complained of, many of them were in Great Britain and in other parts beyond sea, yet all were involved in one indiseriminate ruin, by a new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive power unheard of till then, that of a British par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. A property, of the value of many millions of money, was sacrificed to revenge, not repay, the loss of a few thousands. This is administering justice with a heavy hand indeed! and when is this tempest to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested in its course? Two wharfs are to be opened again when his Majesty shall think proper. The residue, which lined the extensive shores of the bay of Boston, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever interdicted the exercise of commerce. This little exception seems to have been thrown in for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose than that of setting a precedent for investing his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with legislative powers. If the pulse of his people shall beat calmly under this experiment, another and another will be tried, till the measure of despotism be filled up. It would be an insult on common sense to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that this exception was made in order to restore its commerce to that great town. The trade which cannot be received at two wharfs alone must of necessity be transferred to some other place; to which it will soon be followed by that of the two wharfs. Considered in this light, it would be an insolent and cruel mockery at the annihilation of the town of Boston.</p>
            <p>By the act <note n="*" place="bottom">14. G. 3.</note> for the suppression of riots and tumults in the town of Boston, passed also in the last session of parliament, a murder committed there is, if the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor pleases, to be tried in a court of King's Bench, in the island of Great Britain, by a jury of Middlesex. The witnesses, too, on receipt of such a sum as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor shall think it reasonable for them to expend, are to enter into recognizance to appear at the trial. This is,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013351_0014_0F905119A6222178"/>
in other words, taxing them to the amount of their recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, and that amount may be whatever a governor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; for who does his majesty think can be prevailed on to cross the Atlantic for the sole purpose of bearing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to a fact? His expences are to be borne, indeed, as they shall be estimated by a governor; but who are to feed the wife and children whom he leaves behind, and who have had no other subsistence but his daily labour? Those epidemical disorders too, so terrible in a foreign climate, is the cure of them to be estimated among the articles of expence, and their danger to be warded off by the almighty power of parliament? And the wretched criminal, if he happen to have offended on the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can side, stripped of his privilege of trial by peers of his vicinage, removed from the place where alone full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could be obtained, without money, without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, without friends, without exculpatory proof, is tried before judges predetermined to condemn. The cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards who would suffer a countryman to be torn from the bowels of their society, in order to be thus offered a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to parliamentary tyranny, would merit that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting infamy now fixed on the authors of the act! A clause <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>12.G. 3. c. 24.</hi>
               </note> for a similar purpose had been introduced into an act passed in the twelfth year of his majesty's reign, entitled "An act for the better securing and preserving his majesty's dockyards, magazines, ships, ammunition and stores," against which, as meriting the same cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, the several colonies have already protested.</p>
            <p>That these are acts of power, assumed by a body of men, foreign to our constitutions, and unacknowledged by our laws, against which we do, on behalf of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of British America, enter this our solemn and determined protest; and we do earnestly entreat his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, as yet the only mediatory power between the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral states of the British empire, to recommend to his parliament of Great Britain the total revocation of these acts, which, however nugatory they be, may yet prove the cause of farther discontents and jealousies among us.</p>
            <p>That we next proceed to consider the conduct of his majesty, as holding the executive powers of the laws of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013351_0015_0F90511AB8716EB0"/>
these states, and mark out his deviations from the line of duty: By the constitution of Great Britain, as well as of the several American states, his majesty possesses the power of refusing to pass into a law any bill which has already passed the other two branches of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature. His majesty, however, and his ancestors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of the impropriety of opposing their single opinion to the united wisdom of two houses of parliament, while their proceedings were unbiassed by interested prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for several ages past have modestly declined the exercise of this power in that part of his empire called Great Britain. But by change of circumstances, other principles than those of justice simply have obtained an influence on their determinations; the addition of new states to the British empire has produced an addition of new, and sometimes opposite interests. It is now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the great office of his majesty, to resume the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his negative power, and to prevent the passage of laws by any one legislature of the empire, which might bear injuriously on the rights and interests of another. Yet this will not excuse the wanton exercise of this power which we have seen his Majesty practise on the laws of the American legislatures. For the most trifling reasons, and sometimes for no conceivable reason at all, his majesty has rejected laws of the most salutary tendency. The abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of domestic slavery is the great object of desire in those colonies, where it was unhappily introduced in their infant state. But previous to the enfranchisement of the slaves we have, it is necessary to exclude all further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations from Africa; yet our repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions, and by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition, have been hither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by his majesty's negative: Thus preferring the immediate advantages of a sew African corsairs to the lasting interests of the American states, and to the rights of human nature deeply wounded by this infamous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Nay, the single interposition of an interested indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual against a law was scarcely ever known to fail of success, though in the opposite scale were placed the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of a whole country. That this is so shameful an abuse of a power trusted with his majesty for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013351_0016_0F90F2EE49D2E098"/>
as if not reformed, would call for some legal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions.</p>
            <p>With equal inattention to the necessities of his people here has his majesty permitted our laws to lie neglected in England for years, neither confirming them by his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, not annulling them by his negative; so that such of them as have no suspending clause we hold on the most precarious of all tenures, his majesty's will, and such of them as suspend themselves till his majesty's assent be obtained, we have feared, might be called into existence at some future and distance period, when time and change of circumstances shall have rendered them destructive to his people here. And to render this grievance still more oppressive, his majesty by his instructions has laid his governors under such restrictions that they can pass no law of any moment unless it have such suspending clause; so that, however immediate may be the call for legislative interposition, the law cannot be executed till in has twice crossed the Atlantic, by which time the evil may have spent it whole force.</p>
            <p>But in what terms, reconcileable to majesty, and at the same time to truth, shall we speak of a late instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his majesty's governor of the colony of Virginia, by which he is forbidden to assent to any law for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of a county, unless the new county will consent to have no representative in assembly? That colony has as yet fixed no boundary to the westward. Their west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern counties, therefore, are of indefinite extent; some of them are actually seated many hundred miles from their eastern limits. Is it possible, then that his majesty can have bestowed a single thought on the situation of those people, who, in order to obtain justice for injuries, however great or small, must, by the laws of that colony, attend their country court, at such a distance, with all their witnesses, monthly, till their litigation be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined? Or does his majesty seriously wish, and publish it to the world, that his subjects should give up the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious right of representation, with all the benefits derived from that, and submit themselves the absolute slaves of his sovereign will? Or is it rather meant to confine the legislative body to their present numbers, that they may be the cheaper bargain whenever they shall become worth a purchase.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:013351_0017_0F90511B29509190"/>One of the articles of impeachment against Tresilian, and the other judges of Westminster-Hall, in the reign of Richard the second, for which they suffered death, as traitors to their country, was, that they had advised the king that be might dissolve his parliament at any time; and succeeding kings have adopted the opinion of these unjust judges. Since the establishment, however, of the British constitution, at the glorious revolution, on its free and antient principles, neither his majesty, not his ancestors, have exercised such a power of dissolution in the island of Great Britain; and when his majesty was petitioned, by the united voice of his people there, to dissolve the present parliament, who had become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to them, his ministers were heard to declare, in open parliament, that his majesty possessed no such power by the constitution. But how different their language and his practice here! To declare, as their duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, the known rights of their country, to oppose the usurpations of every foreign judicature, to disregard the imperious mandates of a minister or governor, have been the avowed causes of dissolving houses of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives in America. But if such powers be really vested in his majesty, can he suppose they are there placed to awe the members from such purposes as these? When the representative body have lost the confidence of their constituents, when they have notoriously made sale of their most valuable rights, when they have assumed to themselves powers which the people never put into their hands, then indeed their continuing in office becomes dangerous to the state, and calls for an exercise of the power of dissolution. Such being the causes for which the representative body should, and should not, be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, will it not appear strange to an unbiassed observer, that that of Great Britain was not dissolved, while those of the colonies have repeatedly incurred that sentence?</p>
            <p>But your majesty, or your governors, have carried this power beyond every limit known, or provided for, by the laws: After dissolving one house of representatives, they have refused to call another, so that for a great length of time, the legislature provided by the laws has been out of existence. From the nature of things, every society must at all times possess within itself the sovereign powers of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013351_0018_0F90511BEE9844B8"/>
legislation. The feelings of human nature revolt against the supposition of a state so situated as that it may not in any emergency provide against dangers which perhaps threaten immediate ruin. While those bodies are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence to whom the people have delegated the powers of legislation, they alone possess and may exercise those pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but when they are dissolved by the lopping off one or more of their branches, the power reverts to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who may exercise it to unlimited extent, either as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling together in person, sending deputies, or in any other way they may think proper. We forbear to trace consequences further; the dangers are conspicuous with which this practice is replete.</p>
            <p>That we shall at this time also take notice of an error in the nature of our land holdings, which crept in at a very early period of our settlement. The introduction of the seadal tenures into the kingdom of England, though an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, is well enough understood to set this matter in a proper light. In the earlier ages of the Saxon settlement feudal holdings were certainly altogether unknown; and very sew, if any, had been introduced at the time of the Norman conquest. Our Saxon ancestors hold their lands, as they did their personal property, in absolute dominion, disencumbered with any superior, answering nearly to the nature of those possessions which the sedualists term allodial. William, the Norman, first introduced that system generally. The lands which had belonged to those who fell in the battle of Hastings, and in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent insurrections of his reign, formed a considerable proportion of the lands of the whole kingdom. These he granted out, subject to feudal duties, as did he also those of a great number of his new subjects, who, by persuasions of threats, were induced to surrender them for that purpose. But still much was left in the hand of his Saxon subjects; held of no superior, and not subject to feudal conditions. These, therefore, by express law, enacted to render uniform the system of military defence, were made liable to the same military duties as if they had been feuds; and the Norman lawyers soon found means to saddle them also with all the other feudal bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. But still they had not been surrendered to the king, they were not derived from his grant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013351_0019_0F90511CA73B0B88"/>
they were not holden of him. A general principle, indeed, was introduced, that "all lands in England were held either mediately or immediately of the crown," but this was borrowed from those holdings, which were truly feudal, and only applied to others for the purposes of illustration. Feudal holdings were therefore but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions out of the Saxon laws of possession, under which all lands were held in absolute right. These, therefore, still form the basis, or ground-work, of the common law, to prevail wheresoever the exceptions have not taken place. America was not conquered by William the Norman, not its lands surrendered to him, or any of his successors. Possessions there are undoubtedly of the allodial nature. Our ancestors, however, who migrated hither, were farmers, not lawyers. The fictitious principle that all lands belong originally to the king, they were early persuaded to believe real; and accordingly took grants of their own lands from the crown. And while the crown continued to grant for small sums, and on reasonable rents, there was no inducement to arrest the error, and lay it open to public view. But his majesty has lately taken on him to advance the terms of purchase, and of holding to the double of what they were, by which means the acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of land being rendered difficult, the population of our country is likely to be checked. It is time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for us to lay this matter before his majesty, and to declare that he has no right to grant lands of himself. From the nature and purpose of civil institutions, all the lands within the limits which any particular society has circumscribed around itself are assumed by that society, and subject to their allotment only. This may be done by themselves assembled collectively, or by their legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to whom they may have delegated sovereign authority; and if they are allotted in neither of these ways, each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of the society may appropriate to himself such lands as he finds vacant, and occupancy will give him title.</p>
            <p>That in order to enforce the arbitrary measures before complained of, his majesty has from time to time sent among us large bodies of armed forces, not made up of the people here, nor raised by the authority of our laws: Did his majesty possess such a right as this, it might swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013351_0020_0F90511D698B8F20"/>
up all our other rights whenever he should think proper. But his majesty has no right to land a single armed man on our shores, and those whom he sends here are liable to our laws made for the suppression and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of riots, routs, and unlawful assemblies; or are hostile bodies, invading us in defiance of law. When in the course of the late war it became expedient that a body of Hanoverian troops should be brought over for the defence of Great Britain, his majesty's grandfather, our late sovereign, did not pretend to introduce them under any authority he possessed. Such a measure would have given just alarm to his subjects in Great Britain, whose liberties would not be safe if armed men of another country, and of another spirit, might be brought into the realm at any time without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of their legislature. He therefore applied to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who passed an act for the time they were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. In like manner is his majesty restrained in every part of the empire. He possesses, indeed, the executive power of the laws in every state, but they are the laws of the particular state which he is to administer within that state, and not those of any one within the limits of another. Every state must judge for itself the number of armed men which they may safely trust among them, of whom they are to consist, and under what restrictions they shall be laid.</p>
            <p>To render these proceedings still more criminal against our laws, instead of subjecting the military to the civil powers, his majesty has expressly made the civil subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the military. But can his majesty thus put down all law under his feet? Can he erect a power su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that which erected himself? He has done it indeed by force, but let him remember that force cannot give right.</p>
            <p>That these are our grievances, which we have thus laid before his majesty, with that freedom of language and sentiment which becomes a free people claiming their rights, as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate: Let those flatter who fear, it is not an American art. To give praise which is not due might be well from the venal, but would ill
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013351_0021_0F90511E36E0A138"/>
beseem those who are asserting the rights of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They know, and will therefore say, that kings are the servants, not the proprietors of the people. Open your breast, fire, to liberal and expanded thought. Let not the name of George the third be a blot in the page of history. you are surrounded by British counsellors, but remember that they are parties. You have no minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for American affairs, because you have none taken from among us, nor amenable to the laws on which they are to give you advice. It behoves you, therefore, to think and to act for yourself and your people. The great principles of right and wrong are legible to every read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; to pursue them requires not the aid of many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors. The whole art of government consists in the art of being honest. Only aim to do your duty, and mankind will give you credit where you fail. No longer persevere in sacrificing the rights of one part of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the inordinate desires of another; but deal out to all equal and impartial right. Let no act be passed by any one legislature which may infringe on the rights and liberties of another. This is the important post in which fortune has placed you, holding the balance of a great, if a well poised empire. This, fire, is the advice of your great American council, on the observance of which may perhaps depend your felicity and future same, and the preservation of that harmony which alone can continue both to Great Britain and America the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal advantages of their connection. It is neither our wish nor our interest to separate from her. We are willing, on our part, to sacrifice every thing which reason can ask to the restoration of that tranquillity for which all must with. On their part, let them be ready to establish union and a generous plan. Let them name their terms, but let them be just. Accept of every commercial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it is in our power to give for such things as we can raise for their use, or they make for ours. But let them not think to exclude us from going to other markets to dispose of those commodities which they cannot use, or to supply those wants which they cannot supply.—Still less let it be proposed that our properties within our own territories shall be taxed or regulated by any power on earth but our own. The God who gave us life gave
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013351_0022_0F90511EF283EE38"/>
us liberty at the same time; the hand of force may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, but cannot disjoin them. This, fire, is our last, our determined resolution; and that you will be pleased to interpose with that efficacy which your earnest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours may ensure to procure redress of these our great grievances, to quiet the minds of your subjects in British America, against any apprehensions of future encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to establish fraternal love and harmony through the whole empire, and that these may continue to the latest ages of times, is the fervent prayer of all British America!</p>
