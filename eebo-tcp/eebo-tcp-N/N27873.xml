            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF TOM WHITE, THE POSTILLION.</head>
            <p>TOM WHITE was one of the beſt drivers of a Poſt chaiſe on the Bath Road.—Tom was the ſon of an honeſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer at a little village in Wiltſhire: he was an active induſtrious bay, and as ſoon as he was big enough he left his father, who was burthened with a numerous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and went to live with Farmer Hodges, a ſober worthy man in the ſame village. He drove the waggon all the week; and on Sundays though he was now grown up, the farm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his beaſts, and would have turned him out of his ſervice if he had ever gone to the ale-houſe for his own pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:037138_0003_100C835DF3052070"/>Tom by carrying ſome waggon-loads of faggots to the Bear-inn at Devizes, ſoon made many acquaintances in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-yard. He compared his own Carter's frock, and ſhoes thick ſet with nails, with the ſmart red jackets and tight boots of the Poſt-boys, and grew aſhamed of his own homely dreſs; he was reſolved to drive a chaiſe, to get money, and to ſee the world. Fooliſh fellow! he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that, though it is true, a waggon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er works hard all day, yet he gets a quiet evening, and undiſturbed reſt at night. However there muſt be chaiſe-boys as well as plough-boys, there was no great harm in the change. The evil company to which it expoſed him, was the chief miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. He left farmer Hodges though not without ſorrow at quitting ſo kind a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and got himſelf hired at the Black Bear.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the temptations to which he was now expoſed, Tom's good education <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by him for ſome time. At firſt he was frightened to hear the oaths and wicked words which are too often ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a ſtable-yard. However, though he thought it wrong, he had not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037138_0004_100C835F77C94BB8"/>
to reprove it, and the next ſtep to being eaſy at ſeeing others ſin, is to ſin ourſelves. By degrees he began to think it manly, and a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of ſpirit in others to ſwear; though the force of good habits was ſo ſtrong, that at firſt when he ſwore it was with fear and in a low voice. But he was ſoon laughed out of his ſheepiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they called it; and though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver became ſo prophane and blaſphemous as ſome of his companions, for he never ſwore in cool blood or in mirth as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, yet he would too often uſe a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bad word when he was in a paſſion with his horſes. And here I cannot but drop a hint on the great folly as well as wickedneſs of being in a great rage with poor beaſts, who not having the gift of reaſon, cannot be moved like human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with all the wicked words that are ſaid to them; but who, unhappily, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the gift of feeling, ſuffer as much as human creatures can do, at the cruel and unneceſſary beatings g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them. He had been bred up to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was a great ſin, for he never ſaw far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Hodges drunk in his life, and where a farmer is ſober, his men are leſs apt to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037138_0005_100C836102D81A88"/>
drink, or if they do, the maſter can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them with the better grace.</p>
            <p>Tom was not naturally fond of drink, yet for the ſake of being thought merry company, and a hearty fellow, he often drank more than he ought. As he had been uſed to go to church twice on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day while he lived with the farmer, who ſeldom uſed his horſes on that day except to carry his wife to church behind him, Tom felt a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eaſy when he was ſent the very firſt Sunday a long journey with a great family; for I cannot conceal the truth that too many gentle folks will tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel when there is no neceſſity for it on a Sunday, and when Monday would anſwer the end juſt as well. This is a great grief to all good and ſober people, both rich and poor. However he kept his thoughts to himſelf, though he could not now and then help thinking how quietly things were going on at the farmer's, whoſe wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner on a ſunday led as eaſy a life as if he had been a gentleman. But he ſoon loſt all thoughts of this kind, and did not know a Sunday from a Monday. Tom went on proſperouſly, as it is called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for three or four years, got plenty of money,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037138_0006_100C836C5F61FF20"/>
but ſaved not a Shilling. As ſoon as his horſes were once in the ſtable, whoever would might ſee them fed for Tom.—He had other fiſh to fry.—Fives, cards, cudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el-playing, laying wagers, and keeping looſe company, each of which he at firſt diſliked, and then practiſed, ran away with all his money, and all his ſpare time; and though he was generally in the way as ſoon as the horſes were ready, (becauſe if there was no driving there was no pay,) yet he did not care whether the carriage was clean or the horſes looked well, if the harneſs was whole, or the horſes were ſhod. The certainty that the gains of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow would make up for the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of to-day, made him quite thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and happy, for he was young, active, and healthy, and never foreſaw that a rainy day might come, when he would want what he now ſquandered.</p>
            <p>One day being a little fluſtered with liquor as he was driving his return chaiſe through Brentford, he ſaw juſt before him another empty carriage, driven by one of his acquaintance; he whipped his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, reſolving to outſtrip the other, and ſwearing dreadfully that he would be at
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037138_0007_100C836EA4DCDBF0"/>
the Red Lion firſt—for a pint—done, cried the other—a wager.—Both cut and ſpurred the poor beaſts with the uſual fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if their credit had been really at ſtake, or their lives had depended on this foolliſh conteſt. Tom's chaiſe had now got up to that of his rival, and they drove along ſide of each other with great fury and many imprecations. But in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row part, Tom's chaiſe being in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, with his antagoniſt on one ſide, and a cart driving againſt him on the other, the horſes reared, the carriages got entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, Tom roared out a great oath to the other to ſtop, which he either could not, or would not do, but returned a horrid imprecation that he would win the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if he was alive. Tom's horſes took fright and he was thrown to the ground with great violence. As ſoon as he could be got from under the wheels, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up ſenſeleſs; his leg was broke in two places, and his body much bruiſed. Some people whom the noiſe had brought together, put him into the poſt-chaiſe, in which the waggoner kindly aſſiſted, but the other driver ſeemed careleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and drove off, obſerving with a brutal coolneſs, "I am ſorry I have loſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037138_0008_100C83702AE82568"/>
my pint; I ſhould have beat him hollow, had it not been for this <hi>little accident.</hi>" Some gentlemen who came out of the Inn, after reprimanding this ſavage, inquired who he was, wrote to inform his maſter, and got him diſcharged: reſolving, that neither they nor any of their friends would ever employ him, and he was long out of place.</p>
            <p>Tom was taken to one of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hoſpitals with which London abounds. His agonies were dreadful, his leg was ſet, and a high fever came on. As ſoon as he was left alone to reflect on his condition, his firſt thought was that he ſhould die, and his horror was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable.—Alas!" ſaid he "what will become of my poor ſoul? I am cut off in the very commiſſion of three great ſins: —I was drunk, I was in a horrible paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I had oaths and blaſphemies in my mouth."—He tried to pray, but he could not, his mind was all diſtraction, and he thought he was ſo very wicked that God would not forgive him: becauſe, ſays he, "I have ſinned againſt light and knowledge, and a ſober education, and good examples, and I deſerve nothing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037138_0009_100C93698FF0CF80"/>
but puniſhment."—At length he grew light-headed and there was little hopes of his life. Whenever he came to his ſenſes for a few minutes, he cried out, "O! that my old companions could now ſee me, ſurely they would take warning by my ſad fate, and repent before it is too late."</p>
            <p>By the bleſſing of God on the ſkill of the ſurgeon, and the care of the nurſes he however grew better in a few days. And here let me ſtop to remark, what a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it is that we live in a chriſtian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the poor, when ſick, or lame, or wounded, are taken as much care of as any gentry: nay in ſome reſpects more, becauſe in hoſpitals and infirmaries there are more doctors and ſurgeons to attend, than moſt private gentlefolks can afford to have at their own houſes whereas <hi>there never was an hospital in the whole heathen world.</hi> Bleſſed be God for this, among the thouſand other excellent fruits of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION!</p>
            <p>It was eight weeks before Tom could be taken out of bed. This was a happy affliction; for this long ſickneſs and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037138_0010_100C936B8542CD40"/>
gave him time to reflect on his paſt life. He began ſeriouſly to hate thoſe darling ſins which had brought him to the brink of ruin. He could now pray hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily: he confeſſed and lamented his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities with many tears, and began to hope that the mercies of God, through the merits of a Redeemer, might yet be extended to him on his ſincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He reſolved never more to return to the ſame evil courſes, but he did not truſt in his own ſtrength, but prayed that God would give him grace for the future, as well as pardon for the paſt. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, and he was humbled at the thought that he uſed to have ſhort fits of repentance, and to form reſolutions of amendment, in his wild and thoughtleſs days, and often when he had a bad head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach after a drinking bout, or had loſt his money at all fours, he vowed never to drink or play again. But as ſoon as his head was well, and his pocket recruited, he forgot all his reſolutions. And how ſhould it be otherwiſe? for he truſted in his own ſtrength, he never prayed to God to ſtrengthen him, nor ever avoided the next temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037138_0011_100C936D73E80A48"/>The caſe was now different. Tom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to find that <hi>his strength was perfect weakness,</hi> and that he could do nothing without the Divine aſſiſtance, for which he prayed heartily and conſtantly. He ſent home for his Bible and Prayer-book, which he had not opened for two years, and which had been given him when he left the Sunday School. He ſpent the chief part of his time in reading them and thus derived great comfort, as well as great knowledge. The ſtudy of the bible filled his heart with gratitude to God who had not cut him off in the midſt of his ſins, but given him ſpace for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and the agonies he had lately ſuffered with his broken leg increaſed his thankfulneſs, that he had eſcaped the more dreadful pain of eternal miſery. And here let me remark what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this is for rich people to give away Bibles and good books, and not loſe all hope though for a time they ſee little or no good effect from it. According to all appearance, Tom's were never likely to do him any good, and yet his generous benefactor who had caſt his bread upon the waters, ſound it after many days, for this bible which had lain untouched for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037138_0012_100C936FC5351970"/>
years, was at laſt made the means of his reformation. God will work in his own good time.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he got well, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the hoſpital, Tom began to think he muſt return to get his bread. At firſt he had ſome ſcruples about going back to his old employ: but ſays he, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly enough, gentle folks muſt travel, travellers muſt have chaiſes, and chaiſes muſt have drivers; 'tis a very honeſt call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I don't know that goodneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to one ſort of buſineſs more than another; and he who can be good in a ſtate of great temptation, provided the calling be lawful, and the temptations are not of his own ſeeking, and he be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in prayer, may be better than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man for aught I know: and <hi>all that belongs to us is to do our duty in that state of life in which it shall please God to call us.</hi> Tom had rubbed up his catechiſm at the hoſpital and 'tis a pity that people don't look at their catechiſm ſometimes when they are grown up; for it is full as good for men and women as it is for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: nay better, for though the anſwers contained in it are intended for children
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037138_0013_100C9371B2F355C0"/>
to <hi>repeat,</hi> yet the duties enjoined in it are intended for men and women to put in <hi>practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tom now felt grieved that he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to drive on Sundays. But people who are in earneſt, and have their hearts in a thing can find helps in all caſes. As ſoon as he had ſet down his company at their ſtage, and had ſeen his horſes fed, ſays Tom, "A man who takes care of his horſes will generally think it right to let them reſt an hour or two at leaſt. In every town it is a chance but there may be a church open during part of that time. If the prayers ſhould be over, I'll try hard for the ſermon; and if I dare not ſtay to the Sermon, it is a chance but I may catch the prayers; it is worth trying for, however; and as I uſed to make nothing of making a puſh, for the ſake of getting an hour to gamble, I need not grudge to take a little pains extraordinary to ſerve God. By this watchfulneſs he ſoon got to know the hours of ſervice at all the towns on the road he travelled, and while the horſes ſed, Tom went to church; and it became a favourite proverb with him
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037138_0014_100C937343AD77A0"/>
that <hi>prayers and provender hinder no man's journey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At firſt his companions wanted to laugh and make ſport of this—but when they ſaw that no lad on the road was up ſo early or worked ſo hard as Tom: when they ſaw no chaiſe ſo neat, no glaſſes ſo bright, no harneſs ſo tight, no driver ſo diligent, ſo clean, or ſo civil, they found he was no ſubject to make ſport at. Tom indeed was very careful in looking after the linch-pins, in never giving his horſes too much water when they were hot; nor, whatever was his haſte, would he ever gallop them up hill, ſtrike them acroſs the head, or when tired, cut and flaſh them in driving on the ſtones, as ſoon as he got into a town, as ſome fooliſh fellows do. What helped to cure Tom of theſe bad practices, was that remark he met with in the Bible, that <hi>a good man is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to his beast.</hi> He was much moved on reading the Prophet Jonah, to obſerve what compaſſion the great God of heaven and earth had for poor beaſts: for one of the reaſons there given, why the Almighty was unwilling to deſtroy the great city of Nine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eh was, <hi>because there was much
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037138_0015_100C93752E515490"/>
cattle in it.</hi> After this Tom never could bear to ſee a wanton ſtroke inflicted.</p>
            <p>Tom ſoon grew rich for one in his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for every gentleman on the road would be driven by no other lad if <hi>careful Tom</hi> was to be had. Being diligent, he <hi>got</hi> a great deal of money; being frugal, he <hi>spent</hi> but little; and having no vices, he <hi>wasted</hi> none. He ſoon found out that there was ſome meaning in that text which ſays, that <hi>Godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come</hi>: for the ſame principles which make a man ſober and honeſt, have alſo a natural tendency to make him healthy and rich; while a drunkard and a ſpend-thrift can hardly eſcape being ſick, and a beggar in the end. Vice is the parent of miſery here as well as hereafter.</p>
            <p>After a few years Tom begged a holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and made a viſit to his native vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; his good character had got thither before him. He found his father was dead, but during his long illneſs Tom had ſupplied him with money, and by allowing him a trifle every week, had had the honeſt ſatisfaction of keeping him
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037138_0016_100C9377AB68ABC0"/>
from the pariſh. Farmer Hodges was ſtill living, but being grown old and infirm, he was deſirous to retire from buſineſs. He retained a great regard for his old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Tom; and finding he was worth money, and knowing he knew ſomething of country buſineſs, he offered to let him have a ſmall farm at an eaſy rate, and promiſed his aſſiſtance in the management for the firſt year, with the loan of a ſmall ſum of money, that he might ſet out with a pretty ſtock. Tom thanked him with tears in his eyes, went back and took a handſome leave of his maſter, who made him a preſent of a horſe and cart, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his long and faithful ſervices; for, ſays he, "I have ſaved many horſes by Tom's care and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I could well afford to do the ſame by every ſervant who did the ſame by me; and ſhould be a richer man at the end of every year by the ſame generoſity, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I could meet with juſt and faithful ſervants who deſerved the ſame rewards."</p>
            <p>Tom was ſoon ſettled in his new farm, and in leſs than a year had got every thing neat and decent about him. Farmer Hodges's long experience and friendly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037138_0017_100C93799F3F15A0"/>
advice, joined to his own induſtry and hard labour, ſoon brought the farm to great perfection. The regularity, ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, peaceableneſs, and piety of his daily life, his conſtant attendance at Church twice every ſunday, and his decent and devout behaviour when there, ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him to the notice of Dr. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd who was ſtill living, a pattern of zeal, activity, and benevolence to all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh prieſts. The Dr. ſoon began to hold up Tom, or as we muſt now more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly term him, Mr. Thomas White, to the imitation of the whole pariſh, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and condeſcending converſation of this worthy clergyman, contributed no leſs than his preaching to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his new pariſhioner.</p>
            <p>Farmer White ſoon found out that a dairy could not well be carried on without a miſtreſs, and began to think ſeriouſly of marrying; he prayed to God to direct him in ſo important a buſineſs. He knew that a tawdry, vain, dreſſy girl, was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make good cheeſe and butter, and that a worldly and ungodly woman would make a ſad wife and miſtreſs of a family. He ſoon heard of a young woman of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037138_0018_100C937B2BC33F40"/>
character, who had been bred up by the vicar's lady, and ſtill lived in the family as upper maid. She was prudent, ſober, induſtrious and religious. Her neat, modeſt, and plain appearance at church, (for ſhe was ſeldom ſeen any where elſe out of her maſter's family,) was an example to all perſons in her ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and never failed to recommend her to ſtrangers, even before they had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of knowing the goodneſs of her character. It was her character, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which recommended her to farmer White. He knew that <hi>favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised:</hi> "aye, and not only praiſed, but choſen too," ſays farmer White, as he took down his hat from the nail on which it hung, in order to go and wait on Dr. Shepherd, to break his mind and aſk his conſent; for he thought it would be a very unhandſome return for all the favours he was receiving from his Miniſter, to decoy away his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant from her place without his conſent.</p>
            <p>This worthy gentleman, though ſorry to loſe ſo valuable a member of his little
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037138_0019_100C937D17E6D1F8"/>
family, did not ſcruple a moment about parting with her, when he found it would be ſo greatly to her advantage. Tom was agreeably ſurpriſed to hear ſhe had ſaved fifty pounds by her frugality. The Dr. married them himſelf, farmer Hodges being preſent.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon Dr. Shepherd conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to call on farmer and Mrs. White, to give a few words of advice on the new duties they had entered into; a common cuſtom with him on thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. He often took an opportunity to drop, in the moſt kind and tender way, a hint on the great indecency of making marriages, chriſtenings, and above all funerals, days of riot and exceſs, as is too often the caſe in country villages. The expectation that the vicar might poſſibly drop in, in his walks, on theſe feſtivities, ſometimes reſtrained exceſſive drinking, and improper converſation, even among thoſe farmers who were not reſtrained by higher motives, as farmer and Mrs. White were.</p>
            <p>What the Dr. ſaid was always in ſuch a cheerful, good humoured way, that it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037138_0020_100C937F67E38C40"/>
was ſure to increaſe the pleaſure of that day, inſtead of damping it. Well, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſaid he, and you my faithful Sarah, any other friend might recommend peace and agreement to you on your marriage; but I on the contrary recommend cares and ſtrifes.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dodd's Sayings.</note> The company ſtared—but Sarah, who knew that her old maſter was a facetious gentleman, and always had ſome good meaning behind, looked ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, "Cares and ſtrifes, Sir, ſaid the farmer, what do you mean? I mean ſaid he, for the firſt, that your cares ſhall be who ſhall pleaſe God moſt, and your ſtrifes, who ſhall ſerve him beſt, and do your duty moſt faithfully. Thus, all your cares and ſtrifes being employed to the higheſt purpoſes, all petty cares and worldly ſtrifes ſhall be at an end.</p>
            <p>"Always remember both of you, that you "have ſtill a better friend than each other."—The company ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed again, and thought no woman could have ſo good a friend as her huſband. "As you have choſen each other from the beſt motives, continued the Doctor, you have every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ground to hope for happineſs;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037138_0021_100C938153BD92D8"/>
but as this world is a ſoil, in which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and misfortunes will ſpring up; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from which you cannot ſave one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then remember, "'tis he beſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to go to that friend wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Sir, ſaid Farmer White, I humbly thank you for all your kind inſtructions, of which I ſhall now ſtand more in need than ever, as I ſhall have more duties to fulfil. I hope the remembrance of my paſt offences will keep me humble, and the ſenſe of my remaining ſin will keep me watchful. I ſet out in the world, Sir, with what is called a good natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but I ſoon found to my coſt that without GOD's grace that will carry a man but a little way. A good temper is a good thing, but nothing but the fear of GOD can enable one to bear up againſt temptation, evil company, and evil paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The misfortune of breaking my leg, as I then thought it, has proved the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bleſſing of my life. It ſhewed me my own weakneſs, Sir, the value of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the goodneſs of GOD. How many of my brother drivers have I ſeen
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037138_0022_100C9382DED8E578"/>
ſince that time, cut off in the prime of life by drinking, or by ſome ſudden acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, while I have not only been ſpared, but bleſſed and proſpered. O Sir! it would be the joy of my heart, if ſome of my old comrades, good-natured, civil fellows, (whom I can't help loving) could ſee as I have done, the danger of evil courſes before it is too late. Though they may not hearken to you, Sir, or any other <hi>Minister,</hi> they may believe <hi>me,</hi> becauſe I have been one of them: and I can ſpeak from experience, of the great difference there is, even as to worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, between a life of ſobriety and a life of ſin. I could tell them, Sir, not as a thing I have read in a book, but as a truth I feel in my own heart, that to fear GOD and keep his commandments, will not only "bring a man peace at the laſt," but will make him happy <hi>now.</hi> And I will venture to ſay, Sir, that all the ſtocks, pillories, priſons, and gibbets in the land, though ſo very needful to keep bad men in order, yet will never reſtrain a good man from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting evil, half ſo much as that ſingle text, "how ſhall I do this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſin againſt God?" Dr. Shepherd condeſcended to approve of what the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037138_0023_100C9384D3AE1600"/>
Farmer had ſaid, kindly ſhook him by the hand, and took leave.</p>
            <p>Thomas White had always been fond of ſinging, but he had for many years deſpiſed that vile traſh which is too often ſung in a ſtable-yard. One Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening he heard his miſtreſs at the Bear read ſome fine verſes out of a fine book called the Spectator. He was ſo ſtruck with the picture it contains of the great mercies of God, of which he had himſelf partaken ſo largely, that he took the liberty to aſk her for theſe verſes, and ſhe being a very good-natured wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made her daughter write out for the poſtilion the following.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:037138_0026_100C938AB07C7DA8"/>Tom White, as we have ſhewn in the fore part of this hiſtory, from an idle poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy was become a reſpectable farmer. GOD had bleſſed his induſtry, and he had proſpered in the world. He was ſober and temperate, and, as was the natural conſequence, he was active and healthy. He was induſtrious and frugal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came proſperous in his circumſtances. This is in the ordinary courſe of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But it is not a certain and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary rule. GOD <hi>maketh his sun to shine on the just and the unjust.</hi> A man who uſes every honeſt means of thrift and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, will, in moſt caſes, find ſucceſs attend his labours. But ſtill the <hi>race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.</hi> GOD is ſometimes pleaſed for wiſe ends, to diſappoint all the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hopes of the moſt upright man. His corn may be ſmitten by a blight. His barns may be conſumed by fire. His cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle may be carried off by diſtemper. And to theſe and other misfortunes, he is as liable as the ſpendthrift or the knave. Succeſs is the <hi>common</hi> reward of induſtry, but if it were its <hi>constant</hi> reward, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious would be tempted to look no further than the preſent ſtate. They
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037138_0027_100C938CA01A0480"/>
would loſe one ſtrong ground of their faith. It would ſet aſide the Scripture ſcheme. This world would be looked on as a ſtate of reward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſtead of a ſtate of trial, and we ſhould forget to look to a day of final retribution.</p>
            <p>Farmer <hi>White</hi> never took it into his head, that becauſe he paid his debts, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed early and late, and ate the bread of carefulneſs, he was therefore to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no <hi>misfortune like other folk,</hi> but was to be free from the common trials and troubles of life. He knew that proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was far from being a ſure mark of GOD's favour, and had read in good books, and eſpecially in the bible, of the great pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and afflictions of the beſt of men. Though he was no great ſcholar, he had ſenſe enough to obſerve, that a time of public proſperity was not always a time of public virtue; and he thought that what was true of a whole nation might be true of one man. So the more he proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered the more he prayed that proſperity might not corrupt his heart. And when he ſaw lately ſigns of public diſtreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, he was not half ſo much frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſome others were, becauſe he thought
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037138_0028_100C938F1D8E6030"/>
it might do us good in the long run; and he was in hopes that a little poverty might bring on a little penitence. The great grace he laboured after was that of a cheerful ſubmiſſion. He uſed to ſay, that if the Lord's Prayer had only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoſe four little words THY WILL BE DONE, it would be worth more than the biggeſt book in the world without them.</p>
            <p>Dr. Shepherd the worthy vicar, (with whom the farmer's wife had formerly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as houſekeeper) was very fond of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a walk with him about his grounds, and he uſed to ſay, that he learnt as much from the farmer as the farmer did from him. If the Doctor happened to obſerve, I am afraid the long rains will ſpoil this fine piece of oats, the farmer would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, "but then, ſir, think how good it is for the graſs." If the Doctor feared the wheat would be but indifferent, the farmer was ſure the rye would turn out well. When graſs ſailed, he did not doubt but turnips would be plenty. Even for floods and inundations he would find out ſome way to juſtify Providence. "'Tis better," ſaid he, "to have our lands a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037138_0029_100C939109526DC8"/>
little overflowed, than that the ſprings ſhould be dried up, and our cattle ſaint for lack of water." When the drought came, he thanked GOD that the ſeaſon would be healthy; and high winds, which frightened others, he ſaid ſerved to clear the air. Whoever, or whatever was wrong, he was always ſure that PROVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE was in the right. And he uſed to ſay, that a man with ever ſo ſmall an income if he had but frugality and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and caſt off all vain deſires, was richer than a lord who was tormented by vanity and covetouſneſs. When he ſaw others in the wrong, he did not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abuſe them for it, but took care to avoid the ſame fault. He had ſenſe and ſpirit enough to break through many old but very bad cuſtoms of his neighbours. "If a thing is wrong in itſelf." (ſaid he one day to farmer Hodges) "a whole pariſh doing it can't make it right. And as to it's being an old cuſtom, why if it be a good one I like it the better for being old, becauſe it has had the ſtamp of ages, and the ſanction of experience on it's worth. But if it be old as well as bad, that is another reaſon for my trying to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037138_0030_100C939294D89BE0"/>
put an end to it, that we may not miſlead our children as our fathers have miſled us."</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The ROOF-RAISING.</head>
               <p>SOME years after he was ſettled, he built a large new barn. All the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were looking forward to the uſual holiday of roof-raiſing. On this occaſion it was a cuſtom to give a dinner to the workmen, with ſo much liquor after it that they got ſo drunk, that they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt the remaining half days work, but they were not always able to work the next day.</p>
               <p>Mrs. White provided a plentiful din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for roof-raiſing, and gave each man his mug of beer. After a hearty meal they began to grow clamourous for more drink. The farmer ſaid, "My lads, I don't grudge you a few gallons of ale merely for the ſake of ſaving my liquor, though that is ſome conſideration; but I never will, knowingly, help any man to make a beaſt of himſelf. I am reſolved to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037138_0031_100C9394917CEDC0"/>
break through a bad cuſtom. You are now well refreſhed. If you will go chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to your work, you will have half a day's pay to take on Saturday night more than you would if this afternoon were waſted in drunkenneſs. For this your families will be the better; whereas, were I to give you more liquor when you have already had enough, I ſhould help to rob them of their bread. But I wiſh to ſhew you, that I have your good at heart full as much as my own profit. If you will now go to work, I will give you all ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mug at night when you leave off. Thus your time will be ſaved, your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies helped, and my ale will not go to make reaſonable creatures worſe than brute beaſts."</p>
               <p>Here he ſtopped. "You are in the right on't, Maſter," ſaid Tom the thatcher; "You are a hearty man, Farmer," ſaid John Plane the carpenter. "Come along boys," ſaid Tim Brick the maſon; ſo they all went merrily to work, fortified with a good dinner. There was only one drunken ſurly fellow who refuſed, that was Dick Guzzle the Smith. Dick ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver works above two or three days in the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037138_0032_100C9396E299C9C0"/>
week, and ſpends the others at the Red Lion. He ſwore that if the farmer did not let him have as much liquor as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at Roof-Raiſing, he would not ſtrike another ſtroke, but he would leave the job unfiniſhed, and he might get hands where he could. Farmer White took him at his word, and paid him off directly: glad enough to get rid of ſuch a ſot, whom he had only employed from pity to a large and almoſt ſtarving family. When the men came for their mug in the evening, the farmer brought out the remains of the cold gammon: they made a hearty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and thanked him for having broke through a fooliſh cuſtom, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards much left off in that pariſh, though Dick would not come into it and loſt moſt of his work.</p>
               <p>Farmer White's labourers were often complaining, that things were ſo dear that they could not buy a bit of meat. He knew it was partly true, but not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, for it was before theſe very hard times. One morning he ſtept out to ſee how an outhouſe which he was thatching went on. He was ſurpriſed to find the work at a ſtand. He walked over to the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037138_0033_100C9398EB0DB2B0"/>
thatcher's houſe. "Tom," ſaid he, "I deſire that piece of work may be finiſhed directly. If a ſhower comes my grain will be ſpoiled." "Indeed, Maſter I ſhan't work to-day, nor to-morrow, neither," ſaid Tom. "You forget that 'tis Eaſter Monday, and to-morrow is Eaſter Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. And ſo on Wedneſday I ſhall thatch away maſter. But 'tis hard if a poor man who works all the year may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy theſe few holidays."</p>
               <p>"Tom," ſaid the farmer, "when theſe days where firſt put into our prayer-book, the good men who did it, little thought that the time would come when holyday ſhould mean drunken-day. How much doſt think now I ſhall pay thee for this piece of thatch?" "Why you know maſter you have let it to me by the great. I think between this and tomorrow night, as the weather is ſo fine, I could clear about four ſhillings, after I have paid my boy. But thatching does not come often, and other work is not ſo profitable." "Very well, Tom; and how much now do you think you may ſpend in theſe two holidays?" "Why maſter, if the ale is pleaſant, and the company merry, I do
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037138_0034_100C939A7803F740"/>
not expect to get off for leſs than three ſhillings." "Tom can you do pounds, ſhillings, and pence?" "I can make a little ſcore maſter behind the kitchen door with a bit of chalk, which is as much as I want." "Well, Tom, add the four ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings you would have earned to the three you intend to ſpend, what does that make?" "Let me ſee! three and four make ſeven. Seven ſhillings maſter." "Tom, you often tell me the times are ſo bad that you can never buy a bit of meat. Now here is the coſt of two joints at once; to ſay nothing of the ſin of waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time and getting drunk." I never once thought of that," ſaid Tom. "Now Tom," ſaid the farmer, "if I were you, I would ſtep over to Butcher Jobbins's, buy a ſhoulder of mutton, which being left from ſaturday's market you will get a little cheaper. This I would make my wife bake in a deep diſh full of potatoes. I would then go to work, and when the dinner was ready I would go and enjoy it with my wife and children; you need not give the mutton to the children; the potatoes will have all the gravy, and be very favory for them." "Aye, but I've got no beer maſter, the times are ſo hard
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037138_0035_100C939C785981B0"/>
that a poor man can't afford to brew a drop of drink now as we uſed to do."</p>
               <p>"Times are bad, and malt is very dear Tom, and yet both don't prevent your throwing away ſeven ſhillings in keeping holiday. Now ſend for a quart of ale, as it is to be a feaſt; and you will even then be four ſhillings richer than if you had gone to the publick houſe. I would put by theſe four ſhillings, till I could add a couple to them; with this I could get a buſhel of malt, and my wife ſhould brew it, and you may take a pint at home of a night, which will do you more good than a gallon at the Red Lion." "I have a great mind to take your advice, maſter, but I ſhall be made ſuch fun of at the Lion; they will ſo laugh at me if I don't go." "Let thoſe laugh that win, Tom." "But maſter, I have got a friend to meet me there." "Then aſk your friend to come and eat a bit of your cold mutton at night, and here is ſix-pence for another pot, if you will promiſe to brew a ſmall caſk of your own." "Thank you, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo I will; and I won't go to the Lion. Come boy, bring the helm, and fetch the ladder." And ſo Tom was upon the roof in a twinkling.</p>

               <p>Dr. Shepherd happened to ſay to Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer white one day, "that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he diſliked more than the manner in which ſheep-ſhearing and harveſt-home were kept by ſome in his pariſh.
