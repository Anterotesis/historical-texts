            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap> accused them in divers things.</hi> But did not prove his Charge in any one Particular.</p>
            <p>And the said <hi>John Delavall</hi> hath divers times accused me in publick Meetings, <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> would prove me to be no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> replyed in the publick Meeting, <hi>We are not to prove it from Scripture, but from Books Friends; for the Question betwixt us and</hi> G. K. <hi>is not, who is the best</hi> Christian, <hi>but who is the best</hi> Quaker.</p>

               <hi>G.

               </gap> them to all other Writings, ye ought to begin with the Scripture, and from them prove me to be guilty of <hi>Heresie.</hi>

               </gap>ther accuse me, <hi>That my Heresie and Error was in a Fundamental Doctrine of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>in saying, The Light within is not sufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not something else.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. K.</hi> answered, I am glad to find the Controversie at last come to this plain issue, that ye and we differ in Doctrine, which ye would not acknowledge publickly before, but generally said, ye had nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my Doctrine, but against my Passion, &amp;c. But now it plainly appeareth, that ye have against my Doctrine, and that ye and I differ <hi>Fundamentally.</hi> But however, <hi>John Delavall</hi> hath not proved it from any Friends Books, that I am guilty of Heresie; for tho' <hi>William Penn</hi> saith in the <hi>Christian Quaker, That the Talent or Light within is sufficient in it self to Salvation,</hi> yet he doth not say, it is sufficient without the Man Christ Jesus, and what he did and suffered for us on Earth, and without his present Intercession and Mediation for us in Heaven, which is that so nothing else that I have affirmed to be necessary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, together with the Light within, as one entire cause of our Salvation; and I can and dare appeal to <hi>William Penn</hi> in the case, who I hope is a living man, Whether his words bear any such sence, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would impose upon them, to prove me guilty of Heresie in a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for his Charge of <hi>Hatred,</hi> I told them, That it was no sin nor evil to hate mens Errors and Hypocrisie, and to bear a Zealous Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against them; nor is it any Reviling to use sharp words of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof against the Guilty, unless ye will prove that I have falsly accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in any thing, which ye can never do, tho' they have falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> prove; and therefore both the <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at your door. And ye have not been short in giving hard words against me, but have far exceeded me, as can well be proved.</p>
            <p>It may be farther observed, that several first Days one after another <hi>John Delavall</hi> brought to the publick Meeting his Pocket full of Books, interrupting me in my Testimony, and read passages out of the same, pretending he would prove by my own Books, that I contradicted my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Doctrine. To which I have answered, That it was an act of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000641_0004_0FA9626BCDBC0D60"/>
Incivility that both <hi>J. Delavall</hi> and his Brethren were guilty of, (as well as a Breach of the chief Fundamental Law of this Province, than requireth, That no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>And I then told them further, That seeing <hi>John Delavall</hi> did proffer to prove me to contradict my former Doctrine, and to be no <hi>Quaker.</hi> I was most willing, and did desire that a day might be appointed for a Publick Dispute, wherein he might have opportunity to prove his Charge, if he could. To which <hi>John Delavall</hi> positively assented, without any reservation, restriction, or proviso; but sometime after being put in mind of it by me, in a Letter to him, he declined it, by making excuse, that he would dispute with me in publick, providing he had the consent of his Brethren. And on a First Day, some time after. I pressing <hi>J. D.</hi> to perform <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Therefore, seeing that they declined a Dispute, to prove their Charge, I writ a few lines to <hi>J. Delavall,</hi> That whereas he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>And in another Letter of his, bearing date the 3d of 11 Month, (referring to his Paper he sent me the 24th of 10 Month,) he saith, <q>Wherein I have fully proved thee to differ in a Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from thy former, and other Friends Writings.</q> And further to prove me guilty of Heresie, in the said Letter, he giveth his sence of the word <hi>Heresie,</hi> as intended by him, when mentioned in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meeting. <q>It is the same (saith he) as the Fathers (so called) defined it: <hi>Heresie</hi> is a mis-belief of some points of Faith, contrary to the Doctrine universaily received in the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this his Definition of Heresie, out of the Fathers (so called) as he alledged, I replyed to him, in a Letter bearing date the 2d of 12th Month, That his Definition of <hi>Heresie</hi> seemeth rather to be taken out of some <hi>Popish Writer,</hi> than any approved antient Fathers (so called) further adding, That the best way to know what Heresie is, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it by the Spirit of Truth within, and the Testimony of the Scripture without, and to lay most weight on these two. But what hath been the universal Testimony of the Church in all Ages, or what it is at present, is far more hard and difficult in many things to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and too tedious to enquire into, but however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doubt not but I have more the Consent of the Universal Church for me, than against me, in this particular.</p>

            <p>And in my first Paper I did further inform J. D. That my assertion, <abbr>

I further saying, That as God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wise hath ordained divers concurring Natural Causes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one Natural Effect, all subordinate to him, the first and highest Cause; so to effect our Salvation he hath ordained divers concurring Causes; some without us and some within us, and every one sufficient and able in their manner and way of working, to answer to the end and effect, all in Harmony together.</p>
            <p>And because J.

To which, as yet, J.D. hath sent no particular Reply; therefore as to that the matter rests at present. And this is a brief account of the most material Passages in the first Paper that J.
