            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT was the Importunate Solicitation of many, and more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of them whose Request caused the Sermon emitted here with to be Preached, that prevailed with the Reverend and Worthy Author, so far to gratifie their desires, as to let others have a Copy of what he delivered on so Solemn an Occasion; leaving it with them to dispose of, as they should see cause. I have perused it with great satisfaction, finding it to be not only an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate and awakening, but a rational and judicious Discourse, and than which nothing can be more seasonable.</p>
            <p>It hath often been affirmed (and truly) that the distinguishing <hi>Character</hi> whereby <hi>New-England</hi> is differenced from other <hi>Out-goings</hi> of the <hi>English Nation,</hi> is, in that the great motive inducing the <hi>first Planters,</hi> to remove themselves and theirs into a wast and howling Wilderness, was (like that of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> of old) <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Religion,</hi> which their Souls were concerned for. And whilest Men continued faithful to that blessed design (as the Prophet said to <hi>Jehojakim) it was well with them.</hi> They that sought first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness, had other things added to them which they never thought, nor could in reason hope to enjoy. Nor did any Weapon formed against us in those dayes prosper. The Lord hath caused us, and all the World about us, to see that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is our life. That this Interest, without which we our selves cannot live, hath been for many years languishing and dying, is the observation of all men that have their hearts exercised in discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of this nature.</p>
            <p>The complaint is, that <hi>N-England</hi> is not to be found in <hi>N-England,</hi> but we are become like the rest of the Nations, being grown into the same conformity to the World, with other Plantations, whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and profession never was, as ours hath been. There is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful decay as to externals and the Form of Religion amongst the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it. Hearing the Word as to the publick dispensation thereof, Prayer with Fasting, and other religious Exercises (which reach no further than the <hi>Form of Godliness</hi>) are not so frequent as in former dayes; and that is a most certain sign that the power of Godliness is much more in a bleeding and dying state. It is not then to be wondered at, if the tenour of divine Dispensation hath of
<pb facs="unknown:000353_0003_0FA5549B0660BC78"/>
later times been changed towards us: The hand of God hath been heavy upon many places in the Land, he hath smitten us with a deadly destruction. The killing Sword, a mortal Contagion, and other judgements have threatned life it self. And since we have let Religion die, we have been in greater danger than ever of being deprived both of our Political and Ecclesiastical life. Let us not be high-minded but fear. If we do not in this our Day know the things of our peace, so as to recover the life of Religion, the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods holy severity towards others, may cause trembling of heart, lest at last the Lord do unto us as: he hath done unto them. Are we better than <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where the House of God continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most four hundred Years? Are we better than <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Beauty and Joy of the whole Earth? Are we better than the Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> planted by the Apostles themselves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom there was once a gracious and glorious presence of the Son of God? But those Candlesticks are long ago removed out of their Places, not so much as one of them remaining. Because they have lost their Religion they have lost their lives and beings. A late Historian, who about twelve years ago was in those parts, saith, that horrour took hold upon him as he was viewing the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ruins of those once Glorious Churches, fearing lest the sins of other places, which as yet enjoy the Gospel, might in time expose them to the like miseries. He saith, that in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> there are now only a few Cottages, and not so much as one Christian dwelling there. <hi>Smyrna,</hi> is at this day a considerable place in respect of Trade, but no settled Inhabitants there, to uphold so much as the Name of Christians, excepting a few Superstitious <hi>Greeks.</hi> In <hi>Pergamus,</hi> there are but fifteen Families of Christians, and those in a state most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, both as to Spirituals and Temporals. In <hi>Thyatira</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> have eight <hi>Mosches,</hi> but very few Christians now residing there, <hi>Sardis,</hi> which was once the Metropolis of <hi>Lydia,</hi> is now a begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Village, Earthquakes and Wars having brought that famous City under horrid desolations. There is nothing like a Church there. In <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> there is a greater number of Men calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Christians, than in any of those <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches, excepting <hi>Smyrna.</hi> For in that City are two hundred Families of those who are called Christians, but they are Idolaters, and in miserable slavery to the cruel <hi>Turks.</hi> As for <hi>Laadicea,</hi> which was once a rich and populous place; and the Buildings in it exceeding magnificent, it is now utterly desolated, not so much as one Inhabitant there, excepting
<pb facs="unknown:000353_0004_0FA5549BD1391E60"/>
Wolves and doleful Creatures. Thus did all these famous Places, and Churches, by losing Religion lose their own Lives and Beings. Time was when in <hi>Africa,</hi> there were many thousands of Churches, but the true Religion being gone out of that vast Continent (thrice as big as <hi>Europe</hi>) what but Death is to be seen there? Let us look nearer home: In the Land of our Fathers Sepulchres, there were Churches amongst the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> but when those sins of Pride Drunkenness, Contention, Worldliness, notwithstanding <hi>Gildas</hi> and other faithful Ministers did zealously testifie against them, became common and prevailing Evils: God first sent a sweeping Plague a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; and when that Besom af Destruction could not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> them, the Lord brought the <hi>Saxons</hi> upon them, who rooted them out of their Land. And if we consider the dispensations of God since the <hi>Reformation</hi> successfully begun by the Ministry of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin,</hi> and other great Champions for the Truth; how many Protestant Churches in <hi>Saxony, Bohemia, Hungaria, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France,</hi> and other places have been dissipated and unchurched, and that because of their decayings, either as to the profession or practice of Religion? If the Professors thereof be generally grown Formal and Lifeless, it is a sad prognostick that a terrible Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is near at hand. Upon which account, wise men do with some dread, behold the present state of the <hi>Protestant Interest</hi> in the World, the names of those that are indeed alive being so very few.</p>
            <p>As for the Churches in this Wilderness; I am perswaded Christ will not suffer them to be made a Desolation as yet. Though <hi>Israel</hi> was deeply revolted from the holy wayes of God in the dayes of <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> it is said, <hi>2 King.13.23. And the Lord was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and would not destroy them, nor cast he them from his presence as yet.</hi> Nevertheless, shaking Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als may come. We have reason to expect them, and God prepare us for them. For great Sins are now common in <hi>New-England,</hi> which were rarely (if at all) heard of but thirty years ago, Prophaness groweth bold, and is not easily suppressed. There is much Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie and Formality amongst Professors: nay, and wise Virgins are asleep too. It is beyond controversie, that the late Judgements which <hi>New-England</hi> hath been bleeding under, were an effect of Divine anger, provoked by the sins of Men. But since God hath mercifully removed his hand, those very sins the Lord hath been contending for, are committed as much, nay more than ever before.
<pb facs="unknown:000353_0005_0FA5549D35F53B80"/>
It is a most awful and trembling consideration, that the Holy Lord God almighty (who though he may bear long will not suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be abused alwayes) hath been mocked and dallied with more than once. In the day of our late trouble, several things were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be <hi>Provoking Evils,</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> in respect of them confessed to be necessary; which since are made light of. <hi>Austin</hi> did in his time, wish that there might be a Synod called to consider of some effectual course for the suppression of that sin of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness amongst men in those dayes. These Churches, have in a very solemn manner met together by their Representatives, to enquire into <hi>the cause of the Lords displeasure; and the expedients for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> There was a gracious presence of Christ guiding his Servants in those Enquiries. But what doth it all come to, more than to leave the present Generation inexcusable before the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Posterity, and before God in the day of his pleading with those that have known their Masters Will, but have not done it? The infinitely patient God hath waited for fruit three years since that endeavour and pretence to <hi>Reformation</hi> was published. Our <hi>English</hi> Historians have Recorded, that when the sins of the times brought heavy Judgements upon our fore-Fathers, above nine hundred years ago; a <hi>Synod</hi> did convene in order to the redressing of those evils. There were thirty Ministers then found faithful, who gave their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony: but it would not be hearkened to; so that God quickly sent the cruel <hi>Danes,</hi> who for a long time brought the Land into miserable Bondage and Slavery. What hours of Temptation may come upon us, we know not: Our case is the more dangerous, and the Judgements impending like to be the more dreadful when (if Repentance prevent not) at last they shall fall down; in that God hath stirred up the spirits of his Servants in the Ministry full many a time, and with great earnestness to protest against the Sins and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasies of the times; and to press for <hi>Reformation before the Decree bring forth:</hi> but Alas! hitherto with little success. The words of that honourable Man of God, Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> (in his late Sermons on <hi>Luk.13.1,2,3. Page 77.</hi>) have a great deal of truth and weight in them. <q>
                  <hi>Let us not</hi> (saith he) <hi>pretend that the Repentance and Reformation called for, respects the publick enormous sins of the Nation, in Atheism, Prophaneness, Sensuality, Luxury, Pride, Oppression, Hatred of the Truth, Contempt of the Ministry of the Gospel, and the like; they do so indeed, but not only, they respect also the Decays in Faith, Love, Zeal, with love of the World, Conformity unto it, Luke-warmness, that are found
<pb facs="unknown:000353_0006_0FA5549E32638D28"/>
amongst the most eminent Professors of Religion. This is our present wound; here lies our weakness; namely, in the want of a quick, active, zealous Ministry, to call and stir up Magistrates and People to effectual Repentance and turning to God. Unless this be given unto us, I fear we cannot be saved. If it be otherwise, if we have a Ministry that really do attend unto their Duty in this matter, then I shall think it the most pregnant sign of approaching Destruction: Seeing it is apparent unto all, that their Endeavours have neither Fruit nor Success?</hi>
               </q> Truly with us it hath been so: They that have approved themselves faithful unto Christ and their own Consciences in this matter, have indeed inward peace. Yet they cannot but be sensible that they lose the good Word and good Will of some Men; and are exposed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy and reproaches. For as the Excellent Person but now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned saith, <hi>(Page 90.91.)</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>The hardest and most difficult service that ever God called any of his Ministers unto, excepting only Jesus Christ and his Apostles, hath been in the endeavouring the Reformation of backsliding or spiritually decayed Churches. These are the</hi> two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses <hi>which in all ages</hi> have prophesied in Sack-cloth. <hi>Such was the Ministry of</hi> Elijah, <hi>which brought him unto that Conclusion, and an earnest longing to be delivered by Death from his Work and Ministry,</hi> 2 King.19.4. <hi>So was that of</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>in the like season, whereof he complains,</hi> Chap.15.10. John the Baptist <hi>in the same work lost first his liberty, then his life, And in after Ages</hi> Chryfostom, <hi>for the same cause was hated by the</hi> Clergy, <hi>persecuted by the</hi> Court, <hi>and at length driven into</hi> Banishment, <hi>where he died. Most men care not how little a share they have in such a work as this, whose reward will reach them according to the proportion of their engagement in it. All Churches, all Persons almost, would willingly be let alone in the condition wherein they are: They that would press them unto due Reformation, ever were, and ever will be looked on as their</hi> Troublers.</q>

            <p>Nevertheless, God hath given a spirit of Courage, Zeal and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness unto several of his Ambassadors to discharge their Duty in bearing their Testimony, and so to leave the success, and their own Names also, with that God whose they are, and whom they serve. And in special this Worthy Minister of Christ, whose emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Accomplishments are known unto all unto whom he himself is known, hath a long time approved himself singularly Faithful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and the souls of Men herein. The strain of his Ministry, in that Congregation, where He that holds the Stars hath seen meer to place him, hath been to urge Conversion and Reformation. And
<pb facs="unknown:000353_0007_0FA5549F0B875EC8"/>
not only so, but when God hath given him an opportunity (more than once) to speak in the Name of the Lord unto this People, (in respect of the Heads and Representatives thereof) he hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own Soul, by giving Warning; and what he hath spoken shall turn to him for a Testimony. It is an hazardous thing (as much as life is worth) for men not to comply with the Word of God, by whomsoever or to whomsoever spoken. If a <hi>Josiah</hi> regard not the Word of God spoken by a <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> he loses his Life for it; and so did <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> because he humbled not himself before <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord. Its true that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in these dayes, have no immediate Call or Commission from Heaven; yet if they deliver such Messages as are according to the Law and the Testimony, it is God that speaketh by them; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times their hearts are inclined to this or that subject, by a special operation of the spirit of Christ, who is with his Servants to the end of the World. Let us then hear that so our souls may live.</p>
            <p>God of his free Grace, hath seen meet to dignifie an handful of his People, who are separated from their Brethren, with the chief and choicest of Blessings. It is promised as an high favour, <hi>Jer.30.21. Their Nobles shall be of themselves, and their Governours shall proceed from the midst of them.</hi> We have had these over us, who have been (as the Expression of the Antient is) <hi>Nobiles genere, Nobiliores sanctitate.</hi> We cannot be thankful enough for that Blessing. Civil Liberty is an invaluable mercy. The <hi>Jewish Rabbins</hi> have a saying, that <hi>if the Sea were Ink and the Earth Parchment, it would not be sufficient to write down the praise due to God for liberty.</hi> But what then shall be said concerning the Liberties of the Gospel? we enjoy all at this day. The way to have them continued, is, for us to approve our selves faithful to the interest of Religion. For then God will be for us; and if he be for us, who can be against us.</p>

            <p n="1">1.<hi>That Religion is Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.<hi>That it is the Life of the Covenant-people of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1.<hi>Religion it is Life;</hi> that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1.<hi>The true and pure Religion; It is originally, and only from God,</hi> the living God, the God of all Life, who is Life it self in the abstract, and the Fountain of Life to all living: Religion it ariseth from, and is founded in the very Being and Nature of the blessed God. If there were no such God, there could be no such Religion. Religion it is of God, both in a way of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation,</hi> and in a way of <hi>divine Operation.</hi> It is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of divine Revelation, respecting both the <hi>Doctrine of it,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>spiritual supernatural</hi> and <hi>saving Knowledge</hi> of it. It is that whereby God hath revealed himself unto man, and whereby man hath that saving Knowledge of God, and Jesus Christ his Son which is <hi>Life eternal.</hi> Joh.17.3. It is that whereby <hi>God hath commanded Light to shine out of Darkness;</hi> and (by the enlightening power of his Spirit) <hi>shined into our hearts, and given us the light of the Knowledge of his Glory, in the face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> 2 Cor.4.6. <hi>It his marveilous Light.</hi> I Pet. 2. 9. Religion, it is also from God in a way of <hi>divine Operation:</hi> It is the most powerful Effect of the quickening power and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit of God as a <hi>Spirit of Life</hi> upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: hence it is phrased the <hi>Life of God.</hi> Eph.4.8. Religion,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000353_0012_0FA554A284081EA8"/>
it is the most glorious created Emanation of spiritual, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and divine Light and Life from God, as the fountain of both. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>For with thee is the Fountain of Life; in thy Light shall we see Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Religion it is also from Christ the Mediator:</hi> It is founded in the Person, Office, and Work of Christ. The being of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the light, life, good, blessedness, and happiness of it, it is all from the Merit, Satisfaction and Intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ, and from the power and operation of his Spirit. Religion, it consisteth in our Faith in Christ, and Obedience unto Him; and in our practical, and experimental Union, &amp; Communion with his Person, and the Application of all his Benefits, even eternal Life. Thus Religion it is our Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereby we are made partakers of Christ, who is <hi>the Resurrection, and the Life.</hi> Joh.11.25. <hi>The Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi> Joh.14.6. By having of whom, <hi>we have Life.</hi> I Joh. 5. 12. &amp; <hi>who is our Life.</hi> Colos.3.4. Christ is the great <hi>PATRON</hi> and <hi>PROFESSOR</hi> of our Religion. He hath confirmed it by his own personal <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> when on earth; and is himself the great <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>High Priest of our Profession.</hi> Heb. 3. 1. Whence it is most properly called the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.<hi>Religion, it is, respecting the Principles of it, Life.</hi> The Principles of it are <hi>living Principles. Principles of Life.</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is wrought into the hearts of men, by the quickening power of the Spirit, in that saving Work of Grace, wherein we are <hi>raised from Death unto Life;</hi> wherein we are <hi>passed from Death unto Life.</hi> I Joh.3.14. Religion, it is our <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Resurrection,</hi> and so it is our spiritual Life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Religion to the practice of it, it is the only way of Life.</hi> It is by the performance of Religious Duties, that men walk in the way of Life. Practical Religion, it is the <hi>narrow way which leadeth to Life.</hi> Mat.7.14. It is that <hi>way of Life which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove to the wise, to depart from Hell beneath</hi> Prov. 15.24. It is the <hi>Everlasting Way.</hi> Psal. 139. 24.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000353_0013_0FA554A32E89DD38"/>
5. <hi>Religion, in the visible external Forms of it, in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Institutions, Constitutions, and Administrations, which are of divine Appointment, so it is the only Means of Life,</hi> that whereby God gives Life, or works Life, In which sence it is said, <hi>Salvation is of the Jews.</hi> Joh. 4. 22. Religion, it is the <hi>living Waters, the Waters of Life, the Tree of Life: which gives Life to the Nations.</hi> Ezek. 47.8,9. Zech. 14. 8. Rev. 22. 1, 2. Where Religion is, there are all the Means of Life, and the saving Improvement of those Means. Where Religion is not, there is no Day of Grace, no Means of Grace, no Life, no Salvation.</p>
            <p n="6">6.<hi>Religion, it is that wherein and whereby man is brought to God, to Christ, to God in Christ.</hi> It is that whereby we do know God, acknowledge him, fear him, believe, hope, and trust in him, love, serve, worship, and glorifie God; and whereby we come to God, converse with God, have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and receive all saving Communications from God, through Jesus Christ: It is that whereby men move and act towards, and upon God; in and by which <hi>God dwells with men on earth;</hi> it is that whereby we do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, cleave unto, and live upon God, <hi>as our Life.</hi> Deut. 30. 20. <hi>That thou mayest love the Lord thy God—and cleave to him: for He is thy Life.</hi> Thus Religion, in the <hi>Principles</hi> of it, it is <hi>Life;</hi> in the <hi>Practice of it,</hi> is the <hi>Way of Life;</hi> in the <hi>visible and external Forms and Institutions of it,</hi> it is the <hi>Means of Life;</hi> and respecting the <hi>original Object,</hi> and <hi>Ends of it,</hi> it comes from, and leads and brings us up unto God in Christ, who is our Life. Thus it is demonstrated that Religion is Life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That Religion is Life to the Covenant-People of God:</hi> that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is their spiritual Life,</hi> that whereby they <hi>live spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.</hi> It is that whereby every single Saint lives the Life of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Holiness;</hi> the Life of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience.</hi> The spirit and power of Religion in the heart, it is <hi>Life</hi> to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000353_0014_0FA554A6B6A89D60"/>
the Soul, and gives being to the <hi>New Creature.</hi> Rom. 8. 6. <hi>To be spiritually minded, it is Life.</hi> Hence Religion, it is that which makes the People of God <hi>a Living People.</hi> God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must be a living People. Whenever God takes a People to be his People, He quickens them with spiritual Life, and makes them <hi>a Living People.</hi> Ezek. 37. 6.—<hi>And ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord.</hi> &amp; <hi>V. 14. And shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live.</hi> Hence Religion, it is <hi>Life from the dead</hi> to any People. <hi>Rom. 11. 25.—What shall the Receiving of them be, but Life from the dead?</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the <hi>Jews</hi> shall be Life from the dead to the World, by a general and glorious resurrection of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Religion, it is the Life of the Covenant-People of God;</hi> i. e. <hi>It gives them their spiritual Being, and Constitution under Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Relation unto God.</hi> It gives a People their spiritual Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before God as his People, his Covenant-People. It is the essence and substance of the Covenant. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>For this is the Covenant I will make with the House of Israel after those days: I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a People.</hi> taken from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. Religion in this sence constitutes the Covenant, and is the spiritual Constitution of the Covenant-People of God. I <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>But ye are a chosen Generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a Peculiar People.</hi> It follows <hi>V.</hi> 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Which in time past were not a People; but now are the People of God.</hi> Without Religion, they were <hi>no People:</hi> but Religion made them <hi>the People of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Religion, it is the Life of the Covenant-People of God, as to their Political Constitution in visible Church-state and Order, under the Administration of all Ordinances.</hi> Religion gives a People their visible Standing under the visible Dispensation of God's Covenant, and Administration of his Kingdom; as in our Text. <hi>For it is your Life; and by this thing ye shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long your days in the Land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</hi> It was their Religion, which gave them a Standing and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000353_0015_0FA554A84FA877F8"/>
in that Land, the <hi>land of Promise,</hi> in the full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their visible Covenant Interests and Enjoyments, as the Covenant-people of God. So that it remains a manifest plain Truth from the Word of God, that <hi>Religion is the Life of the Covenant-people of God.</hi> The Application follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE. I.</hi> It is for our Information and Instruction in divers Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<hi>That there is, there can be but One only, true, real Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no more.</hi> Religion hath been, is, and ever will be <hi>One &amp; the same</hi> unchangeably. And because there is but One God, but One Lord Jesus Christ, One Spirit, One work of Redemption, One way of Application, One Doctrine of Godliness, One Faith, One Obedience, One and the same moral Worship, One Covenant of Grace, One Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people of God, One Family and Houshold of God, One State both of Grace and Glory, One Life, One Heaven; therefore consequently but One Religion. All the sincere People of God in the World ever have been, and ever shall be <hi>One</hi> in the Profession, and Practice of this <hi>One Religion;</hi> whereby all God's Elect <hi>are gathered together in One, in Christ,</hi> and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted both in Grace and Glory, unto the completion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the mystical Body of Christ which is <hi>the fullness of Him who filleth all in all.</hi> Eph. 1. 10, &amp; 23. True it is, the Apostle grants (I <hi>Cor. </hi> 8.5.) that there are which are <hi>called gods—as there be gods many, and lords many.</hi> So there be that are called religions, such religions many: But as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle concludes, <hi>V. 6. but to us there is but One God—and One Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> So ought we to conclude, that <hi>to us there is but One Religion;</hi> which is the <hi>pure Religion, and undefiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That this Religion, it is the Supreme thing in this lower World;</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> because it is, in all respects, <hi>our Life,</hi> and that nothing else is so. <hi>Religion,</hi> in the full and whole nature and

notion of it, is the most glorious effect and product of divine Wisdom, Power, Grace, Mercy, Goodness, Truth, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness; yea, of the whole divine Sufficiency, and Efficiency, in the accomplishment of all God's eternal Counsels concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his own Glory, in the Salvation of his <hi>Elect. Religion,</hi> it comprehends all the whose Interest of God, of Christ, and of his Church and People in this World; all that is <hi>heavenly, spiritual,</hi> and <hi>divine;</hi> all that is of <hi>Heaven</hi> upon Earth, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting both <hi>State, Interest,</hi> and <hi>Enjoyment.</hi> It gives a Being &amp; Standing to all Saints, both in Grace, and in Glory. Oh! Religion it is a marvellous high, and heavenly thing! All the real worth and excellency that is in the World, it is from Religion. There would be nothing of God, that is, of the knowledge of God, of the spiritual, gracious, and saving Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, were it not for Religion. Those who are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout Religion, are <hi>without God in the World.</hi> Eph. 2. 12. We have no more of God, than we have of Religion. Again, there could have been no <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Goodness</hi> in the World; had it not been for Religion. The World would have been a meer <hi>Vacuum</hi> of all good, nothing else but a receptacle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Sinners; a very Hell of Sin, and Misery; there could have been nothing of Light, or Life, or Grace, Holiness, or Happiness; there would have been nothing but Darkness, and Death, and all kind of woe; no news of Heaven, no hope of Heaven; yea, there could have been no Heaven unto fallen Man, without Religion. Religion doth in a sence, give being unto Heaven: There had not been such Place or State of Blessedness unto Man; neither had Man ever been capacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>to live in Heaven,</hi> otherwise than by this Religion. No wonder then, that God by his Word, doth extoll it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it, as the most excellent, inestimable, invaluable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable thing. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3,15. <hi>She is more precious than ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies: and all the things thou canst desire, are not to be compared to her.</hi> And it is advanced, <hi>because it is our Life.</hi> Prov. 4. 13.—<hi>Keep her, for she is thy Life.

People of Religion, if Religion be our Life, <hi>O let us then be Admonished to take heed that we do not destroy our Religion, and so destroy our own Life, destroy our selves utterly and most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, by destroying our Religion.</hi> And we are the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to give most diligent and earnest heed to such an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> and Warning; because our Lord Jesus seems to speak to these Churches, as to the Church of <hi>Sardis.</hi> Rev. 3. 1. <hi>I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</hi> That there hath been <hi>a vital decay, a decay upon the very Vitals</hi> of Religion, by a deep declension in the Life, and Power of it; that there is already a great <hi>Death</hi> upon Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, little more left than <hi>a name to live;</hi> that <hi>the things which remain, are ready to dye;</hi> and that we are in great danger of dying together with it; This is one of the most <hi>awakening,</hi> &amp; <hi>humbling</hi> Considerations of our present State and Condition. Oh! the many <hi>deadly Symptoms,</hi> Symptoms of Death, that are upon our Religion! Consider we then how much it is <hi>dying</hi> respecting the very <hi>Being</hi> of it, by the general failure of the work of <hi>Conversion;</hi> whereby only it is that Religion is propagated, continued, and upheld in being among any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As converting work doth cease, so Religion doth dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; though more <hi>insensibly,</hi> yet most <hi>irrecoverably.</hi> How much Religion is dying in the very Hearts of sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by their <hi>Declensions</hi> in <hi>Grace, Holiness,</hi> and the <hi>Power of Godliness!</hi> How much it is <hi>dying,</hi> respecting the <hi>visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of it: partly by the <hi>Formality</hi> of <hi>Churches;</hi> but more by the <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>Apostasie</hi> of formal, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Professors! How much it is <hi>dying</hi> under the prevailing power of those Sins and Evils, which are utterly inconsistent with, and destructive of the Life of it! Those Sins continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and prevailing, Religion cannot live, it must needs dye. Such as are the deep, and general <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Unprofitableness under all means of Grace, Unbelief, &amp; Disobedience to the Gospel; Formality, Hypocrisie, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Idolatry in the Worship of God; Prophanation, and Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000353_0019_0FA554AB7B432480"/>
of the House of God; Slighting and Neglect of Holy Things, Interests, and Injoyments thereof; Worldliness, Prophaneness, Sensuality. All these Sins, more especially when they are become the very Spirit of the Times, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; when they are <hi>penal,</hi> and <hi>judicial,</hi> then they will certainly issue in general, and total Apostacy; and so will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, not only the life, and power, but the external Form, Order, and Interest of Religion also. Hence how is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dying in <hi>Churches!</hi> Churches, which are constituted on purpose for the propagation, and preservation of the Life of Religion; that live, and have their being, only by the life of Religion, how little is there of the life of Religion left in them! and how are Churches themselves <hi>languishing</hi> and <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> together with Religion! How is Religion dying in <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies!</hi> through the neglect of the religious Service and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and of the religious Education of Children and Youth in Families. Truly, here, and hereby Religion first received its death's wound. Hence Religion is dying in all other Societies, among all Orders and Degrees of men, in all ways of Converse, both Civil, and Ecclesiastical. O there is little, or nothing of the Life of Religion to be seen, or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring either in the Frame, or Way; Hearts, or Lives of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Professors of it. And that which remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>ready to dye!</hi> How much and great cause have we then to take heed, that we do not quite destroy it. That is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed that we do not exchange our Religion for the World;</hi> that we do not commit that Heaven-astonishing Sin, which God charged his People with. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13.—<hi>But my people have changed their Glory for that which doth not profit. Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, &amp; be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord. For my people have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted two evils: they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</hi> They had exchanged their God, and their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the World; they had advanced the <hi>Interest</hi> of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000353_0020_0FA554AC56C66DD8"/>
World above the <hi>Interest</hi> of Religion; and thereby <hi>Inslaved</hi> themselves. <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>Is Israel a servant? is he a home-born Slave? why is he spoiled?</hi> God destroyed them by that <hi>worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> whereby they had destroyed their Religion. If once a People do set their hearts upon the World, so as to make it their highest and heart-interest, their preponderating, ruling Interest, which doth sway all, and carry all before it; when the <hi>Spirits, Principles, Counsels, and Designs</hi> of a People are all for the World, set for the promotion, and advancement of their <hi>worldly Interest;</hi> when the Interest and Concernments of Religion, yea even <hi>Religion it self,</hi> is made subordinate, and subservient to the World; yea prostituted by worldly men to worldly Lusts, and thereby exposed to all kind of abuse, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, shame, reproach, and made an <hi>Opprobrium;</hi> when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Professors of Religion are, not only in heart alienated from; but are become secret Enemies to it; when Religion is oppressed, and depressed; when it is made, not only to <hi>serve,</hi> but also to <hi>suffer</hi> under the rising, ruling Interest of the World: <hi>WO</hi> then will be to such a People: for they have <hi>exchanged their Religion for the World:</hi> therefore their Religion will dye. The spirit of the World, and of Worldliness hath been, is, and is like to be the most general, and powerful Principle of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy to the professing people of God: and it is often, yea ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, the death of Religion: It is always so, when, &amp; where it prevails.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We are admonished to take heed that we do not desert Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. If we desert it, it will certainly dye; dye without remedy.</hi> That we do not desert it by withdrawing our hearts from it; or by an <hi>Heart-apostacy</hi> from God. Religion always dyes by the People's Heart-apostacy. <hi>They set not their Heart aright—Their Heart was not right with Him.</hi> Psal. 78. 8, 37. <hi>Their Heart was removed far from Him.</hi> Isa. 29. 13. Hence God complains so much, every where, of their <hi>evil Heart;</hi> their <hi>hard, impenitent, unbelieving, stubborn, rebellious, backsliding, revolting, whorish Heart;</hi> whereby they had quite destroyed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000353_0021_0FA554ACF425BB40"/>
the life of their Religion. Again, that we do not desert Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by slighting, neglecting, and exposing the <hi>visible, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interest and Concernments of it;</hi> and so not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing our hearts, but our heads and hands also; I mean our labours and endeavours in whatsoever ought, and is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to be done and performed, for the support, upholding and maintaining of the visible Interest of Religion. Thus the People of old, in their Apostacy forsook the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the visible Worship of God, and suffered all to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ruine and desolation. They deserted the whole Interest of Religion, and so destroyed it. How much the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Sins,</hi> and the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the Times do incline unto such a deserting, or forsaking of Religion, we may consider, and lay to heart with deep Humailiation. For the more close Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Admonition, let it be considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That when Religion is once decaying and dying, is near death, even at the point, or ready to dye,</hi> (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2.) <hi>It is then high time for Professors, and a professing People to take heed to themselves, that they be no further Accessory to the death of it.</hi> When the Interest of the World riseth higher and higher, &amp; all the Sins of the Times grow stronger and stronger; and Religion is growing weaker and weaker; is already grown so weak, that it hath not life, strength, or power enough left, to recover it self: It is a fearful question to such a People, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion be not gone past hope of Recovery, at least in the ordinary way of the improvement of Means. Whether ever that Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and those other declined Churches were recovered, or no, by a resurrection of Religion, is more uncertain. Sure we are, they afterward <hi>dyed,</hi> and were <hi>buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (together with their Religion) in their own ruines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When Religion dyes, all dyes with such a People.</hi> The death of Religion destroys all kind of Life; both the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and Political Life: It destroys Church-constitution, Order, Administrations; yea it destroys the <hi>being</hi> and <hi>standing</hi> of a People before God under his Covenant. When Religion dyes,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000353_0022_0FA554ADB03BC740"/>
then <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> and <hi>Lo-ruhamah</hi> are born; then God saith, <hi>Te are not my People, and I will not be your God: And He will no more have mercy—but that He will utterly take away.</hi> Hose. 1. 6, 8. Thus that People destroyed themselves by destroying of their Religion; and remain dead and buried in their Graves unto this day. <hi>Ezek. 37. 1—14.</hi> If we should destroy our Religion, we should destroy all our <hi>Publique Weal;</hi> all that wherein we have been peculiarly happy, as the People of God. If once Religion dye, there will be nothing but <hi>Death;</hi> Death in our Hearts, Death in all our ways of Converse: we shall be a <hi>dead People.</hi> Sin and Death do always <hi>reign,</hi> when and where Religion dyes and is destroyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When a People destroy themselves by destroying Religion, they perish inevitably, utterly, &amp; most miserably.</hi> When God doth leave a People to destroy Religion, then He hath no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them. By destroying Religion, a People do put away Salvation from them, and render themselves utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof. If God let such a People alone; and execute no outward, temporal Judgement upon them, they will soon make a <hi>miserable end</hi> of themselves: for they will abuse all their Peace, Prosperity, Means Mercyes, Interests, &amp; Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unto their own Ruin; and incurre all kind of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evils; make themselves a <hi>Shame,</hi> a <hi>Reproach,</hi> a <hi>Taunt,</hi> a <hi>curse,</hi> an <hi>Execration,</hi> and an <hi>Astonishment to all People.</hi> So did that People of old. <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 18. And so they continue to be unto this day. No such <hi>vile, refuse</hi> People under heaven, as they who have destroyed Religion: Such a People must needs perish most hopelessly. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 10.—<hi>If our Transgressions and our Sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live!</hi> Observe, Religion being <hi>dead and gone,</hi> they cast away all hope of Salvation, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves desperately unto Destruction, saying, <hi>How should we then live!</hi> It is hard to produce an Instance of any People recovered, when they have destroyed Religion by a general, and total Apostacy from it: For it is the utmost height of all
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000353_0023_0FA554AE9482D6D8"/>
               <hi>Sin, Transgression,</hi> and <hi>Provocation,</hi> which moveth the Wrath of God to arise. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16.—<hi>Untill the Wrath of the Lord arose against his People, till there was no Remedy;</hi> or <hi>no Healing.</hi> By destroying of Religion, a People do <hi>fill up their Sin alway, till Wrath cometh upon them to the utmost.</hi> I <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 16.—<hi>To fill up their Sins alway: for the Wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</hi> Furthermore, to destroy Religion, it is a sin most directly against <hi>our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> because Religion, it is more peculiarly <hi>His; His Work, His Cause,</hi> and <hi>Interest:</hi> Therefore to destroy it, is a sin which doth expose a People more directly to the dreadfull Wrath and Displeasure of Christ. It is the greatest Injury that can be offer'd or done to Him; and therefore He will avenge it. We know it was the Lord Jesus who did denounce so dreadfully against all the Churches. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Else will I come unto thee quickly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thy Candlestick. &amp; V.</hi> 16. <hi>Else will I come unto thee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and will fight against them—</hi> V. 23. <hi>I will kill her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with death, and all the Churches shall know that I am He which searcheth the Reins and Hearts: and I will give unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you according to your works.</hi> The condition of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Churches is become unspeakably woful and lamentable when Christ, who is the only <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Intercessor</hi> with God to procure all, both temporal, and eternal Deliverance, and Salvation, is turned against them, and become their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: for He is the most dreadful Enemie; concerning whom it is written (<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 21.) <hi>Beware of Him, and obey his Voice, provoke Him not: for He will not pardon—&amp; Psal.</hi>

            <p>III. <hi>USE</hi> Wherein the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is to be improved, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in a way of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> If <hi>Religion</hi> be our life, and if there be so much danger of the Death of <hi>Religion. O then let all who love, and desire life; both temporal, Spiritual, and eternal life, and who fear death, so great a death; be moved to labour with all our hearts, minds, souls, might and strength, by all ways and means, to recover, and save the life of Religion which is our own life.</hi> This Exhortation proposeth and presseth all the great and general Dutys of the <hi>Covenant People of God,</hi> at such a time, and in such a case as we are. <hi>Moses</hi> applied all the whole Word of God at once, to the People by this one Word of Exhortation. <hi>Set your hearts unto all the Words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is your life.</hi> It is also the sum of all which our Lord Jesus, propounds to the declining Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.</hi> I am (though most unworthy) called forth this day, and set in this General Assembly, to speak for the life of <hi>Religion,</hi> to <hi>Plead in the Name of the Lord, and by the Word of the Lord,</hi> for the <hi>life of Religion,</hi> to plead for the life of <hi>dying Religion.</hi> Oh! were the heart of <hi>N-Engl.</hi> rightly and fully prepared, resolved, and set for the recovery and safety of the life of <hi>Religion:</hi> God would then most graciously make clear and full discoveries of our whole way and work therein, and of all the means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Yea, God himself would soon bring all to pass for us. To this end we ought to the throughly convinced of, and deeply humbled (even unto shame and confusion of Face) under the sense of the decaying, dying state of <hi>Religion;</hi> and withal charge, judge, condemn, loath and abhor our selves for all that Sin and Apostasie, whereby we have brought <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> into such a state. Under such Conviction and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, we must set our selves to labour, unto the resurrection of <hi>Religion,</hi> and that with extraordinary Zeal, Courage, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and Resolution, in the improvement of all means, with one heart, and one soul, as one man, even as for our

for Zions sake we do not hold our peace, and for Jerusalems sake we do not rest;—that we never hold our peace day nor night, give him no rest until he establish and make Jerusalem a praise in the Earth,</hi> Isai.62.1,6,7. That we henceforth transact with God, and one with another; with religious sincerity, in truth and faithfulness, in and about that great and most important business of <hi>Reformation;</hi> in suppressing all the great and general Sins? and performing the great and general Duties of the times? that we trifle, dissemble, falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no more therein, as heretofore we have too much done; and as the People of old did to their own ruin and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Jer.</hi>3.10. <hi>Nothing hastned their utter defection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction more than their formal, hypocritical Reformations.</hi> That we also labour to retrieve and raise the visible Interest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and advance it <hi>above the head of our chief joy,</hi> Psal.137.6.

God sets matter and cause of Mourning before us; the wayes and works of God towards us call for Mourning; Our Land begins to mourn under the sins of the times; God is many wayes calling to weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning, and baldness, and girding Sack-cloth, <hi>Isai.</hi> 22.12. O that sincere Christians, who have through Grace received the spirit and principle of mourning, would stirr up themselves thereunto, and beg this Grace of God; it is your Calling as Christians to mourn to be Gods mourners, <hi>Sions Mourners:</hi> O how much might you do for God and these Churches, in this frame and way of mourning.

            <p>Those particular and extraordinary <hi>Messages</hi> which God hath sent to us by his Messengers; those full and general Testimonies which God hath given by them against all the Sins of the times, and unto all the duties of the times, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in the delivery of them from the Word of God, by so many solemn Words for Conversion, whereby God hath charged us plainly, expresly and fully with all our Sin and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie judged and condemned us for it; declared and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced wrath and judgement against us, in case of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.

Unconverted Sinners must receive him, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000353_0039_0FA554BFB176DF50"/>
to him by Faith, in a way of Gospel-Obedience: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must awake and rouse up their sleepy Souls out of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ease and rest; follow him, and seek him until you have found him, and repossest your Souls of him, with a fulness of spiritual joy, pleasure and delight, in your injoyments of him, as the Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi>3.4. The Churches must give him free, full and open entrance and entertainment, in the greatest ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his presence and power, recovering their first life, and love, doing their first works; in maintaining integrity of love, peace, union, purity of communion, regularity and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of order within themselves, cleaving to his cause, interest and work, fully, stedfastly and faithfully; managing all the affairs of his Kingdom, in a way of sincere soul-subjection to him, for the advancement of his Name and Glory. O if Christians and Churches could thus prepare and dispose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the return of the presence and power of Christ, they would soon feel themselves enabled thereby, to perform all that is necessary for the recovery and preservation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; the sad cause why we have hitherto Failed in all our undertakings, is the want of the presence and power of Christ: O there is woful evidence of the want of it, until Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it, nothing will or can be done; the return of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and power of Christ will instantly infer an happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Religion; O let us seek it, pray and cry for it, under a deep sence of our extream necessity of it, and of our woful condition without it; let us be moved hereunto from the consideration of the gracious disposition of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus to return; it is yet his voice to these, as it was to those declining Churches, after he had reproved, charged, threatned them very sharply and severely; he concludes all. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open unto me. I will come in;</hi> by opening to Christ we shall do all, and obtain all salvation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That we do what is necessary for the recovery and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the life of Religion quickly, there must be a sudden, quick

dispatch, of all that is to be done for the life of Religion.</hi> It must be done presently, instantly, without delay, as we would do any thing for our life, when in utmost and extreamest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; if we do not do what we have to do quickly, it may be quickly too late, and truly it will be Gods infinite mercy, if it be not already too late, as it was to them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. O we have lingered and delayed upon utmost peril al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; it is now high time, more than time, if we mean to do any thing, <hi>Hos</hi> 10.12. <hi>It is time to seek the Lord till he come,</hi> God is now crying <hi>to day, whilest it is called to day, after so long a time, Psal.</hi>95.7. <hi>Heb.</hi>4.7. God calls for present hast, he is every way hastening of us; the dying state of Religion, and the dangerous state of this People, and of these Churches thereby, will admit of no further delay; God is hastening in his way and work, <hi>Zeph.</hi>1.14. <hi>The day of the Lord is near, it hasteth greatly.</hi> Christ hath threatned to come against us quickly, <hi>except we repent, and do the first works quickly,</hi> Rev,2.5,16.

            <p>Let the general Exhortation <hi>be humbly proposed to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God in the Magistracy: Much Honoured,</hi> It doth in the <hi>Name of the Lord, by the Word of the Lord</hi> in most solemn manner bespeak your utmost help, and your very hearts and fouls therein, for the recovery and preservation of the life of dying Religion; It is your greatest Honour that you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with so much of the care and charge of Religion, in the civil concerns of it.

Churches: It is your highest work, and (although the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest) yet the happiest part thereof, wherein you serve and subserve more directly, to the honour and glory of God, and highest good of his People: and which being fully and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully performed, will turn to your highest account in the day of Account, and add much weight and splendor unto your Crown of glory.</p>
            <p>The General Exhortation, <hi>It is also proposed to the Servants of Christ in the Ministry; the whole Order and Office &amp; work of the Ministry it is Religious: Ordained by Christ as the great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, for the Ministerial Exercise of his Power, for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and preservation of the life of Religion, by the progress of the work of Conversion and Edification among men;</hi> and that in a more direct subordinacy to himself, and subserviency to his Name and Glory in the World: who is himself <hi>the Shepherd and Bishop of Souls;</hi> it is cause of deep Humiliation unto his Servants, that they have been called forth to labour under the sinking discouragement of the decaying state of Religion; that Religion should be dying under their hand, and they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lest they should be called to minister under that woful commission given to the Prophet, <hi>Isai.</hi>6.10. <hi>Go, tell this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hear ye indeed but understand not,—Make the heart of the People fat,</hi>—lest their Ministry should in just judgment be made <hi>penal and judicial,</hi> and so become a <hi>savour of death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death,</hi> and so that they should <hi>Preach Religion to Death, and Preach this People to death,</hi> Hos.6.5. <hi>Therefore I have hewed them by the Prophets, and slain them by the words of my mouth.</hi> The fearful apprehensions of such a danger may move them to labour (though lamenting as Gods Servants of old) yet with so much the more care, love, zeal, even unto the <hi>spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and consumption of their very souls, by fervency, instancy and constancy in all their prayers and soul-labours,</hi> throughout their whole work; more especially in <hi>travelling in birth with Souls until Christ be formed in there;</hi> until they are born and brought forth to God in a saving work of Regeneration; which will

be the most certain way and means, unto a general Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Religion in these Churches. O how should they then make full proof of their Ministry, and approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves throughly, in their life, in their labour, in all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, in their whole ministerial Conversations, as those who are more than any other Order of Men in the World, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly charged and betrusted; yea set for the life of Religion and the salvation of Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Exhortation it is further proposed, as in our Text and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text unto all Israel, and Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel.</hi> It was his final farewel Exhortation <hi>to all the whole Covenant People of God;</hi> The People of these Churches, both the passing, standing, and rising Generations, are all the visible <hi>Covenant people of God;</hi> and therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it is <hi>our life,:</hi> we ought generally to care, labour, pray, cry to God for the recovery, preservation and continuance of it, <hi>as for our life.</hi> You who are sincere Christians are here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain moved by this Exhortation; (not only (as before) to keep Religion alive in your own hearts) but also to <hi>discharge your selves fully and faithfully, in whatsoever duty or service, you may can, or ought to labour for the general Resurrection of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in these Churches:</hi> More especially wherein you may be (any of you) betrusted with any of the concerns of it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Civil or Ecclesiastical; Truly Christians, the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency, the <hi>burthen</hi> of the work it is upon you, the work it is most properly yours; Because Religion it is peculiarly yours; you are under the most sacred and indispensible obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, both unto God, and one unto another to uphold it, it is the most general duty of that high, holy and heavenly Calling, wherewith you are called to be Saints, and wherein you are to approve your selves eminently the Servants of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ; for the defence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his Cause, Interest, Kingdome, Name and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherein we shall live and dye as Saints, obtaining those glorious promises which Christ made to those who laboured
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000353_0043_0FA554C59B7B81D8"/>
faithfully for the recovery of Religion in those declining Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> Rev.2.7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the middest of the Paradise of God:</hi> and ver.10. <hi>And I will give thee a Crown of life:</hi> ver.17. <hi>To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new Name which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it,</hi> Rev.3.5. <hi>He that overcometh, the same shall be cloathed in white Raiment.</hi> Ver.12. <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God,</hi> Ver.21. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to fit with me on my Throne,</hi> &amp;c. that is in Heaven: O what exceeding <hi>great and precious Promises</hi> hath our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus made for the incouragement of those who are his <hi>Sincere Servants,</hi> to labour to uphold Religion in declining times and Churches; we believe and are upon good grounds perswaded that there are many, that there are enough <hi>Sincere Christians</hi> yet remaining in these Churches, to do and perform whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is necessary for the recovery and preservation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that if you would do what you might and ought, Religion would not die but live, and flourish with much spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual prosperity. Will it not then be a <hi>confounding shame and scandal unto this Generation of New-England Christians</hi> before the World: If having had Religion transmitted to us by our Fathers (who through the grace of God, upheld it in so much of the power and purity of it, while they lived) and being still priviledged with all Religious interests and injoyments, as the highest advantages and incouragements, to preserve the life of Religion; we should notwithstanding, through our carelessness, slothfulness, unfaithfulness; suffer to decay, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and dye away; yea and by our own declensions, therein give it a mortal wound. Surely if Religion die, Christians will (in this respect) be more <hi>inexcusably guilty</hi> of the death of it than others: O let this be considered and said to heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The general Exhortation speaks also to Churches, as such:</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in the most proper sence of the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> is

most properly the <hi>life of Churches,</hi> it is that which gives them being, and which is the great end of their being. God hath constituted Churches both by <hi>Religion,</hi> and for <hi>Religion;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the great design, and ought to be the great work of Churches to propagate and preserve the life of it, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and maintaining Holiness &amp; Purity in Ecclesiastical constitution, union, communion, administrations, both of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worship; by religious fear, reverence, sincerity, and solemnity, in all Religious Assemblies, Attendancies; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and Churches transactions in the Name of Christ, by Zeal, Courage, Faithfulness, in the whole work of Christ, and in the management of all the Affairs, and the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Religion; <hi>Let him that hath an ear hear what the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit saith to the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Exhortation speaketh also unto Families; Parents, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Heads of Families, to move you to keep Religion alive in your Families;</hi> by being truly Religious your selves, in all your Family converses; by training up your Children and Servants Religiously, unto and for Religion; by exercising and upholding the Worship of God in all the wayes of it, and in the Life, Spirit and Power of it in your Families: hereby Religion shall live in Families; Thus <hi>Abram,</hi> Gen.18,19. <hi>I know him that he will command his Children and Houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</hi>

               <hi>The Exhortation speaketh to all who are the Children of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and of the Promise; though you may at present have no saving Knowledge and Experience of, or Interest in Religion, and therefore no hearts ingagement to it, or hearty care or concernment for it;</hi> but are in your present state and way, Enemies unto it. Yet O Remember that Religion is your life also; you have been born and bred up under the visible dispensation of the Covenant and Kingdom of God, in the House of God for <hi>Religion,</hi> and therefore if you have any care of your Souls, or hope of Salvation; if you would not be cast off for ever, as a Reprobate Generation; a Generation of Gods wrath; O

apply yourselves to Religion, approve your selves Religious, labour by all means to make Religion <hi>your own,</hi> in a saving work of Conversion; prepare your selves to undertake and uphold a pure and sincere Profession and Practice of it, that you may not only keep it your selves, but transmit it to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations; then Religion shall be your life also; <hi>Then the Lord your God will be with you as he was with your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he will not leave you nor forsake you,</hi> I King.8.57. And now O that all, <hi>who do understand and believe any thing, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God or their own Souls, concerning good or evil, life or death, Heaven or Hell; may at lest so far take notice of, and bare this Exhortation, as to suffer themselves <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>May we not, ought we not all, in the conclusion, to <hi>rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this Exhortation upon our Souls, by that vehement contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby</hi> Moses <hi>doth in a most solemn and awful manner (as it were) conjure that People unto Faith and Obedience,</hi> Deut.30.19. <hi>I call Heaven and Earth to Record against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chuse life, that both thou and thy Seed may live; that thou love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice—and cleave to him for he is thy life.</hi> When God doth thus set <hi>life and death</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Covenant People; and put them to their full <hi>Trial, as to final choice,</hi> O then it is their most important Duty and Interest to <hi>chuse life,</hi> that both they and their Seed may live; May we not with fear and trembling apprehend our selves: even these Churches, and this <hi>whole People, New-England,</hi> as it were standing before God, upon our great Trial for <hi>Life and Death.</hi> O that we understood that the <hi>great case of Life and

Death</hi> is now depending between God and <hi>New-England,</hi> what reason have we to take heed, <hi>as for our lives,</hi> how we approve our selves upon this great trial; that God hath set Life and Death before us, all the World is witness, Heaven &amp; Earth may <hi>be called to record against us,</hi> that he hath done it: God hath set Life before us, by setting the <hi>whole way of Life before us;</hi> his <hi>Law,</hi> his <hi>Gospel,</hi> his <hi>Covenant,</hi> his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> all both <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> good, he hath set Religion before us, and exhibited <hi>himself</hi> unto us through his Son as <hi>our life.</hi> God hath also set Death and Cursing before us, by setting all our whole way of Sin and Apostasie before us, the whole <hi>may of Death</hi> and <hi>Destruction</hi> which we have been walking in, as also by setting both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> Judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, in those Threatnings which have been denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us.</p>
            <p>This proposal of <hi>Life and Death</hi> hath been made in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>way and manner,</hi> by the concurrent <hi>voice and cry of the Ministry;</hi> more especially by such of the Servants of God whom he had made <hi>eminently able and faithful,</hi> who have finished their <hi>Testimony,</hi> and are removed: God hath also made this Discovery and Proposal of Life and Death <hi>general,</hi> to all <hi>Sorts, Orders</hi> and <hi>Degrees,</hi> to all the <hi>Churches,</hi> to all the <hi>People</hi> in all the <hi>Congregations;</hi> and God continueth thus to set <hi>Life and Death</hi> before us, by all seasons and opportunities, but more <hi>plainly, expresly, fully, and generally,</hi> upon such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and in such <hi>General Assemblies</hi> as these, and that with extraordinary Solemnity: It hath been Gods great work of late to set <hi>Life and Death, Blessing and Cursing</hi> before us; by the <hi>Ministry of his Word,</hi> and he is so doing unto <hi>this day;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is yet in <hi>infinite Mercy,</hi> crying unto us; <hi>Chuse life that both you and you Seed may live.</hi>

               <hi>By this Word, God is once more calling after this Generation of Unconverted Sinners.</hi> You who are yet in <hi>your sins,</hi> in a state and way of Sin and Death, remaining secure and senceless therein; who have heretofore, and hitherunto slighted neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,

and rejected all the Calls of the Gospel, and all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial offers of eternal life, through Jesus Christ: After all the proposals of life, after all the calls, commands, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions that you have been under, to move you to chuse Life. <hi>You are now, this day, once more called, commanded, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded; yea intreated, beseeched and prayed, in the Name of the Lord, and by the Word of the Lord to chuse Life.</hi> Our Lord Jesus is most graciously pleased by the Ministry of this Word, to exhibit himself, in all his fulness and sufficiency, of Grace and Life, <hi>all, an Alsufficient Saviour,</hi> and is <hi>crying in this General Assembly,</hi> unto <hi>New-England</hi> Sinners; <hi>to chuse him, to come to him, that they may have life:</hi> as once he did by his own personal Ministry, in a <hi>General Assembly</hi> of that People, far greater than this, <hi>John</hi> 7.37.—<hi>In the last and great day of the Feast, Jesus stood and cried, if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink, he that believeth on me,</hi> &amp;c.—You have been set, and have been continued under an extraordinary improvement of all means, in this your day of Grace, which is continued, and protracted, beyond the ordinary date of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine patience, by an extraordinary protraction of longsuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a way of <hi>probation and trial;</hi> God hath been trying, and proving of you, and waiting upon you a great while: But know that <hi>his Spirit shall not alwayes strive,</hi> Gen.6.3.—<hi>He hath limited a certain day,</hi> beyond which he will not wait, <hi>Heb.</hi>4.7. and upon a supposition, that God hath so limited a <hi>certain day,</hi> whereby he hath dated his patience and longsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and the period of the present day of Grace, unto this Generation of Sinners; you may sadly conclude, that you live under the <hi>latest</hi> and <hi>last,</hi> the <hi>final</hi> and <hi>farewel</hi> calls and cries of Mercy, by the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Word, that God will not much longer call and cry after you, nor strive with you, therefore you are warned <hi>to flee from the wrath which is to come,</hi> Mat.3.7,12. <hi>And now also the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree, therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down and cast into the fire.</hi> You are in extream danger,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000353_0048_0FA554CACEDF8A78"/>
under the power and working of that <hi>spirit of unbelief and disobedience to the Gospel,</hi> which is the Spirit of the times and whereby the Generation that is the generality of Sinners are so strongly inclined and carried out to <hi>refuse Life and chuse Death.</hi> It is much to be feared that many, if not the most, have already so done, and are accordingly in dreadful judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, given up by God unto that fatal choice, <hi>Psal.</hi>81.12. <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts lusts,</hi> &amp;c. O it is high time then; now, <hi>now if ever</hi> (because you may fear now on never) to <hi>chuse life,</hi> to chuse <hi>Spiritual, Temporal, and Eternal Life;</hi> to make that great, comprehensive, unchangeable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Choice, upon which depends not only the Salvation of your own Souls, but even the deliverance and salvation of this People, and these Churches: If you do thus chuse Life, all will be well with <hi>New-England,</hi> but if you should refuse generally to chuse Life, you will be likely, not only to destroy your selves; but all posterity: it would be fearfully signal if any sinners should be so prodigiously hardened, and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their impenitency and unbelief, as to be raised unto that presumptuous and desperate resolution with those in the Prophet <hi>Isai.</hi>22.13,14.—<hi>Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we shall die;</hi> I have no other word to leave upon such but that which follows in the next verse; <hi>And it was revealed in mine ear by the Lord of Hosts, surely this iniquity shall not be purged form you, till you die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God is also by this word calling upon his own Servants to chuse Life;</hi> though you have already made the great and most happy choice of Life for your own Souls, last spoken of; yet you are further to chuse life, that is, all the wayes and means of life, whatsoever may any way conduce unto the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the work of Conversion, and the progress of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the recovery of the life of Religion: Chuse <hi>indeed,</hi> that is, chuse it <hi>practically,</hi> make a practical choice of it, that is, chuse it so, as to make it your work: You are in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, not only to chuse life for your selves, but for others,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000353_0049_0FA554CAF94577F0"/>
               <hi>chuse life for your Families, for your Children and Servants,</hi> Joh.24.15. <hi>Chuse you this day whom ye will serve—But as for me, and my House, we will serve the Lord.</hi> It was a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the People were put to their choice; and <hi>Joshuah chose for himself and his House:</hi> Again, <hi>chuse life for the Churches:</hi> It is with <hi>a few of the sincere Servants of God to chuse life for the Churches;</hi> O chuse <hi>the way and work of Church Reformation, and all means and helps thereunto;</hi> Life and Death is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect set before Churches; if the Servants of God in them <hi>chuse life</hi> for them, the <hi>Churches will chuse life:</hi> Finally <hi>chuse life for the People;</hi> the Servants of God in their several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and stations, according to their betrustments, ought to <hi>chuse life for the People;</hi> chuse all things that do conduce to the preservation of the <hi>life of this People,</hi> in all the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned respects: O it is a great thing to be <hi>charged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the life of a People, the visible People of God; the publick weal, the life of a People hath great dependance upon the Wisdome and Faithfulness of those who are, and ought to chuse life and blessing for them.</hi>

            <p>Thus God hath set <hi>New-England</hi> between <hi>Ebal</hi> &amp; <hi>Gerazim,</hi> he hath life and blessing on the one hand, death and cursing on the other hand &amp; brought us to a <hi>Trial</hi> what we will chuse; it is Gods way and work with us so to do by all his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations; what the issue will be, what <hi>exit</hi> we shall make upon this trial, is awful, considerable. O that it might be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will of the blessed God to <hi>chuse life and blessing for us,</hi> and inable us by his spirit and grace to <hi>chuse it for our selves;</hi> and not suffer us to run upon our own ruin, by the <hi>fatal, woful choice of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein we shall make our selves most inexcusably both sinful and miserable; because we have been warned, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the charge that God hath given unto his Watch-men, <hi>Ezek.</hi>33.3,—8. <hi>The Trumpet hath been blown, and the People have been warned:</hi> It hath been the greatest care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of those of Gods faithful <hi>Watchmen,</hi> who have had
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000353_0050_0FA55C41A96F7BA0"/>
fullest discoveries of our extreamest dangers, both by sin and judgement, so to discharge themselves as to <hi>deliver their own Souls,</hi> that they might themselves be clear from the <hi>blood of all men:</hi> Hence all sorts of People and Persons have been warned, <hi>Unconverted Sinners</hi> have been warned of their danger of perishing in unregeneracy; <hi>Common Professors</hi>
have been warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their danger of perishing in Hipocrisie and Apostasie; <hi>Worldly People</hi> have been warned of their danger of perishing in their Worldliness and Sensuality; <hi>Prophane Persons</hi> have been warned of their fearful danger of being cut off in their high-handed and presumptuous Wickedness, and that with more signal instance of the dread and terror of Gods avenging justice both in their temporal and eternal destruction: <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> also have been warned of the dangerous effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of their declensions, and of their security therein: All <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of Persons have been warned; <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> have been warned, <hi>Churches</hi> have been warned, all other <hi>Societies</hi> have been warned; consequently all <hi>New-England</hi> hath been warned: warned of all <hi>Sins,</hi> of all <hi>Duty</hi> of all <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> we have had full, plain Warning, many warnings, all kind of warnings; particular, personal, and private warnings, general and publik warnings; warnings from the Word of God, warnings from the Works of God; some dreadful and terrible warnings God hath given us from Heaven, and in all these wayes we have had long warning, many years warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Lord is now by his Word testifying on the behalf of his <hi>Watchmen</hi> (more especially those who, have finished their Testimony, by faithful warning given, and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by delivered their Souls, and are at rest) <hi>that they have warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us and we have been warned;</hi> Yea, God <hi>is calling Heaven and Earth to Record for himself</hi> against us, that he hath warned us: and therefore if we will not take <hi>warning</hi> to repent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and turn to God, but perish in our Sins and Apostasie, <hi>Our blood will be upon our ownheads, the Lord and his Throne will be clear, and his Servants guiltless,</hi> Ezek.33.4. <hi>Then whosoever
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000353_0051_0FA55C431877EE68"/>
heareth the sound of the Trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the Sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his, own head—He heard the sound of the Trumpet, and took not warning, his blood shall be upon him—So thou O Son of Man, I have set thee a Watch-man to the house of</hi> Israel, <hi>therefore thou shalt hear the Word at my mouth, and shalt warn them from me,</hi> ver.9.—<hi>If thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy Soul;</hi> This God will have declared for the vindication of his Justice, in the execution of his Judgements, and that if we are destroyed by and in our sins, we may be forced to acknowledge, that God is holy, righteous and just, and that <hi>our destruction is of ourselves;</hi> wherefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>ver.11 Say unto them, as I live,</hi> faith the Lord God, <hi>I have no pleasure in the death of the Wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way &amp; live; turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye dye, O House of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whence in the close of all we have comfort and incouragement, in hope that if yet we will take warning, God is and will be most graciously disposed, in a way of soveraign and prerogative mercy, to revive, raise us up, and cause us to live in his fight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all that hath been spoken concerning the death of Religion, we must understand, that Religion, it is in it self <hi>an immortal thing:</hi> it cannot die nor be destroyed: all the powers of darkness cannot destroy Religion; although this or that people may lose the life and being of it, and destroy themselves by Apostasie from it. Yet notwithstanding Religion <hi>shall live,</hi> &amp; have its being in the World; &amp; there will be a general and glorious <hi>Resurrection of it,</hi> in the successive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of those <hi>Promises</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prophesies</hi> which the people of God in all ages have believed &amp; hoped for: &amp; God brought forth our Fathers with a <hi>gracious design,</hi> to give Religion a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this <hi>Land of Darkness,</hi> which was then none other than the <hi>Region of the shadow of Death.</hi> We have been Originally a People <hi>seperated and set apart</hi> unto and for <hi>Religion;</hi> we have

seen as much of the beauty and glory of it, experienced as much of the light, life, power, grace and blessing of it, injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much tranquility, prosperity, and felicity, in the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and practice of it, as ordinarily hath been or can be: we may therefore comfortably and confidently believe and pray, that God will keep Religion alive with us, and not suffer it to be totally extinguished in these ends of the Earth; which we believe God hath given to his Son <hi>for an Inheritance, and for afirm possession.</hi> We are a People who have yet a <hi>Covenant Right</hi> unto and <hi>Interest</hi> in Religion; yea, God hath yet a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, faithful People in <hi>New-England,</hi> who have a <hi>spiritual heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Interest</hi> in Religion; and some among them who are his <hi>Mourners:</hi> whose very souls are labouring by Faith and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in a way of deep humiliation and mourning before God for the life of Religion. And therefore (although (we being deeply and generally declined) God may cause us to pass under purging and refining dispensations: and be unto us <hi>like a Refiners fire, and like Fullers Sope,</hi> Mal. 3.2. <hi>Turn his hand upon us, purely purge away all our Dross, and take away all our Tyn,</hi> Isai,1.25. <hi>Though God may visit our transgression with a rod, and our iniquity with stripes, nevertheless his loving-kindness he will not utterly take from us, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail, his Covenant he will not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his Lips,</hi> Psal.89,32,33,34. Although God doth sometimes save his People in such a way, yet such Salvation will be wrought out by the <hi>Resurrection of Religion;</hi> which is the most great and glorious Salvation, which God works for his People in this World; and wherein he is most exalted, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and glorified: O why may not we then have and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our Faith, Hope and Confidence in God for such Salvation, as the Church, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.7,8. <hi>Therefore I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my Salvation, my God will hear me, rejoyce not against me O mine Enemy, whan I fall I shall arise; when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me; I will bare the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against

him, until he plead my cause,</hi> &amp;c. We have great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus to wait son God; because God is waiting that he may be gracious unto us, <hi>Isai.</hi>30.18. <hi>And therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you, for the Lord is a God of Judgement, and blessed are all those that wait for him:</hi> O when God thus saves <hi>New-England</hi> by the resurrection of Religion, we shall rejoyce and triumph in his Salvation; as the Church, <hi>Isai.</hi>25.9. <hi>And it shall be said in that day, so this is our God, we have waited for him; and he will save us, this is the Lord we have waited for him, we will rejoyce and be glad in his Salvation;</hi> For then we shall sing as heretofore <hi>in the height of Zion, and flow together unto the goodness of the Lord, Jen.</hi>31.12. Then will be (in a measure) fulfilled in us, and for us what is prophesied and promised, <hi>Zeph.</hi>3.12—17. <hi>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor People, and they shall trust in the Name of the Lord; the remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid: Sing O Daughter of Zion, shout O Israel, be glad and rejoyce with all thy heart O Daughter of Jerusalem, the Lord hath taken away thy judgements, he hath cast out thine enemy. The King of Israel, even the Lord is in the midst of thee, thou shalt see evil no more—the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will save, be will rejoyce over thee with joy, he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing,</hi> and Hos.14.4. &amp;c. <hi>I will heal their back sliding, I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from him; I will be as the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
