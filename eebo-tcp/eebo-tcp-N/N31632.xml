            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A DESIRE to preſerve the memory of worthy and beloved Friends, eſpecially of ſuch as have, thro' the courſe of their lives, approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the friends of God, is not only founded in nature, but ſeems evidently warranted in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God has told us that</hi> the righteous ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance <note n="(1)" place="bottom">Pſalms 112 6.</note>; <hi>and that</hi> the memory of the juſt is bleſſed (2).—<hi>Which implies the care of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, not by</hi> miracle, <hi>but by the</hi> uſe <hi>of</hi> proper means, <hi>in preſerving the memory of ſuch</hi> juſt <hi>and</hi> righteous <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: While thoſe of an oppoſite character, thro' neglect, are forgotten. Their very name is blotted out; as it follows,</hi> but the name of the wicked ſhall rot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:041779_0002_101B294180860498"/>
               <hi>From this principle, no doubt, and with this view, even to perpetuate the memory of his beloved</hi> Rachel, <hi>the</hi> Patriarch Jacob <hi>raiſed a monument over her grave,</hi> Gen. 35. 19, 20 Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath; and Jacob ſet a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day: <hi>which was known, in after ages, to be</hi> Rachel<hi>'s ſepulchre, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But there are other monuments, equally durable and more inſtructive, due to the merits of ſome departed friends, which may be juſtly expected, as they are earneſtly deſired by the living; for this worthy end, that God may be glorified and praiſed, for his gifts and graces, beſtowed on the children of men, whereby he alone makes</hi> one <hi>to differ from</hi> another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> monuments <hi>here intended, are the</hi> Lives <hi>and</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters <hi>of perſons, whoſe excellent ſpirit, chriſtian conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, profitable writings and good works, do furniſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials both to entertain and edify ſucceeding generations, who, without ſuch memorials, would entirely miſs the benefit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tis with this view, and not without ſome hopes of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this end that I have, at the earneſt deſire of</hi> one <hi>(whom I could not deny) been perſuaded to gather up ſome pious remains of</hi> Mrs. Lydia Willis, <hi>whoſe memory is precious, ſo far as I have known, to all her acquaintance— peculiarly ſo, to her beloved, ſurviving husband, near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and intimate friends, for whoſe uſe, more eſpecially, theſe pages are deſigned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Characters, <hi>I know, are oftentimes offenſive; and many unkind reflections, are occaſioned thereby, both on the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the dead.—But why ſhould any be offended at a</hi> character truly drawn? <hi>Why take offence, at a ſimple narrative of</hi> facts, <hi>or a true and faithful account of thoſe virtues and good things, which evidently took place and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:041779_0003_101B2943DFE7D8C0"/>
appeared, in the perſon's life! And this I take to be the main point, in giving a</hi> character, <hi>even to pay a ſacred regard to</hi> truth <hi>in relating</hi> facts, <hi>or things that were really found, in the</hi> perſon <hi>deſcribed. And when all is ſaid</hi> in truth, <hi>we mean not, thereby, to exalt and praiſe the</hi> man himſelf, <hi>but</hi> to glorify God in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore, to excite the living to praiſe the giver of every good and perfect gift, as well as to comfort and edify her ſurviving friends, I ſhall, in ſimplicity of heart, give a ſketch of</hi> Mrs. Willis<hi>'s Life and Character; more eſpecially as it appears in her</hi> familiar letters, <hi>wherein the genuine breathings of her ſoul are the moſt ſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, perhaps, of any way in which her ideas were communicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of</hi> theſe <hi>I have therefore ſelected a number, and given the moſt of them at large, exactly as they were written with her own hand; except a grammatical defect hath, now and then, been ſupplyed. That her letters might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their native ſimplicity, I have not ſo much as corrected ſome</hi> inaccuracies, <hi>which a learned pen might have avoided.—The principal liberty that I have taken, is ſometimes to</hi> exchange <hi>a</hi> word <hi>for</hi> ſome other, <hi>which is more expreſſive of what was evidently her meaning; and the</hi> word <hi>that is</hi> ſubſtituted, <hi>may be known by inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted comma's, before and after it, thus "—"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſome of her letters are wholly ſuppreſſed; and in thoſe that appear, ſame ſtriking paſſages are omitted, on account of the ſingular</hi> amity <hi>and</hi> friendſhip, <hi>that ſubſiſted between</hi> her <hi>and the</hi> living relative, <hi>to whom they were written; in whoſe hands ſhe knew herſelf to be ſafe, tho' ſhe wrote with the moſt unreſerved freedom.</hi>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:041779_0004_101B294567399488"/>MRS. <hi>Lydia Willis,</hi> late virtuous Conſort of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Eliakim Willis,</hi> Paſtor of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Church of <hi>Malden,</hi> after ten days ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, died there, much lamented, on the 25th of <hi>January</hi> 1767, in the 59th year of her age.</p>
            <p>She was born at <hi>Duxborough,</hi> April 1709, the only Daughter of Mr. <hi>Thomas Fiſh</hi> of that Town deceaſed.</p>
            <p>A Deſcription of her perſon, (with ſome principal branches of her character) is aptly and truely drawn, by another hand, as entered at the cloſe of this account.</p>
            <p>And yet, to compleat the view of her perſon, there is room to add, that ſhe was of an eligible <hi>ſtature</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</hi> Her <hi>viſage</hi> comely, eſpecially in youth, nor wholly defac'd in age.—On her <hi>countenance</hi> dwelt a peculiar <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>pleaſancy,</hi> ſo agreeably compoſed, as to demand reſpect, while it ſenſibly invited to near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and freedom of converſe.</p>
            <p>As a grateful acknowledgment to the father of lights, it may be ſaid, that under the influence of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and religious education, her youth was preſerv'd from <hi>blemiſh.</hi> So that ſhe entered the ſocial life, in good repute among her companions.</p>
            <p>An early taſte for <hi>reading</hi> led her to acquaint herſelf, as opportunity favoured, with <hi>authors,</hi> polite as well as religious; the <hi>latter</hi> more eſpecially, ſuited her reliſh and engaged her attention.—This rendered her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation edifying, while it agreeably entertained her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning acquaintance. So that ſhe was favoured with the beſt ſociety that her rural ſituation and the times afforded.</p>
            <p>A good talent at <hi>writing</hi> gave her the advantage of a profitable correſpondence; which many ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences occaſioned her frequently to improve.— Her
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:041779_0005_101B294892B231A0"/>
conſtitution (being of the moſt deligate and tender make) ſubjected her to habitual weakneſs, and frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing ſickneſſes; which, together with numerous other adverſe providences, made her indeed a woman of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and acquainted with grief.—She was a perſon of uncommon trials and afflictions, from her early days. Which, however, did not ſink her ſpirits, but rather tended, for the moſt part, to wake up and invigorate every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and manifeſt to others, rather than herſelf.</p>
            <p>She abounded in love and tender affections, not only to her near relations, but to all mankind.—A mind, ſuſceptable of the deepeſt impreſſions, diſpoſs'd her to joy and ſorrow, in their turns, proportionable to every intereſting event.</p>
            <p>On ſuch occaſions, her letters are moſt expreſſive of what ſhe felt.—But as croſſes and afflictions were fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to her, even from her youth. Theſe were, moſt frequently, the moving ſubjects, on which ſhe wrote.— In a very low ſtate of health, and under ſome peculiar trials, ſhe writes, to her brother at Stonington, upon his <hi>marriage,</hi> and ſettlement there.</p>

            <p>Having buried her <hi>father,</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> 1736, which gave her deep ſorrow of heart, ſhe had the trial of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her <hi>mother,</hi> in —, 1737.—This occaſioned inexpreſſible grief and anguiſh of ſoul.

to herſelf, her chief dependence was upon her <hi>mother</hi>; who was unwearied in doing for her, every thing that might relieve and comfort her. But now the creature fails. — her earthly props are gone,— <hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother forſake her,</hi> and there is none, among creatures, like minded, to take her up! Now, if no higher refuge opens to view, than what the earth and creatures afford, ſhe muſt be even inconſolable.— How ſhe ſhould be provided for, ſupported, and enabled to perform the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtages of life? were queſtions naturally ariſing, but not eaſily anſwered; until the Lord appeared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her troubled mind, by ſhewing that the <hi>fountain</hi> remained, tho' the <hi>ſtreams</hi> were dried up. This conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was not entirely withheld from her, though ſhe had not, ſpeedily, the ſenſible benefit of it.</p>
            <p>Under all the dark diſpenſations of Providence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd and referred to, in the foregoing <hi>letters</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſhe remained very much in the dark, as to her ſpiritual ſtate.—Though the ſpirit and ſentiments of her <hi>writings,</hi> accompanied with a <hi>life</hi> agreeable to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, might afford ſufficient ground of charity to <hi>others,</hi> that the <hi>grace of God</hi> was with her, yet ſhe had very little charity for <hi>herſelf</hi>; at leaſt had not the comfort of knowing that God was <hi>hers,</hi> and that all theſe things were tokens of his love and faithfulneſs.—</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of darkneſs and trying afflictions, not late in life, while yet in a ſingle ſtate, ſhe was, hopefully, led, more fully and clearly, to view and adore the hand that rules the world, and humbly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in all his dealings with her.—She roſe in ſome good meaſure, above the frowns and flatteries of human life,—made the Lord her refuge,—his holy religion her buſineſs, and converſing with him her chifeſt joy.</p>

            <p>"Afflictions are not ſo much <hi>threatned</hi> as <hi>promiſed</hi> to the children of God.</p>

            <p>Reſerving other parts of her life and character, to the hand that publiſhed them ſoon after her funeral (tho' ſome of them have been, unavoidably, touch'd in the foregoing account) I ſhall here only obſerve,</p>
            <p>That her early profeſſion of religion was followed with the exerciſes of devotion; and, abating humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, adorn'd with a converſation becoming the goſpel. Her attendance, when able, was conſtant on public worſhip and ordinances of God's houſe, where
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:041779_0036_101B2994A0D78C08"/>
her ſolemn deportment ſpoke the deep concern of her ſoul, to <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth.</hi>—The zeal which carried her up to the <hi>houſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> accompanied her back to <hi>her own,</hi> and ſpread itſelf through her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary converſation.—The <hi>godly</hi> were higheſt in her eſteem, with whom ſhe delighted to converſe upon the affairs of religion and the other world. Yet ever ſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſant, delighting to make <hi>all</hi> about her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.— Even on a bed of ſickneſs and pain, which affected the hearts of her friends, ſhe would conceal a meaſure of her own grief, and ſtrive to chear their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, rather than increaſe their ſorrows by uttering all her complaints. Her common treatment of thoſe that viſited her houſe, or fell in her way, (not excepting the injurious) diſcovered a heart full of friendſhip and loving kindneſs to all men. But her tenderneſs and dear affection to her <hi>relatives</hi> was almoſt ſingular; nor did it fail of ſuitable returns.—As a <hi>daughter, ſiſter, wife</hi> and <hi>mother,</hi> none more affectionate. The duties of each rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were conſidered as a <hi>privilege,</hi> not a <hi>taſk</hi> —done with ſo much pleaſure and chearfulneſs, and (which could hardly fail) attended with ſuch mutual endearments, as made it not eaſy to ſay, whether ſhe <hi>loved</hi> more than ſhe was <hi>beloved</hi> —As a miſtreſs, provident and kind to her ſervants, ruling with moderation and gentleneſs, to make their yoke of ſervitude eaſy, and their burden light.—She guided the affairs of her houſe with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, generoſity, carefulneſs and frugality appeared in all her domeſtic oeconomy. —Though preſſed with infirmities of body, ſhe greatly aſſiſted her worthy part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the inſtruction and education of tender <hi>youths,</hi> committed to their care (for which ſhe had a ſingular faculty, and) in which exerciſe ſhe cloſed her life.</p>

at the approach of death.—She that had long been deprived of health, and e'en cut off (in youth) from the hopes of that bleſſing.—She "that often received the ſentence of death in herſelf, and viewed the grave as gaſping for her," met the ſummons, when ſhe found it real, with much compoſure of mind.—Though under ſome clouds, and, in a meaſure, deſtitute of former mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations, yet retained a firm reliance on the all perfect righteouſneſs and merits of Chriſt for acceptance with God,— thirſting for him and the diſplays of his grace in that deciſive hour.—At a lucid interval, from the force of her diſeaſe, which had now deeply affected the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of her mind, ſhe finiſhed her work with this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and ſtriking expreſſion (in anſwer to a word that was ſpoken, concerning her going to join the angels and ſaints in their delightful work of praiſe) 'Tis not enough ſaid ſhe, "for me to glorify God in <hi>heaven</hi>; I long to glorify him on <hi>earth</hi> and in death."</p>
            <p>The following character of Mrs. <hi>Willis,</hi> heretofore referred to, was drawn by a gentleman of her intimate acquaintance, and publiſhed in the Boſton prints, ſoon after her death. Which, as it harmonizes with, and confirms the foregoing account; the ſubſtance whereof (touching her character) was taken down, by the author, before he ſaw or heard of what was printed, I hope will (therefore) eſcape the cenſure of <hi>Tautology,</hi> and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as an acceptable cloſe.</p>

               <hi>Malden,</hi> January 30, 1767.</p>
            <p>"On Sunday laſt, one o'clock in the morning, died here, much lamented, Mrs. <hi>Willis,</hi> AEtat. 59, the pious and truly amiable conſort of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Eliakim Willis,</hi> Paſtor of the ſecond church in this town.—The external graces of her perſon were uncommon.—The vivacity and ſprightlineſs of her countenance was unuſual.

Her aſpect diſcovered a quick diſcernment, a deep ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, and benevolent heart. In manners ſhe was gentle, eaſy and unaffected—A moſt agreeable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,—of a very ſociable turn,—pleaſant, without the leaſt tincture of levity,—ſerious, without a gloom,—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and devout, without enthuſiaſm,—extremely entertaining in converſation.</p>
            <p>"Her natural genius was above the common ſize,— her taſte for reading was almoſt ſingular; and ſhe excelled moſt of her ſex, in a reliſh for works of genius; books written in taſte. She had a quick ſenſe of the charms of imagination and beauties of expreſſion.</p>
            <p>"But ſubjects of divinity chiefly engaged her attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſpecially ſuch as were the moſt important and intereſting.—Her favourite authors were thoſe that placed the perfections of God, the grace of the goſpel, and our abſolute dependance upon God, through Chriſt, in the cleareſt light; and that gave the juſteſt repreſentation of our obligations, our duty and intereſt,—and that afforded the beſt rules for ſelf-examination, and the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motives to chriſtian practice.—<hi>Piety,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced in early life, was no ſmall part of her character. She appeared jealous of herſelf, with a godly jealouſy: and at times was concerned leſt ſhe ſhould be miſtaken, in an affair of the greateſt conſequence; though at other times, a ſight of the glory of God, in the face of Chriſt, removed the inquietudes of her mind; and the love of God ſhed abroad in her heart, caſt out diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fear.</p>
            <p>"She had a remarkable turn for friendſhip; and the unuſual kindneſs, courteſy and chearfulneſs, with which ſhe treated her friends, appeared to be a juſt and ſincere expreſſion of that reſpect and benevolence which warmed her heart. She highly valued ſuch as exceeded in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ingenuity.</p>

            <p>"She was much eſteemed and beloved by her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; and the worthy object of Mr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s warmeſt and ſtrongeſt affections. Nor need it be ſaid, that ſhe was very happy in the conjugal connection.</p>
            <p>"Her conſtitution was extremely delicate; and, for a number of years ſhe has been ſubject to much feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indiſpoſition, which did not however deſtroy the amiable ſweetneſs of her mind.</p>
            <p>The rules of true virtue and religion were her guide and companions in life: A dependence upon God's all-ſufficiency thro' Chriſt alone, in death, was her ſupport.— And yeſterday her funeral was attended with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and ſolemnity."—</p>
