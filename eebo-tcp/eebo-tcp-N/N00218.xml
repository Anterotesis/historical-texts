            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Preface.</head>
            <p>THE Lord Jesus Christ witnessed a good Confession, at the time when he said, To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the World, that I should bear witness unto the Truth; and he taketh notice of it, to the praise and high commendation of the Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that they held fast his name, and had not denied his <hi>Faith.</hi> Nor are they worthy of the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who, though the Lord by his Providence call them publickly to own the Truth they have professed, shall nevertheless refuse to declare what they believe, as to those great and fundamental Principles in the Doctrine of Christ, the knowledge whereof is necessary unto Salvation. VVe find how ready the Apostle was to make <hi>A Confession of his Faith;</hi> though for that hopes sake he was accused, and put in chains. And the Martyrs of Jesus, who have laid down their lives in bearing witness to the truth, against the Infidelity, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Heresy, Apostasie of the world, when Pagan, Arian, or overspread with Popish darkness: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="unknown:000280_0004_0FA45C1B758D32B0"/>
their feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace, were free and forward in their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, confessing the Truth, yea sealing it with their blood. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto Righteousness, and with the mouth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is made unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. <hi>10.10.</hi> Nor is there a greater evidence of being in a state of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then such a Confession, if made in times or places where men are exposed to utmost suffering upon that account. <hi>1 Joh. 4.15.</hi> And if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith be, in some cases, of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and necessity, as hath been expressed; it must needs be in it self, a work pleasing in the sight of God, for his Servants to declare unto the world, what those Principles of Truth are, which they have received, and are (by the help of Christ) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to live and dye in the stedfast Profession of. Some of the Lords Worthyes have been of renown among his People in this respect; especially <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi> of old, and of latter times <hi>Beza,</hi> all whose (not to mention others) <hi>Confessions,</hi> with the advantage which the Church of God hath received thereby, are famously known. And it must needs tend much to the honour of the dear and blessed name of the Lord Jesus, in case many Churches do joyn together in their Testimony. How signally the Lord hath owned the <hi>Confession</hi> of the four gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Synods</hi> or <hi>Councils</hi> for the suppression of the Heresyes of those times, needs not to be said, since no man can be ignorant thereof, that hath made it
<pb facs="unknown:000280_0005_0FA45C1D5593DD60"/>
concern to be acquainted with things of this nature. The Confession of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> of the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and of the Reformed Protestant Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad (which also, to shew what Harmony in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Doctrine there is among all sincere Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the Truth, have been published in one Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume) all these have been of singular use, not only to those that lived in the Ages when these Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were emitted, but unto Posterity, yea unto this day.</p>
            <p>There have been some who have reflected upon these <hi>New-English Churches</hi> for our defect in this matter, as if our Principles were unknown; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is well known, that as to matters of Doctrine we agree with other Reformed Churches: Nor was it that, but what concerns Worship and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, that caused our Fathers to come into this wilderness, whiles it was a land not sown, that so they might have liberty to practice accordingly. And it is a ground of holy rejoycing before the Lord, that now there is no advantage left for those that may be disaffected towards us, to object any thing of that nature against us. For it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the only wise God so to dispose in his Providence, as that the Elders and Messengers of the Churches in the Colony of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> did, by the Call and Encouragement of the honoured General Court, meet together <hi>Sept. 10. 1679.</hi> This Synod at their second Session, which was <hi>May 12. 1680.</hi> consulted and considered of a
<pb facs="unknown:000280_0006_0FA45C1D6E9B2AE8"/>
Confession of Faith. That which was consented unto by the Elders and Messengers of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who met at the <hi>Savoy</hi> (being for the most part, some small vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations excepted, the same with that which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon first by the Assembly at <hi>Westminster,</hi> &amp; was approved of by the Synod at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> Anno <hi>1648.</hi> as also by a general <hi>Assembly</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>) was twice publickly read, examined and approved of: that little variation which we have made from the one, in compliance with the other may be seen by those who please to compare them. But we have (for the main) chosen to express our selves in the words of those Reverend Assemblyes, that so we might not only with one heart, but with one mouth glorifie God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>As to what concerns <hi>Church-Government,</hi> we refer to the Platform of Discipline agreed upon by the Messengers of these Churches <hi>Anno 1648.</hi> &amp; solemnly owned &amp; confirmed by the late Synod.</p>
            <p>What hours of Temptation may overtake these Churches, is not for us to say. Only the Lord doth many times so order things, that when his People have made a good <hi>Confession</hi> they shall be put upon the trial one way or other, to see whether they have (or who among them hath not) been sincere in what they have done. The Lord grant that the loins of our minds may be so girt about with Truth, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</p>

               <p>A Lawful Oath is a part of religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, wherein the person swearing in truth, righteousness and judgement, solemnly calleth God to witness what he asserteth or promiseth, and to judge him according to the truth or falshood of what he sweareth.</p>
