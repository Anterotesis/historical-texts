            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>MATTHEW VII. 12.</bibl>
               <q>THEREFORE, ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM: FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE illative particle <hi>therefore,</hi> leads us back to verſe 1 and 2, <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged: and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> q. d. Do not judge and cenſure others, further than you would think it reaſonable and juſt for you in a like caſe to be judged and cenſured. Give no worſe meaſure to a neighbour, than you would think it fit and juſt to receive from him, could you exchange ſides, and you be in his caſe and he in your's. Or the reference may be to verſe 7, <hi>Aſk, and it ſhall be given you: ſeek, and ye ſhall find,</hi> &amp;c. Then it intimates, that, if in anſwer to our prayers, we would receive good things from God, we muſt do things fair, juſt, and of good report one towards another. Zech. 7.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015855_0004_0F9A2E9C51E33940"/>
9, 10, &amp; 13. <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the LORD of hoſts, ſaying, Execute true judgment, and ſhew mercy and compaſſion every man to his brother. And oppreſs not the widow, nor the fatherleſs, the ſtranger, nor the poor: and let none of you imagine evil againſt his brother in your heart. Therefore it is come to paſs, that as he cried and they would not hear, ſo they cried and I would not hear, ſaith the LORD of hoſts.</hi> Iſa. 1. 15. <hi>And when ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</hi> God heareth not ſinners acting in contempt of his moral law, and eſpecially the law of the ſecond table, reſpecting our duty one to another.</p>
            <p>BUT this golden rule, uttered by our Judge and Lawgiver, Prince and Saviour, in the ſermon on the mount, is ſuited to all the circumſtances and conditions of human life: very proper on the preſent important occaſion; for it is fit for all occaſions, and ſuitable for every relation; good for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and orders of men, in this evil world. The very work of righteouſneſs, by this rule, is peace; and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſurance forever.</p>
            <p>THE whole of our duty, to God and man, is briefly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up, Mat. 22. 37 on. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind. This is the firſt and great commandment. And the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. On theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</hi> They are the ſubſtance of all that Moſes and the Prophets have written, as rules of duty to God and men. Rom 13. 8, on. <hi>He that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015855_0005_0F9A2E9CCF43A760"/>
THE rule in the text is the ſame in effect as loving our neighbour as ourſelves, or a branch from that ſacred root: or it is that excellent law reduced to practice, and comprehends the whole law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and writings of the prophets, ſo far as they have taught us our duty, in our ſeveral relations one to another.</p>
            <p>THIS divine law, for regulating our moral conduct, is very plain and eaſy to be underſtood; it is conciſe, and eaſy to be remembered. Any man that has the faculty of reaſon, and a will to do his duty to his fellow creatures, by the aid of ſelf-love, may ſoon diſcern it in the glaſs of this rule. Self-love is firſt, or it could not be a rule of loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. By a natural and innocent ſelf-love, we firſt look within, and conſider what we would in reaſon have done to us, in the like caſe, and proceed to conduct in like manner towards others.</p>
            <p>AWAY then with all the metaphyſical jargon of the ſchools, or of our myſtical divines, that pretend in that way to teach us our duty; and attend to the wiſe inſtructor, who uſed great plainneſs of ſpeech, and taught the way of God in truth. <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>A VICIOUS ſelf-love and hatred of others, will render us incapable of entering into the ſpirit of the text. It doth not mean that we ſhould do to others, as an heart leavened with malice and wickedneſs, and hatred of God's law, would in that temper wiſh to have done to us. The wicked join hand in hand; aid a ſinful companion to perpetrate, and cover ſin,

But this is a conſpiracy againſt the whole moral law, and making it void: yea it is an impious, and daring attempt to joſtle the Almighty Ruler from his throne, and repeal the ſacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, and cancel all our bonds of duty to the ſupreme king. An unjuſt judge that neither fears GOD nor regards man, may thus think with himſelf, If I was in the caſe of this poor criminal at the bar, I ſhould wiſh to be diſcharged, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unjuſt it might be; I will therefore acquit him, and do as I would be done by. But the judge ought to aſk himſelf thus, if I was in the caſe of this priſoner, what could I in reaſon aſk of a judge, conſiſtent with his office, the honor of law and rights of juſtice? The anſwer would be, ſo much mercy as is conſiſtent with juſtice, the honor of government, and faithfulneſs of his office, and no more. Whatſoever in a conſiſtency with truth, with reaſon and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, we would that men ſhould do to us, ſo ſhould we do to them. We muſt not counteract our ſenſe of juſtice, the honor of law, or majeſty of conſcience, under a miſtaken notion of this rule. <hi>Him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away,</hi> ſounds as obliging us in all caſes whatſoever. But let common ſenſe bring the words to this infallible teſt, thus. My neighbour aſks ſuch a favour: if I grant it I ſhall diſoblige myſelf, five times as much as I ſhall oblige him. Could I in honor and reaſon, aſk him to injure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much to oblige me ſo little? Surely no.</p>
            <p>I WILL therefore deny him. <hi>Rutilius,</hi> the noble <hi>Roman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requeſted to do an unworthy thing for his friend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. Whereupon his friend reproached him as violating the ſacred laws of friendſhip. He then replied in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his ſenſe of honor; "I can well bear the loſs of ſuch a friend, whoſe friendſhip cannot be preſerved, but upon the hard terms of breaking thro' all the laws of juſtice and honor." This maſter-piece of human nature, merely by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light, did as he would be done by.</p>

ALL orders of men may ſoon find out their duty, if they are willing to know and do it. Thus. The huſbandman may ſay, if I followed any trade or other buſineſs for my ſupport, ſhould I think it juſt to ſet ſuch an exorbitant price for the neceſſaries of life; to uſe extortion, and make a neighbour's neceſſity my opportunity to exact more than is meet? The lawyer may ſay, was I in the place of my poor client, at the head of a needy family, could I think it juſt to exact ſuch a fee, and have my caſe put off from court to court? The merchant may ſay, was I the buyer, ſhould I think it reaſonable to give ſuch a price? The magiſtrate may ſay, was I the ſubject, could I think it juſt, to be ruled with ſuch rigour, and have my life made bitter by cruel bondage? A maſter may ſay, if I was the poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſhould I not think ſuch ſeverity hard and unjuſt, and quite unbecoming one that has a maſter in heaven, with whom there is no reſpect of perſons?</p>
            <p>WE find <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 42. 17. uſing a judicious, neceſſary, and well timed ſeverity towards his brethren; but on the third day after their impriſonment, ſays, <hi>this do and live: for I fear GOD.</hi> He muſt forſake the fear of the almighty, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The irons had entered into his ſoul, and his feet hurt with fetters. He had learned to pity the diſtreſſed, and ſtrangers, by the things he had ſuffered, and as the law in the text, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, was reſplendent in his conſcience.

            <p>THIS path of our indiſpenſable duty, is the ſure way for the lengthening our own tranquility; and our peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs are cloſely linked with our duty.

            <p>II.

But if we caſt this law behind our back, it will be interpreted, that we will not have Chriſt to reign over us. Let us not divide Chriſt from his own law, or ſeparate <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prophets from their own writings; as the infidel <hi>Jews</hi> built the ſepulchres of the prophets, pretending a mighty reverence for their perſons, while they rejected and crucified the Lord of Glory, to whom all the prophets gave witneſs. The doctrine and law of Chriſt is Chriſt. Eph. 4. 20. <hi>But ye have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> as a leſſon. So when <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prophets are ſaid to be read, we underſtand their writings. Let us then receive this law from the mouth of our gracious lawgiver, and lay up this his commandment in our hearts, or give up all the ſacred laws of the holy bible. The ſhocking conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this latter, you may prove by arguing from the leſs to the greater, in the words of him that is ordained of God to be judge both of quick and dead.

            <p>III. POINT out duty in ſome ſpecial caſes by this unerring rule.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I PRAY you, my friends and brethren, to take a tour with me over to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and ſee this divine law intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at the higheſt court of the nation, or at a <hi>Britiſh</hi> junto, laying a plot to enſlave <hi>America.</hi> But firſt allow me to take one thing for granted, which I am ſure you cannot in honor, or with truth and juſtice deny me, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the king and parliament, and all the miniſters of ſtate in <hi>Old-England,</hi> are as fully bound and obliged by this law, as the meaneſt pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants. He that ſitteth on the circle of the earth, beholds the inhabitants thereof as graſhoppers before him, and regardeth

the rich no more than the poor, for they all are the work of his hands. Diſtempered minds may have reſpect to him that weareth the gay cloathing, and deſpiſe the man in vile apparel; but God doth not ſo. He ſees the difference to be trivial and momentary. They will ſoon he down alike in the duſt, and the worms ſhall cover them. The potentates of the earth, that in contempt of God make a prey of their fellow creatures, will find ſooner or later, that God is more glorious than theſe mountains of prey. When they are brought down to the ſides of the pit, you may ſee their infamy and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs painted in lively colours. Iſa. 14. 10. <hi>All they</hi> (in the infernal regions) <hi>ſhall ſpeak and ſay unto thee, Art thou alſo become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us? Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noiſe of thy viols: the worm is ſpread under thee, and the worms cover thee.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>They that ſee thee, ſhall narrowly look upon thee, and conſider thee, ſaying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble? that did ſhake kingdoms? that made the world as a wilderneſs, and deſtroyed the cities thereof? that opened not the houſe of his priſoners?</hi> ver. 18. <hi>All the kings of the nations</hi> (<abbr>viz.</abbr> that had not been ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants but benefactors to their people, and like <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> fathers of their country) <hi>even all of them lie in glory, every one in his own houſe. But thou art caſt out of thy grave as an abominable branch; and as the raiment of thoſe that are ſlain, thruſt thro' with the ſword, that go down to the ſtones of the pit, as a carcaſe trodden under fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Doeg,</hi> an armourbearer to king <hi>Saul,</hi> has hands full of blood, makes not the Lord his ſtrength, but truſts in the abundance of his riches, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth himſelf in his wickedneſs, by the favor of his bloody prince. But God ſoon plucks him away, and roots him out of his dwelling place. They that ſet God at defiance, and truſt in oppreſſion, and become vain in robbery, will preſently feel their fatal miſtake. If earthly rulers are as properly ſtiled gods at this day, as in old-teſtament times, when they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

            <p>BUT it is time to attend on the court.—Hark!—Who is it we hear ſpeaking? Is it a <hi>Bute,</hi> a <hi>Mansfield;</hi> or by what name or title ſhall we diſtinguiſh him? <q>What ſhall we do with our <hi>American</hi> colonies? If we let them thus alone to govern themſelves, and enjoy their own laws, their natural and charter rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they will ſoon arrive to ſuch numbers, wealth and greatneſs, that we ſhall not be able to control them. In leſs than a centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the manner they have encreaſed, they will be more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with all their appendages in this part of the world. Beſides, our people will leave our lands untenanted, and emigrate to that land of liberty, and have lands of their own: and alas! our great proprietors of lands, eſpecially in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and even in <hi>Ireland,</hi> muſt become poor, or work for their living. My advice therefore is, to aſſume an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute deſpotic power over them, and aſſert our right to bind them in all caſes whatſoever. In conſequence of which openly avowed claim, we may proceed to tax<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir <hi>R. Walpole,</hi> (as I have heard) being urged in his day to tax <hi>America,</hi> replied, "I will leave that to ſome future miniſter of leſs ſenſe and more courage."</note> them by a ſtamp-act and duty on tea; obliging them to purchaſe it of us, or live without it. We may ſhow our high authority alſo by changing times and laws, curtailing their privileges, altering their charters, blocking up their harbours, ſtopping their trade, and prohibiting by our decrees their fiſhing. And if, after all, they will not ſurrender their liberties, and ſubmit to all the grievouſneſs we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, we can outlaw them by the omnipotence of parliament; we may call them rebels, ſend armed forces among them, divide and conquer them, or wear them out: then ſeize their lands; and ſuch as we are pleaſed to ſave alive, may be our tenants at will,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015855_0012_0F9A2EA2CFFC1A20"/>
and upon our own terms. Thus a greater revenue will ariſe from <hi>America,</hi> than from the conquered kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> We can then make ample proviſion for all the friends of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which at preſent we cannot do.</q> Who is this that ſeconds the motion? <q>The honorable gentleman that ſpoke laſt, has propoſed ſomething worthy of himſelf. Surely his heart is very deep. I apprehend the plan may be eaſily carried into execution. The <hi>Americans</hi> will not fight: or if they do, they will not be able to cope with the power of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> And if the nation's debt be encreaſed, it may ſoon be reimburſed by confiſcating eſtates, and other revenues ariſing from <hi>America.</hi> The ready rhino will engage many in <hi>America</hi> to promote our deſigns. King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, tho' a very good king and martyr, was impolitic in taxing the people as he did, without the votes of parliament, (for they would not abet his meaſures.) But we, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, have a good parliament, that will vote things propoſed to them by the miniſter, that muſt be ſuppoſed to know better than they, what is fit for them to vote.</q>—But are all united in this device? No.—Who is that tall, that grave, that venerable perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage? Is it the noted, the victorious Earl, from whoſe tongue a more than <hi>Ciceronian</hi> eloquence has ſo often flowed in the cauſe of his country, and in defence of truth and juſtice?</p>
            <q>
               <p>The power of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> I will not diſpute: let it be ſo, that ſhe can blow <hi>America</hi> into atoms. Allow <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to have the longeſt ſword, and ſtrongeſt arm; and by might can overcome right, and reap a large revenue of the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Can this be true policy? Muſt not every one of us give account of himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth not the <hi>Britons</hi> any more than the <hi>Americans?</hi> Is this to do as we would be done by? What if we had been driven by the cruel oppreſſions and bloody perſecutions of a parent ſtate, from our native land, to ſeek a refuge among ſavages, in a waſte, howling wilderneſs, at the diſtance of three thouſand miles; and at ſuch immenſe expence of wealth, lives, and labour, had ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the uncultivated wilds, got a comfortable ſettlement, and put ourſelves under the parent ſtate for protection; taking the public

Should we not view it as contrary to the whole ſpirit of the moral law, and a daring contempt of the God of judgment? And ſhould we not deem it an inſupportable calamity, to have them that hate us to rule over us? And do not all the oppreſſed, in all ages and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, look upon their oppreſſors to be their haters?

            <p>The turn that things took in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> we all know very well.

For the people turn not to him that ſmiteth them, nor do they (duly) ſeek the Lord of hoſts. The wicked chaſtiſing the people of God, are his hand and ſword.

and preſſes ſubmiſſion. <q>We are obliged to fear and honor the king, to be ſubject to the higher powers, to obey magiſtrates, and ſubmit to every ordinance of man, and not meddle with them that are given to change. The powers that be are ordained of God. Many of us are under an oath of allegiance: great would be the guilt of perjury if we reſith. We ought to obey the king's commandment, and that in regard to the oath of God, which obliges us to non-reſiſtance and paſſive obedience.</q>

               <q>FURTHER, we cannot withſtand the power of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> She has long in a good meaſure held the balance of <hi>Europe.</hi> We have neither counſel, nor ſtrength, nor preparations for the war. If we refuſe the decrees from our mother country, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, nothing but ruin is before us. It is the beſt prudence for us to bow our ſhoulders to bear all the burdens that may be laid upon us, rather than to make bad worſe, by riſing in rebellion againſt the government.</q>

               <q>MOREOVER, if we were in the caſe of the king and his miniſters, we ſhould wiſh for a tame ſubmiſſion. Let us do as we would be done by, if we were in their caſe and they in our's. So that our duty to God, prudence for ourſelves, and our duty one to another, as enjoined us in the golden rule, do all oblige us to non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance, and paſſive obedience.</q> If you are ſhocked at ſuch a groſs perverting the ſcripture, you will do well to conſider, that he that is firſt in his own cauſe ſeemeth juſt; but his neighbour cometh and ſearcheth him out. Let us attend to an <hi>American</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot, and hear what can be ſaid in reply. <q>We owe our firſt and chief ſubjection to the ſupreme King: and the fear of God is firſt before the fear of an earthly king. Our obedience to earthly rulers is to be for the Lord's ſake, and in obedience to him. They muſt then conduct as his vicegerents, be the miniſters of God for good to the people; act in character as benefactors to mankind, ſhepherds of the people, to watch over, feed, protect, and rule them to their, own happineſs. An earthly ruler muſt indeed be obeyed while he guides and governs in the integrity of his heart, and by the ſkilfulneſs of his hands. I readily agree in this, that a civil magiſtrate ſhould be obeyed, as long as he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers

               <q>BUT when a king breaks over the compact, violates his coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation oath, ſets aſide truth, juſtice, and mercy, thoſe foundations of all government human and divine; no more acts in character by redreſſing the grievances of his people, is deaf to their petitions, withholds his protection, yea commences hoſtilities againſt them; and becauſe they put not into his mouth what he cannot conſtitutionally demand,<note n="*" place="bottom">The taxing, at our Saviour's birth, was a mere enrolling; and a tax laid on land, or otherwiſe levying money by the repreſentatives of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for neceſſary uſes, has been hitherto approved and practiſed among all civilized nations. But to tax a people, and extort money from them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by the conſtitution of government they have agreed to, has been ſo deteſted in all ages, that we find but one inſtance of it among all the kings of <hi>Judah,</hi>

                     <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> 2 King, 23, 35. and even that, by the deſpotic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the tyrant his maſter. Nor have we more than one inſtance in all the holy bible of taxing, in this ſenſe, among the Pagans <abbr>viz.</abbr>

have a divine warrant to reſiſt a tyrant and oppreſſor, not only in the oracles of truth, but by that light and law of nature, by which we reſiſt a thief or robber, that cometh not but for to kill, to ſteal, and to deſtroy; demanding our purſes, ſpoiling our goods, and threatening our lives. This law of nature was put into us by our great Creator, has been in force in all ages, and among all nations: not to reſiſt in ſuch a caſe, is the way to receive to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnation. The Holy Ghoſt ſtiles them roaring lions, ravening wolves, leopards, bears, dragons, crooked ſerpents, and ſuch like venomous beaſts; and who ever diſputed the lawfulneſs of reſiſting ſuch miſchievous devourers?</q> But are we able to defend ourſelves againſt ſuch a potent unnatural enemy? We will not boaſt of our own ſtrength, nor vaunt ourſelves againſt our foes. We own we have no might againſt this great company of ſavages, and foreigners, and <hi>Britons,</hi> that cometh againſt us, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are to the hope of our <hi>Iſrael;</hi> our help is only in the Lord that made heaven and earth. Our fathers truſted in him, and were delivered from the numerous natives. We cannot help ourſelves, but God can help us; and it is well known that power belongeth to God, and he can ſave with many or few, as he pleaſes. And tho' we are now under his frowns, yet we hope for a reformation, and that God will return and have compaſſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of his tender mercies. But if we ſurrender our liberties, we give up the divine protection, and virtually ſay as <hi>Jehoram, This evil is of the Lord; what</hi> or why; <hi>ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> We know he is a God of judgment, and hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wrong and injuſtice. Tho' for wiſe and holy ends, he may, for a time, look on them that deal very treacherouſly, and hold his tongue, while the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he; and make men like the fiſhes, the greater devouring the leſs; yet he is the holy one of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> will ſooner or later vindicate his name. And when he riſeth to ſave all the meek of the earth, he will make the wrath of man to praiſe him. We hope he will, in his own time, judge our fees, and plead our cauſe againſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly nation, that delight in war, and againſt all that have been an

arm of ſtrength to the children of <hi>Lot.</hi> The juſtice of our cauſe gives us hope of help from a faithful Creator. If a parliament, at three thouſand miles diſtance, can bind us in all caſes whatſoever, our lands are at their diſpoſe. Strange, if they be the proprietors of <hi>America,</hi> that they never put in their claim before. When the king of the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> invaded <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to take ſpoil and a prey, he had no other pretext for his injuſtice but this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> took away my land, when they came out of Egypt. Now therefore reſtore again thoſe lands peaceably. The truth was, the <hi>Moabites</hi> had taken thoſe lands before <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s coming, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> took them from the <hi>Moabites,</hi> by the ſpecial gift and favor of him whoſe is the earth and the fulneſs thereof: and the people of God had quietly poſſeſſed them for 300 years.</p>
            <p>WE have a title to our lands by poſſeſſion; for more than a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury and half. The great proprietor of the univerſe, and the God of the whole earth has given us our lands, by almoſt as great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as thoſe wrought for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in giving them the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> It has been the practice, and is till this day, to purchaſe them of the natives; and our lands have been guaranteed to us by the king of <hi>England.</hi> Is not all this enough to make out our title? Muſt we now be turned out of the poſſeſſion, which God hath given us to inherit? Muſt we be ſervants in the land which we have ſo good a title to? When king <hi>Ahab</hi> received the ſummons from <hi>Benhadad</hi> to ſurrender, 1 Kings, 20. 3. <hi>Thy ſilver and thy gold is mine, thy wives alſo and thy children, even the goodlieſt are mine:</hi> he ſubmitted upon this tenor—<hi>My lord O king, according to thy ſaying, I am thine, and all that I have.</hi> i. e. I will pay homage to thee as my liege Lord. But the cruelty and covetouſneſs of the tyrant, like the horſeleech's two daughters, crying, <hi>Give, give,</hi> being embolden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſo ready and tame a ſubmiſſion, he proceeds to add inſult to a moſt extravagant demand; the ſubſtance of which was, that his ſervants ſhould ſearch his houſe, and take what they pleaſed, and eſpecially what was moſt pleaſant and goodly in the eyes of <hi>Ahab.</hi> The elders of the land were then conſulted. They all agree not to hearken to ſuch a cruel inſulting demand. <hi>This thing I may not do,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:015855_0020_0F9A2EA8D0BA2E48"/>
is the meſſage back. There is a <hi>may not,</hi> or a <hi>cannot,</hi> in ſuch caſes. God then frowned upon the inſulting foe. If we ſtruggle for our liberties, and are conquered, we may be humbled and reformed, and God may at length pity his people. The wheels may turn, but if we give up our liberties, before they are by violence wreſted from us, they are gone forever.</p>
            <p>THE moſt popular plea for a tame ſurrender of our all, to be bound in all caſes whatſoever, is that propoſed by <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> Iſa. 36. 16. A plea likely to prevail with people that are weak, unthinking and ſoon weary of the troubles of the war. <hi>Thus ſaith the king of Aſſyria, make an agreement with me by a preſent, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his figtree, and drink ye every one of the waters of his own ciſtern: until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. Hezekiah</hi> had given him above two hundred thouſand pounds ſterling, to turn away from him, and yet in violation of the treaty, and without returning the money, he would perſuade them to truſt him with their all; and that they may thereby better their condition. But tyrants with all their fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, are political hypocrites; and they that believe them are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared. The whole truth is not told. The whole is thus. If you will rely upon the word of one that neither fears God nor regards man, and lately proved himſelf ſo falſe to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> you may qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly poſſeſs your eſtates, ſo long, and no longer, than the tyrant pleaſes. Whom he will he ſlays, and whom he will he keeps alive. If he ſees cauſe to give your lands to his ſoldiers, he will carry you to a land (and it may be) as good as your own: but it will not be your own. You will be poor and ſtrangers in it, and far from the holy land. Is this to better one's condition? But you may ſay, if I was the prime miniſter of ſtate in <hi>England,</hi> I ſhould wiſh for a ſurrender of <hi>American</hi> liberties, and we muſt do as we would be done by. If you was as blind and infatuated as all tyrannical mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and in their place, you would, doubtleſs, do as they do. So, if you was a wolf, you would wiſh to have the ſheep tamely ſubmit to be devoured; and if you was a devil, you would go about as a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015855_0021_0F9A2EA9A2770750"/>
roaring lion ſeeking to devour. But this is not the ſenſe of the rule. If you was a <hi>Briton,</hi> could you in reaſon, conſcience and honor, deſire ſuch a tame, unmanlike, daſtardly ſubmiſſion in <hi>America?</hi> If not, then by this rule you cannot find yourſelf obliged to ſurrender. I ſpeak as to wiſe men; judge ye what I ſay. Weigh the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſtand up in ſelf-defence, or yield yourſelves as willing ſlaves, and entail bondage upon your children; who, perhaps, may riſe up and call you curſed; but if you ſtruggle and are conquered, your own conſciences will not reproach you, and your children may riſe up and call you bleſſed, on account of your faithful endeavours. And who can tell how ſoon the tables may be turned? The great God may appear for us, and make <hi>Britons</hi> to know that the heavens do rule: that he whoſe name alone is Jehovah is the moſt high over all the earth. Let us do our duty and leave the event with God, who will certainly ſhew that he rules in <hi>Jacob</hi> and to the ends of the earth, being king of nations as well as king of ſaints, and will plead our cauſe. He ſtyles himſelf a God that bringeth down high looks, and ſaveth the afflicted people; and hath ſaid, by ſtrength ſhall no man prevail.</p>

Now, ſirs, I requeſt your patience, hoping you will take a turn with me to the metropolis of that State, to which we were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed in 1764, enter their cabinet, and attend to the ſtate politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <q>If the <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants on our northern borders were annexed to us, we might lay claim to their lands, and fill our purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, by granting patents, and get a large ſhare of thoſe lands into our hands. This will greatly impoveriſh the new ſettlements, and bring them low. We may ſet up officers over them, that will promote our deſigns, and eſtabliſh courts ſo numerous and expenſive, as to be too heavy for them to bear: by all which many will become our tenants. We may enlarge the quit-rents, and hold them ſubject to ſpecial writs from this chief ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and keep them low. Now is the time. Let us not conſult them. They will oppoſe the motion here and in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> But let us write to the king, and repreſent it as for their intereſt to be annexed to us, and requeſt it as a favor.

And conſidering the plan formed to ſubjugate theſe Colonies, and conſidering who is on the throne, and about it, we ſhall be eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. And if by an arbitrary act, they ſhould be annexed to us, it will be a good ſtep to teach the <hi>Americans</hi> ſubmiſſion to deſpotic government, and will bring us under ſpecial obligations to ſtand by them in all their future advances of arbitrary power. And as for the new ſettlers, poor people, they will not be able to withſtand the royal authority, and ſo they may in the event be to us, what <hi>Ireland</hi> is to <hi>Britain.</hi>

            <p>THE wicked plotteth againſt the juſt, and gnaſheth upon him with his teeth: the Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth that his day is coming. A ſnare did not uſe to be laid in the ſight of any bird. The new ſettlers are about their neceſſary buſineſs, and are little aware of the pit that is made, and the ſnare hid for them. But doth the cabinet afford no patron for injured innocence? Have the oppreſſed no comforter, while on the ſide of their oppreſſors there is power? Yes, beloved. For juſtice ſhall not be wholly run down, without a witneſs for it's injured rights. There was a <hi>Nichodemus</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> court, that could ſay as much for an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, abuſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as he ought to have ſaid for the worſt of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals. Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and know what he doth? And there was a <hi>Lot,</hi> you know, even in <hi>Sodom,</hi> that could plead the laws of friendſhip, and ſacred rights of hoſpitality, on behalf of the two angels his gueſts. Hear one then, even in the cabinet, that fears God, and regards man; is judicious, juſt, and hating covetouſneſs; that wiſely knows that the exacting money for patents of thoſe that came honeſtly by their lands, is but picking their pockets at the expence of juſtice; and that treaſures gotten by deceit, or a lying tongue, are a vanity toſſed to and fro of them that ſeek death. <q>Are you in earneſt,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015855_0023_0F9A2EAB110131F8"/>
gentlemen? Is it poſſible? Can ſuch policy as this be harboured a moment in our cabinet? Don't we all acknowledge a God that judgeth in the earth? And ſhall not the meaſure we mete to others, be meaſured to us again? Will not a faithful Creator take their part, and have reſpect to the work of his hands? Shall we not ſet the cries of the widow, the fatherleſs, and afflicted againſt ourſelves? Shall we that now hate them in practice, get to be rulers over them? Hatred is often covered by deceit, but love is without diſſimulation. Let us follow the dictates of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and charity, and do as we would be done by. They have now already got as good a title to their lands, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> government can give; if this muſt fail, other titles may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion, and the public faith be no foundation to build our intereſts upon. Shall titles of lands fail, and private property be changed, by being annexed to a different government under the ſame king? Who ever thought of ſuch a nonſenſical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of private property, by all the additions to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> or <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> from the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay?</hi> I had rather be confined to our preſent limits, than to have them enlarged by ſuch groſs deceit, iniquity, and injuſtice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL leave it to you, gentlemen, to decide upon the premiſes; and only add, that the late governors and courtiers of <hi>New-York</hi> muſt, as well as we, be judged by this perfect law of liberty; and all their conduct towards theſe plantations, be weighed in that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; and he that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now, beloved, if you are not quite exhauſted by hearing ſo many hard and ungrateful things, I muſt intreat you to retire with me, and let us hold a conſultation among ourſelves. Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, take advice one of another, and ſpeak our minds freely. The queſtion now to be diſcuſſed is, Are we obliged by the perfect law of love and liberty, to continue under the yoke of that ſtate, to which with ſo much injuſtice we were annexed? We muſt be free with, and friendly to one another, as companions in tribulation: with a mutual fellow-feeling together, and a genuine tenderneſs for
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015855_0024_0F9A2EAC135EA610"/>
our offspring; keeping all along in view the common cauſe of theſe injured and oppreſſed ſtates. We all know the woe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the word of God, againſt them that decree unrighteous decrees, and write the grievouſneſs that they have preſcribed; and that all the unrighteous acts in the world are in contempt of the God of judgment; ſo that all the world ought to diſcard them, if able to do it. Such arbitrary, unjuſt acts, are never ratified in heaven. It is ſuppoſed that the open ſons of <hi>Beliel,</hi> that will endure no yoke, perpetrating their wickedneſs in contempt of all law; do not ſo exceedingly provoke the Lord, as the miniſters of juſtice, framing miſchief by law. Theſe latter do in effect make the Supreme Ruler to ſerve with their ſins, and uſe his authority againſt himſelf. Let us call in ſelf-love to our aid, and our juſtice and charity begin at home. We are chiefly from <hi>New-England;</hi> our genius and temper, and the laws we have been accuſtomed to are very different from thoſe of <hi>New-York.</hi> Hence it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſed, that theſe counties would have been three or four times as numerous, at this day, had they never been annexed to that ſtate. And ſhould we continue a few years more in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, and the quitrents be exacted according to the late reſolve of their convention, for the time paſt, as well as now to come; we muſt ſoil our lands, if we can find buyers, at leaſt in part, in order to pay them. The encreaſe of our inhabitants will be retarded. But let us for a minute ſet all theſe aſide, and conſider our diſtance from the chief ſeat of government, ſome three, and ſome four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles from the chief place of trade and buſineſs. How is it practicable for us to be repreſented, in their aſſemblies, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure anſwerable to the exigences of theſe remote plantations? A tender God enjoined his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 17. 14, on, to ſet no other as king or ruler over them but (as it is expreſſed) <hi>one from among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet king over thee: thou mayeſt not ſet a ſtranger over thee, which is not thy brother.</hi> ver. 20. <hi>That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren.</hi> It is elſewhere mentioned as a curſe, to have them that ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e us to rule over us. We know men by their fruits. Actions are more invincible proofs than words.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015855_0025_0F9A2F9F8F6E3200"/>
We look upon all to be ſtrangers that have no fellow-feeling with us; and all thoſe as our brethren, that are afflicted in all wherein theſe plantations are afflicted. Now, if you find yourſelves obliged to think that the rulers of that ſtate hare us, are ſtrangers to us, ſtand aloof from our ſore, have forged chains for us, and lift up themſelves above us, not owning us as their brethren:—How, in the name of reaſon, can you expect they will aſſiſt us in opening a trade to the lake, in erecting thoſe mechanical works, that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in theſe remote parts? It is no pleaſure to me to renew your ancient griefs. But I muſt drop a few words. You have the feelings of humanity; judge ye what I ſay. Is it reaſonable? is it juſt? is it for the public weal? that an infant county, after the expence of a court-houſe and goal, ſhould have four county courts in a year, and to all theſe three or four times the number of jurymen be ſummoned, at the nod of a petty deputy-ſheriff, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s neceſſary? And if any, at two days warning, tho' without an horſe and caſh, do not attend, at the diſtance of thirty, forty, or fifty miles, and ſtay the whole week, or till diſmiſſed, upon their own coſt, while they have nothing, or next to nothing to do: in a few days almoſt the only ſupport of their poor families, except bread, muſt be ſeized by the officer. Is this juſtice? Is this to maintain the honor of government? Doth not righteouſneſs, at this rate, ſpring up as poiſonous hemlock in the furrows of the field? Doth it conſiſt with juſtice, with mercy, with humanity, or with any thing laudable and praiſe-worthy, even among Pagans, to govern ſuch infant ſettlements (or any other) by a law, in virtue of which a poor neighbour, at a ſmall diſtance, may have his cow taken from him for a note of hand for three ſhillings with coſt? Who that has one ſpark of humanity, but would ſooner loſe a dozen ſuch trifling debts, than to be the maker, or executor of ſuch a law? But I could wiſh many paſt things might be buried in oblivion, provided we might, with the conſent of our neighbouring ſtate, enjoy liberty and wholeſome laws for the time to come. Is it then? I appeal to reaſon, to conſcience, Is it the mind of our gracious King, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this perfect law of love and liberty, that we continue annexed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015855_0026_0F9A2FA0CB1835C0"/>
to that ſtate, againſt the whole grain of our nature and education, and againſt thoſe principles of juſtice, reſplendent in your conſciences; and contrary to the moſt apparent intereſts of theſe territories? So ſpeak ye, and ſo conduct in this weighty affair, as they that expect to be judged by this perfect law of liberty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. BE ſo good now, my brethren, as to take a tour with me to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> and attend a few minutes to the grand council of theſe <hi>American</hi> States. We conſider them as defenders of truth, juſtice and mercy; the patrons of liberty, and advocates for the rights of mankind. We long to hear what paſſes among them, relative to our affairs, and ſhall watch to catch any thing out of their mouth in favor of our tranquility and freedom. But let me ſtir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, that theſe our political fathers will ſpeak and act in character: they have no creating power to relieve us, but can do nothing againſt our liberty: yea, they may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encourage us that, if we may be made free, to uſe it rather.</p>
            <p>IT is hoped diſcretion and prudence will guide us, according to the honeſty of our deſigns in ſo nice a point as our union with theſe States.</p>
            <p>WE read of one of good underſtanding in the fear of the Lord; and that God's ſervant ſhall deal prudently; and of a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which all they have that do his commandments: and we find the fearer of God guiding his affairs with diſcretion. But we are as well aſſured, that a great oppreſſor is void of underſtanding; and that oppreſſion, or a temper and reſolution to oppreſs, maketh a wiſe man mad; ſo that the wiſeſt counſellors of a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come brutiſh in their knowledge. They that diſcard truth and juſtice, do, in point of prudence, loſe their ſenſes, as is evident by the holy bible, and hiſtory of all ages. Being hood winked by bribes, or blinded by pride, covetouſneſs and a luſt of power; they appear as much infatuated in their politics, as viciated in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Such may apply to the God of judgment to ſucceed their cruel plots, or to men in authority, to ſupport, beyond their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, their unjuſt claims, but know not what they aſk of God or men;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015855_0027_0F9A2FA10FE565A0"/>
and are as much loſt to the dictates of good ſenſe, as to the rights of juſtice; but I hope better things of this honorable convention, and that a prudent conduct will be added to the goodneſs of their cauſe, and honeſty of their intentions. How otherwiſe can we, in a rational way, and by the obſervation of all ages, account for that wiſdom, that has hitherto guided the chief council of theſe ſtates; commanding ſuch univerſal reverence, from them; as alſo from the wiſeſt men in <hi>Europe:</hi> but that they have all along ſet the ſupreme Ruler before them, and kept truth, juſtice and mercy ever in view? You will then judiciouſly conſider, they can do neither more nor leſs, for us than as they act for all theſe united States. They may defend and eſpouſe the cauſe of any parts or members oppreſſed; but they cannot oppreſs, or hurt us. They may do good, but cannot do evil: as the apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us then attend to what paſſes in that auguſt aſſembly, and wait a while for the iſſue. Hearken! Who is this that ſpeaks? Is it a member from that ſtate that has cauſed ſo much grief and trouble to theſe counties? We ſhall ſoon know by what he faith. How embarraſſed! not by the dictates of his own reaſon, which might lead him to eſpouſe the cauſe of an oppreſſed people, but inſtructions from his conſtituents, may have plunged him into this viſible confuſion. A bad cauſe indeed, that cannot be defended without ſuch perplexity! <q>The three counties that deſire the countenance of this board, as a new <hi>American</hi> State, were taken from <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and given, or ſold to us by a royal edict: our then ſo kind and good king was to have no ſmall income from thoſe lands, by the largeſt quitrents ever paid on the continent. Our convention, upon this turn of times, have reſolved themſelves to be all one a king, to receive thoſe quitrents, which will be all loſt to our ſtate, if they ſhould be encouraged to ſet up as a ſtate by themſelves. Our convention, in June 1776, was ſo kind to them, as to grant ſeveral companies of rangers for their defence, which calls for more grateful returns, than their revolting from our juriſdiction. Protection calls for allegiance. It will be
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015855_0028_0F9A2FA1D11A4FA8"/>
much to the injury of our ſtate to be ſo diſmembered, and loſe out dominion and tribute money. If ſuch a rebellion againſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be winked at by this board, we may perhaps withdraw from it, at the call of our conſtituents, and ſo break the happy union of theſe ſtates.</q> With as many more arguments as come into his mind, and as little to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>How forcible are right words, but what doth ſuch arguing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove?</p>
            <p>BUT we long to bear what is ſaid by ſome impartial diſintereſted member, that knows no man after the fleſh, whoſe ſoul abhors tyranny in <hi>America,</hi> as well as in <hi>Britain:</hi> and being inſpired with the feelings of humanity, cannot ſtand aloof from our ſore.—<q>Thoſe <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Grants were never annexed to the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi> by their own conſent, but as horſes and cattle are ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one to another by the will of their deſpotic maſters. And their taking the advantage of the change, to put the poor people to the coſt of another title to their lands, was carrying the matter of private property, in this caſe, further than many civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Pagans have done, in caſe of conquered nations. I ſhould have thought, that no man that knew any difference between right and wrong, (meum and tuum) could have hit upon ſuch a project to get money. And this convention appears to me an heavy burden, which they are no longer able to bear. And if the ſtate of <hi>New-York</hi> have ſhewed kindneſs to thoſe plantations, by granting money for about 200 rangers for their defence; it may ſerve as ſome juſt compenſation for the injuries they have received. I would not expoſe any men or body of men further than juſtice and truth oblige and neceſſity urges; yet I muſt ſay, on this criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal occaſion, that (as I have learned) the convention of <hi>New-York,</hi> in that affair, acted in their ſimplicity, and knew not any thing of the circumſtances of thoſe remote ſettlements.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>THOSE rangers were granted without the knowledge or requeſt of the people in thoſe parts, at the motion of one ſingle man who attained the chief command: and if any repreſentatives from the counties joined in the motion, it was chiefly from his repreſentation. And tho' both officers and ſoldiers would freely
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015855_0029_0F9A2FA28FD7A230"/>
turn out with the militia in thoſe parts upon any alarm, yet when under orders as rangers they were eſteemed rather a nuiſance than a defence, and innocently the waſters of the public money. And muſt a people be obliged by a courteſy, they never requeſted, and which was no favour to them, to be perpetual ſlaves to their mere nominal benefactors? I depend upon it, the people there know better than to purchaſe miſtaken favours at ſo dear a rate. But ſuppoſe the favour of thoſe rangers as great as was ever propoſed, to barter their liberties for it, is to give a moſt extravagant price. We all think the being bound by <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to an abſolute ſubmiſſion in all caſes whatſoever, too great a recompence for her protection. This miſapplied expence ſhews that the divine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is beſt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that not ſtrangers but our brethren rule over us; that know our wants and circumſtances. Had <hi>Vermont</hi> then been a State independent of <hi>New-York,</hi> all the expence of thoſe rangers had been ſpared. We find the <hi>Britons</hi> to be ſtrangers to us, and making groſs miſtakes about us, when they meddle with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal polity. Colonies, at ſuch a diſtance from their rulers, are treated with contempt. The rulers lift up themſelves above their brethren. And many things are done by the rulers which ought not to be done; and many things, which the public good requires, are ignorantly or careleſly omitted. I ſee not therefore, but thoſe counties have a natural right to freedom, and a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to aſſert it. For my part, I cannot but commiſerate their caſe and feel for their paſt ſufferings. I know the heart of the oppreſſed, for I myſelf have been ſeverely ſcourged by that iron rod. My life has been threatned and endangered, for no other cauſe, but the ſacrificing my intereſts, and riſking my honor and life, in defence of my injured, oppreſſed country. Nothing gives me greater pleaſure, than to be happily inſtrumental to undo the heavy burdens and let the oppreſſed go free, and to break every yoke of injuſtice and oppreſſion. I rejoice to find in thoſe remote parts wiſdom and manhood in aſſerting their rights as men; and ſo great a unanimity in the general cauſe. Let us encourage them. Their advancement will be the glory of the <hi>American</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:015855_0030_0F9A2FA351612090"/>
union. We hope to be free, and that all <hi>America</hi> will be ſo, and the cries of the oppreſſed heard no more, in theſe weſtern climes. Truth, juſtice, and mercy, can never do wrong to the ſtate of <hi>New-York.</hi> I wiſh the lengthening of their tranquility; but cannot do evil that a falſe and miſtaken good may come to them. If they withdraw from this board, becauſe we cannot become oppreſſors in their favor, it is hoped they will not boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſuffering for righteouſneſs ſake. I muſt therefore, (I ſpeak for one) cordially bid them welcome to a ſeat at our board, as the addition of another ſtate to our happy union; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but other the worthy members, touched with the ſame feeling for their diſtreſſes, and inſpired with the ſame patriotic zeal, for the rights of mankind, will concur in the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IV. APPLICATION, by way of inference and addreſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Infer.</hi> THE God of heaven doth wonders for an oppreſſed people. The wheels of Providence are full of eyes; and there is often as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. He firſt humbles and proves them, and then doth them good in their latter end. The God of grace knows his own thoughts of peace and mercy to a people, even while he ſuffers a ſpirit of unrighteouſneſs to prevail againſt them. Maketh the ravens to feed <hi>Elijah,</hi> and bringeth meat to his people out of the eater, and out of the ſtrong ſweetneſs. Had <hi>Great-Britain</hi> continued her protection and faith and juſtice to theſe ſtates, we ſhould never have thought of a change at this time. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were colonies more cloſely attached to the mother-country, or royal family, than theſe now independent ſtates. Not one in a thouſand among us, but was cordially well affected to <hi>George</hi> the third. Who but a wonder-working God, could ſo ſoon have united ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a people of different intereſts, in ſuch an entire and eſtabliſhed alienation both from <hi>Britain</hi> and the royal houſe? The <hi>Britons</hi> have been the inſtruments. The way of man is not in himſelf. God left them to take ſuch meaſures, and perſiſt in them, againſt our petitions, and againſt the remonſtrances of the wiſeſt men in <hi>Britain.</hi> It was of God to rend theſe colonies from the parent ſtate, and wean us from it. So had we continued under
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015855_0031_0F9A2FA40F5BEE38"/>
               <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> we ſhould likely, never have thought, at this time, of forming into a State by ourſelves, whatever our oppreſſors intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God has made them the tools of his providence, Pſal. 9. 15, 16. <hi>The heathen are ſunk down into the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion; ſelah.</hi> The two laſt words intimate that we muſt ſtop, make a ſolemn pauſe, and deeply conſider ſuch a wonderous work of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Infer.</hi> OUR paſt ſufferings are adapted to make us tenderly affected one to another; and ſo lay a foundation for our future peace and union. If this law of love becomes the fundamental principle of our ſtate, we may differ in ſentiment, without the leaſt diſaffection one to another. Hence the exigences of any part, will be felt by the ſeveral members as their own. No man will live to or for himſelf alone, but as members one of another. So we may in the event count it all joy, that we have fallen into divers tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as ſerving to prepare us for future proſperity and peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Infer.</hi> THAT all treacherous dealing, for or againſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is contrary to the light of nature, and the perfect law of liberty in the text. Treaſon in every ſhape is abhorrent to human nature, and deteſted among all nations, and in all ages of the world. We muſt act openly, honeſtly and faithfully in all we do for the public; and never betray ſo much as one private friend: be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in what we undertake, and never act under a cloak. I ſcarce ever read a worſe character than that of Lord <hi>Lovet,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> rebel, executed at Tower-hill 1745, "<hi>True to no king, to no religion true.</hi>" i. e. Diſſimulation and deceit, treachery and hypocriſy, unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and double dealing, were interwoven thro' the whole web of his conduct in religion and politics. We muſt not turn traitors, tho' to ſave our country, or do ſo great an evil that good may come. Dare to be true, to be honeſt and fair, and leave the event with God. This is the way to have the bleſſing of God, and the favor of all men of true honor.<note n="*" place="bottom">When <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had vanquiſhed his rival <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the empire at <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſent for <hi>Herod</hi> the great out of <hi>Judea,</hi> who had joined his rival againſt him. It was expected his life muſt go. But when he came before the emperor, and ſenate of <hi>Rome,</hi> in a manly and gallant ſpeech, owned he had ever been true and faithful to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and would have ſhed the laſt drop of his blood to ſave him. But now, ſince he is no more if he might be taken into ſavor with his preſent majeſty, he ſhould be as true and faithful an ally to him, as he had been to the other. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and ſenate were charmed with his manly ſoul; did not diſgrace him; yea loaded him with new ſavors. Honeſty is the beſt policy.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:015855_0032_0F9A2FA4D0D1D110"/>
4. <hi>Infer.</hi> IT is our duty and prudence to treat with juſtice, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and a generous compaſſion, all that differ from us with reſpect to meaſures, while they profeſs friendſhip to the country, and act nothing againſt it. All that openly join with our oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, I leave to truſt in oppreſſion, to become vain in robbery, and take the event. We muſt wait to ſee how the ſhip, in which they have embarked their all, rides out the ſtorm. We leave all that privily aided and influenced <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to theſe hard meaſures, to him that will ſhortly make inquiſition for all the blood ſhed, in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and fatal war. Thoſe that enjoy privileges and protection among us, while they ſecretly practice deceit and aid our enemies in oppreſſing us, I muſt leave to our enemies contempt, and their country's abhorrence; for a prey to their own conſciences, and to the judgment of him that in all caſes requires truth and ſincerity in the inward parts.</p>
            <p>BUT there are numbers in theſe ſtates, that cannot ſee as we do; that are conſcienciouſly engaged not to act againſt us. They fear we are hurting ourſelves, and ruining the country. They cannot ſee that the kingdom was given to <hi>George</hi> the third only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the people, but to <hi>David</hi> of old, under a theocracy, by a covenant of ſalt; and that, nevertheleſs, it was a juſt and manly thing in the ten tribes to refuſe an abſolute ſubmiſſion to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> to be bound in all caſes whatſoever, after his haughty, imprudent menaces, and telling them of a yoke more grievous, and even of whips and ſcorpions. They cannot wiſely conſider that <hi>Rehoboam'</hi>s infatuation was from the God of judgment, and the revolt of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en tribes by his order and counſel: and ſhewed a manly ſoul.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015855_0033_0F9A2FA5911C18B0"/>
For is <hi>Iſrael</hi> a ſervant? is he a home-born ſlave? No, he is free born. God forbad <hi>Rehoboam</hi> therefore to attempt by war to bring back the kingdom to the houſe of <hi>David;</hi> as it was of God, that they were diſmembered from it. Their ſin was the rejecting not a ſtupid, imprudent, infatuated <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> but the whole houſe of <hi>David,</hi> in contempt of the covenant of ſalt, for the infamous ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> and without doubt too much raſhneſs and fury attended. Theſe our weak brethren cannot ſee that all that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> could in juſtice and manhood have done with us, ſuppoſing us to have erred in not making ſuch an abſolute ſubmiſſion to them as is due only to the Supreme King, was only to withhold her protection and trade; but to cut our throats, becauſe we will not be at ſuch enormous expence for them, is a puniſhment ſo inadequate to the fault, (if it be a fault) as quite ſhocks our underſtanding. They cannot ſee that a compact groſly violated on one ſide, diſcharges the obligation on the other. What ſhall we do with theſe our weak brethren? To perſecute and oppreſs them on account of their political weakneſs, will ſerve only to confirm them in their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and may harden them againſt their country. Weak people are leaſt able to endure a ſevere diſcipline. Till ſuch by a fair and impartial trial are convicted of ſome overt act, againſt the common cauſe, we that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe ourſelves. <hi>Ye,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>ſuffer fools gladly, ſeeing ye your ſelves are wiſe.</hi> q. d. Ye have the heart felt joy of being wiſe and judicious yourſelves, this ſhould influence you to a generous compaſſion towards the ignorant, and ſuch as are out of the way. It ſeems to me both our duty, and for the common good, to endeavor by a friendly, courteous, and faithful ſpirit towards theſe miſtaken friends, to win and attach them to us. They may be cordially won, and drawn by the cords of a man and bands of love; but all hard ſpeeches and ſevere treatment, tend to alienate them forever; and may be the unhappy occaſion of their own and families ruin. Pride in our own ſuperior wiſdom will blind our eyes, and betray us into a fooliſh and miſplaced ſeverity towards thoſe, that do not, with what we in pride may call a due
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015855_0034_0F9A2FA64F6BF7B0"/>
reverence, come into our ſentiments. But an humble ſenſe of the law of liberty, will lead us to treat them in the ſame humble and obliging manner, as we ſhould think it ſit to be treated by them, if they were in our caſe, and had all our wiſdom, and we in their's, with all their weakneſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Infer.</hi> We muſt yield to this golden rule and law of liberty, before a merciful deliverance from our preſent troubles. Oh! when ſhall the hearts of the fathers be turned to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, and the hearts of the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the wiſdom of the juſt; that we may be a people ready and prepared for the Lord to command deliverances for our <hi>Jacob?</hi> We are now loudly called to reform, to amend our ways, and our doings which have not been good; to acquaint ourſelves with God and be at peace, that thereby good may come unto us. Here we muſt begin, if we mean to comply with the text; and put away thoſe crying ſins that have exceedingly provoked the Lord to leave proteſtants to bite and devour one another. Our iniquities correct us, and our backſlidings reprove us; let us know and conſider that it is an evil thing and bitter, that we have forſaken the Lord, the only hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and forgotten our reſting place. The fooliſh people that blaſpheme God, and his enemies that take his name in vain, muſt be reformed, and learn to fear that glorious and fearful name, the LORD our God. For becauſe of ſwearing the land mourneth under the ſad tokens of the divine diſpleaſure. They that profane the day of ſacred reſt, and impiouſly neglect the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his worſhip and ordinances of religion, muſt return to their duty, and enter into his ſanctuary which he hath ſanctified forever, that the fierce wrath of the Lord may be turned away from us. For becauſe we have not obſerved his ſtatutes and deſpiſed his ſabbaths, God has given us ſtatutes from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> that are not good, and judgments whereby we cannot live. Wilful impenitents and unbelievers, that tremble not at the words of the living God; fear not his wrath, and will not ſubmit to be ruled and ſaved by him; ſpurn at his divine bowels; affront the God of grace, and incenſe the Saviour of the world; vex and grieve the holy Spirit: theſe muſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015855_0035_0F9A2FA711594CA8"/>
come to a pauſe, conſider and turn to the Lord, receive the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make their peace with God by the blood of the croſs; and all will be well. In a word, the extortioner, the monopolizer of ſcarce and neceſſary commodities, the deſtroyers of our preſent medium of trade; thoſe that oppreſs one another, and grind the faces of the poor, muſt turn back to juſtice, humanity, and charity, and a love to their country. Iniquity muſt be put far from our tabernacles, family religion ſet up, and the riſing generation inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We muſt put away all violence from our hands, and malice from our hearts. Love the Lord, and love our neighbour as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Our pride, ſelf-ſufficiency, impenitency, unbelief, wilful contempt of God, and his holy laws, not ſeeing the hand of God, receiving not correction, truſting not in the Lord, and drawing not near to our God. Theſe have kept us back from honor and victory, and brought us low, and withheld good things from us.</p>
            <p>THE Addreſſes follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> PERMIT me to drop a few hints to the honorable the Houſe of Repreſentatives now convened, to form a plan of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honored ſirs,</hi> WHAT is purely political, I ſhall leave to your better ſkill and wiſdom; and wiſh you the divine bleſſing, in all your deliberations. But I truſt your candour will not take it as acting out of character, if I ſuggeſt ſome things which may be worthy your future conſideration.</p>
            <p>THE unanimity of the late Convention in calling upon us to faſt, and cry to heaven for direction and help in our preſent affair, as well as the more public intereſts of <hi>America,</hi> intimates to us a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground of hope, that this will be thy land, <hi>O Immanuel!</hi> That God will be openly acknowledged in all the important buſineſs of our State. Tho' the Kingdom of the Redeemer is not of this world, and civil rulers are not to invade the rights of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet they may be nurſing fathers to the church and the earth may help the woman: they may upon occaſion forbid ſervile labour, and call upon us to faſt, or offer thankſgiving to God, without invading his throne. By no means would I urge civil rulers to bind conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015855_0036_0F9A2FA847E01530"/>
in the chains of their decrees. Chriſt alone is Lord of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and every man muſt act for himſelf in all matters wherein conſcience may be obliged, for this plain reaſon, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Every man muſt give account of himſelf to God. But it is folly and ſtupidity for a man to plead conſcience for breaking the moral law, which is a tranſcript of the moral perfections of God, and written upon the hearts of all by nature. Civil rulers are God's vicegerents and deputies on earth, to maintain the honor of his rectoral righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo prevent divine judgments coming upon the people. I hope the legiſlative and executive powers of this State will ſo ſtand in awe of the ſovereign Ruler, as to put reſtraints upon an open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and all religion, blaſpheming and the taking h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous name in vain; adultery as a ſin againſt God and the State, as well as againſt the party injured; the profanation of the ſabbath day, (the morality of which may be eaſily proved,) and in a word, all groſs violations of the ſacred decalogue as far as certain proof can be taken in human courts; are iniquities to be reſtrained by the laws and puniſhed by the judges in all chriſtian States. Neh. 13. 17, 18. <hi>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and ſaid unto them, what evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the ſabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Iſrael, by profaning the ſabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN forming a plan of government for this State you will judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly temper and balance the powers of the ſeveral branches of the legiſlature, that one cannot arrogate to himſelf what belongs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The legiſlative authority of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by king, lords and commons, has long been the pride and boaſt of the nation, and envy of other nations. But former and later experience invincibly proves by the moſt notorious facts, which are the hardeſt arguments, that when the powers of thoſe three branches by bribes or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are engroſſed by one, like the beams of the ſun contracted by a glaſs in a focus, the intenſe heat may ſet the whole land in flames. The preventing ſo great an evil to this State, will demand your cloſeſt attention and care.</p>

            <p>AMEN. SO BE IT.</p>
            <p>I CLOSE all with a few words to the people here preſent before God.</p>
            <p>IT is a critical day with us. Perilous times are come. Let all unite for reformation and to promote the common cauſe of <hi>America,</hi> and good of this State. Whatever we might think heretofore, and however cloſely attached to the mother country; we muſt eye the hand of God in the change. God by a ſeries of wonderous provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, has made us independent States. We are now to ſeek their good.</p>
            <p>THE public faith of <hi>Britain</hi> now well known to us, and how far it is prudent to truſt it; their perſecuting us with a rage that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto heaven, the inſults offered to our underſtandings, as propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals for reconciliation, the deeply rooted and ſo univerſal alienation of theſe States, from that kingdom; and our treaties abroad, which may (for ought we know) preclude all rational and moral poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a re-union; all theſe conſidered ſeem to oblige us to be ſo prudent for ourſelves, as to think and ſpeak no more of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but to look upon the breach like the ſea, paſt healing. We muſt, it ſeems, be their allies, or conquered vaſſals, or have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with them.</p>
            <p>LET us put away thoſe ſins that have armed our enemies againſt us, and be cordially united in all our efforts for the public weal. The cruelty of our mercileſs foes, ſhould make us tenderly affected one to another. You may have heard of a man, a lamb, and a lion by chance falling into the ſame pit, ſo touched with ſympathy and mutual tenderneſs, under the common calamity, as not to hurt one another. May the law of love, and that ſpirit of chriſtian morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that runs thro' the ſermon on the mount, be cultivated among us: and O that all the powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> for our ſakes, as well as their own, might be under the influence of that ſame ſpirit.</p>

WHEN ſhall that glorious day appear when wars ſhall ceaſe to the ends of the earth, by the ſupreme command of the Lord of hoſts? Then <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall no more envy <hi>Judah,</hi> nor <hi>Judah</hi> vex <hi>Ephraim.</hi> We ſhall then very cordially unite with <hi>Britons,</hi> not indeed in civil connections, but in chriſtian fellowſhip, and amity. The wolf will then dwell pleaſantly with the lamb, and the leopard lie down with the kid; and people both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America</hi> try to render each other happy, as much as ever the one has ſtruggled to make the other miſerable.</p>
            <p>ALL the oppreſſors, and tyrants of the earth, will then be gone down to the ſides of the pit, to lie with the uncircumciſed, and their iniquities upon their bones; tho' they were the terror of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the land of the living.</p>
            <p>THE greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven, will then be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High, and the voice of the oppreſſor no more be heard. Civil Rulers will then be benefactors (not malefactors) and ſeek the welfare of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and the people will love and not oppreſs one another. And in the peace of the civil community, and city of God, will every one have peace. Thy kingdom come, O LORD.</p>
