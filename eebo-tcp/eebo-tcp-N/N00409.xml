            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ABRIDGMENT Of the English Military DISCIPLINE.</head>
            <p>WHen a Regiment or several Companies are Commanded to draw out, It is necessary that the Major and Adjutant (or at least the Adjutant) be there to give each Company its due Post. The eldest on the Right, the second on the Left, so till the youngest come into the Center. And all Companies (and Bodies of Men) are to draw up at first at the same Order they March at, both in Bank and File, the single Companies
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000508_0003_0FA6A7A03B6BB350"/>
observing to leave room for the Sargeants and Drums to stand on the Right and Left of each Company.</p>
            <p>Before you form your Battalion, remember alwayes to draw out the odd Men from every Company, forming a Rank in opposition at fifty paces distance from the Head of each Company, thereby to have no broken Files, which is much the better and quicker way to compleat your Files, than after your Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are formed.</p>
            <p>When your Companies are thus disposed, the most ready way to form a Battalion, is by these words of Command.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Have a care to form the Battalion.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Musketiers to the Right and Left outwards.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Pikes to the Right and Left inwards,</hi>
               </item>
               <item>March, <hi>interchanging Ground.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>When Pikes and Musketiers interchange Ground, the first Rank of Pikes pass before the first Rank of Musketiers. And it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be observed, that (after any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for moving) no Man stir before the Word of Command, <hi>March</hi> be given, thereby to make them all move together.</p>
            <p>When they have thus changed Ground, they are not to Face to their Leaders till the Word
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000508_0004_0FA6A7A131BE8EE0"/>
of command be so given. At which time they are then in Battalia, but at close Order in File. And now it is to be observed that the Officers are no more limited to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Companies, but are all concerned in the whole. He that Commands, is to see how many Sargeants there are present, and dispose of them in this following manner, <hi>viz.</hi> if a Battalion consist of eight or ten Companies, or more; and the Companies have each two Sargeants, and three Corporals, (who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to do Sargeants Duty) it is necessary to place two on each Rank to the right and left, and the rest in the Rear; but if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sargeants be fewer, then there can be but one to each Rank, on the Right and Left: the remainder alwayes to be in the Rear, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Rank parallel to the Souldiers at three Paces distance frow the last Rank.</p>
            <p>The Sargeants being placed in this manner: the Drums are to be disposed of, one half on the right, and the other on the left, ranging directly with the first Rank of the Souldiers, unless there be many Drums, and the Ground streight; And then they are to be formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Ranks, on the Right and Left, to range with the two first Ranks of the Souldiers;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000508_0005_0FA6A7A1C1F5E848"/>
And they are alwayes to have their Drums slung, unless Commanded to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Hoboys to be on the right of the Drums, which are on the Right of the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, ranged in the same Rank with them.</p>
            <p>The Commission-Officers are to take their Posts at the head of the Battalion as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are drawn. But the more particular placing of the Officers will be directed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Now it is to be observed, that tho' the Files are still at their close Order, the Ranks are to have their Distance of Twelve large Feet, which the Sargeants are to be very diligent and active to see kept very even.</p>
            <p>The Officer in Chief is to place himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the centre of the Pikes, about forty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from them, the better to observe what is done, And that he may be more easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the whole Body, He is to be on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.</p>
            <p>The Words of Command are to be given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>urely, that the Soldiers may have time to perform the Exercise without confusion. And above all, <hi>Silence</hi> is to be kept very strictly. And the first Word of Command before you begin the Exercise, is, <hi>Silence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:000508_0006_0FA6A7A27B9A1650"/>
When every thing is thus disposed, The next Word of Command is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Files, Open to the Right (or to the Left) to your Order.</hi> March.</p>
            <p>At which Word every individual man turns to the Hand named, and after a little pause, the Sargeants on the Flank lead the Ranks (which are then Files) directly, forward, as slow as possible, by the least Steps they can make, with their Halberts Advanced, the Iron upwards; observing alwayes for a Rule, To mind the Front, that is, if they move to the Right, every man is to observe his Left hand man. And if they move to the Left, his Right hand man.</p>
            <p>As soon as the last man but one of the first Rank stirs his Foot, they are to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all to <hi>Halt.</hi> And no man is to stir after that Word.</p>
            <p>In this manner of opening of Files, no man is to stir till his Leader be four foot from him; And then to move and keep at that distance, which will make them three foot distance from each other, when Faced to the Proper Front.</p>
            <p>As soon as they are Commanded to <hi>Halt,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000508_0007_0FA6A7A33A0EB390"/>
The next Word of Command is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To your Leader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Captains and Lieutenants are to carry their Pikes Comported alwayes when they move to the Right or Left, and the Colours to be Advanced. The Sargeants are to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mindful to keep the Ranks even, and at twelve large feet distance, and the Files at three. And for the better keeping Files streight (after they are Opened to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) every man is to look to his Right and Left hand man, and to see that he has an equal distance from both, especially the File-leaders, by whom all the rest are governed.</p>
            <p>The next thing is to Draw the Officers from the Front of the Battalion to the Rere, which is done by these Words of Command.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have a Care of the Exercise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which Word of Command, the Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are to pull off their right hand Gloves, and put them under their Girdles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:000508_0008_0FA6A7A3F8A24A80"/>
               <hi>Officers take your Posts of Exercise in the Rere. March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is to be done by the Officers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Right about, The Captains March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a good round pace in one Rank, and the Lieutenants and Colours in another, Two paces behind the Captains, who as well as the Lieutenants are to carry their Pikes Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
            <p>When they are come into the Rere, the Lieutenants &amp; Ensigns are to be in one Rank, Eight paces from the Sargeants, and the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and Ensigns Eight. The Captains being from the last Rank of Soldiers Thirteen paces, and the Lieutenants and Colours Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>At the same Word of Command or Signal for the Officers to take their Posts of Exercise in the Rere, Six Sergeants of those that are Posted in the Rere are to March through the Intervals of the Files into the Front and Post themselves Forty six paces from the First Rank of Souldiers, that is, Six paces advanced before the Commander in Chief, where they are to Range themselves so as to make a parallel Line with the Battalion, and to keep the Front clear and undisturbed. And at the same word of Command, the Pikemen are to joyn their Left hands to their Pikes even with their Shoulders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:000508_0009_0FA6A7A4C7D9D788"/>
Now the Musketiers being Shouldered, and the Pikes Advanced, <hi>Silence</hi> being Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and none to speak but the Officer in Chief He is to proceed as followeth.</p>

And the first Rank is to take such a compass of Ground, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to press one another out, nor yet to make a Gap or Interval in the Ranks; The best way to avoid both which is, for every man to be sure to observe what distance he is at in File when he is commanded to Wheel; and if he Wheels to the Right; to be sure to keep that

               <p>The Battalion being Drawn up, the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets Shouldered, and the Pikes Advanced, you must first of all Command the Colours, Drums and Ho-boys to the center of the Pikes: Which done, you are to make the ranks close forward to three large feet distance: Then you must make the three outwardmost files
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:000508_0116_0FA6A815F7A1AF18"/>
of Pikes on the right and left, to double into the three Files of Pikes which are next them on the right and left. After which you are to make the Rere half-files of Musketiers to double their front either to the right or left; which being done, you must make all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy close their files to close Order, and after having faced them again to the proper Front, you are to make the Pikes face Square, and close forward to close Order, as they then are faced every way; which done, you must make the Pikes face again to their proper front. Then you command the left Wing of Shot to face to the right about; which being done, both Wings of Shot are to march till clear of the Front and Rere of Pikes. After you have made the Musketiers to Alt, both Wings are to face to the Left, and are to be led by the Sargeants cross the Front and Rere of Pikes. That is to say, the right Wing of Shot to be led (as near the Pikes as they can march) round, till the Head of the Shot comes even with the left Rere Angle of the Pikes; and the left Wing of Shot is to be led in like manner round the rere of the pikes, till the Head of the Shot comes even with the right front Angle of the pikes.</p>

                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:000508_0117_0FA6A816B9357E18"/>
Then you must command them all to <hi>Face to the proper Front.</hi> The Officers are to move with the Musketiers as they move, by which they will naturally fall into the Posts where they are to be, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lieutenants divided equally into the four Angles, as also the Sargeants. The Captains are to be divided in the following manner.</p>

               <p>The Officers to take care that every Front of Soldiers do their Duty, and the Captains that are in the Center of each Front are to retire into the first rank when the Musketiers make ready, and are to kneel when the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers kneel, and to perform the same with their pikes that the pikemen do. When you have done this, you place your Company of Granadiers (being divided into four equal parts) in the four Angles, and if there be
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:000508_0118_0FA6A81778BC5290"/>
not room enough for them to stand in the Angles without, you must take some of the files, and place them within the Angles with their Daggers in their Firelocks, keeping the rest on the Angles without three deep, the two last ranks of which are to fire with the Musketiers, the Front rank making ready their Granado's, assoon as ever the two last ranks have fired, they are to put their Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into their firelocks, and stand charged, and when the first rank of Musketiers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the first rank of Granadiers are to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Granado's and assoon as done, they are to unsling their firelocks, and put in their Daggers, and stand charged as the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When you give the Command to Face Square the Musketiers on the right and left are to Face outwards, and those in the Rere to face to the right about, The three outwardmost Files of Pikes on the right and left are to Face outwards, and the Rere half files of the rest of the Pikes are to Face to the right about. Those men that are in the Angles, are to face towards the Points of the Angles, the Musketiers must close, backwards as near to the Pikes as they can with convenience to use their Arms, that the Pikes may reach the farther over them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>If there be ten Colours, the three Colours on the right are to be against the proper front of the Battalion, the two Colours next to them are to be against the right flank. The two Colours next to them are to be against the Rere, and they are all to Face as the Body faces, and to March as they do. The Drums and Ho-boys are to divide themselves equally to make as much room as they can within the Square.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Musketiers being commanded to make ready, They are all to make the motion of Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Guarding, and at the same time the Pikemen to Port their Pikes very low, (as they stand faced) without any word of Command, as also the Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tou must fire only the two last ranks together, that is, The second and third, the first of which being to stoop, the front rank or the first rank of all is to kneel, holding their Muskets, so that the two other ranks may fire clear of them. As soon as ever the second and third rank have fired and Recovered their Arms, the first rank is to stand up without any other word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with their Muskets Cockt and Guarded

ready to Present. And at the same time the two other Ranks which have fired, Load their Arms again and make ready. The Pikes are to continue Ported very low all the while till all the three ranks have fired. After the front rank stands up, they are to be commanded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Fire, and after that to Recover their Arms, the Pikemen at the fame word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand being to Recover their Pikes. The front rank which fired last and all the rest that have not Primed and Loaded their Arms, are to do it (or in Exercise to make the motion of it) as they March, and are afterwards to Shoulder.

               <p>The reason why the Pikes do not <hi>Charge</hi> when the Musketiers <hi>Present,</hi> but continue Ported, is, That the Musketiers in firing may not shatter the ends of them with their Shot, but when the Musketiers have fired, if there be occasion, the Pikes may be made to <hi>Charge</hi> from their <hi>Port</hi> in the twinkling of an Eye.</p>

The Major General in the mean while is to Ride about the Camp to Post the Main-guards as he finds best for the Safety of the Army, and is to order the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Master General what ground or Village he shall take up for the Kings Quarters, as also some commodious place for the Park of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of Horse and Foot attending always on the General that they may be ready to Execute his Orders, and make Detachments without delay.</p>
               <p>It is the usual Practice to Camp an Army in two Lines, The Second distant from the First Three hundred Paces; That is, From the Head of the first Line to the Head of the Second, whereof One hundred and twenty are for the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping of the First Line, so that there remains One hundred and eighty Paces for the distance between the last Tents of the first Line and the Head of the Second. And if the Army Encamp with a Reserve, Then the same distance is to be observed by them.</p>
               <p>The Horse are to be Posted on the Wings, and the Foot in the Middle in such a manner that the Lines of the Camp look towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and be Covered behind by a River, Brook, of March, if it may be with Convenience.</p>
               <p>Every Squadron consisting in Three Troops, &amp; fifty men each Troop, must be allowed fifty paces. And every Battalion consisting of sixteen Companies and fifty men in each Company, must have One hundred paces allowed for their Encamping.</p>
               <p>All Troops or Companies of Horse of Foot consisting but of fifty men are to be Encamped on one Row of Baraques or Hutts; But when Troops or Companies consist of more men, there must be two Files of Baraques or Hutts.</p>
               <p>It is to be observed that in each Squadron or Battalion, The Colonels Company be always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Then the Second Company make their Row of Hutts, near to which the Third makes theirs, leaving the space of two Foot onely between their Hutts, which is called the By Street. And the same thing is to be observed by the Horse.</p>
               <p>The Hutts of the Foot always open towards the Street, the Baraques of the Cavalry always to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Horse Heads.</p>
               <p>The Hutts of the Quarter-Master and Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants are always to be at the Head of the Troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Soldiers, And the Officers Tents behind.</p>
               <p>The Camp of the first Brigade of the Army is on the right hand of the first line, That of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond on the Left, the Third is Posted on the right of the Second Line, the Fourth on the Left, and the rest in the Center according to their Seniority. This is to be observed among the Horse as well as Foot.</p>
               <p>The Dragoons are never to be Encamped in the Body of the Army, but have their Camp at the Head or on the Wings on that side where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test danger is, serving always as an Out-guard for the Army.</p>
               <p>Every Regiment is to have a Guard at the Head of their Camp, and the Major General for the day, takes care to place the great Guard in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place and distance from the <hi>Army</hi> towards the Enemy, choosing for that Effect a place where all

               <p>When an Army Encamps near an Enemy, and there be no River to divide them, the General of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes Entrenches his Camp, and makes his men pass the night under Arms.</p>
               <p>The Colonel, or Officer of Horse who Mounts the Guard, is to send off an Out-Guard, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance-guard consisting of twenty four Troopers, Commanded by a Lieutenant, whom he Posts where he sees most convenient in a place from whence the Countrey about may be easily discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</p>
               <p>The Duty of him who commands the great Guard, is to let no person whatsoever pass without an Order, to look every where about, and to send Notice to the General whenever he discovers any Troop or Forces.</p>
               <p>It is to be observed, that the measure of ground beforementioned, is meant only for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping of an Army, for if it were to be Ranged in Battle in case of Service, the distances between the Battalions or Squadrons are to be greater than in a Camp.

no, by placing the Eldest Captains at the head of the Pikes, and so proceeding in the method before specified, the youngest being posted in the Rere, whatever the Number of Officers may be, unless the General or Commander in chief give order to post them otherwise, as there may be occasion.</p>
               <p>Advancing against the Enemy in Battel out of Musket-shot, the Captains and other Officers at the head of the Battalion are all to March in a Line with their pikes in their hands two good paces before the men, and are often to look behind them, because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they may insensibly get too much before the body, and the Soldiers by following to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

line of Captains and other Officers is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire each of them into the Intervals of his Files next behind his Post, yet so that they may look to the right and left of the Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The Offier commanding the Rere, is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that the Battalion keep marching, to cause the Soldiers to close forwards easily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noise or confusion. His chief care is, to command the pikes to march always even with the wings of Shot; for it often happens that in marching any considerable time in Battel, the Wings advance, and form a half Moon, so that the pikes in the middle being extreamly pressed upon, the Battalion falls into confusion; but provided the motion of the pikes be equal with the Right and Left, the Battalion cannot be disordered in its March. Above all, care must be taken to preserve the distance in rank and File, according to what has been said already.</p>
               <p>The Granadiers (when there are any) are to be Drawn up on the right of the Battalion, and to augment it without intermixing with it, or troubling the order of it, they being a separate number of men, that are to be always reday f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Commander of a Battalion may be on Horseback at the Head of it, when the Captains are on Foot, with their Pikes in their Hands, in as much as he is to be stirring to all parts, to see that they March as they should; and above all, that none speak except himself, or the Major by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and is to alight when the Musketiers make ready, and to march with his Pike Charged against the Enemy.</p>

               <p>THe Officers usually placed in a Garrison, are a Governour, a Lieutenant Governour, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, Aid-Major, and Captains of the Gates.</p>
               <p>It is the Governours part to have a continual care of the preservation of the Place intrusted to him. His Office is to appoint the Guards, Rounds, and Patrols, to give the word every evening, visit the Posts, keep the Officers and and Soldiers to their Duty, charge them to be diligent, and to send out frequent Parties as well to learn News of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as to raise contributions from the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countrey.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant Governour, or Officer in chief commands in the place and Government in absence of the Governour, with the same Authority.</p>
               <p>The Major sees the Guards mounted, the Rounds and Posts assigned, he regulates the Centinels, goes
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000508_0153_0FA6A839F9654878"/>
every evening to receive the word from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and gives it about upon the place of Arms, to the Quartermasters and Sargeants of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. He goes his Round Major, visits the Corps of Guards, and sees that all the Soldiers Arms are fixt and in good order; he causes necessary Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to be distributed among them, orders the Gates to be opened and shut, and gives the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour an exact account of all that passes in the place</p>
               <p>The Aid Majors are more or less in number, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatness of Places; They go the Rounds with the Major by turns, and the Duty of their Places differs nothing at all from his, they being as Assistants to him.</p>
               <p>The Care of the Captains of the Gates is to go Evening and Morning to the Governours House, to receive the keys of the Gates, that they may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and shut them.</p>
               <p>There is usually in every Garrison (especially a Frontier Town) a Commissary of Artillery, a Store-keeper who keeps account of all the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and distributes it according to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, order, a certain number of Gunners, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is always to be one on the Guard at the Batteries, a Commissary of Provisions who hath the charge of the Corn, Flower, and all that may serve font be Sustenance of a Garrison.</p>
               <p>The Officers who are in a Garrison, owe all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Respect to the Governour or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, and they cannot be absent for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reason soever, without a permission from him
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:000508_0154_0FA6A83AB8E43D50"/>
in Writing or from the Person that commands there in his absence.</p>
               <p>In Garrison, some men are to be placed at the Gates, whose care is only to observe Strangers that come in and go out, and according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Memorials which they and all the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers of the Town are to bring every evening to the Major; it is known how many Strangers are every night in the place, what they are, and where they Lodge.</p>
               <p>The hour of mounting the Guard is different in Garrisons, according to the inclination of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varnours; in some places it is done at the break of day, because at the time when the Gates are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (which is the usual hour of Surprizes). Two Thirds of the Garrison are in Arms; others mount it at ten of the Clock in the Forenoon, or towards the Evening; but the most usual time is at two of the Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Whilst the Drums beat for the Guard, the Sarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants or Corporals are to go to the Major's House, who makes them cast Lots for the Posts &amp; Rounds and writes them down in a Register kept for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Having done so, they return to their Companies or Squadrons, who gather together before the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Quarters, and if they do not mount by whole Companies, but by Detached men (which is the most practicable way of doing Duty) the Sarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Lead them in good order, Drams beating as far as the place of Arms, to that part where the

                  <hi>Whilst the Guard is mounting, the Officers of the Guard that is to be Relieved, put their Soldiers in Arms and draw from the Guard, that they may leave the Place to the Guard that is to Relieve them, and Post themselves over against them, every Officer standing in his Post at the Head of them.</hi>

March off their Soldiers to the place of Arms; where when they have Drawn them up; they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss them.</p>
               <p>The Officers of the Guard that have Mounted, Command the Soldiers to set down their Arms, by these Words of Command, the Pikes being Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and Muskets Shouldered.</p>

               <p>After the Gates are shut, one half of the Guard is to be drawn upon the Rampart to pass the night in the Corps of Guard of the Curtains or Bastions. The Corporals send some Soldiers for Firing and Candle, and the Sargeants go to the place of Arms to receive the Word, which is no sooner given but the Sargeants of the Guard carry the Word to their Officers and give it about among the Corporals who command the Sentinels to suffer no body after that time to pass upon the Ramparts without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to Stand, and giving Notice of it to the Corps of Guard.</p>
