            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>That led them by the Right Hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> with his Glorious Arm, dividing the Water before them, to make Himſelf an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Name.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT hath been an Ancient, Laudable, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Cuſtome, on our Anniverſary Elections, (formerly of Governours, but always of Aſſiſtants in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to Invocate the Divine Preſence, and Conſult the Sacred Oracles for Direction in ſo Weighty an Affair.</p>
            <p>By the diſpoſe of Divine Providence, it hath fallen to my Allotment, and at the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe Worthy and Honourable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Repreſentatives of this Province, I find my ſelf expoſed, and have this task put upon me; which I am very ſenſible, might have been better performed and accepted by

ſome other Perſon, better acquainted with the preſent circumſtances and ſtate of Affairs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>
            <p>But ſince it cannot be prevented, that I would crave, is only a candid Interpretation of what may be very plainly, but ſincerely offered; it not being preſumption, but obedience, that makes me comply in my preſent offerings, who have reaſon to account my ſelf the weakeſt &amp; moſt unworthy of my Brethren that miniſter at the Altar.</p>
            <p>That which I have to offer to this Great and Honourable, the General Aſſembly of this Province; and in the Audience of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Elders, and all good Chriſtians now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd: Let it be ſome brief and ſuitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Divine Providence, in the Lords Conduct of his Church thro' the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of this World, or from one part of the Wilderneſs of this World to another.</p>
            <p>This is admirably Exemplified in our Text, by the famous Inſtance of God's Conduct of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of Old (the only Church upon Earth, the National Church of the <hi>Jews</hi>) thro' the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> and into, and in the Wilderneſs by the Right hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with Gods Glorious Arm (for forty years together) to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Everlaſting Name.</p>
            <p>Which may be improved as a parallel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and may put us upon a Reflection of Gods Conduct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>But leſt I ſhould <hi>in ipſo limine impingere,</hi> and forget the limits of time alotted; I muſt mind you, that our Text is a brief Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, or an Abridgement of that Famous Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Hiſtory of Gods Conduct of his Church from <hi>Egypt</hi> thro' the Wilderneſs, and in the Wilderneſs: In which Conduct, four things are pointed out in our Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Divine Power and Providence of God, figuratively ſet forth by the Metaphor of his Arm, his Glorious Arm; (who led them by the Right hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> with his Glorious Arm) the Arm of God in Scripture Language, denotes the Power of God: <hi>Brachium ponitur pro Robore, Fortitudine, Potentia.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. We have the Glorious Arm of God's Conduct exemplified in one particular Inſtance, inſtead of all others, <hi>ſoil.</hi> in leading his People miraculouſly thro' the Sea; intimated in that expreſſion in our Text, (dividing the waters before them, the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and alſo <hi>Jordan,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 14. 21. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3. 15, 16.</p>

            </p>
            <p>You may take up this Doctrine from the words, as the ground of our Enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>

               <label>DOCTRINE.</label>

For Confirmation hereof, I might lead you thro' the whole Hiſtory of the Scriptures; wherein we may trace the footſteps of the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Working Providences of God in his Care and Conduct of his Church, and Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Enemies, which have remarks put upon them every where by Gods Holy Prophets; And by way of Imitation in treating the Subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our preſent Conſideration, I might improve their method.</p>
            <p>Our Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in our Text, points out unto us the Ancient way of Preaching in Old Teſtament times, which was an Hiſtorical Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Memorable Mercies and Remarkable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments relating to Gods Church, or his Churches Enemies: Mercies and Judgments were the Texts they Preached on; hence is that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will Sing of Mercy and of Judgment unto thee Oh Lord,</hi> Pſal. 101. 1.</p>
            <p>But let it ſuffice to Confirm this Doctrine from the particular Inſtance in our Text, wherein as in a Glaſs we may behold the Providence of God, his Wiſdom, Glory, Power and Goodneſs exerciſed towards his People at all times. Now that there was ſo much of the Praiſe-worthy Excellency and Goodneſs of God Diſcovered in this Conduct of his People, the Scriptures do frequently declare: Hence ſo many Pſalms of Praiſe made concerning it: After Ages tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down to their Children the Glory of God appearing therein.<note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. 106. 1, 7, 8.</note>

but all this was to make himſelf an Everlaſting Name: This indeed was the end of all Gods Wonderful Works, both of Creation and of Providence, but eſpecially of his Churches pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and moſt eſpecially of the Glorious Work of Redemption; the foundation whereof was Everlaſting Love, and the Topſtone ſhall be laid with ſhouting, Grace Grace unto it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. that hereby the Lord might make to himſelf an Everlaſting Name.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To make himſelf an Everlaſting Name, was the great end of the Works of Creation; therefore God call'd up this great World out of nothing, for this end he fram'd the ſtately Fabrick of this vaſt and beautiful Univerſe; he hath planted the Heavens, that ſtately Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure, that vaulted Roof, and beſpangled Canopy over our heads; wherein he hath ſet a tabernacle for the Sun, and appointed the Ordnances of Heaven, with the influential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations thereof, and guides <hi>Arcturus</hi> with his Sons, and hath made <hi>Orion,</hi> the <hi>Pleides,</hi> and the Chambers of the South; and all this to make himſelf an Everlaſting Name: Hence that of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 19. 1. <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his handy-work.</hi> And he hath alſo laid the Beams of his Chambers in the Waters, and fixed the Groundſels and Foundations of the World, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 26. 7. he ſtretcheth out the North over the empty place, and the Earth hangs equally poized with its own weight, which made the very Heathen to admire: Hence that of <hi>Ovid,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. To make himſelf an Everlaſting Name, is the end of all Gods wonder-working Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences in the World; ordering all things to his own Glory, and for the good of his Church, &amp; the deſtruction of all the implacable Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries thereof; as <hi>Pharoah</hi> is a ſpecial example, yielding to us a fair demonſtration of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging Deity, and of a Divine Nemeſis.</p>
            <p>But to come up to the preſent purpoſe from the Inſtance in our Text, to make a parallel of it, in order to Application, we may Enquire,</p>

            <p>The Lord doth oft make things difficult that he may the more ſhew his Power; ſo oft it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, things come to the extremity, and beyond the tho't of man, how they ſhould have help; and then the Lord ſhews his Power.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſpaired of Proviſion (and <hi>Moſes ſaid) The people among whom I am, are ſix hundred thouſand foot-men; and thou haſt ſaid, I will give them fleſh, that they may eat a

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Glorious Arm of Gods Wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, in making curious contrivances of his Works, and bringing things about wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, above the reach of man; leading in a Wilderneſs: He is a wiſe Guide that can lead and guide thro' a Wilderneſs, and find the way out. So theſe Wilderneſs Leadings and Salvations are works, wherein Mercy imployes all the Attributes of God, and ſo Wiſdom; in ſpecial, Wiſdom in bringing things about in a moſt wonderful manner when at wits end; making Dejection the way to Exaltation; alſo in uſing fit means to do his People good, in doing many things at once; taking vengeance on their Enemies, chaſtiſing, humbling his own People Saving in fit ſeaſons by wonderful ways and means.</p>
            <p>There is an extraordinarineſs in Gods Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs-works, they are not accompliſh'd in a plain and ordinary manner; but there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a diſcovery of Infinite Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Glorious Arm of Divine Mercy &amp; Goodneſs appeared, in making his Peoples<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. 11. 22, 23. Exod. 14. 13,</note>

miſery his opportunity; in coming in the hour of Difficulty, in the article of Diſtreſs, when help was ſweet and precious, when mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would be moſt illuſtrious; in remembring in their low eſtate, as he oft did.</p>
            <p>The ſweeteſt help is help in Diſtreſs, and then moſt of the goodneſs of God is taſted. A Mercy in the Wilderneſs is the ſweeteſt Mercy of all.</p>
            <p>But more particularly, His Glorious Arm of Divine Goodneſs appeared in Leading His People, if we conſider the <hi>Terminus a quo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad quem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of the Term from which he brought them, <hi>ſoil.</hi> from <hi>Egypt,</hi> an Houſe of Bondage, a Furnace of Iron, from under Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, from out of the Brick-kilns, from the midſt of Idolatry. That he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we know how much is ſpoken of in Scripture. Better be in the Wilderneſs, than in <hi>Egypt:</hi> Better be ſerving and following the Lord in a Wilderneſs, in a Land that was not ſown, than ſerving cruel men, and defiling themſelves with the Abominations of <hi>Egypt;</hi> now the Lord led them, and there was no ſtrange God with them. <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Type of the ſtate of Sin and Miſery, out of which God leads his own People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of the Term to which he was leading them; namely, to <hi>Canaan,</hi> Reſt, that is the end; the Wilderneſs is the way to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and there they arrive at laſt; the hope
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001780_0018_0FB8241026FDD790"/>
of that makes Travel eaſie and ſweet, the Journeys end makes amends for all; and the enjoyment of it at laſt, is the more ſweet; we ſay, <hi>All is well that ends well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Wilderneſs, tho' a place of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was a place of much mercy; they were in the Wilderneſs, but God led them there, was with them there, and did great things there for them. Particularly, let me Inſtance in ſome of the ſpecial Mercies of God in his Glorious Arm of Conduct of his People by the Right hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Wilderneſs, which may be of uſe in the Application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lord ſet up RELIGION among them, gave them Statutes and Judgments, and Rules to walk by; the Lord gave them his Word, this was a diſtinguiſhing favour: <hi>He ſhewed his Word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and his Judgments unto</hi> Iſrael; <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never had the People of God ſo much of his Word given to them, as now ſince they came into the Wilderneſs. <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt Writer of Holy Scripture, was given them to be their Leader in the Wilderneſs, &amp; to deliver the firſt Scriptures in writing; and it is like he writ not only the four laſt, but <hi>Geneſis</hi> alſo, in the Wilderneſs. He acted as an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prophet; and then alſo by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, the Law was given on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> In the Wilderneſs God gave them both Law &amp; Goſpel; the Law was delivered on the Mount,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001780_0019_0FB82412ACD13888"/>
and the Goſpel was Preached in the Renewing Gods Covenant with them; and in the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Types of the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Wilderneſs lifted up.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>vid.</hi> Par. Prol. in Gen Joh. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>And of the Rock, whoſe waters follow'd them; and of the Manna,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, in the wilderneſs God opened his mind and heart to them; now they were alone, he revealed both Law and Goſpel in a larger and fuller manner than ever he did before.</p>
            <p>Again, the SABBATH had been Inſtituted from the Beginning, and the Law of it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been in force, as other Moral Laws, but much neglected and forgotten; therefore God ſolemnly made it known, and called them to Remember it on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> this was his great mercy, to give them the clear Rule of the Sabbath in the Wilderneſs, and to reduce them to the careful Obſervation of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſet up his TABERNACLE among them in the Wilderneſs, he gave them Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Inſtitutions, and Prieſts and Levites to Diſpenſe all the Ordinances of God to them, according to that <hi>Moſaical</hi> Paedagogy; having alſo cauſed them to Renew their Covenant with him, their Church-Covenant; for ſo that is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. being a Social Covenant, wherein many People together, did engage themſelves to the Lord; thus God brought them near to him, and Set up his Tabernacle among them.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001780_0020_0FB82413E3D19228"/>
3. The Lord ſet up Government among them, Civil Government; he gave them Laws, ſo alſo Magiſtrates with Power to execute theſe Laws. Not only <hi>Moſes,</hi> an extraordinary Perſon to be King of <hi>Jeſhurun,</hi> whom the Lord raiſed up to bear their lumber, and to manage the Difficult work of Leading that People as in our Text. He led them by the Right hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>—But alſo others were appointed according to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro's</hi> Council for ordinary ſtanding Rulers.<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod, 18. 21, 22, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt provide out of the People able Men, ſuch as fear God, men of truſt, hating Covetouſneſs; and place ſuch over the People to be Rulers of thouſands, and Rulers of hundreds, alſo of Fifties and of Tens, and let them Judge the People at all ſeaſons.</hi> And alſo afterward the ſettled ſeventy Elders to be <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes'</hi>s Aſſiſtants (which were after the ſettled Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil &amp; chief Court, called the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> or the <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drion</hi>) of which we Read<note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. 6. 11, 16, 17 26, 30.</note> Hence we ſo often Read of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the heads of the People and their Judges and Officers, all ſorts of Rulers.</p>
            <p>The Lord did not bring them from under their Taskmaſters in <hi>Egypt,</hi> into the Wilderneſs to turn Libertines, and to do what is Right in their own Eyes, to deſpiſe to be Ruled by any of their Brethren—Altho' ſome of them roſe up againſt that Order and Government the Lord had ſet them under; but the Lord did ſolemnly and dreadfully declare himſelf againſt them, as he will ſooner or later ſhow that he will not bear with thoſe that refuſe to ſubmit to Order, either in Church or Common Wealth: And Oh what a Mercy is it to Enjoy Government, this was a

favour to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Government for them and Officers of all ſorts, and this was his great Mercy to them; and ſo he alſo in the Wilderneſs gave them a Militia, and order'd the ſame Bands of Soldiers and Armies to be ready for Defence; as in the beginning of <hi>Numbers</hi> we read at large.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Lords Conduct of them with his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arm, he delivered them from their Enemies, and gave them peace in the Wilderneſs.

Application, which the Premiſes afford abundant matter of</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. I might apply this Truth to the Church and People of God in General, and then to our ſelves in this Wilderneſs in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Relating to the Church and People of God in General, and Gods Conduct of his Church thro' the Wilderneſs of this World with his Glorious Arm. Gods Church may be ſaid to be in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs while in this World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the World we live in is a Deſart Vale, a time and place of Changes, Sorrows, Straits, yea of Sin and Unbelief too.</p>
            <p>We read of the Woman <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church that fled into the Wilderneſs where ſhe had a place prepared of God, and that ſhe ſhould remain there one thouſand three hundred and threeſcore Days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. And this is aſſerted, and ſeems to be fairly intimated by thoſe that affirm, that the forty two months, or the one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, mention'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter, <hi>Chap</hi> 11. 3. Of the witneſſes Propheſying in Sackcloth, not to be yet expired; for it is evident, that Contemporary therewith, and of the ſame length of time is the Womans, that is the Churches being in the Wilderneſs, mention'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6, 14.

thro' that horrid part of the Wilderneſs, the depth of the Antichriſtian Darkneſs toward Reformation.</p>
            <p>Let us but inſtance in our own Nation: Oh the Difficulties and Diſcouragements and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that the firſt Reformers in the laſt Age paſs'd thro'; but there is ſtill the Glorious Arm of Divine Conduct carrying on the Reformation. God hath Gloriouſly delivered our Nation from Papal Superſtitions and Idolatries: Oh the torch of the truth of the Goſpel that hath been lighted up in both <hi>Englands!</hi> And notwithſtanding the many Oppoſitions to quench it, it hath been kept burning to this Day.</p>
            <p>And Oh the Mercy of God to our Nation! wherein the Glorious Arm of Divine Conduct is remarkable in two famous Revolutions freſh in memory, the former <hi>Anno</hi> 1689. The latter in the happy Acceſſion of ſo Illuſtrious a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne, as at this Day; and we his Loyal Subjects in <hi>New-England</hi> Bleſs our ſelves with the pleaſing Proſpect of ſharing in his Royal Favours; as thinking our ſelves ſecure from a Deſpotick or Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or having our Liberties Invaded by Papal Uſurpations and Tyrannies. Long let our King live to be the Honour of this preſent, and the Imitation of future Ages; and never let there want a Succeſſour to that Proteſtant Line, to Sway the Scepter of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

            <p>The ſecond branch of the Uſe is to our ſelves in this Wilderneſs; we are, and have been in a Wilderneſs in propriety of ſpeech ſo called: But O Generation, may the Lord ſay, <hi>Have I been a wilderneſs unto you, as Jer.</hi> 2. 31. No, but
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001780_0025_0FB8241EAA5F59E0"/>
the Lord hath been as <hi>a ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</hi> Oh the mercies of this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, have exceeded thoſe of other Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>America!</hi> A work never to be forgotten, is the Lords preparing this Wilderneſs for his People, when he ſwept away thouſands of thoſe Salvage Tawnies (thoſe curſed Devil worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers) with a mortal Plague, to make room for a better People, (I mean our Fathers) that came into this Wilderneſs to plant the Goſpel, and to enlighten theſe dark Regions. Pardon me, I compare not the place they came from, to <hi>Egypt,</hi> God forbid I ſhould; it was a <hi>Goſhen,</hi> in compariſon of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet to ſpeak freely, the time was, when the People of God had their Task-maſters, which they ſigh'd under; and the power and purity of Religion was in the <hi>Houſe of Bondage;</hi> and heavy burdens were impoſed on the necks of many of the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servants; from which, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Liberty and Purity, they were glad to fly into this Wilderneſs; if happily in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they might Worſhip and Sacrifice to the Lord their God. And Oh the powerful calling voice of God to gather his People into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs! And they were a choice ſelect Number, whom God with his Glorious Arm did bring hither to lay the foundations of the Everlaſting Goſpel; ſo that we may glory in it, when we behold the Lord laying our Stones with fair colours, and our Foundations with Saphires.</p>
            <p>And God has granted Proſperity to theſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001780_0026_0FB8241FE6758908"/>
bleſſed Enterprizes, he has cauſed the Goſpel to flouriſh in this Land; and we have not only brown bread and the Goſpel, but the Bread of Life; <hi>Manna</hi> in plenty, Angels food. Oh how hath God proſpered our ſmall Beginnings, and given us Towns and Buildings, and Bleſſings of all ſorts, and hath ſown our Land with the Seed of Man and Beaſt; ſo that we can now tell <hi>of the Beaſts of our Forrests, and the Cattle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thouſand hills, and of our Oxen ſtrong to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, of our Sheep that bring forth thouſands and ten thouſands in our ſtreets,</hi> Pſal. 144. The time would fail me to enumerate the paſſages of Gods goodneſs in his Conduct of his People in this Wilderneſs with his Glorious Arm: But take a taſte in a few parallel Inſtances by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the premiſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lord hath given us his Everlaſting Goſpel in this Wilderneſs. God hath ſet up the true Religion among us, and this hath been our ſafety and ſecurity. Religion is the Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of a People, or Nation; therefore God hath made the World to take notice, that <hi>New-England</hi> hath been a <hi>People Saved by the Lord.</hi> Oh we have had the true Religion among us! Oh the Glory of the Goſpel that hath ſhined in this Land! Oh the Lively Oracles that have been delivered to us, the Gate of Heaven hath been here opened; the Goſpel hath been here ſpread in its beauty, plainneſs and glory! Oh the <hi>Bethels,</hi> the many <hi>Bethels</hi> God hath E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and Set up in this Wilderneſs!</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:001780_0027_0FB824215F847370"/>
2. The Lord hath furniſh'd us with glorious Ordinances and Miniſtries; he hath ſet up his Tabernacles among us, the Orders of his Houſe; he hath laid before us a Platform of Diſcipline, and bleſſed us with a Goſpel Order in our Churches; ſo that were <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf here, he could not curſe, but bleſs and admire to ſee the comely Order in the ſeveral Flocks of the Lords Sheep, folded together in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Companies. <hi>Vid. Numb.</hi> 24. 2, 5. <hi>And Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam lift up his eyes, and he ſaw Iſrael abiding in Tents, according to their Tribes; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him,</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>How goodly are thy Tents Oh</hi> Jacob! <hi>and thy Tabernacles, Oh</hi> Iſrael! <hi>as the Valleys are they ſpread forth, as Gardens by the River ſide.</hi> Even ſuch hath been the Bleſſing of our good God to his Heritage in this Land.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The glorious Arm of Divine Conduct, hath fenc'd us with the hedge of Government. Oh what a favour is this! to give Government, to Eſtabliſh Authority, to have a Wall of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy ſet and kept about a People; this is a thing of unſpeakable concernment; otherwiſe a people would be left to Anarchy and heaps of Confuſion. Oh! it is thro' the love of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if he ſets a man over them, that will do Juſtice and Judgment, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>Exod,</hi> 18. 21. To ſee thoſe that fear <hi>God</hi> Exalted, Oh how great a Bleſſing! And we are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Soveraign and Holy Counſel of <hi>God</hi> therein; <hi>and know that the Most High
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001780_0028_0FB82422E1EA9630"/>
Ruleth in the Kingdoms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will.</hi> God hath granted us Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Guides and Governours in this Land; he hath not left us to turn <hi>Libertines,</hi> but hath ſet up his Government among us, hath walled us about with Magiſtracy; &amp; he <hi>hath made our Officers Peace, and our Exactors Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> And there hath been the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wholeſome Laws, a teſtimony born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt prevailing Sin: If it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Plectuntur Achivi,</hi> the poor People would have paid for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lord with his Glorious Arm hath been our Protection, and delivered us from our Enemies in this Wilderneſs, as he did <hi>Iſrael</hi> from thoſe <hi>Amalekites;</hi> ſo God hath delivered us from thoſe <hi>Amalekites,</hi> the <hi>Pequets,</hi> the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganſets,</hi> that ſet upon Gods People when they were weak and tender; but how did the Lord cruſh and blaſt them, and blot out their Names from being a People as at this day; ſo let our Enemies periſh that have committed their Outrages in this Land.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God hath ſet up a School of the Prophets among us; a Colledge, a Seminary of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this hath made <hi>New-England</hi> preferable to all the <hi>American</hi> Plantations; to the Silver Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, thoſe glittering Entrails of the <hi>Spaniſh West-Indies.</hi> Let the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

6. The Lord hath ſpread a Table for us in this Wilderneſs and ſupplyed our wants from year to year, and every year; the year laſt paſt, was an eminent Inſtance of this; in the time of that laſting ſcorching drought, when our Hearts and our Hopes failed us: God did ſecretly and unaccountably (I had almoſt ſaid Miraculouſly) Reſerve a Bleſſing for us, that there was Bread to the ſower, a ſupply for our neceſſities; this was the Lords doing, and it is Marvellous in our Eyes, it was Gods Glorious Arm that effected it; Oh let His Everlaſting Name be Magnified.</p>
            <p>Oh how hath the Lord provided for us from year to year, and ſometimes plentifully; this is indeed to rain Bread in a Wilderneſs. Oh the Thouſands of poor Creatures among us, whoſe Loins and Bowels do bleſs the Lord! Very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches us Gratitude for this, who elſe in their Poverty might have fainted and periſh'd for want of Bread.</p>
            <p n="7">7. God hath done all this for us, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our many Sins and Provocations. We have been a ſinful People. Oh the Lords ſparing Mercy in the midſt of our Sins, great cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sins. Prophaneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

8. God hath heard our Prayers in our ſtraits and plunging difficulties, how often hath he heard Prayers and been found of his People in their Supplications, and how often hath he come in the nick. Oh the many ſweet returns of Prayer we have had! and God hath made his Arm Glorious for our relief. When we Prayed for Rain, for fair Weather, for removal of Devourers, for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, for Health, for Peace, for continuance of our Civil and Sanctuary Enjoyments; God hath made his Arm Glorious, and Glorified that Title among us that he is, <hi>A God hearing Prayer.</hi>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Beware of thoſe Sins that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to withdraw the Glorious Arm of his Conduct. I ſhall hint only at ſome that are more obvious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of deſpiſing a Glorious Goſpel, or ill treating the Diſpenſers of it. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> mocked the Meſſengers of God, deſpiſed his Words, and miſuſed his Prophets, the Wrath of God aroſe againſt his People; and there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>God expects his Miniſters ſhould find ſuitable entertainment every where, and that they ſhould be ſo provided for, ſo as to ſerve the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction. There are many Townſhips and Precincts readily Granted, and ſupplyed with burning Lamps, which are like to be extinguiſh'd for want of Oyl to feed them; the Goſpel ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſome Places, and the Diſpenſers of it fain to work with their own hands, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to their Neceſſities.</p>
            <p>It would be pleaſing to God, and more Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for our Chriſtian Profeſſion, if ſome Methods could be taken for Relief in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Be aſſured that an impoveriſh'd ſtarved Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001780_0031_0FB8242B217AE470"/>
will not only induce the Contempt of the Clergy, but alſo introduce a deſpiſed Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and if the Goſpel be once deſpiſed, God will ſoon withdraw the Glorious Arm of his Conduct.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed of the Sin of Worldlineſs. This our Saviour cautions againſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 15. This eats out the very heart of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the ſweets of the World, eat out the ſavour of the Goſpel; neither the Dread of God is feared, nor the Grace of God prized by the worldly ſenſual Heart. Oh the ſtrange alteration in the ſpirits of men! Our Fathers left the World, for the Enjoyment of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in this Wilderneſs; but the Deſigns of moſt are Inverted: Moſt in theſe days are lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Religion in purſuit of the World. They have that, that contents them in this world; hence they are regardleſs of God, and the World to come. Oh! we came hither for Religion, for the Goſpel; but the world hath engroſs'd our affections, our love, delight, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, our whole thoughts. Oh, take heed of the World! this caution the Lord gave to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old, when they had plenty and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Houſes full of all things, and Vineyards, and Olive-trees, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 6. 11, 12. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt thou forget the Lord; ſo Chriſt gives caution, take heed of your Farms, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, Yokes of Oxen, and pieces of Ground, left you make light of the Call of the Goſpel; the world is full of <hi>Irritamenta malorum;</hi> it
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001780_0032_0FB8242C9FA58C18"/>
proves a ſnare to new and flouriſhing Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when the world comes in, &amp; they have a plentiful encreaſe, they abuſe the good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God to Senſuality.</p>
            <p>Noah <hi>became an Husbandman, planted a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, drank of the wine, and was drunken,</hi> Gen. 9. 20, 21. The things of the World are incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Luſt.</p>
            <p>There is at this day among us, a great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry after the World, and after a Medium of Trade, to carry on worldly Intereſts; it's well if our over-reaching after the world in too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed and bold attempts, have not marr'd our worldly Intereſts.</p>
            <p>We live in a good Land, did we but walk humbly with our God, keep his Statutes &amp; his Judgments; were we but induſtrious &amp; frugal, did we avoid all exceſſes; <hi>we ſhould mount up with wings as Eagles, our peace would be like a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and our proſperity like the waves of the Sea; and inſtead of lying among the pots, we ſhould be like</hi> Davids <hi>Dove, whoſe wings were covered with ſilver, and her feathers with yellow gold,</hi> Pſal. 68. 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed of the Sin of Pride. It's tho't there is more expended on that one luſt, than goes to the defraying our Publick Charges, ten times told; This Sin is an abomination to the Lord: And ſure I am, it is ill-becoming a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs Condition, to be poor and proud.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take heed of the Sin of Oppreſſion. That Sin hath its rounds among us; it is a crying ſin, Iſa. 5. 7. <hi>I looked for Judgment, but behold Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001780_0033_0FB8242FEE3A9070"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Caution</hi> 5. Take heed of Senſuality and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, in all the branches of it; Unchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, the prevailing Sins of this Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution</hi> 6. Take heed of the Sin of Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Diſcontent, under our Priviledges and Enjoyments. We are a People for changes &amp; alterations, well if God does not make us ſmart for it before he's done.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Take heed of advancing private Intereſts, under a gilded pretence of promoting a Publick Good. There is too much of Self-intereſt, playing its part on Publick Stages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caut.</hi> 8. Take heed of the Sins of the tongue, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. Oh the miſchief that is done by that one member! that ſets on fire the courſe of nature, and is ſet on fire of Hell; forging, fomenting falſe reports, <hi>ſpeaking evil of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Jude</hi> 8. ſeverely reproved.
