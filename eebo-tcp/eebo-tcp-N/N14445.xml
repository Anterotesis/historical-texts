            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And where is the tyrant who has not reaſon to dread an army of freemen?</p>
            <p>IN the battle of Naſeby
<note n="†" place="bottom">Vide Political Diſquiſitions.</note> in the days of Cromwell, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of forces was equal on both ſides; and all circumſtances equal. In the parliament's army only nine officers had ever ſeen actual ſervice, and moſt of the ſoldiers were London apprentices, drawn out of the city two months before.

<note n="‡" place="bottom">Moore in his view of ſociety and manners in Europe, obſerves—"As to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldiers, the leading idea of the diſcipline is, to reduce them in many reſpects, to the nature of machines; that they may have no volition of their own, but be actuated ſolely by that of their officers; that they may have ſuch a ſuperlative dread of their officers, as annihilates all fear of the enemy; that they may move forward when ordered, without deeper reaſoning or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern than the firelocks they carry along with them."</note>

            <p>THEY who follow the profeſſion of arms conceive themſelves exempted from the uſeful occupations of life, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a habit of diſſipation; ſoldiers inured to exerciſe and labour in their duty, at leaſure to roam, will not be wholly inactive in a city, where the means of gratification abound; perſuing the objects of pleaſure, with the ſame zeal they engaged in the toils and enterprizes of the field. Whole armies have, too late, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſtroyed by the diſſolving power of luxury.</p>
            <p>WE have a remarkable inſtance of this, my fellow-citizens, in the army of Hanibal, which, having withſtood the greateſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and which the moſt dreadful dangers had never been able

            <p>THE effects of luxury tho' productive of the greateſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to an army ſtationed in a city, are by no means confined to that claſs of men. The great body of the people, ſmote by the charms and blandiſhments of a life of caſe and pleaſures, fall eaſy victims to their faſcinations. The city reared by the forming hand of induſtry, ſoon feels the ſymptoms of diſſolution—The buſy merchant now no more extends his commerce! The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic throws aſide his chiſſel; the voice of riot ſucceeds to the ſound of the hammer, and the midnight revel to the vigils of labour.</p>
            <p>WHEN a large reſpectable ſtanding army has been ſtationed in a city, commanded by officers of known patriotiſm, who have taught thoſe under their orders, to enterchange the kind and friendly offices of life; citizens conceiving themſelves ſecured from domeſtic broils and the danger of invaſion from abroad, imperceptibly relax in their attention to military exerciſes, and may thus be expoſed as a tempting bait to an aſpiring deſpot; beſides, a people who have made themſelves reſpectable by their perſonal attention to their own defence, neglecting their militia, may be inſulted by thoſe neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours who had formerly been accuſtomed to revere their power.</p>

WHEN communities have ſo far miſtaken their intereſt, as to commit the defence of every thing valuable in life to a ſtanding army; the love of caſe will ſcarcely permit them to reaſſume the unpleaſing taſk of defending themſelves.</p>
            <p>AT the concluſion of a long and bloody war, the liberties of a people are in real danger from the admiſſion of troops into a free city. When an army has ſuffered every hardſhip to which the life of a Soldier is peculiarly incident, and has returned crowned with the well earned laurels of the field, they juſtly expect to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the open arms, and with the applauſes of thoſe for whom they have fought, and in whoſe cauſe they have bled; in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like this, whole communities in tranſport of gratitude, have weakly ſacrificed at the ſhrine of a deliverer, every thing for which their armies have fought or their heroes have bled.</p>
            <p>NATIONS the moſt renowned among the antients for their wiſdom and their policy, have viewed the army with an eye of attentive jealouſy; the Romans characterized for <hi>perſonal brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018302_0010_0FA5CC1FE28B3B30"/>Such an army was dangerous, they ſaid, to liberty. Theſe poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic people knew the prevailing propenſity in all mankind to power. The hiſtory of later times has abundantly juſtified the wiſdom of their jealouſies All parts of Europe which have been enſlaved, have been enſlaved by armies. No nation can be ſaid to enjoy internal liberty which admits them in a time of peace. When a government has a body of ſtanding troops at command, it is eaſy to form pretenſions for the diſtribution of them, ſo as to effect their own purpoſes; when a favourite point is to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, a thouſand ſoldiers may convey irreſiſtable argument, and compel men to act againſt their feelings, intereſt and country.</p>
            <p>SUCH were the arguments employed by Philip the ſecond of Spain, to perſuade the inhabitants of the Netherlands to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh their liberties, their property and their religion; the progreſs of theſe dreadful meaſures produced ſcenes of Maſſacre and Devaſtation, the recital of which muſt excite exquiſite hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the moſt ſavage breaſt.</p>
            <p>ONE of the commanders of the army under the duke of Alva, demanding a paſs through the city of Rotterdam,
<note n="*" place="bottom">This whole affair is related at length in Watſon's Hiſtory of the Low Countries to which the reader is referred.</note> was at firſt refuſed, but aſſuring the magiſtrates that be meant only to lead his troops through the town and not to lodge them in it; they conſented to ſuffer the companies to paſs through one by one:
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018302_0011_0FA5CC21681692C0"/>No ſooner had the firſt company entered the city, than the officer, without regard to his engagements, ordered them to keep the gates open 'till the other companies ſhould arrive; one of the citizens endeavouring to ſhut the gate, was killed by his own hand; his troops eager to follow his example, drew their ſwords, and giving a looſe to their fury, ſpread themſelves over the town, and butchered more than three hundred of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
            <p>THIS was among the firſt events of that war which rendered the Netherlands a ſcene of horror and devaſtation for more than thirty years; but which, whilſt it proved the ſource on many occaſions of extreme diſtreſs to the people, called forth an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of virtue, ſpirit and intrepidity, which ſeldom occurs in the annals of hiſtory. Never was there a more unequal conteſt than between the inhabitants of the Low-Countries, and the Spaniſh Monarch; and never was the iſſue of any diſpute more contrary to what the parties had reaſon to expect.</p>
            <p>UNDER ſimilar circumſtances, my fellow-citizens, a ſtanding army was introduced and ſtationed in this city; which produced the ſcene we now commemorate; and which I know you cannot all remember; but let the ſtranger hear and let the liſtening youth be told; that on the evening of the fifth of March, ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred and ſeventy, under the orders of a mercenary officer, murder with her polluted weapons, ſtood trampling in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018302_0012_0FA5CC223A7BB9B8"/>the blood of our ſlaughtered countrymen; imagination cannot well conceive what mingling paſſions then convulſed the ſoul and agonized the heart!—Thoſe pangs were ſharp indeed which uſhered into life, a <hi>nation!</hi>—like <hi>Hercules</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Hercules is repreſented when very young, engaged in the moſt courageous and dangerous enterprizes—ſuch as encountering lions, ſqueezing them to death againſt his own breaſt, or tearing their jaws aſunder; ſometimes when an infant, graſping ſerpents with a little ſmile upon his cheek, as if he was pleaſed with their fine colours and their motions, and killing them by his ſtrong gripe with ſo much eaſe that be ſcarce deigns to look upon them.</note> ſhe roſe brawney from the cradle, the ſnakes of <hi>Britain</hi> yet hung hiſſing round her horrible, and fell!—At her infant voice they haſted—At the dread of her riſing arm they fled away.</p>
            <p>AMERICA ſeparated from the nations of Europe by the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ocean, and from Britain by the mightier hand of Heaven, is acknowledged an <hi>independant nation;</hi> ſhe has now to maintain her dignity and importance among the kingdoms of the earth. May ſhe never be ſeduced from her true intereſt, by ſubtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, miſtaken policy, or miſguided ambition! but conſidering her own condition may ſhe follow the <hi>maxims of wiſdom,</hi> which are better than the <hi>weapons of war!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT has become faſhionable in Europe, to keep a large ſtanding army in times of peace. The people of Great-Britain have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their averſion to the eſtabliſhment, yet have ſuffered it to gain ground upon the idea of preſerving the balance of power.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018302_0013_0FA5CC22E12369E8"/>This cuſtom is ſo deeply rooted and ſo firmly eſtabliſhed, that nothing ſhort of annihilation of the governments where they have been ſo long tolerated can aboliſh the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>FROM the ſituation and vicinity of the nations of Europe with reſpect to each other, the different extent of territory rendering it more difficult to repel an invaſion from ſome countries than others, for the celerity of defence and the more compleat ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of extenſive countries; from theſe and ſimilar conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even wiſe politicians have defended the propriety of the eſtabliſhment; but let their motives be ever ſo pure, the <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and the <hi>aſpiring</hi> have views more extenſive and ruinous; they have felt the charms and experienced the utility of this engine, and are not wanting in their exertions to ſupport its exiſtence.</p>
            <p>OUR fortunate Alliances in Europe have ſecured us from any danger of invaſion from thence; this ſecurity is derived from conſiderations of the beſt policy and true intereſt of the allied powers.</p>
            <p>THE new and <hi>glorious treaty,</hi> concluded ſince the laſt anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary with the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> whoſe <hi>manners, laws, religion,</hi> and <hi>bloody conteſt for freedom</hi> ſo nearly reſemble our own,

                  <p>If there was ever among Nations a natural Alliance, one may be formed between the two republics. The firſt planters of the four northern States found in this Country an Aſylum from Perſecution, and reſided here from the Year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and eight, to the Year one thouſand ſix hundred and twenty, twelve Years preceeding their Migration. They ever entertained and have tranſmitted to poſterity, a grateful Remembrance of that Protection and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and eſpecially of that religious Liberty they found here, having ſought it in vain in England.</p>
                  <p>"The firſt Inhabitants of two other States, New-York and New-Jerſey, were immediate Emigrants from this Nation, and have tranſmitted their Religion, Language, Cuſtoms, Manners and Character: and America in general, until her Connections with the Houſe of Bourbon, has ever conſidered this Nation as her firſt Friend in Europe, whoſe Hiſtory, and the great Characters it exhibits, in the various Arts of Peace, as well as Atchievements of War by Sea and Land, have been particularly ſtudied, admired and imitated in every State.</p>
                  <p>"A Similitude of Religion, although it is not deemed ſo eſſential in this as in former Ages, to the Alliance of Nations, is ſtill, as it ever will be thought, a deſirable Circumſtance. Now it may be ſaid with Truth, that there are no two Nations, whoſe Worſhip, Doctrine and Diſcipline, are more alike than theſe of the two Republicks. In this particular therefore, as far as it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p>"The Originals of the two Republicks are ſo much alike, that the Hiſtory of one ſeems but a Tranſcript from that of the other: ſo that every Dutchman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the ſubject, muſt pronounce the American Revolution juſt and neceſſary, or paſs a Cenſure upon the greateſt Actions of his immortal Anceſtors: Actions which have been approved and applauded by Mankind, and juſtified by the Deciſion of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>"If therefore an Analogy of Religion, Government, Original, Manners, and the moſt extenſive and laſting commercial Intereſts, can form a Ground and an Invitation to political Connections, the Subſcriber flatters himſelf, that in all theſe Particulars the Union, is ſo obviouſly natural, that there has ſeldom been a more diſtinct Deſignation of Providence to any two diſtant Nations to unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together."</p>

WHEN we conſider our own proſperous condition, and view the ſtate of that nation, of which we were once a part, we even weep over our enemy, when we reflect that ſhe was once great; that her navies rode formidable upon the ocean; that her commerce was extended to every harbour of the globe; that her name was revered wherever it was known; that the wealth of nations was depoſited in her iſland; and that America was her friend, but by means of her ſtanding armies, an immenſe continent is ſeperated from her kingdom,
<note n="‡" place="bottom">A doubt may be entertained of the truth of this aſſertion; but we can hardly believe that it would have entered into the head of a Miniſter or Parliament, to collect a militia in Great-Britain to enforce their acts in America; ſo that in our view, had the army been diſbanded at the end of the laſt war, America and Britain at this moment would have been parts of the ſame Kingdom.</note> and that once mighty empire, ready to fall an untimely victim, to her own mad policy.</p>
            <p>NEAR eight full years have now rolled away, ſince America has been caſt off from the boſom and embraces of her pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parent; and has ſet up her own name among the empires. The aſſertions of ſo young a country, were at firſt beheld, with dubious expectation; and the world were ready to ſtamp the name of raſhneſs or enterprize according to the event.</p>
            <p>BUT a manly and fortunate beginning, ſoon inſured the moſt generous aſſiſtance. The renowned and the ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> came early to the combat—wiſe in council—mighty in battle! Then with new fury raged the ſtorm of war! The ſeas were
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018302_0017_0FA5CC29A2B4B460"/>crimſoned with the richeſt blood of nations! America's choſen legions waded to freedom through rivers died with the mingled blood of her enemies and her citizens; through fields of carnage; and the gates of death!</p>
            <p>AT length, <hi>Independence</hi> is ours—the halcyon day appears, lo from the eaſt I ſee the harbinger, and from the train 'tis peace herſelf; and as attendants all the gentle arts of life; commerce diſplays her ſnow white navies, fraught with the wealth of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; plenty from her copious horn, pours forth her richeſt gifts. Heaven commands! The eaſt and the weſt give up, and the north keeps not back! all nations meet! And beat their ſwords into ploughſhares and their ſpears into pruning-hooks, and reſolve to learn war no more.—Henceforth ſhall the American wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bloſſom as the roſe, and every man ſhall ſit under his vine and under his fig-tree, and none ſhall make him afraid.</p>
