            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>1 Cor. 12.13.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>For by One Spirit are we all Baptized into One Body, whether we be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whether we be Bond or Free, and have been all made to drink into One Spirit.</p>

            <p>SAint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the fore-going Verses of this Chapter, is holding forth the Variety of the Gifts and Graces of the holy Spirit, bestowed of God, through Jesus Christ, upon the Church, some whereof were peculiar to some Members of the Church, and extraordinary, and others were common and universal; also, he doth hold forth the several and peculiar Offices and Services that some Members of the Church had, which were not common to all: All which variety of Gifts and Offices &amp; Officers, did not make a plurality of Bodies, but still the Body of the Church is but
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001161_0003_0FB095E6B60F37D8"/>
One consisting of many Members. The which Oneness of the Body he proves in the words of the Text, <hi>first,</hi> from the One <hi>holy Sacrament of Baptism,</hi> where-with all the Members ae baptized; <hi>secondly,</hi> from the <hi>One holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> whereof all are made partakers, expressed in the Text synecdochically by <hi>drinking into One Spirit,</hi> as else-where it is synecdochicallye <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> by <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> Acts 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>4<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. That both the Sacraments are here understood, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring sense of Expositors upon this Text, and doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear so to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s using the same way and method of Argument else-where, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.5. from the <hi>One Baptism,</hi> as well as <hi>One Lord, One Faith, One God &amp; Father, One Body, One Spirit,</hi> and <hi>One Hope of their Calling,</hi> he proves the Unity of the Members; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. from the <hi>One Bread</hi> in the Lords Supper, whereof all are Partakers, he proves the like Unity of the Members; <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>we being many, are one Bread, and one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which is further to be observed in the Text, is the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> visible Grace of the holy Spirit, I conveyed by and through the means and conduits of the external Signs or Symbols in both the Sacraments, whence a Sacrament is rightly defined to be <hi>An outward and visible Sign of an inward and spiritual Grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same inward and spiritual Grace, and a Pledge to assure us thereof,</hi> and also it is a proper means and Memorial to preserve the Doctrine and Faith of Christ's Death and Passion, and the benefits thereof among us. And so the Church in her Catechism defines a Sacrament, and affirms, <hi>That there are two parts in each Sacrament,</hi> the one, <hi>the outward visible Sign,</hi> the other, <hi>the inward spiritual Grace; the which inward and spiritual Grace in Baptism is a Death unto Sin, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a new birth unto Righteousness,</hi> as well as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001161_0004_0FB095E8248CC7F0"/>
Remission of sin, by the Body and Blood of Christ applyed to us by a lively Faith; in all which the holy Spirit is the principal Author and Agent. And as in the Lords Supper the Body and Blood of Christ is received by Faith, so toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Body and Blood, there's an increase of the sanctifying Grace and Gift of the holy Spirit, formerly given at Baptism, and also at the hearing and believing the Word preached by adult Persons.</p>
            <p>This serves to detect the gross Falshood, Lyes and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies cast upon the Church by certain false Teachers, who not only reject those holy Sacraments, and teach their Hearers to vilifie and contemn them, as well as to reject the use of them, to their great hurt and sin, but do give a false Representation of the Doctrine and Practice of the Church, as if, according to her Doctrine, the Sacraments were nothing else but <hi>Signs,</hi> and <hi>empty Signs too,</hi> as some of them have affirmed, and much worse. And as if, by her Doctrine, the bare external action of the Minister, in the administration of Baptism, by pouring or sprinkling a little Water upon the face of a Person, whether infant or adult, did intirely constitute that person a <hi>Christian,</hi> which, ye see, from what is said in her Catechism, is not the Doctrine of the Church.</p>
            <p>But the general Objection made, even by many others, who approve of the Practice of Baptism, both to Infants and Adult Persons, is, <hi>That the sanctifying Grace of the holy Spirit is not given universally to all baptized persons, either Infants or adult, for that in many baptized persons no certain signs or fruits of the sanctifying Grace of the holy Spirit doth appear in them. Beside that,</hi> Simon Magus <hi>was baptized, and yet was no san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>I Answer</hi>; That if in adult persons no real signs of the sanctifying Grace of the holy Spirit appear in them after Baptism, it is because they have not received it with a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001161_0005_0FB095E99F155620"/>
sincere Faith, which is a necessary Requisit in all adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in order to receive the inward and invisible Grace signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the external Sign; for as Unbelief is an obstruction to the holy Spirits operation, in hearing the Word preached, so it is no less to the same, either in Baptism or the Lords Supper. Next, as to Infants, if after they are become Adult, no real signs of the sanctifying Grace of the holy Spirit appear in them, the like reason may be given, that by their actual Unbelief and Unfaithfulness when they become adult, they have quenched and resisted the same; and yet it must be owned, that such is the goodness of God, that his holy Spirit, tho' oft quenched and resisted in his gracious motions, doth strive with those who are within the Pale of the visible Church, by Baptism, to convert &amp; turn them to God, more especially than with those who are without in the <hi>Heathen</hi> parts of the World. Even as God did strive, by his holy Spirit, to reclaim the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> so that his holy Spirit did not forsake them, but did wone and intreat them, as by his Prophets outwardly, so by his inward Calls and Motions to turn unto God, though they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit, as it is said, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.10. and this with respect that they were a People in covenant with him, by the Sacrament of Circumcision, &amp; other external Observances of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Gather my Saints together unto me, those that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice</hi>; And indeed the word <hi>Saint,</hi> derived from the Latine verb <hi>Santio,</hi> signifies one in Covenant with God; and according to this, by virtue of the Covenant ratified by Circumcision, (the Seal of it) God did call them, as well inwardly by his Spirit, as outwardly by his Prophets, to turn to him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Turn, O back-sliding Children! for I am Married unto you</hi>; compare this with <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. And no less favour have baptized Persons, by their <hi>Baptism,</hi> than the People of <hi>Israel</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001161_0006_0FB095EF57A08DB0"/>
by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> tho' the external Symbols cannot save with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the internal Grace signified thereby.</p>
            <p>But the Adversaries of the holy Sacrament of Baptism, object, <hi>That St.</hi> Paul <hi>saith, there is</hi> One Baptism, <hi>and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Baptism with Water is ceased, being that of</hi> John, <hi>to give place to the Baptism of Christ, which is not with Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with the holy Ghost and with Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answ.</hi> There is but <hi>One</hi> only Baptism for Remission of Sin, consisting of two parts, the <hi>external Water</hi> and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Grace</hi> of Christ, and of the holy Ghost; but that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism with the holy Ghost and with Fire, which Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and <hi>Iohn</hi> did fore-tell, being Miraculous, and not given, or intended to be given universally, is not that One Baptism common to all the faithful, and which is one of the Bonds of their Unity, as appears both from the words of the Text, and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.5. but That Baptism with Water was only <hi>Iohn</hi>'s, is plain contrary to the holy Scripture; for Christ also baptized with Water, tho' not with his own hands, but by the hands of his Disciples, as plainly appears from <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.26. compared with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1, 2. And had not his Disciples at his Command and by his Authority baptized with Water, he could not be said to have baptized; for what they did by his command and authority, was his, and is said to be done by him. And though <hi>Iohn</hi> also baptized with Water, and that our Saviour did so honour his Baptism, that he did receive it, yet it doth not follow, that <hi>Iohn's</hi> Baptism with Water, and that which Christ commanded to his Disciples, (either before or after his Resurrection) was the same; for tho' the Element of Water was one in both, and the general end and intent in both was the same, to wit, <hi>Remission of Sin</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> yet the different manner how Christ was set forth, as the Object of Faith, in that of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism, and that of Christs Disciples, makes a plain difference; for <hi>Iohn</hi> did
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001161_0007_0FB095F1353093C0"/>
teach his Disciples, that they should believe in him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Messiah (or Christ) that was to come, and baptized them in that Faith, but Christs Disciples &amp; Apostles baptized in the Faith of him that was come, beside divers other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Differences betwixt them. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.2, 3, 4, 5. we find, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> baptized certain persons who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism.</p>
            <p>Nor hath it any weight against Baptism with Water, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>He thanked God he baptized but a few of the</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, <hi>and that he was not sent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel</hi>; for the first, he said to take away all occasion from any of them, that, by reason of the Division that was among them, might say, <hi>That they were of Paul</hi>; for it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were baptized, from <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>even as many as believed</hi>; and his main and principal work, as an Apostle, was not to baptize with his own hands, as neither was it of the other Apostles, that Office being generally to be performed by inferior Ministers, whereas the Apostles main work was to preach the Gospel, they were, by their preaching, to lay the Foundation, and others to build on it the Superstructure, whereof even Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism was a part.</p>
            <p>The two holy Sacraments of the New-Testament, to wit, <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> were figured forth under the Old Testament, as that of Baptism by the Baptism of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel,</hi> together with their Wives &amp; infant Children, unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes special Notice of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. as also of the Manna they did eat, and Water of the Rock that they drank of, in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, prefiguring the Lords Supper. And he makes his Discourse upon them an introduction to what he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deliver in the same Epistle, concerning the two Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sacraments of Baptism and the Supper. As also, St.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001161_0008_0FB095F2A5B4AA08"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> declares, <hi>That</hi> Noah <hi>being saved by Water in the Ark,</hi> our Christian Baptism doth answer, <hi>to the like Figure, which doth now save us, not the putting away the filth of the flesh,</hi> [for that's not the end of it, to wash away natural filth of Dirt or Clay from the flesh] <hi>but the answer of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the Resurrection of Iesus Christ</hi>; thereby referring to the answer that Persons to be baptized, were to give to the Questions to be asked them, before Baptism, with respect to their Faith, and professed and promised Subjection and Obedience to the Commands of Christ. Of both which the Church takes notice in the Office of Baptism of Infants, in the first Prayer. See now, how in that Baptism of the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Infant Children, as well as the Men and Women, were baptized unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the Cloud and in the Sea, without being plunged into Water, and yet being a true Baptism, was with Water, but not by Immersion.</p>

            <p>Hence, as God Almighty did take the Infant Children of believing <hi>Iews</hi> into Covenant with himself, (as is clear from <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.11, 12. and other Texts of Scripture) he did require a Promise of them at their Entry into his said Covenant, which they not being able to do by their own Mouthes, they were to do it by the Mouthes of some others under the same Covenant, and which others under the same Covenant could do, as well as their Parents, and of which an exact Record was to be kept, according to <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.12.

At their entrance and admission into what they call their Church, neither the Adult by themselves, nor their Infant Children by any others, make any Promise to be the Lords, and to be faithful and obedient to him, nor give they any declaration before Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, what they believe or profess, in order to Salvation.

            <p>But this sort of Persons, &amp; especially the Preachers among them, do oft in their Assemblies most prophanely &amp; ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well as contemptuously exclaim against the manner of the holy Ordinance of Baptism, appointed by Jesus Christ, as it is practised in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as if what these who present the Children to holy Baptism, commonly called God-fathers and God-mothers, did promise in the name and on the behalf of those Children, what they do not believe either they or the Children (in whose Name they promise) can perform at any time during this mortal life; and then they cry out, <hi>What confusion is here!</hi> Thus not only ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing Gods holy Ordinance, but vilely and wretchedly lying against the <hi>Church of England</hi> &amp; her <hi>Christian</hi> Practice, as some of them have lately done in divers places of these <hi>American</hi> parts <note n="*" place="margin">Particularly one <hi>Tho.

Again, that it is said, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.23. <hi>That</hi> John <hi>was baptizing at</hi> Enon, <hi>because there was much Water there</hi>; according to the <hi>Greek,</hi> and as <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> translates it, there were <hi>many Waters, i. e.</hi> not many Rivers, but many small Runs or streams of Water, which they who have given the Geography of the place, say, had not depth enough of Water to plunge the whole Body under the water; but <hi>Iohn</hi> baptizing so many Thousands as he did, there was need of much Water for the doing it, though he had used but a little to every one. Beside, we do not find that any of the Baptisms used

among the <hi>Iews,</hi> under the Law, was by a total immersion or plunging the whole Body under the Water. That the <hi>Iews</hi> had several sorts of Baptisms under the Law, is evident, and that they were so called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. the Greek word, there translated <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> is <hi>Baptismois, i. e.</hi> Baptisms, and so doth <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> translate it, and so is it rendered on the Margin in divers English Bibles, and particularly in a large Octavo Bible printed at <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>H. H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lls</hi> and <hi>Iohn Field,</hi> 1660 some of which Baptisms, if not most of them, were by sprinkling Water on the Persons, for their purifying, as plainly appears from <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Sprinkle Water of Purifying upon them</hi>; and <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.13, 19. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10, 19. And because in all Signs, the Sign and the thing signified thereby, doth answer by way of Analogy, hence as we are said to be washed by the Blood of Christ, so the heart of the Believer is said to be sprinkled by that Blood, (<hi>i. e.</hi> by the merit, virtue and efficacy of it, applyed by a true and lively faith) 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. And by the like Analogy, <hi>Ezek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 36.25. God promised, <hi>That he would sprinkle clean Water upon his People</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New-Testament) <hi>and they should be clean,</hi> which divers of the Antients understood of the Water of Baptism, as well as that <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Your Bodies washed with pure Water,</hi> pure Water being a Hebraisme referring to the Water of purifying under the Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.7. and 19.13, 19.</p>
            <p>But their last Refuge is from the proper signification of the word <hi>Baptize,</hi> which, they say, some learned men, even of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> have affirmed, signifieth, to plunge the whole Body under Water, from the Greek word <hi>Baptizo. Answ.</hi> But that any of the <hi>Church of England</hi> have affirmed that to be the only, or yet the most proper and frequent signification of it, I do not remember that I have read. But supposing it were so, other men as learned, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more learned, have affirmed, and do affirm, that to plunge the whole Body under Water, is neither the only, nor the most proper signification of it; for it coming from the Greek word <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizo,</hi> which is a derivative from the word <hi>Bapto,</hi> it looseth the force of the primitive word in its signification, as is usual in the like cases, as in the Latine, <hi>senesco, ditesco.</hi> Nor ought we to give trust to any learned man, if what he saith contradict the holy Scripture. But in the holy Scripture we find, that to wash the hands, or to have the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001161_0021_0FB096AE21735EA8"/>
hands washed, is to be baptized, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.38. where it is in our English Translation, <hi>he marvelled that he had not first washed,</hi> the Greek hath it <hi>Ebaptisthe, i. e.</hi> was not baptized: And the like in <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. <hi>except they be baptized,</hi> according to the Greek, <hi>Baptizontas,</hi> and so it is in the English Bible above-mentioned, in those other two places last mentioned; and we are not to question it, for both St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> knew what was proper Greek, and how to write it, as well and much better than any learned man now in the World.</p>
            <p>There are some few others, that being convinced of the <hi>Quakers</hi> vilest and grossest Errors, in the Province of <hi>Pennsilvania</hi> have left their Meetings, and have set up a Meeting by themselves, and as yet continue to hold it up in two or three places, some of whose Speakers have with great rashness and presumption, without all shadow of warrant from holy Scripture, taken upon them Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Power to baptize, upon the pretence of the inward Call of the holy Spirit, with whom I have had some Conference, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been formerly joyned with me against the <hi>Quakers</hi> vilest Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I put them close to it, to give any proof either of Precept or Example in Scripture, where any baptized, who had not an outward Call and Ordination, by laying on of hands, by some that were their spiritual Superiors in the Church? And as concerning <hi>Phillips</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing those of <hi>Samaria, Acts</hi> 8.12. and the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8 38. it is evident, that he was one of the seven Deacons who had Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the laying on of the hands of the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5, 6. But to this they confessed, that they could give no Proof, by either Precept or Example in Scripture. And as to that pretence of their inward Call by the Spirit, I told them, That was not sufficient to convince others, or satisfie them they had such an inward Call that did suffice without the outward Call, unless they could demonstrate their inward Call, either by Miracles, or some other way equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; for tho' <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> wrought no Miracle, and his Baptism was from Heaven, yet he was a Prophet, and had divers concurring Demonstrations to prove his Doctrine and Baptism, that they were of God, and particularly our Saviours Testimony concerning him, and his Father <hi>Zachariah's</hi> prophecy of him. I further told them, they might by the like pretence <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, they had an inward Call or Commission to be Mayor or other Magistrate in the Town

of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which few, if any, would believe, though they should pretend to it, which I thought their Modesty would not suffer them to use any such Pretence. I also told them, that it was to be observ'd by them, that tho' our blessed Saviour was filled with the holy Spirit above measure, yet he had an outward Call by an outward audible Voice from Heaven, by his Father,; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had their outward Call from our Saviour, by audible words, and his laying his hands on them; and the Apostles did lay hands on others whom they ordained; and They were to do it on others who should suceed them, to keep up outward Order in the Church. And I asked them, whether outward Order in the Church was not as necessary as outward Order in the civil State, to prevent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion? They answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was, when there were many; and when they became <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, they would likewise have it: But upon the supposition that they should become many (which they are not like to be) how could they hinder others which might rise up among themselves, and lay equal claim to the inward Call of the Spirit, as any of them?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> not only approves of the inward Call, or moving of the holy Spirit to the Ministerial Function, but the first Question that the Bishop asketh of any that is to be ordained a Deacon, is, <hi>Whether he is moved of the holy Ghost to undertake the same?</hi> and if he should say, Nay, the Bishop would not ordain him</p>
            <p>Their last evasion is, <hi>They had none to whom they could apply for Ordination; for as to the</hi> Church of England (one of them said) <hi>their Bishops had their Ordination from the Pope.</hi> [But this is a common Objection of other Dissenters, as well as of those above-mentioned.] I told him, it was a Mistake; He said, <hi>he had it of them whom he had cause to believe, more than to believe me</hi> [But he did not tell his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors] I replyed, That of whomsoever he had it (whether of me formerly, for I confess, I was (when under the Profession of a <hi>Quaker</hi>) in the same mistake; but now, I thank God, I am better inform'd) it was a great mistake &amp; abuse; for there were Bishops in <hi>England</hi> before either Popery or Pope was in the World, and there has been a continued Succession of Bishops in <hi>England</hi> ever since the first planting of the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And tho' as well before the immediate Reformation from Errors, both in Doctrine and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001161_0023_0FB096B1201D5810"/>
Practice, as for some Ages antecedent, the <hi>Church of England</hi> was too much corrupted with the Errors of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> yet that corruption prevailed rather in a Faction than in the whole Body of the Church; and whatever Power the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> claimed over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> before the Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was but an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation, and was never generally consented to by the whole Church. Beside, we are to distinguish betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her self and the <hi>Papacy,</hi> as betwixt a diseased Person or Leper, and the Leprosie that cleaves to him, who is the same Man still when Leprous, and when cured of his Leprosie, by some Miracle. The <hi>Church of England,</hi> (as other <hi>Protestant Churches</hi>) became reformed, and was not to have a new Foundation. And as she was not to throw away the Scriptures, nor Sacraments, nor many other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Christianity,</hi> because held with great mixtures of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption among them, but retain the good, and reject all that was evil; so nor was she to reject <hi>Church-Government</hi> and <hi>Ordination,</hi> and distinction of Church Officers, well warranted by holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Scripture fore-told, <hi>That Anti-christ was to sit in the Temple of God,</hi> and <hi>That God was to have a People in Mystical Babylon,</hi> which is no argument that the Church was not the Temple of God still, and his People in <hi>Babylon,</hi> were not his People.</p>
