            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Last Words AND DYING SPEECH OF SAMUEL SMITH, Who was Executed at Concord, in the County of Middlesex, and Commonwealth of Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sachusetts, the 26th of December, A. D. 1799, for the Crime of BURGLARY.</head>
            <p>I WAS born in <hi>Middleton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex</hi> and State of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> on the 18th Day of January, A. D. 1745.</p>
            <p>My Parents were honest, industrious, reputable persons; well instructed and much inclined to the Christian Religion, especially my Mother, who is now living to lament the shameful death of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful Son. My Parents gave me but a very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary education, though I often received from them good moral instructions. I have four Brothers and two Sisters now living, who by their good conduct have made themselves reputable in the World, whilst I, by my bad, have brought myself to the Gallows. I have now but a short time to live and make my Peace with my God. I therefore shall not pretend to recollect and publish to the World every particular Crime, of which I have been guilty; for to do this, would require a Month's time, and a Catalogue of my shameful thefts would fill a large Volume. I passed my childhood, as others, pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my <hi>Toys</hi> and <hi>Rattles,</hi> till age and strength required I should do something for my support: From that time till I arrived to the age of 27, I led an honest industrious life, entirely free, not only from the crime, but without any inclination fraudulently to take the property of another person.</p>
            <p>About this time I fell in company with a female of whom I was foolishly and extravagantly fond, but at length, I found her heart was corrupt and the words of her mouth very deceitful. This disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, with the loss of two hundred Dollars, stolen from me, which was all I then possessed in the world, led me frequently to the excessive use of ardent spirits, which caused me very soon to commit the crime of theft, of which I was suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, apprehended and committed to Litchfield gaol; tried, found guilty, and publicly punished.—</p>
            <p>After finding my credit and property were both lost, I then with less remorse of conference continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the horrid practice of Stealing, till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the War, in April, 1775; at which time, I served my Country faithfully. I then list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the term of three years into the Regiment commanded by C. I. Meigs of Connecticut, who wrongfully kept my bounty money, which gave me such a dislike to the Man, that while the Regiment was stationed at Peek's Kill's on the east side of Hudson's River, I deserted said Regiment, about ten or twelve days before the surrender of General Burgoyne. After I left my Regiment I roved through the States of Connecticut, and Massachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setts, and finally went to the Town of Amherst in New-Hampshire where I tarried several years; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time I paid attention to a young Lady of a reputed good character, but she proved false to me, which set me again into the habit of roving and stealing; till at length I went to live in the Town of Lancaster in the County of Worcester, where I courted, and on the 11th day of April, A. D. 1782, was Married, to one Sally Pratt, of said Lancaster, by whom I have had five Children, and they are all living, to hear of the shameful death of their wretched Parent. I earnestly pray to GOD, that these my Children, which I am about to leave behind me may take warning and shun those crimes which have justly rendered my name infamous and brought me to this untimely end.</p>
            <p>My Wife was the offspring of reputable parents, but her wanton conduct proved to me a source of trouble, and her idleness and profligacy have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to commit many and shameful crimes.—Soon after I married I moved to Hollis, in the County of Hillsborough, and State of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, where I lived about fourteen months; during which time I became acquainted with one James McDaniels, a native of Rowley, in said County.—I have ever since been acquainted with, and do now, as a man who expects very soon to enter the eternal World! warn all my fellow creatures, to beware of having any kind of Connection with this same McDaniels, "who is now going about as a roaring <hi>Lion,</hi> seeking whom he may devour." He unlawfully takes his Neighbour's Property: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches the innocent; has Slander on his Tongue, and Malice in his Heart—He has given me satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Evidence that he was the Murderer of one Stone, in Harvard; likewise the Mean of his own Wife's Death: And he does not hesitate to boast, that he gave the fatal Blow to Captain Ephraim Jones, formerly Goal-keeper in this place.—Over such a Man let Government watch.—I then moved back to Lancaster, where I lived about two Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during which time I used frequently to be guilty of the crime of Theft, and have often purchased Plate, which I knew to have been stolen, out of which I used to make sometimes good, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times counterfeit money.</p>
            <p>After the expiration of the above said two years, I removed to Hollis, where, shameful to relate, I did not forsake my predominent vices, stealing, and counterfeiting the Coin of my Country.</p>
            <p>On the 17th day of November, A. D. 1787, I was taken with a Warrant for Stealing three Sheep from Capt. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Richardson of Groton, Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, and on Trial, before the Justice, I confessed the Crime, and for want of Property, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Goal in Concord.</p>
            <p>On the 24th of said November, I was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by a Warrant, and tried before Justice Wood of Concord, for having made and passed counterfeit Money, and ordered to Recognize <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Sum of Three Hundred Pounds for my personal Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the Supreme Court in April following:—But my Circumstances and Character were such, that I could not procure Bonds, and was oblig'd to remain in Prison.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of February following, I broke Goal and made my Escape, but was soon overtaken, brought back, put into Irons, and confin'd in the Dungeon, and there kept 'till April; at which Time, I had my Trial, and was convicted of the above-mentioned Crime, for which I was sined, set in the Pillory, and had my Ears cropped.</p>
            <p>On the 7th day of June. A. D. 1791, I was apprehended with a Warrant in Charlestown, in said County of Middlesex, upon complaint of one Joshua Welcott, for having stolen sundry Goods from him the said Joshua, and was on Trial, before the said Justice, in his opinion, found guilty, and thereupon committed to the common Goal in Concord, and there remained till the next Court of the General Sessions of the Peace, which was on the second Tuesday of the September following; at which Time the said Welcott did not appear to prosecute his Complaint, and I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon discharged. I now say as a dying Man, that I was not guilty of the Crime complained of; and I furthermore declare that the said Welcott did at that Time steal Money from me, out of my Bundle, and for fear I should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him, he complained of me.</p>
            <p>Sometime in the Month of July, in the year A. D. 1794, I was in Boston, and fell in company with two Old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, one by the Name of Fletcher, and the other by the Name of Gilbert, who agreed to meet me at a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Time in a certain Place of Woods about six Miles Southwest from Boston, and there to bring me some Silver Plate, which they said they could procure, by breaking open a certain House. They met me at the Time &amp; Place, and brought a large Quantity of Plate, which they told me they took from Deacon Phillips of Boston. I then told Fletcher and Gilbert, that it was no harm to steal from such rich old Fellows as Deacon Phillips, and that they should go and get some more from some other Person, and bring it to me, and I wou'd work it up into Money, and we would go Shares in the Business. They immediately set out on their second Expedition, and left me in the Woods, where I tarried two Days; and being almost star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Death, I was forced to quit my Stand to gain Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for Nature, and never afterwards saw said Fletcher, or said Gilbert.—Not long after this, there came a Person to me, who called his Name Flush.—said Flush was an Old Countryman, and appeared to be about 50 years of Age. He told me he had Thirty Weight of Silver Plate he wished me to purchase; and said if I did not buy it, he should be obliged to carry it to New-York, for he should be afraid to expose it for Sale any where in these Parts. I told him that I would give him three Shillings per Ounce for it, provided he would bring it to me at such a Time. He left me and I have never since seen him: but I have good reason to suppose, from what I have since heard, that the Plate, offered to me by said Flush, did belong to and was taken from, his Honor Governour Gill. This is all I know respecting this theft, which many have supposed me guilty of: and I furthermore say, that I never stole any plate in my life. Not long after I saw Flush, I was passing through Groton in the County of Middlesex late at Night, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some of the Plate which was taken from Deacon Phillips in a pack swung at my back, a person attempting to catch me, seized hold of my pack, which tore from my shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and I made my escape, but was in a few days after, taken with a Warrant for stealing said Plate, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Gaol in Concord, and from thence removed to the Gaol in Boston, and was thence tried, convicted and sent on to the Castle for fifteen Years—where I tarried about two Years and four Months; at which time, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Weather had frozen over the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, when I made my escape on the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and after suffering both Cold and Hunger, I arrived in the State of Pennsylvania, where I tarried several Months, and behaved myself like an honest Man.—After which I returned home to see my Family, and found my wife had gone of with another Man, and my Children living wherever any Person would take them. During last Winter I lived in the Town of Dublin, in New Hampshire, and behaved myself like an honest Man. Sometime about the middle of June last, I, in the Night Time, broke and entered the House of one Joseph Richards, in Sherburne, and took therefrom some Bacon, an old strainer, and a pair of Trowsers.</p>
            <p>The Night following the 20th of June last, I was passing through the Town of Natick; and seeing a Light in the House of Esquire Boden, I went up to the Window to see what I could discover.—I there saw a Watch hanging up against the side of the House, and a Woman with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in her Hand, and she very soon went to the Cupboard and took, as I supposed, about a Glass of Spirits, which caused me to think she would soon after retiring to bed drop to Sleep. She very soon went to bed; and I, in about fifteen minutes after, entered the Room, where she and her Husband slept, and took therefrom the Watch and some Money, which I found in a Desk Drawer.</p>
            <p>The Night following, I broke open the Store of Deacon Tucker, of Sherburne, which adjoined his Dwelling House, and took therefrom a considerable quantity of English Goods, which I conveyed to the Town of Sudbury, nigh to the House of one <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Moores, and left them in the Woods during the following day. In the Evening of said Day, I went to fetch the Goods into the Moores House, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of viewing them, and consuling what place would be best to conceal them—but to my astonishment, when I came nigh the place where I left the Goods, I was seized upon by a person lying in wait for that purpose: Moores was immediately taken and we were both kept till morning, when we were brought before a Justice of the peace, and by him examined, and committed to Gaol in Concord and from thence removed to Cambridge in October following, where we were both indicted for burglary, and tried for our lives. Moores was acquitted of the crime of Burglary, but found guilty of Theft: whilst I, by the laws of my Country was condemned to die—I, in this public and solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner declare, that Moores did not help me break said Store. Yet, he was very ready to help me conceal the Goods, after I had taken them—I now in my last moments, say to the World, beware of Isaac Moores and his family. Since I was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>7 years of age, hard fortune has been my lot; Theft my living, Gaols my habitation, and very soon the Gallows will be my companion—I shall in a few hours be beyond the Grave; and I pray GOD, I may enter that part of the invisible World, where Thieves do not break through and steal. I have now to perform my last Duty to my Fellow-Creatures, which is, to warn them all to shun every Kind of Sin, and in particular, that Sin, which has brought me to the Gallows.</p>
