            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have lately had a Sight of a printed <hi>Letter</hi> from the Rev. Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> Rector of the College at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> to his Friend in <hi>Boſton,</hi> concerning that he has declared that he heard me ſay, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> told me, of a Deſign he had, of turning out the Generality of the Miniſters in the Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—wherein he cites <hi>two Letters</hi> that I ſent to him about that Affair. The Repreſentation he makes of what I ſaid in thoſe Letters, make it neceſſary, in my Opinion, that <hi>thoſe Letters</hi> ſhould be <hi>publiſhed at large.</hi> I therefore here ſend you a Copy of each of them; and would pray you to publiſh them as ſoon as may be.</p>
            <p>The LETTERS are as follows:</p>

                  <p>I Have often heard that you, when you was down at <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> the Summer paſt, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Perſons, declare that you heard me ſay, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> told me, that he had a Deſign of turning out of their Places, the greater Part of the Miniſters in <hi>New-England,</hi> and of ſupplying their Pulpits with Miniſters from <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:005581_0003_1018AF9E1AC52640"/>
Particularly Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Pomfret</hi> told me that he was there, and heard you ſay it: But only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſays, that you ſaid to him, <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And ſays that he could ſcarcely believe it: and therefore was particular in enquiring of you; taking Care that he might not miſunderſtand you: and you aſſerted to him more than once. <hi>I was exceedingly aſtoniſhed to hear it;</hi> not only <hi>becauſe that I knew that I never had ſaid it to you, nor to any Mortal,</hi> as well as it is poſſible for me to know a Negative, or to know that I had not ſaid any Thing whatſoever that could be mention'd; but alſo, becauſe <hi>when I firſt heard this Report, the Thought of Mr.</hi> Whitefield'<hi>s ſaying any ſuch Thing, was perfectly new to me.</hi> Indeed I heard Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> ſay that he had Thoughts of bringing over a Number of young Men from <hi>England,</hi> into the <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to be ordain'd by the <hi>Tennents;</hi> but ſaid not one Word of any Deſign of their ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pulpits of other Miniſters (made vacant by their being turn'd out) either <hi>there,</hi> or in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I have alſo on ſome Occaſions mention'd it <hi>as my Opinion,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> was <hi>formerly</hi> in the Opinion and Scheme of People's forſaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Miniſters, which poſſibly you might hear of from others; for I have no Remembrance of my ever having any Converſation with you about Things of this Nature; and think it on ſome Accounts very unlikely that I ſhould; I have had but very little Opportunity of Converſation with you, as you know, ſince Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has been in the Country; and I have always known that your Thoughts of Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> and the late Work, were generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005581_0004_1018AFF9441136C8"/>
to be diverſe from mine, and leſs favourable: It is much more unlikely on that Account, that I ſhould enter into Converſation with you, tending to confirm Prejudices againſt Mr. <hi>Whitefield.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, THIS I DECLARE, <hi>that I have no Manner of Remembrance that I ever heard Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or hint any Deſign he had of turning out the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part of the Miniſters of</hi> New-England, <hi>or any Part of them, and introducing others into their Places, from</hi> Great Britain <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>or any other Place, or any Thing like it; nor have I any Imagination that I ever heard Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>ſay any Thing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, any more than that I heard him ſay he had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of dethroning the</hi> great Turk, <hi>and introducing a</hi> new Sultan <hi>to ſit upon his Throne:</hi> And I have equal Reaſon to be confident that I never repreſented, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſaid the former, as I have, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repreſented that he ſaid the latter. If I have ever reported any ſuch Thing to you, who are at ſo great a Diſtance from me, and with whom I have had ſo little Converſation; it is exceeding likely that I have told others the ſame; But I challenge the whole World beſides you, to ſay that they ever heard me ſay any ſuch Thing. <hi>Therefore I deſire you to do</hi> me <hi>and Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>the Juſtice, as publickly to correct your Miſtake</hi> in this, which you have ſo publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; which I perceive has been very much taken Notice of, and has been much the Subject of Talk. <hi>I can't but think, that when you come to conſider of the Matter, you will ſoon be ſenſible that you have been greatly miſtaken; and have by ſome Means or other, ſtrangely confounded Things in your Mind; and that Juſtice and Integrity will conſtrain you ſpeedily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

                  <p>THE Relation you give in your <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. of the Converſation that paſſed between us as we rode together through <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> the laſt <hi>May</hi> was <hi>Twelvemonth,</hi> is one of the moſt amazing Things to me that ever I met with in my Life. I don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our having any Converſation about Mr. <hi>Whitefield:</hi> But that might be, and I might forget it. But if I told ſuch a Story about Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> and what paſs'd between him and me, with ſo many Particulars and Circumſtances (which muſt have been altogether of mine own Invention, <hi>without the leaſt Foundation in Truth</hi>) I don't believe I ſhould have forgot it. I have ſometimes ſaid to others, (as I informed you, in my late Letter to you) that <hi>I ſuppoſed</hi> that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> was <hi>formerly</hi> of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that unconverted Miniſters ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Miniſtry: And I do <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to propagate this Opinion, and a Practice agreable to it. But all that ever I have ſaid about it, has been only as expreſſing <hi>my Opinion;</hi> and <hi>not any declared Deſign</hi> of Mr. <hi>Whitefield.</hi> You are expreſs in it, that I ſaid that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> not only ſpake to me of bringing over Miniſters from <hi>England,</hi> but
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005581_0006_1018AFA086495C18"/>
alſo from <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> which is peculiarly wonderful to me: For I not only, <hi>never heard Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>ſay any Thing of bringing Miniſters into</hi> America <hi>from thoſe Countries laſt mentioned, and from neither of the Countries into</hi> NEW-ENGLAND: But I had never heard, at that Time when Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> was here, of his having any Followers in <hi>thoſe Countries;</hi> and I ſuppoſe he had none: The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Work that has been in <hi>Scotland</hi> has been all <hi>ſince,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitefield'</hi>s Deſign of going to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was I ſuppoſe form'd afterwards: Some Things that he told me of his Deſigns, ſeem'd inconſiſtent with his having formed the Deſign thon. But the moſt amazing of all is, that <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd as one of the Countries from whence Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> would ſupply <hi>New-England</hi> with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. If I had ever heard any ſuch Thing from Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> doubtleſs I ſhould have remember'd it; for I ſhould have looked upon it very ſtrange; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never heard of any Thing like a Revival of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of late in <hi>Ireland;</hi> or any Intereſt that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had there; or any Expectations he had from thence. <hi>I don't know that Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>ever ſo much as mention'd the</hi> NAME <hi>of</hi> THAT LAND <hi>to me.</hi> You ſay that I told you, "That I took all Opportunities to talk with Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> alone about this Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But when Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſaw that I did not approve of his Deſign <hi>in that Matter,</hi> he did not ſeem to chuſe to ſay any Thing about it; he would either turn off the Diſcourſe upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, or go out of the Room." <hi>This Account is amazing to me: It is all of it perfectly new to me.</hi> Nor can I conceive what any Imagination, that ever
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005581_0007_1018AFFD308E2530"/>
I ſaid any ſuch Things, ſhould ariſe from. I indeed have told ſeveral Perſons, that I once purpoſely took an Opportunity to talk with Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> alone about <hi>Impulſes:</hi> and have mention'd many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of our Conference together, on that Head: That I told him ſome Reaſons I had to think he gave too great Heed to ſuch Things: and have told what Manner of Replies he made; and what Reaſons I offered againſt ſuch Things. And I alſo ſaid that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> did not ſeem to be offended with me: but yet did not ſeem to be inclined to have a great deal of Diſcourſe about it: And that in the Time of it he did not appear to be convinced by any Thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaid. I have alſo ſaid that I at that Time talked with Mr. <hi>Barber</hi> (who came to my Houſe with Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>) about ſome of his <hi>Impulſes;</hi> dealing plainly with him; whereby he ſeem'd to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and replied with Earneſtneſs and Zeal. It is alſo true (tho' I don't know that ever I ſpake of it before) that I thought Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> liked me not ſo well, for my oppoſing <hi>theſe Things.</hi> And tho' he treated me with great Kindneſs; yet he never made ſo much of an Intimate of me, as of ſome others. It is alſo true, that I once talked with Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> (tho' not alone) about <hi>judging other Perſons to be unconverted.</hi> But <hi>that I took all Opportunities to talk with him, about a Deſign of his, of turning out the Generality of the Miniſters of</hi> New-England, <hi>or</hi> any Miniſters; <hi>or that I took any one Opportunity to talk with him about it; or that I ever ſaid a Word to him, or he to me, either alone, or with others, about</hi> any ſuch Deſign; <hi>or that I took many Opportunities to talk with him about any of his Errors,</hi> (as your Expreſſion ſeems

to imply) <hi>or that he ever went out of the Room when I was talking with him about any of his Errors, ſo put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an End to, or avoiding the Diſcourſe; or that be ever turned off ſuch Diſcourſe to any Thing elſe;</hi> I SAY THESE THINGS ARE NOT TRUE. And if I ever told you any ſuch Things as theſe when we were riding through <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> or at any other Time, I was beſide my ſelf and knew nothing what I ſaid; or elſe I am beſide my ſelf now, and have had ſome ſtrange ſupernatural Change paſſed upon me, ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literating my own Ideas, and all Memory of moſt remarkable Things that formerly I knew, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd for a long Time, ſo as to give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Account of 'em to you; that they are to me as if they never had been. <hi>I do ſolemnly declare in the Fear of</hi> GOD, <hi>that I han't the leaſt Trace or Footſtep of any one of theſe Things in my Memory, either as true in Fact, or ſpoken by me.</hi> And dear <hi>Sir,</hi> if <hi>theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Things</hi> are true, is it not ſtrange that I ſhould keep theſe great Secrets ſhut up in my own Breaſt, from all Mankind, to reveal 'em to <hi>you only;</hi> that when I knew <hi>ſuch remarkable Things</hi> of one ſo famous as Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> and ſo much the Subject of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation thro' <hi>New-England,</hi> I ſhould make <hi>you, above all the World, my Confident,</hi> to declare them ſo freely to you, after I had kept them ſecret for <hi>two or three Years.</hi> If I had mention'd <hi>ſuch remarkable Things</hi> to any other, it could not but be much taken Notice of by them: and it would doubtleſs have been talked of by ſome-body elſe beſides you. <hi>Theſe Things are all new to my neareſt Friends; they never heard of any of them, 'till they heard of them as coming from you.</hi> And I am willing that all my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005581_0009_1018AFFED88C0AD8"/>
and thoſe that I have been moſt converſant with, Miniſters or others, in this Town or elſewhere, ſhould be enquired of, whether they ever heard me report any ſuch Thing. I have moſt diligently ſearch'd my Memory as to what paſs'd between Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> and me, to find out what there was that I could ſay about it, from whence it ſhould be poſſible for you ſo to conceive of Things. And I cannot conceive what it ſhould be. Whether you have heard ſome Report from ſome-body elſe, that in Length of Time is become inſenſibly blended with ſomething that I might ſay, and you might miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, I cannot tell; if you diligently enquire, you will be moſt likely to find out: <hi>But certainly there has been ſome ſtrange and wonderful Miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Confuſion ariſen in your Mind, by ſome Means or other, that caus'd you ſo confidently, publickly &amp; plentifully to report theſe Things of me.</hi> I beg of you thoroughly to conſider it; and <hi>inſiſt upon it, as what Juſtice to others Characters does greatly require from you, publickly to correct theſe groſs Miſtakes.</hi>

about Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> at that Time (tho' I remember conſiderable of other Converſation, as about <hi>my Book,</hi> and about <hi>Connecticut Laws</hi>) yet it's <hi>poſſible</hi> I might ſay to you, that I believ'd Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> did aim at People's forſaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Miniſters, and to endeavour that there ſhould be a Supply of converted Miniſters, as far as in him lay; or ſomething to that Purpoſe.

            <p>Theſe <hi>Sir,</hi> are the Letters that Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> mentions, and cites, in what he has lately publiſhed about this Affair. Theſe are ſome of <hi>the Letters that have paſſed between us,</hi> (and thoſe of 'em which he cites as moſt to his Purpoſe) <hi>conſidering which,</hi> he tells the World, that <hi>it was very unexpected to him, to hear that I ſhould write a Letter to</hi> Boſton, <hi>to be printed, wherein there is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of ſome Things which he had reported:</hi> inſinuating to the World, that in theſe Letters, I had in Effect
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005581_0011_1018B00470A71400"/>
own'd all. Whereas it appears that I have own'd no Part of his Report, but have moſt ſolemnly deny'd every Article of it. Theſe are the individual Letters, of which he ſays expreſly, that in <hi>theſe Letters; tho' I have not uſed exactly the ſame Terms with him; yet I have uſed a Variety of thoſe which are equally full and ſtrong: And if we ſtill differ, it is only about ſome particular Terms, and inconſiderable Circumſtantials, which are not worthy of any Diſpute.</hi> Theſe are the Letters in which Mr. <hi>Clap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> plainly inſinuates, that I in a Manner had conceded to all that he had reported, <hi>by ſundry fair and ingenuous Conceſſions to him,</hi> as he expreſſes himſelf; ſlightly adding theſe Words, <hi>Indeed Mr.</hi> Edwards <hi>ſeems not willing to allow that he mention'd</hi> Ireland; <hi>becauſe he never heard of any Intereſt Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>had there</hi> &amp;c. Juſt as tho' this was almoſt the only Circumſtance wherein he and I differ'd; and as tho' I ſcarcely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that; tho' (as he ſays) I <hi>ſeem'd not willing to allow it; becauſe I never heard of any Intereſt Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>had there.</hi> Now dear <hi>Sir,</hi> you have Opportunity to compare theſe Letters with what he has publiſhed to the World about them. And I am willing to leave it with you, and every one that pleaſes, to judge how full his Paper is of Artifices, intirely to miſlead the Minds of his Readers, as to their Conception of the whole Import and Drift of theſe Letters; not only in what has been mention'd, but in his Manner of introducing and intermingling broken Scraps of theſe Letters, and his Manner of joining together diſtant Sentences, and broken Pieces of Sentences, (that have no Connection in the Letters themſelves) as tho' they were a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Diſcourſe, and his Manner of diſcanting on them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005581_0012_1018AFA7C46D2DC0"/>
I am willing that every Reader, who has read his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſhould judge for himſelf, whether in reading it his own Mind was not lead to conceive of theſe Letters, as Things extremely diverſe from what he finds them to be. Doubtleſs Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> truſted to it, that I had kept no Copies of my Letters; otherwiſe he would never have ſo exceedingly expoſed himſelf: I am willing that you and others ſhould judge for themſelves, how far, one whoſe Conſcience will not reſtrain him from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Repreſentations of Letters written, that he may deſtroy others Characters, and render 'em odious to the World, is capable of unfair dealing in repreſenting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Converſation; where there are no Witneſſes, or written Words, that can be produced to confute him. And who can be ſafe in human Society, if ſuch Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are taken, in order to ruin their Fellow-Creatures and Brethren, by Gentlemen from whom ſo different Things might be expected? If it had been true, that I had ſaid juſt as Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> has reported, yet how vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently has that Practice been cried out of, by Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on that Side of the Controverſies of the preſent Day, of publickly making Uſe of private Converſation, and the Report of ſingle Perſons, to deſtroy the Characters of others? And eſpecially how ill does this become Rector <hi>Clap,</hi> after he knows that that ſingle Perſon that he ſays thus reported to him, does ſo ſtrongly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly deny it, intreating of him therefore to forbear? What a Treatment is this of Chriſtian Brethren!—This dear <hi>Sir,</hi> is a Specimen of the Manner and Spirit, in which the Controverſies of the preſent Day are carried on againſt Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> by many Perſons (for I am far from thus charging all his Oppoſers) the Perſons frequently hiding themſelves, &amp; concealing their Names.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005581_0013_1018B00632319430"/>
And tho' I think it but to little Purpoſe, to carry on a Controverſy with theſe Perſons from the Preſs, unleſs when forced to it by groſs Slanders; yet I can't but ſay on this Occaſion, that it ſeems to me worthy greatly to be lamented, by all true Lovers of the Chriſtian Religion, which conſiſts ſo much in Love &amp; Forgiveneſs, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſhould be purſued with ſo much Violence, and Appearance of inveterate Oppoſition, and indefatigable Endeavours to blacken him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and with ſuch Artifices, as it would be mean to uſe, with Reſpect to the baſeſt Miſcreant; and that for former Errors, which are not at all to be wondred at, conſidering his Youth, and the Circumſtances of his Education &amp;c—; when there ſeems to be ſo little Appearance of Obſtinacy and Incorrigibleneſs in him, and ſo much of the contrary; and when ſo little can be found, by his moſt watchful Enemies, now, to blame him for. I think this is a proper Occaſion, for the meek Followers of the Lamb of God, to lie low before God, and lament the Corruption of human Nature, and the Sin and Shame of their dear Country, and cry humbly to Chriſt, that he would ride forth proſperouſly, becauſe of Truth, Meekneſs, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And with Reſpect to the Affair that is the Subject of the preceeding Letters, doubtleſs ſo great a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction between Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> and me, in ſuch a State of Things as the Country is now in, and relating to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, concerning whom the Country is ſo much divided in their Sentiments, with Spirits ſo deeply, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily engaged, will cauſe a Variety of Reflections and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005581_0014_1018AFAB2E1228B0"/>
Cenſures; and every one will ſay as he is diſpoſed. However, I think my ſelf now called openly to make this DECLARATION: <hi>That ever Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>ſaid any Thing to me, or I to him, of any Deſign of his of turning out the bigger Part of the Miniſters of</hi> New-England, <hi>or any where elſe, or ever ſo much as hinted, either he or any of his Company, any Thing of that Nature; or of his bringing over any Miniſter, or Candidate for the Miniſtry, from</hi> Scotland, <hi>or</hi> Ireland, <hi>into any Part of</hi> America, <hi>or from any one Country in</hi> Europe, <hi>into</hi> New-England; <hi>or that I ever reported any ſuch Thing to Mr.</hi> Clap, <hi>or any other Perſon, or that ever any Thought of Mr.</hi> Whitefield's <hi>ſaying, or hinting, any Thing like either of theſe Things, ever entred into my Heart, 'till I heard 'em as coming from Mr.</hi> Clap; <hi>or that Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>ever intimated to me, any Deſign of his going to</hi> Scotland, <hi>or making any Intereſt there; or that he ever mention'd the Name of</hi> Ireland <hi>in my bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> I ſay that any of theſe Things ever were, I have no Remembrance: <hi>God is my Witneſs who ſearches my Heart, and will bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and make manifeſt the Counſels of the Heart.</hi> And whether it be probable that I ſhould wholly forget all theſe Things, if they indeed had been; eſpecially thoſe remarkable, great Things, that Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> has reported that I ſaid, after I had well remembred them for two Years and an half, ſo as to give Him a diſtinct Account of them, I leave others to judge. And whether I have a Conſcience ſufficient to reſtrain me from Lying with this Solemnity or no; yet, I muſt alſo leave it to others to judge, whether it be likely that when I had ſo grand a Secret committed to me, of a Scheme to bring about
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005581_0015_1018B00B52F8AC98"/>
ſo great a Revolution, as the turning out moſt of the Miniſters in the Country, and bringing over four or five Hundred from <hi>Europe,</hi> to ſettle in their Places, I ſhould carefully keep it ſecret from every Mortal for two or three Years, and declare it freely to Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> and never to any other Perſon before or ſince. For I now publickly Challenge the whole World beſides Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> to declare, if they ever heard me report any ſuch Thing.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> ſays, he and I well agreed to condemn many Errors &amp;c.—: That might be; for all the Land knows that I ever condemned many Errors. But there was little in our Converſation, in the Journey Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> ſpeaks of, to draw me to ſuch a Confidence in him, as to chooſe him above all the World, to reveal my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Secrets to: For he immediately fell upon me, as he knows, as ſoon as ever we began to ride the Road to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, about ſome Paſſages in my Book, concerning the Revival of Religion, greatly blaming me, earneſtly diſputing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Thus dear <hi>Sir,</hi> I have endeavoured to ſet forth this latter as it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Publick Controverſy from the Preſs, <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">
