            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>LIBERTY, evangelical and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial! Jewel of ineſtimable Price! Thou Bleſſing, of all Bleſſings the firſt! Woo'd and courted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; won and wedded by few! Ever near us; yet often at a diſtance fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied! Thro' all the <hi>Modes of Faith,</hi> by the SAINT purſued; and, in every <hi>Frame of Government,</hi> by the PATRIOT ſought! O thou coeleſtial GOOD—or rather THOU who art the AUTHOR of all GOOD, terreſtrial and coeleſtial—SUPREME ARCHITECT <hi>of the</hi> UNIVERSE; who, by our great and SPIRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUAL MASTER thy Son, haſt taught us the true <hi>Way of Liberty</hi>—the Way of being <hi>free</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> thro' Him! May I now be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016526_0006_0F9C8B02E1168908"/>and enlivened by a Ray from THEE, while I endeavour to ſhew, that the Doctrine delivered in my Text for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment and Exerciſe of <hi>Liberty,</hi> among CHRISTIANS in general, is what the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this ANCIENT SOCIETY (by whoſe appointment I appear in this place) have bound themſelves by the ſtrongeſt Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to follow, in the ſeveral Relations they ſuſtain; viz.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in all their <hi>Meetings and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> with each other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in <hi>Society</hi> at large. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in <hi>private Life,</hi> as Individuals glowing with the Love of their Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and ſeeking to promote their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as far Opportunities can reach, or the wide Wiſh of Benevolence extend.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe THREE GRAND PILLARS, founded on the adamantine Rock of ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL TRUTH, we profeſs to ſupport the <hi>Fabric of our Labors;</hi> convinced that other Foundation than what the great MASTER-BUILDER hath laid, can no Man lay. Did we preſume to depart from this, or propoſe to cultivate a Science, which hath any thing leſs for its Object than the Contemplation
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016526_0007_0F9C8B03A0CDF6E8"/>and Imitation of that everlaſting <hi>Order, Harmony</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> which ("in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Number and Weight") HE hath eſtabliſhed through all his Works; I ſhould conſider our Foundations as laid in the <hi>Sand,</hi> and our Superſtructures raiſed of <hi>Stubble.</hi> Whatever Curioſity might have at firſt prompted me to pry into the Secrets of this Science, the moſt ſolemn Obligations could not have engaged my Adherence to it, when found repugnant to antecedent Obligations, which are indiſpenſible, and therefore more ſolemn.</p>
            <p>Theſe were my early <note n="*" place="bottom">Sermon preach'd on St. John Baptiſt's Day, 1755.</note> Declarations. Many Years have ſince roll'd over my Head. That <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi> which I ever wiſh'd to maintain on grave and ſerious Occaſions, is now (thro' various Trials and Viciſſitudes, public and private) become habitual to me. I would not, therefore, upon this Occaſion, or in this ſacred Place, riſe up to indulge the wanton Sport of Imagination: but my Hope is that, in Diſcharge of the preſent Duty aſſigned me by the <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> I may be in ſome Degree inſtrumental, among all who honour us with their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, in that beſt Office of a Chriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter —the rendering GOD more feared and more adored, and <hi>Mankind</hi> more happy and more in Love with each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016526_0008_0F9C8B045FA228E8"/>
I proceed, then, to apply the Apoſtle; Doctrine to my <hi>firſt Head</hi> of Diſcourſe; and, for that End, it is neceſſary to recite ſome preceding Parts of his ſublime CHARGE.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Wherefore, ſays he, laying aſide all Malice, and all Guile, and Hypocriſies, and Envies, and all Evil-Speaking—</q> be ye as <q>
                  <hi>living Stones,</hi> built up a <hi>ſpiritual Houſe</hi>—as FREE, and not uſing your LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY as a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as the Servants of GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding theſe Words it muſt be obſerved that, as in our modern Times; ſo likewiſe, from the firſt Stages of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> its true Purpoſe, reſpecting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty both ſpiritual and temporal, hath been miſunderſtood or miſinterpreted by many.</p>
            <p>From the Power of Bigotry, the Strength of Prejudice, a ſtrange Meanneſs and unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Frame of Mind; ſome, who were firſt called into evangelic Freedom, had ſtill, rooted in their Temper, a beggarly Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the old abrogated Rites and Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, both <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Pagan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aſtoniſhed at this, St. Paul, with his uſual Fervor of Eloquence, cries out— <q>O fooliſh Galatians! who hath bewitched
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016526_0009_0F9C8B0524D3F2B0"/>you?—After having known God, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are known of Him, how turn ye back to the weak and beggarly Elements, wherewith ye deſire again to be united?</q>—Quit this Folly—be perſuaded to <q>ſtand faſt in the Liberty, wherewith CHRIST has made us FREE; and be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled again with the Yoke of Bondage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Others there were, and ſtill are, in the contrary Extreme; ſo hardly do Men ever <hi>ſquare</hi> their Conduct by the <hi>golden Rule,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the Text.</p>
            <p>Such were many of the early Jewiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. The <hi>new Law</hi> of CHRIST, which promiſed them Liberty from the ancient ſpiritual Bondage, they interpreted into a Scheme of ſuch unbounded Licentiouſneſs, as diſſolved all Obligations even of their own <hi>moral Law,</hi> which, he expreſſly told them, he "came not to deſtroy but to fulfil." Affecting to conſider themſelves as the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Favorites of God, and under his ſole Government, they ſought an Exemption from the Authorities of this World, and were for trampling under Foot the Powers ordained, or permitted, by him.</p>
            <p>Thus, forgetting the <hi>Spirit of the Goſpel,</hi> and blown up with the Pride of their <hi>own
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016526_0010_0F9C8B05E1795600"/>Spirit;</hi> they treated with Contempt all whom they conſidered as Unbelievers, or leſs righteous than themſelves. In <hi>private Life,</hi> they thought that their ſuperior Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Sanctity and furious Zeal would atone for all Sorts of <q>Malice, Guile, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, Envies and Evil Speaking;</q> and, in <hi>public Life,</hi> would juſtify Seditions, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and the Deſtruction of their Brethren—</p>
            <p>Miſerable Infatuation! as if the GOD of all <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> could be ſerved, by extirpating from our Hearts not only thoſe native Dictates of <hi>Humanity</hi> which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to give us ſome Degree of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this World; but thoſe nobler Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of CHRISTIAN CHARITY, which are our beſt Preparation for the unbounded Happineſs of the World to come!</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle, in my Text, contends ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly againſt this ſad Miſtake; teaching that it leads not to the <hi>Uſe</hi> but deplorable <hi>Abuſe</hi> of <hi>true Liberty;</hi> making it a Covering for every wicked Purpoſe, and enſlaving us more and more to thoſe internal Paſſions, from which our DIVINE MASTER came to ſet us FREE.</p>
            <p>To the like Purpoſe are we taught by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great and <hi>wiſe Maſter.</hi>—"SIX Things,"

            <p>Theſe <hi>ſeven Abominations</hi> of Solomon, comprehended alſo by St. Peter under the general Term <hi>Maliciouſneſs,</hi> muſt ever be peculiarly hateful to Us, as a SOCIETY OF FRIENDS; linked together by a ſtrong Tie of BROTHERLY LOVE, as well as by every other Tie of RELIGION and Law, for the Advancement of true Humanity, genuine good Humour, undiſſembled Virtue, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Liberty and uſeful Science.</p>
            <p>Indeed the whole Doctrine of the Text (calling us to conſider ourſelves <q>as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God,</q> in the Uſe of every Thing which he offers for our Enjoyment here) muſt ſtill be neceſſary among all Societies of Men, in a World wrapt up in falſe Peace;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016526_0012_0F9C8B076EBE6288"/>truſting too much to external Profeſſions, and where Multitudes have yet to learn— That TRUE RELIGION is ſomething <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> and deſign'd to perfect the Soul in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, thro' the Fear and Love of God— That ſhe muſt lie deeper than in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Profeſſions— <q>Muſt reach the inner Parts, or rather take her Riſe there, even in the hidden Man of the Heart, where Chriſt bruiſes the Serpent, ſubdues our natural Corruptions,</q> erects his Throne within us, and conſecrates us Temples of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>It is in this Senſe only, that Men can be conſidered as <hi>living Stones, built up a ſpiritual Houſe!</hi> It is in this Senſe only that they can enjoy <hi>Liberty as the Servants of God;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out "Maliciouſneſs," and without Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs!</p>
            <p>As to you, Brethren! I hope I need not remind you that if none be <hi>accepted</hi> among us, but ſuch as ſtrive daily, thro' the Grace of Heaven, to lay aſide thoſe evil Paſſions, condemned by the Apoſtle; then ſhall the LODGE be truly denominated a "Spiritual Houſe," and all its Members "Living Stones," hewn out of the <hi>Rock of Ages,</hi> and adorned with Jewels of unſpeakable Value. Then ſhall they be <hi>free</hi> indeed! for the

            <p>That WISDOM which deſcends from on high— <q>a pure Influence flowing from the Glory of the Almighty—which is the Brightneſs of the everlaſting Light, the unſpotted Mirror of the Power of God, and THE IMAGE OF HIS GOODNESS— more beautiful than the Sun and above all the Order of Stars—pure, peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be entreated—which whoſoever findeth, findeth Life—</q>
            </p>
            <p>That STRENGTH, which depends not on the Arm of Fleſh, nor delights in Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Confuſion; but is a Refuge to the Diſtreſs'd, a Band of Union among Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and a Source of Comfort in our own Hearts—</p>
            <p>That BEAUTY, which ſhines forth in the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of Holineſs, the <hi>Jewels</hi> of Mercy, the <hi>Cloathing</hi> of Humility, and the Practice of all Religious, Moral and Social Duties.</p>

In Concluſion, therefore, to this <hi>firſt Head</hi> of Diſcourſe; let me, in the Fullneſs of my pledged Affection, exhort you to remember, in all your <hi>Meetings</hi> and <hi>Communications,</hi> that you are Brethren; although <hi>free,</hi> yet on the <hi>Level;</hi> bound to keep within the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi> of mutual Good-Will; and to frame your Conduct by the <hi>Square</hi> of Doing as you would be done by. Keep an open Heart to every ſuffering Brother, ready to receive him as a Tempeſt-driven Voyager into a Port of Safety; ſeeking among you that Relief and Shelter, which he ſought in Vain, while toſs'd upon the reſtleſs Ocean of common Life.</p>
            <p>Be of one Mind. Avoid all Levity of Converſation. Be ſober and temperate; abſtaining from every Exceſs that would enervate the Body, debaſe the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cheriſh Strife and diſhonour your Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Study to be quiet, and to do your own Buſineſs with your own Hands; as knowing that <q>a <hi>wiſe Brother</hi>'s Delight is in the WORK OF HIS CRAFT.</q> Learn when to be ſilent, and when to ſpeak; for <q>a Babbler is an Abomination, becauſe of the <hi>unſpeakable Words,</hi> which a <hi>Man</hi> may not utter,</q> but in a proper Place.</p>

Theſe are fundamental Principles, and Practices of immutable Obligation in our Society. Flowing from the Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Antiquity, they have roll'd down to us, in pure and uncorrupted Streams, through the Channels of Time; and, we truſt, will ſtill roll, broader and deeper, until the <hi>dread Order</hi> of this TERRESTRIAL FABRIC ſhall be conſummated in the <hi>endleſs Order</hi> of ETERNITY. While we draw from ſuch ſacred Sources, our true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as in Times paſt, ſo likewiſe now and in Times to come, in different Climes and Ages, ſhall be able to ſilence <q>the Tribe of Scorners;</q> and to convince them that the only Qualities we wiſh to honour are thoſe which form good Men and good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; and the only Buildings we ſeek to raiſe, are <hi>Temples for Virtue and Dungeons for Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Societies of this World—Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Kingdoms and Commonwealths— being of leſs perfect Conſtitutions, have been of leſs permanent Duration. Although Men have buſied themſelves, thro' all Ages, in <hi>forming</hi> and <hi>reforming</hi> them, in caſting down and building up; yet ſtill their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have been vain!

Hence their Fabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, unable to ſupport themſelves, tumbled to the Foundation, through internal Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or were ſhaken to Pieces by external Violence.</p>
            <p>The EGYPTIAN, the BABYLONIAN, the ASSYRIAN, the PERSIAN <hi>Empires;</hi> the <hi>Commonwealths</hi> of ATHENS, of SPARTA, and of ROME, with many more of later Date—Where are they now? "FALL'N— FALL'N—FALL'N"—the weeping Voice of Hiſtory replies! The Meteors of an Age, the Gaze of one Part of the World; they roſe—they blaz'd awhile on high—they burſt and ſunk again, beneath the Horizon, to that Place of Oblivion, where the pale Ghoſts of departed Grandeur fleet about in ſad Lamentation of their former Glory!</p>
            <p>Such have been the Changes and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which, as a Fraternity, we have been.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016526_0017_0F9C8B0B21C078F0"/>From the Boſom of the LODGES, (ſeated on an Eminence) its Foundations reaching the Center and its Summit the Sky; we have beheld, as upon a turbulent Ocean at an immenſe Diſtance beneath us, the States of this World alternately mounted up and caſt down, as they have regarded or neglected the Principles deſcribed above; while, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by them, the ſublime Fabric of our Conſtitution has remained unſhaken through Ages—and, thus ſupported, it ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, while the Sun opens the Day to gild its Cloud-cap'd Towers, or the Moon leads on the Night to chequer its ſtarry Canopy. The Current of Things may roll along its Baſis <note n="*" place="bottom">A few Sentences which were leſt out of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Editions of the Sermon on St. John Baptiſt's Day, 1755, as relating only to the Society before whom it was preached, are interwoven in this and the 12th Page of the preſent diſcourſe.</note>; the Tide of Chance and Time may beat againſt its Walls; the ſtormy Guſts of Malice may aſſault its lofty Battlements, and the heavy Rains of Calumny may deſcend upon its ſpacious Roof—but all in vain. A Building, thus conſtructed and ſupported, is impregnable <hi>from without;</hi> and can then only be diſſolved when the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the Univerſe ſhall be ſhaken, and <q>the great Globe itſelf, yea all which it inherit,

            <p>But altho' we have ſeen thoſe Changes, Convulſions and Diſſolutions; we have not ſeen them with Inſenſibility, nor without Heart-felt Grief and a ſympathetic Tear. And this brings me to my—</p>
            <p>SECOND HEAD, which was to ſhew— That our Love to God and Man leads us to cultivate the ſame rational and evang lie Uſe of Liberty in <hi>Society at large,</hi> as in our own ſubordinate Societies.</p>
            <p>This, we know, is a more arduous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor; becauſe the ſame watchful Care cannot be ſo eaſily applied to the Admiſſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or Government of Members, in large Societies as in ſmall. Nevertheleſs, if every Man, firſt in his own Houſe, and then in all thoſe leſſer Societies of Brethren with whom he may be connected, would learn, in the Apoſtle's Uſe of Liberty, to ſubdue every evil and diſcordant Paſſion; the bleſſed Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit would eaſily be carried forth into Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety at large. Individual States would not only be happy, durable, and <hi>free</hi> from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016526_0019_0F9C8B0C9F6FE5B8"/>Broils and Convulſions; but <q>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would no more riſe againſt Nation</q> in dreadful Havoc and Oppreſſion. The whole World would be as ONE HARMONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS LODGE, knit together in <hi>Brotherly Love,</hi> and obedient to the Will of the great HEAVENLY MASTER!</p>
            <p>Such a glorious Aera many believe to be <hi>promiſed,</hi> and hope it may yet come. Our Principles lead us to cheriſh this Hope; and, as the beſt Means, under Providence, for its accompliſhment, to reſiſt Violence, and to ſupport Juſtice, Truth, Freedom and Happineſs in the Governments to which we belong.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine that <hi>One</hi> Man's Grandeur, or the Grand ur of a <hi>Few,</hi> is to be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of <hi>All,</hi> can have no reception among us. We can acknowledge no abſolute uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable power upon Earth; and can form no Conjecture whence ſuch power could come, or be pretended. From GOD, the ſupreme Fountain of all Power, it could not come; without ſuppoſing he granted it to diſhonour his own Perfections, deface his Image in his Works, and debaſe his whole Creation. From MAN it could not come;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016526_0020_0F9C8B0D60C1A2A8"/>unleſs we ſuppoſe him, voluntarily and in his ſober Senſes, conſenting to his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Miſery and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>In our Eſtimation, therefore, "no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can be of <hi>divine</hi> Original, but as it reſembles God's own Government; round whoſe eternal Throne, Juſtice and Mercy wait. And all Governments muſt be ſo far <hi>divine,</hi> as the LAWS rule; and every Thing is ordered, under God, by <hi>free and common conſent."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To contend for ſuch Governments, with a holy, enlightened, and unquenchable zeal, is the higheſt temporal Glory. Wherefore, we dwell with Rapture upon the Records of former Renown, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template with Veneration thoſe tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Scenes of Heroiſm; in which we behold the BRAVE 2nd the FREE wearing upon their Swords the Fate of Millions—while the divine GENIUS OF VICTORY, eſpouſing their Cauſe, hovers o'er their Heads with expanded Wing; reaching forth the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wreath that is to ſurround their trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Brow; and ſmiling upon the <hi>deciſive Moment</hi> that is to fix the Happineſs of future Generations!</p>

They who (from a Senſe of Duty to God and their Country, ſeeking that LIBERTY and PEACE which Heaven approves) have thus acted their Part, whether in more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated or inferior Stations, form the firſt Claſs in the Roll of Worthies. And when they deſcend again into private Life, caſting behind them vain Pomp and faſtidious Pride, to mingle with their Fellow-Citizens in all the tender Charities and endearing Offices of Society and Humanity; their Characters, if poſſible, become ſtill more Illuſtrious. Their very Maims and Scars are nobly Honourable. The Reſpect which they command, grows with their growing Years; and they approach the Horizon of Life, as the Sun in ſerene and ſetting Glory, with Orb more enlarged and mitigated, though leſs dazzling and ſplendid. Even their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous old Age, while it can only recount the Feats of former Days, will be liſtened to with Attention: Or ſhould they ſurvive all the active Powers both of Body and Mind, yet ſtill, like ſome grand Structure, tottering and crumbling beneath the Hand of Time, they will be conſidered as majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Ruins, and venerable even in Decay!</p>

And when at laſt the Meſſenger DEATH, who comes to all, ſhall come to them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted they will obey the Summons; in conſcious Hope of being ſpeedily united and beatified with their Com-patriots and Fore-runnners, in the Manſions of endleſs Bliſs!</p>
            <p>Such, to name no more, was the Character of a CINCINNATUS <note n="*" place="bottom">For ſome further Account of this illuſtrious Roman (too long for a Note) ſee the Appendix. p. 30.</note> in ancient Times; riſing "awful from the Plough" to <hi>ſave his Country;</hi> and, his <hi>Country ſaved,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Plough again, with increaſed Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Luſtre. Such too, if we divine aright, will future Ages pronounce to have been the Character of a **********; but you all anticipate me in a Name, which Delicacy forbids me, on this occaſion, to mention. Honoured with his Preſence as a Brother, you will ſeek to derive Virtue from his Example; and never let it be ſaid, that any Principles you profeſs, can render you Deaf to the calls of your Country; but, on the contrary, have animated you with intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity in the Hour of Danger, and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Moments of Triumph.</p>
            <p>True <hi>Courage</hi> conſiſts not in any Thing <hi>external to a Man</hi>—in the Trappings of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016526_0023_0F9C8B101DDBB510"/>Dreſs, the Parade of Office, the Pride of Looks, a quarrelſome Temper, or loud-ſounding Boaſts; but in a Soul ſerenely fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Duty, and unconſcious of Guilt, as knowing that Death has no Terrors but what he derives from Sin. For it hath been well ſaid on this Subject, that <q>Fire may as eaſily be ſtruck out of Ice, as Valour out of Crimes; and he has the chance of moſt Valour who lives beſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>True Religion, therefore, is a Man's Glory and Strong Hold in every ſituation of Life, whether Public or Private; and this brings me to my—</p>
            <p>THIRD HEAD, Under which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed briefly to remind you, as a <hi>Fraternity,</hi> of the Principles by which you profeſs to regulate your Conduct towards Individuals in private Life; which ſtill having that <hi>great</hi> Commandment of our HEAVENLY MASTER, <hi>Brotherly Love,</hi> as the chief Corner-Stone; every Thing raiſed upon it ſhould be ſuperlatively <hi>Grand</hi> and <hi>Fair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence, therefore, we muſt ſeek to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand our Souls to the whole human Species; ever ſtriving to promote their Happineſs to the utmoſt of our Power. Whatever is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016526_0024_0F9C8B1079BE5940"/>partial and contracted—a ſelfiſh and unfeeling Heart, coiled up within its own ſcanty Orb—we muſt reject from among us. Looking far beyond the little Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Sect or Party (by which too many ſeek to know, and be known by, each other) we ſhould labour to imitate the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in regarding thoſe of every Nation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Tongue, who <q>fear Him, and work Righteouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such Conduct becomes thoſe who profeſs to believe that when our MASTER CHRIST ſhall come again to reward his faithful Workmen and Servants; He will not aſk whether we were of LUTHER or of CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIN?

            <p>But although we may believe that none of theſe Things will be aſked in that Great Day; let us remember that it will be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly aſked—Were we of CHRIST JESUS? <q>Did we pray to him with the Spirit and with the Underſtanding?</q> Had we the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016526_0025_0F9C8B1131E623B0"/>true Marks of his Goſpel in our Lives? Were we "meek and lowly of Heart?" Did we nail our rebellious Affections to his Croſs, and ſtrive to ſubdue our Spirits to the Rule of his Spirit? But above all, it will be aſked us—Were we cloathed with the <hi>Wedding-garment</hi> of LOVE? Did we recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize our HEAVENLY MASTER in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of thoſe whom he died to ſave? Did we, for his ſake, open our Souls wide, to the Cries of HIS DISTRESSED POOR? <q>When they were Hungry, did we give them Meat? When Thirſty, did we give them Drink? When Strangers, did we take them in? When Naked, did we clothe them? When Sick, did we viſit them? When in Priſon, did we come unto them,</q> with Comfort and Relief?</p>
            <p>This Day, my Brethren—nay, a few Moments hence—will furniſh you with an Opportunity of laying up in your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and ſending before you to Heaven, an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to thoſe important Queſtions, againſt the awful Day of final Retribution.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016526_0027_0F9C8B12A26701C0"/>Let the POOR, then, have reaſon to conſider our preſent Meeting, as a JUBILEE to them rather than to us.</p>
            <p>And while I Addreſs <hi>You</hi> on this Subject, I would, at the ſame time, beg leave to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the whole of this numerous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Auditory—for CHARITY is the concern of all; and we are peculiarly called to its higheſt Exerciſe at this particular Time.</p>
            <p>But a few Days have paſt, ſince we were joining together in the SONG OF ANGELS; giving <hi>Thanks</hi> and <q>Glory to God in the Higheſt</q> for the BIRTH OF A SAVIOUR, and the <hi>Spiritual Deliverance</hi> accompliſhed by Him. In a few Days <note n="*" place="bottom">The Thankſgiving Day appointed for Dec. 10th</note> more, we are again, by ſpecial Appointment, to offer up <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> to God for whatever <hi>temporal</hi> Bleſſings and <hi>Deliverances</hi> we have received through his Goodneſs. On both Accounts, one of the beſt Sacrifices of <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> which we can offer, is—to raiſe the drooping Mourner; cheer the lonely Heart of Woe; and be the Inſtruments of Heaven for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the Number of the <hi>Thankful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Return of Gratitude which CHRIST peculiarly requires; namely, that,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016526_0028_0F9C8B13633F7BB8"/>from the Conſideration of his unbounded <hi>Love</hi> to us, our Heart ſhould overflow with <hi>Love</hi> to each other. Such <hi>Love</hi> is juſtly ſtiled— "the fulfilling of the whole Law," —the Sum and Subſtance of all Obedience. For true Religion being an Emanation from on high, cannot but ſhed <hi>Light</hi> upon the Underſtanding, and <hi>Love</hi> upon the Heart— even that <hi>Love,</hi> which, when genuine, will gradually conſume every Thing that is groſs and earthly within us; and mount up our Affections, at laſt, in a pure Flame, to the omnipotent Source of all Love.</p>
            <p>Deeds of Love are the chief Employment of the Angels of God; and, into a Soul which overflows with <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> Heaven may be ſaid to have deſcended, while on Earth.

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>LUCIUS QUINTIUS CINCINNATUS was a Patrician of Rome. In the 293d Year of the City, his Son CAESO, a Youth of high Spirit, great Credit, and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Bravery, exaſperated the Tribunes of the People, by ſome ſevere Animadverſions upon their Conduct; and was accuſed of TREASON. A Day was appointed for his Trial, and ten Securities (which was the firſt inſtance of <hi>Bail</hi>) taken for his Appearance; each being bound in the Sum of <hi>three thouſand Aſſes,</hi> about <hi>Nine Pounds Thirteen Shill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Nine Pence,</hi> Sterling. Apprehenſive of a Trial, where his Accuſers were to be his Judges, he retired into voluntary Baniſhment among the Etrurians, before the Day fixed for his Appearance. His Father refuſed to ſuffer the Securities to Pay the Forfeiture, which fell ſhort of <hi>One Hundred Pounds, Sterling;</hi> and ſold all his Eſtate, to ſatisfy the public Juſtice, except about FOUR ACRES and a MEAN COTTAGE, on the farther Side of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> afterwards called the <hi>Quintian Meadows.</hi> To this little Spot he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and ſupported himſelf in a humble, virtuous, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Independency, by the Labour of his own Hands, and of ſome Slaves; never croſſing the River to viſit the City, or take Part in Public Affairs.</p>
            <p>About a Year afterwards, he was elected Conſul, and called from his Retreat. He diſcharged his high Office with Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; appeaſed the Tumults of the City; reſtored the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice; refuſed to ſet the bad Example of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016526_0031_0F9C8B159F159888"/>Suffering himſelf to be elected Conſul a ſecond Time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law; and retired to his mean Cottage and ſmall Farm, ſuperior to all public Reſentment on account of his private family Wrongs.</p>
            <p>About two Years afterwards, the Aequi, having made War upon Rome, ſhut up the Conſul MINUCIUS within his Camp near the City; and brought him to the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, either of ſtarving by Famine, or ſurrendering at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. In this ſad Emergency, CINCINNATUS was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared DICTATOR, and a deputation of the Senate ſent to bring him from his Retreat. The venerable Patriot was <hi>at his Plough,</hi> 
               <q>covered only from his Reins to his Knees, with a Cap on his Head.</q> When he ſaw the Deputies, with their Croud of Attendants approaching, he ſtopped his Oxen; and aſking, <hi>if all was well,</hi> ordered his wife <hi>Racilia</hi> in haſte to bring his Gown, that he might be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, in Reſpect to his Viſitants. Being <hi>cloathed,</hi> and the Duſt and Sweat wiped from his Face, (we may preſume by the Hands of his faithful <hi>Racilia</hi>) he was ſaluted <hi>Dictator</hi>

At the awful Voice of his Country, he paid an inſtant and ſilent Obedience; dropped a few do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic Tears—uttering at laſt only theſe Words— <q>
                  <hi>My Field, then, will not be ſown this Year</hi>—RACILIA! <hi>take Care of our houſhold Affairs!</hi>

            </p>
            <p>He conquered the Aequi; reſcued the Conſul; took <hi>Corbio,</hi> the Enemy's principal City; made them paſs under the Yoke; returned to Rome with their General in Chains; was honoured with a ſplendid Triumph; refuſed to increaſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016526_0032_0F9C8B1661529038"/>his little wrecked Fortune, by accepting any ſhare of the Spoils, or conquered Lands; abdicated the <hi>Dictatorſhip</hi> the <hi>ſixteenth Day;</hi> and returned again to his little Farm. —"Happy Times! admirable Simplicity!" ſays Rollin <note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin and ſome other Moderns, following Dionyſius, mention all thoſe Circumſtances of his being found at the Plough, half Naked, covered with Duſt, &amp;c. when he was ſent for to be Conſul, about two Years before. But, on Account of the Tumults in the City, the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Conſuls did not take place that Year, till the Month of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember; a Seaſon neither ſuitable for the Plough, nor correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Duſt, Sweat, and a half-naked Body. I have, therefore, followed Livy, as better informed than the Greck Hiſtorian; though, without doubt, Cincinnatus on both Occaſions was found buſy in his rural Labour.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is the CINCINNATUS whoſe Character is briefly touched in the foregoing Sermon; but, as if Magnanimity and Moderation were the hereditary Qualities of the Name and Family, there was another CINCINNATUS (TITUS QUINTIUS) in the 375th year of Rome (Liv. VI. 28, 29) who followed the Example of the former. At that Period, when the private Diſſentions of the Citizens raged with ſuch violence, as ſuperſeded all attention to the public Safety; the Praeneſtines, ſeizing the favourable opportunity, invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Roman Territory; and, laying all waſte before them, advanced to the Colline Gate, threatning the immediate Deſtruction of the City. In this dreadful Criſis, the Second CINCINNATUS, who had been one of the Military Tribunes, was called forth to the high Office of Dictator Such was the Veneration of his Character among his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens, and the Dread of it among their Enemies; that the Voice of Diſſention immediately ceaſed among the former, and the latter fled with Precipitation from the Walls. He purſued and reduced them to Peace, having firſt taken all their Cities (<hi>nine</hi> in Number) including <hi>Preneſte</hi> itſelf; carrying back from thence in Triumph the <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which, as a monument of his Virtues, was erected
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016526_0033_0F9C8B1720A577B8"/>in the Capitol, with the following Inſcription upon its Pedeſtal, viz.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>JUPITER ATQUE DIVI OMNES HOC DEDERUNT, UT T. QUINTIUS DICTATOR OPPIDA NOVEM CAPERET.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it was neither this Monument of his Country's Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, nor the Exploits for which it was Dedicated, that could have ſecured to him his principal Eminence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown. The Monument hath yielded to the waſte of years or barbaric Rage; and his Fame, as well as that of the Elder Cincinnatus, would now, at moſt, have only been blended with theirs, who, for the ſake of their Country, have mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly ſubdued <hi>others;</hi> if each of them had not exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a more illuſtrious Proof of Magnanimity by ſubduing <hi>Himſelf.</hi> For, although they might ſeverally have held the Dictatorſhip <hi>ſix Months,</hi> and thereby advanced their own Fortune, their Friends and Dependents; yet having attained the glorious End for which they were inveſted with it, the former, as already mentioned, abdicated the ſame the <hi>ſixteenth,</hi> and the latter the <hi>twentieth Day;</hi> both retiring ſelf-ſatisfied, amidſt the Applauſes of their Country, to enjoy the calm Repoſe of private Life.</p>
            <p>The eloquent and judicious <hi>Rollin,</hi> ſpeaking of the elder CINCINNATUS, makes the following beautiful Reflections: <q>Methinks I ſee Poverty enter Rome in Triumph with him. It appears indeed cloathed with Purple, and with a pompous Equipage; but does not derive its Luſtre from them. It rather adorns that Pomp, and exalts the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Purple. The Dictator will ſoon return to his Field and his Labor; but he will be neither leſs great nor leſs venerable, in his humble poor Cottage, than he is now upon his Car of Victory. What force, what Power has Virtue! It lends its Luſtre to all that ſurrounds it, and imparts to every Thing an Irradiation of Glory and Magnificence—Amidſt the higheſt Praiſes and Bleſſings,
