            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>BEING fully and generally admitted, it neceſſarily follows, that well drawn character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic pictures of life, though fabulous, are a commendable and profitable branch of literary compoſition; as they prepare an attentive, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent reader for ſcenes of real action; and if the ſuperſtructure be raiſed from a moral foundation; without which, however beautiful the component parts, it muſt fall before the breath of rational criticiſm; then, while it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights the imagination, it improves both the head and heart; a large majority, eſpecially of the fair ſex, have not time nor talents for the inveſtigation of abſtract principles in moral and ſocial life; wherefore a lighter kind of ſtudy is eſſential; and even the greateſt proſelytes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſpeculation, may unbend their minds, by peruſal of a well pen'd novel, both with pleaſure and advantage; ſeveral of this tendency might be pointed out, were they not already general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known and acknowledged.

of ſentiment, and ſtrength of character; but their pictures being, in general romantic caricatures; our lighter and fainter drafts have more original reality to recommend them;—though it is to be feared, that many authors, through neceſſity or avarice, exerciſe their pens for gain; and though we have too many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of wretches ready to propagate vice, for pecuniary advantage; yet, to the honour of the preſent age, it may be ſaid, that no licentious piece, beyond a half penny ballad meets encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement: wherefore the worſt charge that can be brought againſt productions of this nature, at preſent being trifling; ſo that there is little danger of prejudice, ſhould there even be ſmall hopes of improvement to the mind.</p>

                     <p>SIR HENRY SUMMERS was a man by nature form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſible, open, and compaſſionate to the diſtreſſes of his fellow creatures, which he never looked on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pitying, nor was pity all he beſtowed; he too well knew the pain which that paſſion muſt give a feeling mind (when unaccompanied by aſſiſtance) ever to refuſe his, to merit in diſtreſs. By art his natural ſenſe was refined into wiſdom, and his own generoſity of ſentiment gave him a humane politeneſs of behaviour, which gained him univerſal reſpect. By fortune he was bleſſed with an ample ſufficiency to indulge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry benevolent wiſh of his expanded mind; luxurious or whimſical ſuperfluity never rendered him incapable of aſſiſting unhouſed poverty. In ſhort, he only regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his riches as they gave him an opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the ſupport of deſerving or neceſſitous objects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="2" facs="unknown:032122_0006_0FF138A6491BFC48"/>
While his character was reſpected even by thoſe who were not perſonally acquainted with him, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour created admiration and affection in all who were.</p>
                     <p>In friendſhip he was ſincere, conſtant in danger, and patient in adverſity, which he more than once had felt. To theſe qualifications he had joined the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent addreſs of living (which is moſt hard to do) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach. Yet, notwithſtanding he was thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with every virtue that can truely form the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, generous, honeſt man; he had, in common with all human kind, his particularities; but they were ſuch as rather to be the objects of applauſe than cenſure: His praiſes were too conſtant in the mouth of every one not to reach his own ear, and being well convinced of the ſolidity of his judgment, he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a due deference to be paid thereto by all who had the leaſt dependance on, or connexion with him; he had a pleaſing dignity of countenance, which rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered him at once the object of eſteem and reverence; there was a little tincture of warmth and ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in his diſpoſition, which made him rather impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of controul: yet, after what I have ſaid of this gentleman, there requires no great ſagacity to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that what all allowed to be his virtues, far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed what ſome choſe to call his faults.</p>
                     <p>Sir Harry, ſo early as eighteen, had contracted an acquaintance with a young lady of fortune, which, in a ſhort time, grew into the moſt diſintereſted love; and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:032122_0007_0FF138AA162E2578"/>
being a man of too much ſenſibility ever to think of her on any other than honourable terms, he conſulted her father, who cruelly rejected his propoſals, not from any diſlike to his perſon, family, or fortune, which were all unexceptionable, but on account of his youth; partially imagining, that he could not be endowed with ſo much ſolidity, as to fix the volatile, wandering affections at ſo early a period of life, upon one object, however valuable; therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his paſſion but as a flight of inconſiderate youth, which, in a ſhort time after the accompliſhment of his wiſhes, would naturally wear off: thus, through an over-refined degree of caution, the anxious father oppoſed the only ſtep which could inſure his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's happineſs. Thus it often happens in life, that by earneſtly endeavouring to avoid one error, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably fall into its oppoſite.</p>
                     <p>This refuſal, of courſe, put a ſtop to the frequent interviews with which the young couple had before found means to indulge themſelves; yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it deprived them of the few ſweet minutes perſonal conferences afforded, they, lover like, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly found means to hear conſtantly from each other; two of which letters I here preſent to my readers. The firſt, which is from Sir Harry, was wrote the day after he received the refuſal from her father.</p>

Oh! my AEmily, think what a perſon, who loves like me, muſt feel at ſuch a ſentence: but, thank heaven I have ſtill one gleam of comfort to ſupport my drooping ſpirits; I can not think you ever will be induced to join in ſuch cruelty.

Yet, though I am fully conſcious of your flattering ſentiments, allow me to feel.—Your own delicate mind will do me the juſtice to ſuggeſt, how far a thought of loſing you muſt affect me: let me avoid it, leſt I ſink beneath a painful weight of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.—Yet, can I be thus divided from you, and looſe the thought of what I ſhould feel from an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

How much more delight do we feel, than thoſe whoſe breaſts are not ſuſceptible of ſo delicate a refinement? This, my AEmily, is a ſituation I once hoped to have reached; but alas! why do I think thereof, ſince it can now afford but a momentary ſatisfaction, and only ſerve to make me return to the proſpect before me with more reluctant regret—a proſpect that I cannot think or look on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhuddering?—Forgive me for ſaving, that under

Let this undiſguiſed effuſion of an artleſs heart quiet thoſe uneaſy ſenſations which too plainly appear in your letter. Once more reſt aſſured of ſincerity on my ſide, as a return for your obliging wiſhes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to promote and ſecure my happineſs. I could dwell much longer on the pleaſing theme of mutual regard and ſincerity, but that a parent's harſh commands intrude, and hurry me to a concluſion, with this aſſurance, that I am, with inviolable attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>MANY more letters paſſed between Sir Harry and his AEmily; but as moſt of them only contained the ſame aſſurances of regard in other words, and as love letters, no more than love ſcenes, are amuſing to any but the parties concerned, I ſhall not trouble my readers with any more than theſe two, which may ſerve as a ſpecimen of the ſtile and contents of all the others. Let it ſuffice to ſay, that Sir Harry having made another application to her father, and having received the ſame refuſal, our lovers determined to make a ſtolen match; which being effected, Sir Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would have thrown himſelf at his wife's father's feet, but the old gentleman abſolutely refuſed to ſee either of them, taking this imprudent ſtep too nearly to heart, it in a ſhort time finiſhed his days; nor could he ever be prevailed upon to ſee his daughter, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately carried his reſentment to the grave, as a proof of which, he bequeathed all he was worth to a diſtant relation of his wife's. This accident happening when Lady Summers was pregnant, a miſcarriage was the conſequence, followed by a violent fever, which in a few days put an end to her life: and thus
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032122_0012_0FF138B78B380648"/>
was Sir Harry left a widower at the age of twenty-two, as a mourning monument of the fatal effects of filial diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>So quick and ſo impreſſing a ſeries of misfortunes caſt a gloom upon his countenance, which it was not in the power of time to remove, any more than the ſettled reſolution he made, on his wife's death, of never entering again into that ſtate, wherein he had been ſo unlucky in his firſt attempt. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lived, as I before ſaid, the object of every one's admiration and eſteem, ſtriving to do all the good in his power. He partook of all the pleaſures of life, without running into any of the abſurdities; he was more delighted with amuſements he met with at his ſeat in Yorkſhire, as being the more rational, yet when in town, as he was half the year, he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every public place of diverſion, to avoid the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of a miſanthrope, which, from his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ettled me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, ſome few officious people had choſe to honour him with. He was about the age of forty, when the following affair happened.</p>
                     <p>Early one morning in February, when on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Carliſle-Houſe, he was ſurprized by ſeeing a croud of watchmen round his door, occaſioned, as he diſcovered on enquiry, by a baſket juſt then picked up, which, to his great aſtoniſhment, was found to contain a female child, of (ſeemingly) about a month old. On his nearer approach, he obſerved
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032122_0013_0FF138BE4A688918"/>
a paper pinned to its breaſt, on which were wrote, in a neat Italian hand, theſe words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"Stranger, whoſoe'er thou art, that find'ſt this luckleſs babe, ſhut not your ears againſt the tender cries of youthful innocence, but pity, cheriſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her; in return for which ſhe will far o'erpay your generous care by her endearing prattle."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was ſo forcible an application to the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sir Harry (than whom no man had a greater ſhare) that he could not withſtand the natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of his heart, but ordered the child to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into his houſe, and to have all immediate care taken of it.—Thus to a heart ſo ſuſceptible of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, theſe few words pleaded the cauſe of this help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs infant, in full as effectual a manner, and perhaps with more ſucceſs, than whole volumes on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, from the ableſt hands, could have done.</p>
                     <p>So ſingular an adventure employed Sir Harry's thoughts great part of that time which he would otherwiſe have appropriated to reſt; but this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, the more he conſidered it, the more it bewildered his ideas; in ſhort, it was an endleſs maze of perplexities. He could not believe thoſe lines to be the produce of any common hand, either from the ſtile or writing, nor did he know any one on whom to fix his ſuſpicions: however, after ſome heſitation he yielded fully to the humane dictates of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032122_0014_0FF138C0F63C8580"/>
his heart, by reſolving to furniſh the child with every neceſſary, and, as ſhe turned out, to fix her in the world. This reſolution afforded him the tacit praiſe of what he had determined; nor was he a little ſtrengthened in his deſign by the affecting ſmiles which ſat upon the infant's countenance, when he went to inquire after it, and give orders for her nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. He was juſt ſat down to breakfaſt, when Mr. Modiſh entered the room, to inquire after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he had ſeen at Carliſle-houſe the preceeding evening.</p>

                     <p>MR. Modiſh was a gentleman of fortune, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endowed with a good underſtanding, but unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily much over-run with the weed of inattention.—He was a diſtant relation to Sir Harry's who having a real regard for him, with pain obſerved the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous circumſtances of his behaviour, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, like a true friend, endeavoured to amend by admoniſhment, wherever he ſaw occaſion. Sir Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's mind was ſo full of the laſt night's adventure, that the firſt compliments were ſcarce paſſed, when be told the whole affair to Modiſh, who having heard him to the end with great attention, taking his hand with a triumphant laugh. replied:—"Sir Harry, I

give you joy. 'Egad, I'm glad to ſee any honeſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who has ſpirit enough to acknowledge his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry. I really began to fear, we were all reverting to the antideluvian ſtate, when an amour was looked upon as a crime. You know, I in particular was never fond of thoſe primaeval notions, and always thought you rather too much addicted to them.—Well! and pray—Now, what happy girl has had the honour of converting you to my way of thinking? What—it is a ſecret, I ſuppoſe.—She bid you not kiſs and tell, ha! Sir Harry?—'G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d, I began to give you up for an obſtinate heretic, in whom it was impoſſible to work a reformation. Well—I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is to be ſent to nurſe in the country to a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's wife, who was formerly your houſe-keeper; and when he is about twelve years old, brought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>own as the ſon of a poor clergyman, for whom you have a great regard; then a few years ſchooling, and a cornetcy in the guards, finiſhes the whole affair.—Well, upon my ſoul! you are a happy fellow, who have no check upon your pleaſures from a deficiency in your purſe."—This gentleman's volubility of tongue was ſo great, that Sir Harry was obliged to let him run on thus far, before he could convince him of his miſtake with regard to the ſex of the child, and which he had before forgot to inform him of;—but when he heard it was a girl, after near a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute's pauſe, he cried,—"A girl! that's unlucky; however, we muſt make the beſt of a bad bargain.—
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032122_0016_0FF138C4EF5C2D10"/>
Why, ſhe muſt of courſe, be nurſed in the country; and then bring her to London as your ward, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daughter of a particular friend who died in the Weſt Indies:—ay, ay, that will do:—and then a couple of thouſand pounds, or ſo, may make her the wife of ſome honeſt citizen, who has more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney than wit."—In vain did he proteſt the child was not his own: Modiſh could not believe, that any man would thus adopt a perfect ſtranger to him: however, on Sir Harry's firm proteſtations, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to have rather a different opinion:—Well, (ſays he) if the child is not your's, I think you did wrong to take any notice a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> her.—For my own part, it is a ſettled rule with me, to provide for no man's off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring but my own, and not even them at all times." "For ſhame, for ſhame! (cried Sir Harry, not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle nettled at his relation's diſſolute ſentiments) I am ſorry to ſee a man, to whom nature has been bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both in underſtanding and fortune, make ſo bad an uſe of either, as to be directed, in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the moral duties of life, by that faſhionable folly, that plea, for the commiſſion of every crime, Cuſtom. Charles you know I'm your friend, and 'tis my friendſhip tells you, that however you may have been taught to believe otherwiſe by the company you kept, yet be aſſured, upon the word of a man who has ſeen and knows the world, that chaſtity is as noble a qualification in our ſex as in the female, though, to our ſhame be it ſpoken, in the preſent age it ſeems
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032122_0017_0FF138CB55537CE8"/>
totally excluded from the catalogue of male virtues; nor indeed can I hardly blame our youths for a breach thereof, not only becauſe they have never been taught to conſider it in the light of a crime, but becauſe they have no incitement thereto from the only part of the creation, they naturally expect it from, I mean, that claſs of females diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of modeſt women; a tender union with whom, in ſome part or other of our lives, we all eſteem as our ne plus ultra; and want of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being no impediment to ſuch an alliance, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are not ſo ſolicitous about poſſeſſing this virtue as we otherwiſe ſhould be: for let a man commit every folly, every vice, which youth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, or his impaſſioned inclinations prompt him to, and he will never feel the conſequences from thoſe who, by the coolneſs of their behaviour, ought to expreſs their diſlike of ſuch proceedings. On the contrary, amours with a variety of women give a man an air of greater conſequence, and more probability of ſucceſs with the reſt of the ſex. Can any thing be a ſtronger proof of the truth of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, than that proverbial expreſſion which we ſo conſtantly hear come from the mouths of females of every rank, and of the truth of which they ſeem all to be ſo well convinced, <abbr>viz,</abbr> That a reformed rake makes the beſt huſband.

happineſs."—Bravo! (cried Modiſh, after a ſhort ſilence) pray, proceed:—upon my word, Sir Harry, you have harangued with the gravity of a biſhop: ſo you mean, by this fine, grave, ſentimental oration, to make me believe, that this girl is not your own. But pray, my dear Summers, joking apart, do you really look upon keeping a miſtreſs in the light of a crime?"—"Sir (ſaid Sir Harry, frowning, much amazed) I am obliged to go out at preſent, on ſome particular buſineſs: if you will favour me with your company to dinner, by four, at the Thatch'd Houſe. I may perhaps tell you ſome more of my thoughts on this ſubject."—"Agreed, ſaid he, though upon my ſoul! I am engaged to meet Lord Squander, Billy Rattle, and ſome others, to dinner, at the Shakeſpear, from thence to proceed in battle array to aſſiſt at the damnation of a new comedy; but you are ſuch a holy witch, as the poor poet ſays, that you enchant ſociety to you, and I have really now kept your company ſo long, that I begin to find more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid pleaſure in hearing your rational diſcourſe, than in the noiſy mirth of my bottle companions: I will therefore wait upon you, though, by ſo doing, I ſhall diſoblige ſome of the honeſteſt fellows, except your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the univerſe."—"For which, replied Sir Harry, I ſhall not be ſorry. But pray, have you read this new play, which you thus intended to have ſtrangled in the birth?"—"Not I, upon, my ſoul! ſaid he; I don't even know the author.—"And how could you, rejoined his friend, be cruel enough, for
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032122_0019_0FF138D166FE0670"/>
the ſake of a few minutes diverſion, perhaps to ruin a man, whoſe only proſpects may depend on the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this night's piece; even before you can know, whether it is deſerving of your cenſure or applauſe?"—"Nay, that replied Modiſh, is conſidering it in too ſerious a light. I never troubled my head about its merit; but it would be making a riot, which is my delight. But adieu till four."—And thus they parted; Sir Harry, to go about the buſineſs he had mentioned, and Modiſh, to take his uſual turn in the Mall; after which, he met his friend, according to appointment, and had the pleaſure of hearing his farther thoughts on the ſubject they had that morning ſtarted: but as the particulars of their converſation never came to my knowledge, and were, I preſume, ſimilar to thoſe already mentioned, let it ſuffice to ſay, that Sir Harry, in conſequence of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was more confirmed in the principles of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and protection to his ward, or rather adopted daughter. He went home, his mind replete with thoſe pleaſing ſenſations, of which no one can be a competent judge, whoſe ſoul is not equally expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, equally ſucceptible of delicate ideas.</p>

                     <p>THE conſequence of the converſation which Sir Harry had with Modiſh, as related in the laſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was an immediate application of his time to the preparation of every thing which might conduce to the eaſe and happineſs of his adopted child, whom he now determined to educate in London, that he might not ſeem to pay any attention to the many ill-natured inſinuations which he conſtantly heard, and ſtill expected to hear, about ſo extraordinary an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, from the major part of the world.

                        </gap>e benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſmiles, whenever he approached, he conſidered as ſo many grateful returns for his humanity, in the preſervation of her life.</p>

                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:032122_0021_0FF138DA90321288"/>
As ſoon as her tender mind was adjudged capable of retaining any impreſſions, he prepared maſters to inſtruct her in every thing ſuiting her age and ſex, which ſhe took faſt as 'twas miniſter'd; and he had ſoon the ſatisfaction of hearing her, in unaffected ſtrains, expreſs her thanks for the many favours he daily beſtowed on her, and which never failed to put him in mind of thoſe remarkable words, which the reader may remember were found upon her breaſt. He was in ſome doubt whether to acquaint her with this circumſtance or not; but judging that a diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of that nature might, from the generoſity and laudable pride of her mind, when ſhe conſidered herſelf as an object of charity, occaſion a reſerve in her behaviour, which would deprive him of the pleaſure of her open and ingenious converſation, he choſe, rather than run this hazard, to impoſe upon her by an information that ſhe was his niece; and as he always made a diſtinction between a falſity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived with a premeditated deſign to do an injury, and one with an innocent intention, he had on this occaſion no other feelings, than thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious virtue always experiences on the performance of any good action. However that ſhe might not always remain a ſtranger to what ſo nearly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, he wrote an account thereof, which with the paper abovementioned, being incloſed in his will, were committed into the hands of his attorney.</p>
                     <p>AEmily was now endowed with a perſon far from contemptible; but having affairs of much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032122_0022_0FF138DD8CAE5A68"/>
to take notice of, I ſhall not detain my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with a minute account of thoſe qualifications which can reflect no honour on her noble parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualifications, if they deſerve that name, which every woman is equally liable to poſſeſs in as emminent a degree as herſelf; but to her honour be it ſpoken, that, added to ageeable external endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe had a mind replete with every amiable virtue.</p>
                     <p>Sir Harry now conſidering her in every reſpect as his niece, accompanied her to all places of public entertainment; but ſhe was far too ſenſible, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſolid ſatisfaction from the enjoyment of any of the preſent modiſh diverſions, except the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, which ſhe conſidered as not only proper for refining our ſentiments and ideas, but as the moſt luxurious treat the human underſtanding is capable of enjoying. No wonder then, that ſhe was an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtant attendant there, eſpecially when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of an edifying caſt were exhibited.</p>
                     <p>The reſidence of her uncle (that being the light in which ſhe now conſidered Sir Harry) in Yorkſhire, during the ſummer ſeaſon, to which place ſhe always accompanied him, gave her a full opportunity of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing her favourite amuſements, reading and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in the latter of which ſhe found an additional pleaſure, being generally accompanied by a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring young lady, for whom ſhe had the ſincereſt

affection that a ſimilarity of ſentiment could promote; nor was her generous friendſhip placed on an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving object; ſhe had the happineſs of having it returned with additional ardor. To this young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who was the daughter of Sir Thomas Hartry, AEmily opened her whole heart, on every occaſion, with all the ingenuity of diſintereſted regard. She had juſt attained her twentieth year, when an affair, which the reader will ſoon become acquainted with gave riſe to the following letters from AEmily to her friend.</p>

Finding I was no ſtranger to his ſiſter, from his firſt entrance, he directed his converſation parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to me; but being the only woman in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, except her (and ſiſters, you know, are nobody) I only thought it what every man would have done in the ſame caſe, and therefore, at that time, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

it in no other light than as common civility. Our diſcourſe naturally turning upon the exhibition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, the juſtice of his remarks added to the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent diffidence with which they were uttered, gave me as high an opinion of his judgment as I had of his addreſs and perſonal behaviour. Added to theſe, he is furniſhed with a mind ſuſceptible of the moſt delicate feelings; for, would you think it, my dear? he was even unfaſhionable enough to weep at the imaginary repreſentation of diſtreſs: as if aſhamed of his weakneſs, he for ſome time endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the emotions of his foul; but in vain: nature got the better of art, and ſhewed the unaffected good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart in its true colours. I do not know whether it was from ſympathy, but I never was more affected at a tragedy in my life: he perceived it, and I had the ſatisfaction of being complimented by him on the tenderneſs of my paſſions. Surely this man knows my very thoughts, for he did not once ſeem to pay the leaſt attention to my perſon: if he has any deſign upon my affections, this is his only way. Your Emmy would hold that man unworthy a place in her heart, who could be captivated by her perſon only; ſuch love can have no ſtability; every day will ſhew new beauties to his eyes, each of whom will blot the remembrance of the former from his heart; and thus admiring all, he really regards none. But a man, who prefers us for ſome ſuperior excellence of mind, will, when in poſſeſſion of our perſons, have daily opportunities of ſeeing the improvement of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032122_0026_0FF138EB4F3D8128"/>
and thus with love and reaſon both combined, we ſpread a toil too dear for him to break. How cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, then, how very cautious ſhould we be, not to fix our affections on a man, who probably may abuſe the confidence we place in him. When the indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble knot is tied, we are no longer preſerved under the foſtering wing of an indulgent parent, friends and relations, all give up the joint care they have had of our happineſs, and center it alone in the will of a huſband: to him we muſt on all occaſions fly for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which if he refuſes, we indeed are miſerable.</p>

                     <p>At the concluſion of the play, my uncle went out to enquire after the carriage, promiſing to return immediately: but after having waited ſome time, you may imagine how amazed I was to ſee nothing of him, nor could I help expreſſing my aſtoniſhment thereat to Miſs Martin, who as well as her brother, ſtrove with all the tender concern they could to quiet my fears; but in vain. During the whole time of the entertainment, I was agitated with the moſt dreadful apprehenſions, inſomuch that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> had dropt ſometime before I diſcovered it.—In this dilemma, Mr. Martin inſiſted on ſetting me down, which, in ſuch a ſituation, I could not refuſe; he therefore handed me into the paſſage, where the croud was too great for us to proceed, and his eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032122_0029_0FF138F4EF251780"/>
to extricate us from this difficulty led him ſo far, that by ſome accident, a chairman in ſhifting one of his poles let it fall upon his head, from whence the blood immediately guſhed in a great quantity. You may more eaſily imagine, than I can deſcribe, the conſternation this threw both his ſiſter and me into, our fears interpreting the danger to be greater than it really was, which, he aſſured us, was very trifling, and notwithſtanding our moſt earneſt entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, could not be prevailed on to accept of any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance till he got home: but turning to his ſiſter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſhe would lend him her handkerchief, ſomebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the croud having been civil enough to borrow his; but I being the quicker of the two (and, I am afraid, almoſt as much concerned for his ſafety) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could find her's, had offered him mine, which he politely accepted; and having bound it round his head, with ſome difficulty ſeated us in the coach.</p>
                     <p>On our arrival at Albermarle-ſtreet, I enquired after my uncle, and had the ſatisfaction of hearing that he had been taken ill, on the ſudden change from ſo intenſe heat to cold; but that, to my heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt eaſe, he was again recovered, and had arrived juſt before me. On hearing this, Mr. Martin beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged leave to enquire after his health, the next day: which I could not refuſe, but deſired that he would not, out of complaiſance to enquire after the ſafety of others endanger his own, by coming out too ſoon; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and intreated he would let me know how he did in the morning; which having promiſed, they took their leave, and left me at liberty to viſit my uncle, who, I found had no remains of his diſorder but a violent head-ach.</p>
                     <p>Mercy on me! to what an unconſcionable length have I extended this ſubject! but we are apt to dwell on pleaſing themes, without conſidering the leiſure or patience of a correſpondent.

                     <p>AGREEABLE to my promiſe, I again take up my pen, to proceed in what your vivacity will call a romantic adventure. After parting with Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, I went to bed, but without inclination to ſleep. The compoſure I had always hitherto felt, on repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſt, was gone, and in its room had left ten thouſand doubts and fears.—According to my cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, upon a ſtrict examination into my actions of the day, I found in my heart ſenſations which I dared not give way to, nor could totally ſuppreſs: in ſhort, I found my happineſs depended on the actions of a man who never (and what was worſe) who perhaps never intended to ſpeak to me on any other footing than that of a common acquaintance. Shall I confeſs to you, that this thought affected me ſo far as to hinder me from taking my natural reſt? I therefore roſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſupplanted by a melancholy dejection, almoſt too much for me to bear. My uncle perceived it, and with a paternal kindneſs, tenderly enquired the cauſe. To acknowledge the real one was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the fictitious confeſſion of having been troubled with the toothach all night, delivered me from that confuſion which his queſtion had thrown me into; but you may imagine that I did not feel much eaſier, when after a moment's recollection, my conſcience dictated to me, to what the entertainment of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent paſſion had reduced your friend; the wilful deception of a man ſo kind, ſo generous, that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he had always ſtrove to intercept my wiſhes, that I might never know what it was to aſk a favour.—Oh! my Maria!—to what does this love ſubject us! how far does it debaſe the generoſity of our minds beneath its glorious ſphere!—At our births, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are open, ingenuous, and ſincere; our youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts can entertain no thought, no wiſh, which we deſire to exclude the breaſt of any one acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>I was meditating on the fallacious influence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authorized concealed love, when, according to my expectation, the ſervant announced Mr. Martins approach.

I was ſorry to obſerve, that his

I am afraid he has either too much of the coxcomb in him, or a worſe opinion of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than I could wiſh; as his appearance ſeemed to indicate, that he thinks me capable of receiving an impreſſion from his exterior parts. From your thorough knowledge of my heart, you beſt can tell how much he is miſtaken: and here, methinks you will call me a whimſical girl, for troubling my head ſo much about a man, whom as yet I had never ſeen but once.—Why, that indeed is very true; but in that once, his eyes as plainly ſpoke the language of his ſoul, as if he had told me that he loved; for, in his whole behaviour, there was a delicate attention to my every word, which was more perſuaſive elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than any he could uſe.</p>
                     <p>Some few compliments had paſſed between us, when my uncle entered the room, to whom I intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Mr. Martin, as the gentleman to whom I was ſo much obliged for his aſſiſtance the preceeding evening. With his uſual politeneſs, he made him many acknowledgments for his behaviour, and in a ſhort time, inſenſibly fell into a converſation, which ſeemed to promiſe an intimacy; nor was I miſtaken in my conjectures; a general invitation to Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle-ſtreet was the conſequence, at which I will confeſs, I was not a little pleaſed; and, in order to ſtrengthen this growing connexion, I ſent by him a meſſage to his ſiſter, intimating that I ſhould be
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032122_0034_0FF1390787429CB0"/>
proud of a ſtricter acquaintance with her: after which he took his leave, not without firſt having made a very ſignificant bow to me;—at leaſt my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity conſtrued it as ſuch.</p>
                     <p>You may imagine he did not neglect the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had received: few days paſſed in which we did not ſee him; and my uncle in a ſhort time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo cordial a fondneſs for him, that he ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever ſeemed to have enough of his company; he was one in all our parties at home, and a tended us to every public place; and though he did not pay me the common compliments which moſt of his ſex uſe to our's, ſtill there was a certain delicacy in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, which too plainly aſſured me, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded me with other eyes than thoſe of a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: and I will acknowledge, that I daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a declaration of his paſſion, nay, that I even wiſh'd it, though I was not without my fears, leſt my uncle, on account of the ſmallneſs of his fortune ſhould oppoſe his inclinations, and thereby deprive me of his company, which I now enjoyed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited pleaſure.—Oh! my Maria!—what did I not ſuffer from this apprehenſion!—and as he grew eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more particular, every time I ſaw him increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my uneaſineſs, till at length, what I ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, arrived: but I am ſummoned to my toilet, and therefore muſt make this the ſubject of another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>WHEN once affection is rooted in the breaſt, hard is the taſk to conceal the movements of our hearts from the dear object. I thus, my amiable friend, begin with a ſentiment, becauſe I think the ſequel of my ſtory will pretty clearly exemplify it: I will therefore now reſume the thread of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and endeavour to be a little more conſiſtent than in my laſt; but as I was at that time in an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual flutter of ſpirits, I am ſure you will pardon me.</p>
                        <p>The morning preceding to my writing it, I was lolling negligently on a ſettee, peruſing your letter, when Mr. Martin, entering the room ſuddenly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard and unexpected, threw me into ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle confuſion, and in my hurry I dropt your epiſtle on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

perceived the ſuperſcription to be a man's hand: after a ſhort ſilence, during which various paſſions by turns appeared in his face. "How happy, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ſaid he, muſt that gentleman be, who can ſo far have acquired your eſteem, as to be permitted to correſpond with you!"—Having ſo ſaid, he held it in his hand, as if waiting for an anſwer; but as I perceived a taint of jealouſy in his words and mode of expreſſion, I endeavoured to evade the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by enquiring when I might hope to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late him upon a perfect recovery of the accident he met at the Theatre, which ſtill clouded his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with a patch? Seeing through my artifice, he anſwered as follows; "You ſeem, Miſs Summers, to be extremely cautious of ſaying any thing further on the letter:"—and, with a kind of forced irony, added, "I am ſure Miſs Summer's principles would never ſuffer her to hold a correſpondence with any one of whom ſhe need be aſhamed."—Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſatisfaction I at that moment felt for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awakened the reſentment of that love I wiſhed to cultivate, to ſupport the farce, I could not avoid replying, with an air of negligence, "I do not think myſelf obliged to conſult all my acquaintance on the choice of my correſpondents; and provided I have none with whom my uncle is diſpleaſed, I do not ſee that any other perſon has any concern in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair."—Poor ſoul! how engagingly ſimple he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032122_0037_0FF13911E83BC630"/>
—he hung his head, and with a timid heſitating inferiority, ſaid, "To be ſure, Madam—as you ſay—I have no right—I once, indeed, added he with a ſigh, flattered myſelf—but fool that I was—what reaſon had I to expect"—then with a low bow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, "as I acknowledge my tranſgreſſion, and ſincerely beg your pardon, I hope Miſs Summers will for once excuſe ſo impertinent a curioſity;—eſpecially as in palliation thereof, I can with truth aſſure her, that I had ſome reaſon for my ſeeming enquiry."—Well, ſaid I, ſince you confeſs your fault, I will now convince you, that your ſuſpicions were groundleſs;—but obſerve—I do this to juſtify myſelf, not to ſatisfy you."—So ſaying, I produced the letter, and relating to him the real truth, ſhewed him your name, at the ſight of which, his countenance immediately brightened up; and I will own to you that I felt an unſpeakable pleaſure, when I ſaw him under a pretence of a cloſer examination of the direction, preſs my name to his lips with the greateſt eagerneſs; after which he returned me the letter, with as much compoſure as if he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced I had not taken notice of his laſt action.</p>
                        <p>The converſation now dropp'd; but this being far from my intention [I am afraid out of the ſecret deſire of urging him to a declaration] immediately took an opportunity of ſaying, "I think Sir you told me, that you had a reaſon for your ſeeming enquiry concerning the letter; ſhall I not come under the

—A fine young fellow at my feet, uſing all the rhetoric he was maſter of, to perſuade me to what before I had no ſmall inclination (I mean the avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of my paſſion) was a dangerous ſituation:—Tell me, my Maria, was this a time for heſitation?—Truſt me—No—And I really think that I had great prudence in avoiding a preſent return of his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; which I did by ſaying, "It has always been my conſtant rule, and always ſhall be, Sir, never to liſten to any one on this ſubject, till I have my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's ſanction for ſo doing; it is to him therefore you muſt apply."—"By your referring me to Sir Harry, madam (replied he) I flatter myſelf that if I have his permiſſion for the attempt, I may one day inſpire you with ſentiments of tenderneſs."—Was not that pretty forward my dear?—However I was determined to puniſh him for his preſumption; therefore with all the conſequence I could then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, I replied, "You have drawn, Sir, a concluſion in your own favour which might as eaſily be turn'd to your diſadvantage; I mean, that you might take my reference of you to my uncle for an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; as I think, you may be pretty well convinced, that he will never be induced to give you his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent."—"I underſtand you, Madam, ſaid he, the difference of our fortunes and expectations; but I have too good an opinion of your generoſity to think that alone could influence you, whatever it might Sir Harry; for which reaſon I rather choſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

to you firſt, being convinced that were I to meet with encouragement from you, he would never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his, in a point where your happineſs was ſo nearly concerned." My anſwer to this came of courſe, "Your only way, Sir, to gain mine is, to ſay no more on this ſubject, till after your application to him; however of this you may be aſſured, that as I am almoſt convinced he will never interpoſe in an affair of this kind, ſo have I too much honour to give any perſon a double trouble where one will ſuffice." Was this ſaying too much?—However, whether it was or not, be underſtood my meaning well; for kiſſing my hand with the greateſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, "My kindeſt AEmily," burſt ſpontaneouſly from his lips; and ſo he left me to follow my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions with regard to my uncle.—And now my friend, I aſk your advice how to act, in caſe he ſhould oppoſe my wiſhes: as be that as it may, I am ſure it will be impoſſible to hide the movements of my heart from him, who has gained ſo entire poſſeſſion of it; but in your council, talk not of impoſſibilities; and if you have never felt the influence of a tender partiality, conſidering the difficulty of eraſing one when it is firmly rooted in the heart.—Adieu, ſtrain every power to aſſiſt with your advice,</p>

                        <p>INDEED, indeed, my deareſt AEmily, there's no bearing this: you are poſitively a horrid provoking girl: one minute you aſk my advice, and the next comes a letter, informing me that you have followed your own inclination, without waiting for my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: thus are all the fine things, which I had trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up to perſuade you to conquer your paſſion, thrown away, and rendered uſeleſs, by your precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate conduct. Being determined to give you ſome aſſiſtance, as I cannot addreſs myſelf to you after the manner I at firſt intended, I will endeavour to lay you down ſome rules for the married ſtate, which I hope will not be totally uſeleſs.</p>

Seriouſly then, as my AEmily has always hitherto dignified me with the name of Friend, I ſhould ill deſerve that title, were I to be ſilent at a time when all her acquaintances will ſoon be pouring in their congratulations, on what may juſtly be called, the moſt important event of our life. At a time like this, when your heart is replete with joy, I am afraid you will ſcarce have leiſure to attend a tedious homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of grave ſentiments. Sincerity is the trueſt teſt of friendſhip, and, though uncourtly, when well meant claims a favorable reception: the phyſician who adminiſters medicines which may be diſagreeable, and the ſurgeon who probes a wound, as they act upon ſalutary principles, ought rather to be thanked than blamed, for the eſſential pains their endeavours oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                        <p>Firſt then let me entreat you to conſider ſeriouſly the ſolemn nature of the engagement into which you are going to enter; and as you have often, to feed a fooliſh vanity, ſpent whole days in choice of a new gown, or a ſet of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſlow to find, and ready to forgive, faults;—cautious of hearing that dangerous flattery beauty like your's may produce; follow faſhion, without worſhiping ſo vain an idol; indulge agreeable, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſociety; preſerve natural charms, by a regular life, without paltry aids of art; ſupport ſpirit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your income, with that commendable oecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy which caſts at diſtance parſimonious penury;—in ſhort, my dear AEmily, ſtrive to make home agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and with the accompliſhments you are miſtreſs of, if your huſband wanders, he muſt be the moſt ungrateful, inſenſible, or vicious wretch living.</p>

                     <p>Sir Thomas Hartry was a baronnet poſſeſſed of a large eſtate in the country where he reſided; which he inherited from a long train of anceſtors, who were all rendered remarkable by their extreme avarice: and though he did not poſſeſs this ſhocking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of heart in ſo great a degree, ſtill he did not
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032122_0048_0FF139390FD1E570"/>
totally degenerate from the maxim of his illuſtrious forefathers. "Get money," was his favourite prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and indeed this ſeemed to be the aim of all his actions; notwithſtanding which, he was by no means totally callous to the feelings of humanity;—for, what was moſt extraordinary, he could feel for the diſtreſſes of others; though he ſeemed deaf to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the common calls of neceſſity for himſelf. Ever conſtant to his favourite notions, he married lady Hartry for two reaſons; the one, becauſe ſhe had ten thouſand pounds; the other, in hopes of having an heir to his eſtate: and as this was almoſt his ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate wiſh, one would imagine he muſt be complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, to find himſelf indulged with ſuch a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about a year after his marriage; and ſuch a one who as he grew up, became the admiration of the whole country, for his ſenſe and good nature; in ſhort he ſeem'd entirely clear from his father's faults, and to inherit the virtues only of both his parents; yet ſuch is the unaccountable caprice of human nature, that though he was ſo deſerving a ſon, as almoſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed deſcription, he never was a favourite with his father; who, notwithſtanding, could aſſign no reaſon for his diſlike. Charles (that was his name) beheld it with concern, and endeavoured to gain his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by his aſſiduity; but this, inſtead of being taken in the favourable light, ſerved only to heighten his father's diſguſt: in ſhort, nothing could pleaſe him, and he at laſt drove him, by a courſe of ill uſage, at
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032122_0049_0FF1393E59A6BA08"/>
the age of eighteen, to ſeek that happineſs among his neareſt relations. But behold the amazing caprice of mankind! who never knew how to ſet a juſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue on a jewel till 'tis gone; that we cannot know how much we love, or what it is to want a friend till we have loſt him was never more ſtrongly veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that in this inſtance of Sir Thomas Hartry; who till this moment, never was aware of the real affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he had for his ſon; his virtues now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with double force to the afflicted father, who in vain uſed all poſſible means to recover him; and when be found that he was gone for even, all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parent riſing into his eyes, quite abſorb'd the man; and he for ſome time gave way to that ſoft ſorrow which overpowered his breaſt, and which he could not ſuppreſs.</p>
                     <p>So ſevere a blow had nearly been too much for Lady Hartry, who almoſt doated on her ſon, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with thoſe innate feelings which mothers only can be truly judges of. Time, however that great reſtorer of all things, in ſome meaſure allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the grief of both Sir Thomas and his lady; the former of whom, with the loſs of his ſon, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed totally to have abandoned his paſſion for money, and determined to make up in kindneſs what the ſon had wanted, to his daughter Maria, who being ten years old when the above affair happened, could not, of courſe be ſuppoſed to feel much affliction for the loſs of her brother:—all that ſhe could, ſhe did.—

As ſhe might now be reckoned an only child, no trouble, no expence, was ſpared in the education of this darling of the family; and her fond parents were overjoyed to find their trouble and attention ſo well repaid, as to behold her, at the age of eighteen, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of every natural as well as acquired perfection, neceſſary to complete the accompliſhed lady: her perſon was handſome to exceſs, rather ſhort than otherwiſe; her carriage was genteel and eaſy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affectation;

The goodneſs of her underſtanding has been made ſufficiently apparent to the reader by her letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſerted, to AEmily on the ſubject of her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.

                     <p>MARIA Hartry was propoſed as a juſt pattern for all the young ladies in the country. No young man could ſee her without loving; nor was there any father but what courted, and would have been proud of her alliance. Yet, amidſt the many admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that ſhe gained, the many compliments which were paid her, and though ſurrounded by the whole artillery of love; no gallant could yet boaſt of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received more encouragement from her than was becoming an acquaintance, for as ſuch only did ſhe regard all who had offered her their ſervices: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, as I profeſs myſelf to be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hiſtorian, I muſt confeſs, that ſhe could not call her heart her own, it having long ſince, in her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate determination, been beſtowed on a neighbouring gentleman, whoſe name was Melvill; though he was ignorant of his good fortune in the poſſeſſion of ſo ineſtimable a treaſure; not that he was blind to the united charms of perſon and underſtanding, which ſo apparently ſhone forth in Maria, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his diffidence prevented him from aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032122_0052_0FF13944E5177FA8"/>
of that ſucceſs, which only depended on his aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her the queſtion.</p>
                     <p>I will not pay ſo bad a compliment to that young gentleman's underſtanding as to ſay, he was the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt man nature ever formed; let it ſuffice to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my readers, that ſhe had been far from deficient in adorning him with perſonal qualifications, to which his politeneſs gave an additional luſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>re; his father dying whilſt he was yet young, left him heir to a very large eſtate; on this proviſo, that he ſhould not come into the poſſeſſion thereof, till he attained the age of twenty-five years: a right which though not allowed of, either by nature or juſtice, many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents thus aſſume, by prolonging the minority of their children. As he lived with his guardian, in the neighbourhood of Sir Thomas Hartry, he of courſe was intimate with that gentleman, and from his frequent viſits at Oak-hall, had drank deep of the delicious poiſon of love, before he knew by what name of ſtile his regard; recollection of the pleaſure which he had alway found in Maria's company, too ſoon, alas! convinced him of the true reaſon, and he ſeveral times determined to inform her thereof; but ſuch is the modeſty attendant on unfeigned love, that notwithſtanding the various opportunities he had, his fear overcame his regard, and prevented his beginning the only ſubject on which he wiſh'd to talk; but 'tis not the tongue alone, that can declare
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032122_0053_0FF1394917D472D8"/>
our paſſion; no, our eyes pronounce it, and every action ſpeaks; what though he never told her that he lov'd, his whole behaviour ſhew'd it; it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to every eye; nor could Maria any longer be blind, to what ſhe ſo earneſtly wiſh'd to be true.</p>
                     <p>She ſaw it with pleaſure; and thus Melvill had a more powerful advocate in her breaſt, than he even dared to hope: thus ſituated, ſhe daily expected a declaration, and as often was diſappointed; for though her behaviour gave him every encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the nature of their connection would admit of, he could not ſo far overcome the natural timid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his ſoul. Under theſe almoſt inſupportable torments, his health, from inward grief, ſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; his life became burthenſome and tedious; he never was eaſy one minute when out of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and at the ſame time, was racked with the moſt tormenting fears of looſing her forever: In this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtate did he for ſome time live, till no longer able to endure it, he determined to acquaint her with his inviolable attachment, and hope the beſt. When we have form'd any favorite ſcheme, it is an eaſy matter of putting it into execution; thus as Melvill had formed a deſign on the ſucceſs of which, all the happineſs of his future life depended, he burnt with the moſt eager impatience to be delivered from ſo painful an uncertainty; and as very few days paſſed in which he was not at Oak-hall, he ſoon found the ſo much wiſhed for opportunity.</p>

                        <pb n="50" facs="unknown:032122_0054_0FF1394AD1F7B758"/>
One very warm day, after having dined there, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria propoſed a walk in the grove, which her parents immediately aſſented to, ſaying that they would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her; thus luckily leaving our young couple to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at which Maria was not a little pleaſed. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill having previouſly informed her, that when a proper time offered, he could wiſh to have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with her; therefore joyfully leaving her parents to follow them, ſhe ſet out with Melvill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dying with curioſity to know what he had to communicate.</p>
                     <p>She wiſhed it might be what ſhe ſuſpected; tho' at the ſame time ſhe was not totally devoid of fear, leſt it ſhould, not being provided with a ſuitable anſwer thereto: from theſe conſiderations therefore, her mind was far from being the moſt tranquil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his intentions, Melvill was not in a very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable ſituation, and trembled ſo violently, that had ſhe not been as much agitated, it could never have eſcaped her notice: however, by both being equally concerned, they neither of them perceived it in the other, and thus walked without uttering a ſyllable, till they arrived at a bench in the grove, where they ſat down, both ſtill preſerving the exacteſt ſilence: many attempts, indeed, to ſpeak, were made on both ſides, but nothing more than—Sir—and Madam—I beg your pardon—I thought you ſpoke—and ſuch incoherent ſentences paſſed, till alter ſome he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, Maria took courage enough to aſk, what
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032122_0055_0FF1394C82EA0478"/>
buſineſs Mr. Melvill could have with her? to which he returned no anſwer, and put her to the painful neceſſity of repeating the queſtion; when no longer able to reſtrain his paſſion, he dropt on one knee, and ſeizing her hand cried, "Can you lovely Maria, even appear to be ignorant of what I have to ſay?—Who can be permitted to converſe with you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out involuntary loving you?—Can you be miſtreſs of thoſe charms and wonder at my paſſion?—Yes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

What vanity could induce me to hope your kind notice, with ſo ſmall a ſhare of attraction and merit to recommend me?—But do not, dear Maria, do not hate me; though you cannot love, do not deſpiſe me."—"Deſpiſe you!—no, Mr. Melvill, heaven forbid I ſhould deſpiſe any one!—But pray, Sir, riſe:—you diſtreſs me—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you do."—"I did not mean it, replied he, I would ſooner die, than give you one moment's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs:—but will you then thus reject me for ever?—Oh! do not look with ſuch chilling indifference: allow me to hope, without treſpaſſing the bounds of delicacy, one favourable expreſſion."—"What would you have me ſay?"—"Only that I am not quite indifferent to you, not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hateful"!—"You are,

                     <p>The arrival of Sir Thomas and Lady Hartry put an end to the converſation for this time. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe turned on different topics, and our young cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple parted much better pleaſed with each other than when they met; Maria, to find that ſhe had no placed her affections on a ſenſeleſs and unworthy object; and Melvill, that he had gained a kind of permiſſion to write to her, which he determined to do immediately on his return home.</p>

which indeed was not large, as it conſiſted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himſelf, his daughter Charlotte, and his ward.—This gentleman had formerly been in a capital buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in London; during which time, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted an intimacy with Melvill's father; who, from his candour and juſt dealing, conceived ſo good an opinion of him, as at his death to appoint him ſole guardian of his ſon.</p>

                     <p>On reading this extraordinary note, our hero was little better than one mad: his mind was agitated
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032122_0062_0FF13965A80EC6A8"/>
with the moſt perplexing doubts and fears; and in this agony did he ſet out for Oak-hall, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any anſwer to the repeated queſtions of Miſs How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who had no ſmall reaſon to be ſurprized at his behaviour; nor indeed could ſhe form any conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the cauſe, 'till, juſt as he was ſitting out, throwing her Maria's note, he cried, "Madam, read that;—then wonder, if you can, that I am diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
                     <p>On his arrival at Sir Thomas Hartry's, he found that both he and his lady were out, but that Maria had walked into the grove; thither he haſtened with all the impetuoſity of a lover, and found her on the ſame bench, where but the preceeding day he had diſcloſed his love; he found her, 'tis true;—but, oh heart piercing ſight! with one hand ſhe was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting her head, and with the other, ſhe wiped away the tears, which fell in torrents from her lovely eyes. She was ſo loſt in thought, that he got pretty near before ſhe perceived him; but when the ruſtling of the leaves drew her attention that way, ſtarting up, with eager tranſports, ſhe cry'd, "Oh! Mr. Melvill, is it you? I am glad you are come."—Then ſmiling through her tears, ſhe added, "Have I not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtepp'd the bounds of modeſty, in thus deſiring to ſee you?"—"Tell me, my dear Maria (ſaid he) tell me, what is it that affects you, inform me, I beſeech you, what can be the cauſe of that uneaſineſs which I ſee ſo ſtrongly printed on your countenance?"—"You were no ſooner (anſwered ſhe) departed yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday,

forgot to inſtil ſome of his favourite principles into him; ſuch as, "Children have not, or ought not to have, any will of their own;—that all their actions tend to one great end,—obedience," and many others equally arbitrary and ridiculous.—When Sir Toby therefore mentioned this match to him, all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he made to it was,—"Why, ay, I'll marry her, if you think it proper; otherwiſe, I am very well as I am,—howſomever, I'm glad you've appointed this afternoon for the meeting, becauſe I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to hunt to-morrow with neighbour Trott<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all."—</p>
                     <p>Such was the gentleman who arrived at Oak-Hall to pay his addreſſes to the lovelieſt of her ſex; and to whoſe beauty her anxiety and concern gave an additional luſtre: After a little general converſation, the young couple were left alone, and ſome time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed before one word was ſpoke on either ſide, Mr. Clunch being very buſy in tying ſome kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I ſuppoſe Miſs, you know my buſineſs here;—my father has ordered me to wait on you; for as he ſays, we are to be married, he thinks it proper we ſhould be a little acquainted beforehand; though for my own part, I don't ſee the neceſſity for it; but it ſeems it is the way of your great folks; and ſince I am here, I'll tell you a piece of my mind—look
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032122_0067_0FF13976EEFD9250"/>
ye, Miſs, I am a man of few words.—I don't love your high-flown ſpeeches, becauſe I don't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, if you can like me for a huſband—I'm your man: but what do I ſay—if? for your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays you muſt, and that's enough."—A great deal more of the ſame ſort did Maria ſuffer him to run on, before ſhe interrupted him; which ſhe at length did, though in the genteleſt terms poſſible, left he ſhould fly into a paſſion, and thereby rouſe her father, whom ſhe knew to be not far off;—with the moſt perſuaſive eloquence "ſhe begg'd him not to importane her any longer on the ſubject, for that ſhe could never think of him for an huſband, that ſhe ſhould always be proud to reſpect him as an acquaintance; but found herſelf unequal to the taſk of loving him with the tenderneſs of a wife."</p>
                     <p>Rough as the ſurrounding woods, all the anſwer this unfeeling brute returned to her remonſtrances, was, "why, for the matter of that, I can't help it—I believe there will be but little love loſt between us; nor ſhould I ever have troubled my head about lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, but that my father has expreſsly ſaid, I ſhall marry you; and your's ſays the ſame."—"I am ſure he could not ſo far have forgot himſelf," replied Maria.—"Nay, but he did, anſwered the ſquire, and marry me you muſt; unleſs you have a mind to be a diſobedient girl:—but as I am obliged to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of your behaviour, I aſſure you;—your ſervant.—So ſaying, he fallied out in queſt of her father, to whom he related all that had paſſed, not without ſome favorable additions on his own ſide.</p>
                     <p>When Maria found herſelf alone, burſting into tears, with uplifted hands, ſhe exclaimed,—"And is it poſſible, my father can ſeriouſly think of marrying me to ſuch a wretch?—a brute, devoid of every ſenſe of feeling!—"<hi>Your father ſays you</hi> SHALL <hi>marry me,</hi> thoſe were his words:—Sure no ſuch unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ever could eſcape his lips.—Would he, who hitherto has let my inclinations be as free as air, for the ſake of a little pelf, tie me to a wretch whom my ſoul deteſts, on whom I can never look but with abhorrence?—SHALL <hi>marry me!</hi>—Surely, if the ſin of diſobedience admits of palliation, it is where parents cruelly uſurp an authority, by endeavouring to force the hearts of their children; and which no ſituation in life, however elevated or debaſed, can give them a juſt right to.—Oh! Melvill, you have my heart, and on you alone will I beſtow my hand."</p>
                     <p>Thus was the lovely Maria bewailing her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, when the door opened, and preſented her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a much more angry look than ſhe had ever ſeen him wear before:—"Little did I think Maria, ſaid he, on entering, that I ſhould ever have ſo much occaſion to be diſſatisfied with you, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that you do not behave even with common civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ility to the man whom I have fixed upon for your

The next time they were alone, he luckily opened the ſubject, by ſaying," I can't imagine what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that girl can have, for ſo ſtrongly objecting to marrying the perſon whom my prudence has ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as one fit to be her huſband; a young man of perſon, family and fortune, who demands no money till after my death too; a plaguing, provoking little jade; when I have found a ſuitable match for her, in all reſpects, ſhe forſooth, muſt object to it, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>She cannot love him,</hi> but ſhe ſhall have him I'm determined, or I'll never give her a farthing."—As lady Hartry had reſolv'd not to mention a word of Melvill, leſt he ſhould imagine, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Lady Hartry having joined the company, Melvill told them the ſcheme from which he entertained ſuch flattering hopes, in the following words; "It is, ſaid he, that Maria ſhall feign an implicit obedience to her father's commands, in receiving the addreſſes of Mr. Clunch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe ſhall even carry her ſeeming duty ſo far, as to go to church with him, and then publicly refuſe him at the altar: this of courſe will convince Sir Thomas of her firm reſolve, never to marry the man whom he has fixed upon; which will alſo be ſo public an affront to my rival, as to ſhake off his diſagreeable ſolicitations: I will take care to be preſent, and make uſe of all my rhetoric, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to conſent to our union: if he is cruel enough to entertain a doubt of my making a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Maria, when I come of age, I will even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to have our marriage poſtponed to that period, and at the ſame time, to put a private one out of our power, will conſent to reſide abroad, during all the intervening time; and notwithſtanding his late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, I am ſo well convinced of his natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, that, added thereto my perſuaſion, the ſolemnity of the place, and his ſurpriſe at ſo ſudden

                     <p>OUR lovers, thus happy in the anticipation of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture joys, had been ſometime alone; when they were ſuddenly ſurpriſed by the unexpected return of Sir Thomas, who immediately burſt into the room where they were ſitting; happy was it for lady Hartry that ſhe had left them, being thereby rendered unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of having had a hand in this meeting; although the bare finding the young couple together, would have been ſufficient grounds for Sir Thomas to have reprimanded Melvill; yet to add to the misfortune he had interrupted them in a minute, ſacred alone to love and privacy; in ſhort he had found his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter claſp'd in the arms of him ſhe fondly lov'd: to deſcribe the ſurprize painted on each of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances at this minute, would require the pen of a Fielding, or the pencil of a Hogarth; there was but one part for Maria to take; and therefore with an aſſumed anger, puſhing Melvill from her, ſhe utter'd ſome few inarticulate words in a kind of reproof.—Sir Thomas now began, by telling him, that after what had paſſed, he was much ſurpriſed at ſeeing him

there, and inſiſted he would not for the future trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oak-Hall with his company, for if he did, as a gentleman, he ſhould be obliged to call him to an account for his behaviour. Melvill, willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove on the hint he had received from Maria, begg'd his pardon in the moſt humble manner: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THE neceſſary preparations for Maria's wedding were immediately begun, and Clunch ſpent as much of his time as he could ſpare from his ruſtic amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at Oak-Hall with his intended bride, who
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032122_0085_0FF139B350672090"/>
received his viſits with great ſeeming complacenſe, conſcious that they could be of no long continuance. When ſhe was not thus employed, ſhe had the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of enjoying the company of her two friends, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul; and indeed the affection which theſe young ladies had mutually for each other, made their time to paſs with the greateſt ſocial harmony; every day brought with it ſome new pleaſure; and as the ſureſt means of augmenting their feſtivity, each of them ſeem'd more aſſiduous to promote the bliſs of the other two than her own. A ſigh, indeed, would ſometimes unwarily eſcape from poor Maria; who as the deſtined day drew nigh, ſeemed every moment to looſe ſome of her reſolution: to add to which, her friend Charlotte, on the day before the intended marriage, for reaſons very apparent, made an excuſe to return home; by that means avoiding being preſent at the propoſed nuptials.</p>
                     <p>During this young lady's ſtay at Oak-Hall, poor Melvill's time had paſſed but heavily; however, to compenſate for all his torments, ſhe brought him a letter from Maria, containing freſh aſſurances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; which when he received, in an involuntary extaſy, he exclaimed;
<q>

                           <l>Oh, that her father would approve our loves,</l>
                           <l>To ſeal our happineſs with his conſent!</l>

As it was agreed on that Melvill ſhould leave Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as ſoon as he had gained a promiſe from Sir Thomas to conſent to their marriage when he came of age; he had taken care to prepare everything ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his voyage: nor indeed was he diſpleaſed at thus having a plea to ſatisfy his eager curioſity, by viſiting foreign countries, though at the price of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated from Maria. And when the deſtined morn arrived, he haſtened to the church, were the other company were already aſſembled; conſiſting of the intended bride and bridegroom, AEmily Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Sir Thomas, and Lady Hartry, and Sir Toby Clunch: Maria trembled with apprehenſion; but that only ſerved to caſt an unuſual glow upon her countenance, and made her look uncommonly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; nor was her concern on ſuch an occaſion taken notice of, as a modeſt diffidence is uſual.</p>
                     <p>Although Melvill ſtood a great way behind the reſt of the company, he could not avoid the eyes of Sir Thomas, who thought it not a little extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for him to be there; however, ſtill keeping his poſt, he ſtood agitated by violent hopes and fears.—Maria went through the former part of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tolerably well, till the critical moment arrived; and here I fain would conceal the weakneſs of my heroine: but truth obliges me to maintain my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and inform my readers of every particular, without ſuppreſſing any. Judge then, if you poſſibly can, kind reader, what were poor Melvill's ſenſations,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032122_0087_0FF139BA0B754DC8"/>
when on her being aſked the important queſtion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter near a minute's ſilence, he heard her feebly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, I WILL: his aſtoniſhment and rage for ſome time, were both ſo great, that he ſtood motionleſs; at laſt, caſting at her a look of diſtraction, he hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the church, and throwing himſelf into a poſt chaiſe, which had been ordered to wait for him, proceeded to Mr. Howard's, to whom in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes he related what had happened and ſet out the next day for Dover, but with a far different opinion of the female ſex, than what he flattered himſelf he ſhould have begun his travels with: thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone had for ſome time occupied his mind; but anger againſt Maria now took its place, which he vented as follows, "Yes, I have long been blinded by paſſion, but that at laſt is over, my natural reaſon has regain'd her power; and I can now ſee, nay feel what an abject wretch he muſt be, who truſts his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in a woman's power; ſmiling miſchiefs all, that crocodile like, flattery but to betray: thus then I diſclaim all thoughts of a ſerious connexion with any of the ſex; but why do I ſtill talk, of, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble myſelf about her, ſhe is not worth a thought; and I hope I ſhall get quite clear of her idea before I reach Dover;"—on the road to which place we muſt leave him and return to ſee what happened at the church after his departure.</p>

                     <p>I DON'T doubt but my young female readers, if any ſuch I am honoured with, will be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and deſpiſe poor Maria for want of fidelity, or rather of reſolution; but let them conſider, and make her caſe their own, and I am ſure their contempt will be converted into generoſity. A young lady educated with ſo ſtrict a ſenſe of honour and truth as ſhe was, could not be guilty of ſuch premeditated deceit; the ſolemnity of the place, the awful grandeur of the ceremony, all forbade it; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had before obſcured her reaſon, but it now juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared to her, like going to church with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to utter a premeditated falſehood in the ſight of God: yet notwithſtanding all this, ſhe ſuffered the moſt painful conflict, before ſhe could ſo far let her virtue overcome her love; but when ſhe had thus nobly gained an aſcendancy over her paſſions, ſhe left that innate ſatisfaction which conſcious virtue
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032122_0089_0FF13A1677671718"/>
always does, on the performance of any good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but that ſatisfaction was but of a very ſhort du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and inſtantly vaniſhed, when on turning her head round, ſhe obſerved in Melvill's face the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of his heart and immediately after ſaw him leave the church; it was then the thoughts of having deceived him, and loſt him for ever, ruſh'd upon her mind in their full force; nay, even with aggravated circumſtances: this was far too much for her tender nature to ſupport; ſhe immediately fainted away, before the material part of the ceremony were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and threw the whole church into confuſion: ſhe was carried home ſenſeleſs: but by being put to bed, and by the application of proper remedies ſoon came to herſelf.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt every one then preſent, put different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions on this accident: No one except lady Hartry and AEmily were acquainted with the true cauſe; they had as well as Maria obſerved Melvill, and on his leaving the church in ſo extraordinary a manner, had too well gueſſed what where his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: to theſe, when alone, our afflicted heroine unburthened her full heart; and having made all the excuſes ſhe could think of to palliate her infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Melvill's anger began to ſubſide, he would ſtay and ſee the end of ſo extraordinary an affair; that he would defer his journey, till he was thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of her infidelity:—he thought very juſtly, that nothing could be a ſtronger proof thereof than thus giving herſelf to another before his face; his paſſion obſcured thoſe reaſons which aroſe ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in her mind to countenance the act; thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons laſted but ſo long, as while ſhe remained in that uncertainty of doubt and fear, but when the anſwer to her mother's note arrived, ſhe inſiſted on ſeeing it, which lady Hartry at firſt refus'd, as thinking one part thereof, not ſo proper for her peruſal; but as it is impoſſible long to maintain a denial of any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

againſt herſelf; but as according to the natural order of things, the human conſtitution cannot long thus exiſt upon the ſtretch, in a ſhort time the agony of her mind affected the body, and threw her into a violent fever, in which ſhe quickly became delirious, and was continually calling on Melvill; ſometimes ſhe would talk to him as if he were preſent, at others, ſhe would fall into the moſt violent fits of paſſionate rage, and in this manner rave, till nature being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exhauſted, a flood of tears came ſeaſonably to her relief.</p>
                     <p>Conſcious, that from her ſo often mentioning Melvill's name, Sir Thomas muſt imagine there was ſomething more at the bottom of this affair than he was acquainted with, lady Hartry, by the advice of AEmily, who behaved with more than common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in ſuch a ſcene of complicated diſtreſs, related to him all ſhe knew of the affair, kindly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exempt poor Maria from as much blame as ſhe poſſibly could:—To her great joy, this news was received in a far different manner from what ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; for as ſoon as Sir Thomas knew the cauſe of his daughter's illneſs, he us'd every means in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to haſten her recovery; at her firſt interval of reaſon, with the moſt aſſiduous tenderneſs, he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to compoſe her ſpirits, acknowledging, that he was convinced of the folly of his conduct, and determined no longer to oppoſe her happineſs; ſhe

                     <p>AS Maria had now gained her father's conſent to an union, which, ſhe flattered herſelf, would one day take place; notwithſtanding the fears ſhe had, leſt Melvill ſhould meet abroad with ſome lady, whoſe beauty, joined to her ill uſage might eaſily efface all

remembrance of her former kindneſs; the tranquility of her mind was ſoon in ſome degree reſtored, which added to her youth and natural ſtrength, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh her health; the roſes that ſo long had left her cheeks, began now to recover their accuſtomed bloom; and as after a tedious gloomy winter, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gladdens at the approach of ſpring, ſo there was no one in the houſe, or neighbourhood, who did not really rejoice at Maria's recovery, which was in a ſhort time totally completed:—and thus the family at Oak-Hall, of which, AEmily ſtill made one, all but Maria, regained their former ſerenity and peace.</p>
                     <p>When Mr. Clunch found that Sir Thomas was no longer an advocate for him with Maria, he was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induced to retract his claim, and in a few weeks after, married the daughter of one of his father's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's, with whom he probably found more real hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, than ever he could have done with a perſon, whoſe ſentiments and purſuits were ſo widely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from his own.</p>
                     <p>As Sir Henry Summers had now been abſent much longer than he at firſt intended, AEmily began to be not a little ſurpriſed thereat, as well as puzzled to find out what buſineſs he could have there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him ſo long; nor could ſhe avoid obſerving, that he had never made mention of it in any one of his letters; however, as he wrote conſtantly to inform her of his welfare, and as Mr. Martin had in the laſt
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032122_0095_0FF139D345067BD8"/>
letter given her a hint of an intended viſit, ſhe was eaſily prevailed upon by Maria to remain at Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hall; where, by their mutual deſire, Charlotte How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard now was.</p>
                     <p>Nothing therefore was wanting to complete the felicity of this family, but Melvill's return, which Maria had waited for, ſome-time, with the greateſt reſignation and patience; but when the period was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed, whereat ſhe had flattered herſelf with the pleaſing expectation of beholding him, and in which ſhe was moſt grievouſly diſappointed, her former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs began to return, and from the natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which ſhe had for ſolitude, ſoon ſettled into a melancholy deſpondence, when as if adverſe fate had not ſufficiently tormented her, Mr. Howard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from Melvill, wherein he informed him—"That he had juſt recovered from a violent fit of illneſs, and was preparing to leave Paris, where he then was, in order to viſit Madrid; that it ſtill remained his firm reſolve to endeavor, by a quick ſucceſſion of new objects, to recall his heart from Oak-Hall; that as he ſhould be continually upon the move, it would be impoſſible for him to hear from England; his deſign in which was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to avoid ſeeing the very name of Hartry, that nothing might retard the cure he hoped in a ſhort time to work in his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed affections."</p>
                     <p>It was very apparent from this, that he had never

received the letter Sir Thomas ſent after him to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais: and although the news pierced poor Maria to the heart, yet ſtill, to oblige her parents, ſhe endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to aſſume the placid ſmiles of cool indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Oh, what a painful taſk to wear a cheerful countenance with a gloomy heart!—Out of duty and complaiſance to them ſhe entered into company, though at the ſame time ſhe longed to be alone, to indulge her melancholy reflections on this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affair, which was the more ſo to her, as ſhe could blame no one for it but herſelf: her two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom friends, AEmily and Charlotte, endeavoured all in their power to comfort her, the latter of whoſe company ſhe was remarkably fond of, as ſhe knew by fatal experience the torments of divided love, and would ſometimes humour her affliction, by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Melvill, in return for which, Maria would ſympathize with her in her grief, for the long, long loſt Charles Hartry; in this manner, by each hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friend to ſhare in their afflictions, the burthen lay the lighter upon either:—But as theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not deliver poor Maria from her miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation; and as I at preſent ſee no probable means of doing it, I muſt be contented to leave her as ſhe is, and take ſome further notice of AEmily's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                     <p>It was now in the delightful month of May, about ſix in the evening, while our female friends were
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032122_0097_0FF139DA0C225E78"/>
ſitting in a natural alcove, formed by ſurrounding jeſſamines and woodbines, their attention abſorbed, in liſtening to a natural concert of the feathered cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſters around, ſuperior far to any which the rigid rules of art can dictate, when they were ſuddenly ſurpriſed by the appearance of a gentleman, whom, on his nearer approach, AEmily diſcovered to be no other than Mr. Martin; who, to add to her joy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her, that her uncle would be there the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning: the firſt ſalutations were ſcarce over, before Charlotte and Maria took an opportunity of leaving their friend to enjoy, without reſerve, the company of that man, for whom alone ſhe ſeemed to wiſh to live: AEmily ſaw, or at leaſt fancied ſhe ſaw, an unuſual ſeriouſneſs painted on his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, nor could ſhe forbear aſking him the reaſon; but he evaded an explanation, by the weak excuſe of being fatigued by his journey; though this was not the real cauſe, as the reader will preſently be convinced.—The next morning, agreeable to what Mr. Martin had told her, AEmily had the ſatisfaction of embracing her uncle; who in a ſhort time alter his arrival, not a little aſtoniſhed her by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>"It may not now my dear AEmily be improper to acquaint you with the cauſe of my ſo ſudden expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, at which I don't doubt you were very much ſurprized; but I am ſure you will be much more

ſo, when previous to what I have to ſay, I muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, you are not my niece; nor did I, till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this ſhort time, know any relation you had in the world."—AEmily's ſurprize at hearing this piece of news, may be much better imagined than deſcribed; however, as no word could convey a proper idea of her aſtoniſhment, ſhe ſat ſilent, and ſuffered Sir Harry to proceed without interruption.—He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Mr. Martin, who was then preſent, of this affair before; and indeed this was the cauſe of that inquietude which AEmily had taken notice of the preceeding evening; for when he found there was no ties of kindred between Sir Harry and his ward, and ſtill heard the warm manner in which he ſpoke of her, he began to be under ſome apprehenſions, left in his old age he ſhould play the fool, by ſinging am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous ditties to the bloom of nineteen; ſo ready are we to ſurmiſe whatever our fears dictates.—Sir Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now related to AEmily all the circumſtances rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his finding her, that the reader has before heard in the former part of this hiſtory; and then proceeded as follows.</p>
                     <p>"Soon after this extraordinary affair happened, I was telling to a circle of gentleman, none of whom choſe to believe me, but all perſiſted in attributing to me a larger ſhare thereof than I had any right to.

ſhewn him.—So extraordinary a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance awakened his curioſity; and in the way to her lodgings, where common civilities obliged him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her, with many apologies for the queſtion, he begged to know on what occaſion thoſe words were wrote, and as he aſſured her, that he had other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than curioſity for his inquiry, ſhe readily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied him; at the ſame time, giving him the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her life, from which he was convinced it could be no other than your mother.—At my deſire he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately introduced me to her; and having before informed her, what ſhare I had in the buſineſs, ſhe was as eager to relate as I was to hear, the ſtory of her woe; though both our deſires ſprung from diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erent motives; mine, from the hopes of making a worthy woman happy, for ſuch, from my friends ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I was ſure ſhe muſt be, by delivering to her arms a daughter, whom a monarch might boaſt of; and hers, from the expectation of becoming a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mother, at a time when ſhe had ſo little reaſon to look for ſuch a bleſſing:—She therefore ſatisfied my curioſity, as follows.</p>

                     <p>BORN and bred in retirement and eaſe, at more than a hundred miles diſtance from the capital of England, my youthful days were paſs'd in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued round of innocent amuſements; educated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the foſtering wing of indulgent parents, whoſe utmoſt wiſhes were their childrens happineſs; my inclinations never learnt to ſtray, but where my duty led them; the ſmiles of benignity ſat upon my youthful countenance, every circumſtance of life conſpired to make me bleſs'd:—I had a brother whom I loved dearly as myſelf: and as our ages were nearly equal, our ſtudies and purſuits were made ſo too, under that man, who was at once our tutor and our parent:—I read the Claſſics and learnt French with him, and to return, he was ſometimes permitted to take a leſſon on the guittar with me; but as we were only ſuffered to uſe theſe as amuſements at our leiſure hours, by thus being taught to conſider in the light of indulgences, what were really edifying and uſeful ſtudies, we of courſe made much more progreſs

I thus give you the hiſtory of my family, becauſe in my brother's, my own is included.—About a year after his departure, he informed us by letter, of an intended viſit, having obtained leave of abſence for three months; and that he ſhould bring a particular acquaintance, who was a brother officer with him: accordingly, in a few days he arrived, attended by his friend, whoſe name was Modiſh: this gentleman, who was a lieutenant as well as my brother, ſeem'd by nature form'd to pleaſe the women; had I ſaid for their deſtruction, my own circumſtances would too fatally juſtify the expreſſion, as I can with truth affirm, that I have never felt the influence of joy, ſince firſt I knew him; but ſtill I don't repent of my acquaintance; for whereſoever he is, may heaven protect him!—he had not been long at my father's before his behaviour too plainly convin'd me of his ſentiment; in ſhort he ſoon found an opportunity of declaring his paſſion for me, in the warmeſt terms; nor will I pretend to play the hypocrite, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was diſpleaſed at it and though prudence, as he had no fortune, but the income of his commiſſion, would not ſuffer me to receive his addreſſes openly as it would have been madneſs in me, to have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that my father ever would agree to the match, yet in private I gave him all the encouragement that modeſty would allow of, or his generoſity have aſked.</p>

I was now one-and-twenty, and had juſt received a thouſand pounds left me by an uncle, and which was all the fortune I had independent of my father; and, in ſhort, Sir, my affection for him was ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted, that he too eaſily prevailed upon me to fly from the beſt of parents, and receive him as a huſband:—he then wrote to my brother, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him therewith, and deſiring him to break the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to my father, and intreat his forgiveneſs; after which we proceeded to London, where we waited for ſome time, in daily expectation of an anſwer, but were amaz'd to find ourſelves diſappointed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially as Mr. Modiſh had had the precaution to deſire my brother to direct to him at a certain coffee houſe; thither he went every day, but every day had the mortification of a diſappointment:—and altho' my huſband's regard for me, ſeemed every moment to increaſe; in ſuch a ſituation, I was far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy:—the conſideration of being neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſerted by my parents, and all that my ſoul held dear in the world, except the partner of my heart, was too tormenting a thought for me not to be ſenſibly afflicted with.—We had been in town about two months, when the following misfortune happened to deprive me even of the pleaſure which my huſband's company afforded.</p>
                     <p>He was returning home one night from the coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, about twelve o'clock, elevated in liquor, when

a perſon from behind, gave him a ſlap on the ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.—Imagining he was beſet by foot-pads, turning ſuddenly round, he fired one of the piſtols which he always carried with him, and inſtantly ſaw the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had thus attacked him, fall to the ground. A crowd of watchmen immediately aſſembled, drawn thither by the report of his piſtol—but—good heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens!—what was his conſternation, when he found the perſon he had ſhot, to be no other than my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and whoſe ſlap on the ſhoulder, which was a mark of familiarity and affection, had been thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally miſconſtrued.—Concluding that he had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed him, under pretence of fetching a ſurgeon, he ran home, and informing me of this melancholy accident, took half my fortune, which luckily was in the houſe, and tenderly embracing me, hurried away to preſerve himſelf.</p>

                     <p>In this accumulated diſtreſs, I had no friend to comfort or aſſiſt me, and though Mr. Modiſh had promiſed to inform me of his fate, I ſtill remained entirely ignorant thereof, having never once heard from him ſince his departure; when, to crown all my miſery, I found myſelf with child: although I had a pretty large ſum of money left, it would daily diminiſh, and as I had no proſpect of getting more, I even then began to anticipate the tortures of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—At the uſual time, I was brought to bed of a daughter; and about ſix weeks after my delivery, had the luck of meeting with a lady, who had generoſity enough to believe my ſtory, and humanity enough to promiſe to aſſiſt me: nor did ſhe fail to keep her word; in a few days after, ſhe told me that a widow lady, to whom ſhe had mentioned my misfortune, had kindly offered to take me with her to Ireland as a

<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032122_0109_0FF13A004E921270"/>
when he endeavoured to diſſuade him from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and humane reſolution that he had made.—How little did he then know he was arguing againſt his own niece!—I have alſo, added Sir Harry ſince my return, on enquiring of my couſin concerning the fate of his brother, heard that he was loſt on his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to Italy; for which place he had embarked to avoid the officers of juſtice. As his marriage was an entire ſecret, he never had an opportunity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it to his brother, who was then abroad; and who, till my information, never had the leaſt ſuſpicion thereof.</p>
                     <p>On obſerving that AEmily could not refrain from tears, at hearing the fate of that man to whom ſhe owed her birth; he ſaid, "Indeed, my dear, this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is unneceſſary, as you never knew the perſon whoſe loſs you are lamenting; and as heaven has been kind enough to reſtore to you a parent, who I am ſure, will perform every duty, and amply ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of both father and mother.—This, my AEmily was the only reaſon why I deſired you to defer your marriage till after my return: for as you have now a parent to apply to, mine is but an aſſumed authority; though I am convinced, ſhe will readily give her conſent to every thing which may contribute to your happineſs."</p>
                     <p>As Mr. Martin was now entirely delivered from thoſe apprehenſions, which we hinted at above he
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032122_0110_0FF13A0554785370"/>
ſoon recovered his uſual flow of ſpirits: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated AEmily on her new acquiſition, in terms of the greateſt tenderneſs; as did the reſt of the family at Oak-Hall; who were immediately made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this happy revolution.—Even poor Maria ſeem'd to forget the cauſe of her affliction, and ſhare in the general joy.—The next morning Sir Harry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To deſcribe the meeting between AEmily and her mother, would require the efforts of a ſtronger pen, than my poor inexperience is maſter of; let it ſuffice to ſay, that each was highly pleaſed with the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſo deſerving a relation; and that this lady readily conſented to her daughter's marriage with Mr. Martin, whom ſhe from that moment conſider'd as her ſon.—Sir Henry having generouſly preſented his adopted child with ten thouſand pounds, theſe happy people accompanied by Mrs. Modiſh, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sir Thomas Hartry's, where, in a ſhort time, Martin's happineſs was completed, by being put in poſſeſſion of the truly amiable AEmily.</p>
                     <p>Although Maria, out of regard for her friend, could not refuſe being preſent at the wedding, the reader may imagine how much this renewed her grief; the thoughts of having lately been to the ſame

church, on ſo different an occaſion, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly circumſtances attending it; all ſerved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive that ſorrow, the firſt tumults of which were as yet ſcarcely ſubſided; and though her breaſt at this juncture, was truly the ſeat of mourning and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on her face ſhe wore apparent marks of joy:—thus then, all were, or at leaſt ſeemed happy. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and affection here went hand in hand, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially embraced each other: but mark the mutabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of all human affairs—oh, vain man! who can controul his fate? or dare to ſay, To-morrow is my own?—The joy that this family might truly boaſt, and the happineſs which fate ſeemed to have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them, for many years to come, were at once cruelly deſtroyed, by an accident as unforeſeen, as unprovided for.</p>
                     <p>The day after their marriage, AEmily propoſed a ride, which the unfortunate Martin too readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in; and they were ſcarce got a hundred yards from the houſe, before her horſe took fright at ſome linen hanging on a hedge: when, not being the moſt expert horſe-woman, ſhe loſt her ſeat, and was thrown with the moſt violent force, with her head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the foot of a tree, from thence ſhe was taken up and carried home ſpeechleſs:—On an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wound by a ſurgeon, he declared it to be mortal.—Would to heaven his report had been falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious! but as he foretold, in a few hours, the faireſt flower which earth ever ſaw, or heaven ever deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

departed from a place where her felicity was but juſt begun!—Oh Providence! how unſearchable are all thy ways, when the very means that we contrive for our amuſements, are thus conducive to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? for, to add to the poignancy of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, Martin was the firſt who, in order to amuſe AEmily, had inſiſted on her learning to ride. How little did he then imagine the fatal conſequences, which were one day doomed to attend it!—Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon griefs admit of common palliative conſolations; but alas, poor Martin! who ſhall ſpeak comfort to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction great as thine?—in one ſad hour deprived of wife—bride—miſtreſs.—Let the Stoic, pamper'd with delicacies, from his bed of down, deſpiſe the pinching gripes attendant on poverty;—then let him ſmile at misfortunes, and defy their point;—but ſhew me the man who, when the preſſing hand of ſtern adverſity is on him, will talk thus: who when his heart is ſick with grief, and his eyes dim with tears, can ſtill preſerve his reſolution, and I will worſhip him like a deſcended angel.</p>

till after her interment.—As this was too extraordinary an affair long to remain ſecret; the whole country were ſoon in tears, for the fate of the moſt deſerving woman of her early age.—This blow added to thoſe ſhocks ſhe had lately received, had nearly been the occaſion of Maria's relapſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, by the friendly converſation of Charlotte, her mind was diverted from the continual contemplation of thoſe things which occaſioned her grief.</p>

and in a few hours reached the end of his voyage, from thence proceeded with the utmoſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity to Paris, where he had not been long, before the fatigue of travelling, to which he was ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, join'd to his uneaſineſs of mind about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, whom, however he might flatter himſelf, he could not ſo ſoon forget; threw him, as the reader has before heard, into a violent fever.</p>

To recount to you the various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues that now preſented themſelves, eſpecially the amorous advances of Mrs. Faintwell, who took pains to inform me, that every young man who had a mind to ſucceed, ſhould form a connection with ſome lady of merit in the company; it would perhaps appear the effect of vanity, though moſt certainly Mrs. Faintwell, who was old enough to be my mother, and who had poſſeſſed eight real or nominal hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, abſolutely propoſed going by my name, that we might live, and taſte the ſweets, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of matrimony:—to tell alſo the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhifts we were obliged to make, in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our pieces, would appear romance; however, we gained conſiderable applauſe where ever we went—I ſay we, becauſe I belonged to the company;—though hitherto I had done nothing more than ſweep the ſtage, ſnuff the can l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Such were the father and daughter to whom Don Carlos introduced Melvill as one of his moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friends, ſuch was the family by which our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro was much careſſed, and in whoſe acquaintance he thought himſelf extremely happy.</p>

Like you my Henry, ſhe was too much in love to hear reaſon, and it was in vain, that I urged a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſentiment of her own to induce her to forget you—they never knew to love who knew to change.—I in vain aſked her what ſhe ſhould think of you, were you thus diſhonourable to transfer your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from one to the other, it all ſignified nothing.—But as you muſt, from fatal experience, know the difficulty of overcoming a miſplaced affection, better than I can pretend to inform you; I will ſay no more upon the ſubject.—In ſhort, ſhe inſiſted on my declaring it to you, which as ſhe had been candid enough to confeſs it, I could not refuſe; nor could I break my word with her, without adding thereto, the more flagrant crime of falſehood. I have alſo, as I though it my duty, informed my father of this affair, who would moſt joyfully accept of you for a ſon in law; I need not ſurely add, what I hope you are already convinced of, that I ſhould be highly pleaſed to join the more endearing name of brother, to that of friend—but I fear it will never be—all that I can now add, is, that I am ſorry poor Juliana' happineſs depends upon your anſwer, as I think, I too plainly read it in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

conſider of ſo friendly a propoſal and promiſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of his reſolution, in writing the enſuing day, after which, they hurried to their uſual gay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, whoſe vivacity however was not able to efface the gloom, which the above converſation had ſpread upon Melvill's countenance; and when he retired to his bed, it was without the leaſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſleep.</p>
                     <p>He lay ruminating the greateſt part of the night on the buſineſs of the ſubſequent day, ſo delightful a proſpect was not eaſily renounced.—A beautiful vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous young lady with an immenſe fortune, were ſtrong temptations for a man in his circumſtances, ſo very ill uſed too by that woman where he had garnered up his heart.—All theſe, were great incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to him to reſolve to abandon Maria for ever and marry Juliana; but then the thoughts of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſuch an engagement, when he was convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how firmly his affections were otherwiſe fixed; wounded his conſcience as a man of honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, far too ſenſibly to ſuffer him to commit ſo baſe an action.</p>
                     <p>After a long and violent conflict; he determined to make this ſacrifice to Maria; in which he was not a little ſtrengthened, by the firſt gleam of hope that he had entertained ſince his departure, and which ſhot acroſs his mind preſenting her to his view in her original ſimplicity and virtue.</p>

With the heart felt tortures of an unaffected ſorrow, ſhe lamented his abſence:—ſhe grieved for him, 'tis true: but then that grief was allay'd, by ſometimes hearing of his welfare from Mr. Howard; by the conſolatory reflections, that he muſt one day return: that when he found his error, his former love would
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032122_0148_0FF13A8C784A3F70"/>
revive, with an additional ardour, for having been thus ſuppreſſed; and by the conſideration that they might then be happy, in an union that was no longer oppoſed by the harſh commands of an auſtere parent—on the contrary, Sir Thomas endeavoured all he could to make her forget his former ill uſage;—he was continually inventing new pleaſures, to divert her from that melancholy, which the quick ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of two ſuch unfortunate accidents had given her a turn to: nor was his endeavours wholly unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; her former ſerenity of mind and countenance began, in ſome meaſure, to return, to the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joy of her over fond parents;—ſhe again began to be the ſprightly Maria Hartry;—dutiful to her parents; obligingly good natured to all who knew her;—beloved by the whole country:—and from the above conſiderations, poſſeſſed a tolerable degree of happineſs, when another unforeſeen acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happened to deprive her of it; which altho it is what every one muſt meet with, ſome time or other, was nevertheleſs very unexpected at that period;—being no other than the death of Sir Thomas, after a few days illneſs.</p>
                     <p>Maria felt this loſs the more ſeverely, as her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's fondneſs for her ſeemed every day to increaſe; having as it were, had her reſtored to his arms, from the mouth of the all devouring grave: we may therefore reaſonably conclude, that with a heart poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed

of extreme ſenſibility, her grief for the loſs of ſo good a parent, would be almoſt immoderate: but being a natural affliction, no one attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it.</p>
                     <p>Lady Hartry was much too good a woman, not to be ſenſibly concern'd for the loſs of a man who had been united to her by the tender ties of wedlock: neither could ſhe be ſuppoſed to feel the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſorrow for him, as if their lives had been one continued round of harmonious concord, which no one can imagine to be the caſe; as her's was rather a match of obedience to the inclinations of others, than from any choice of her own: but

ſiſter, twenty thouſand pounds on demand; to Charlotte and Melvill, each one thouſand pounds; leaving it, as his laſt deſire, that the latter on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſhould marry Maria; and to Mr. Howard, whom he appointed his executor, for his trouble therein, two thouſand pounds; but, in caſe his ſon ſhould not return, he bequeath'd his eſtate to his wife, on the ſame conditions: and after her death, to his daughter Maria; who now finding herſelf in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an ample independency, determined to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to Melvill, on his return; for which having waited for ſome months, with great patience, and no ſign thereof appearing, ſhe again began to relapſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her former melancholy; which Mr. Howard perceiving, propoſed to lady Hartry, in order to diverſify the ſcene, a journey to Bath; ſaying, that himſelf and Charlotte would accompany them.</p>
                     <p>In hopes of re-eſtabliſhing her daughter's health, that was viſibly declining, ſhe readily agreed to this propoſal; and they, in a few days, accordingly ſet out on their journey. Maria was pleaſed at leaving a place, where every object ſerv'd but to remind her of the many happy days ſhe had formerly ſpent there nor was her joy a little increaſed, by the heart-felt ſatisfaction of being accompanied by her dear Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte: however not to be troubleſomely minute, I ſhall paſs over the particulars of their journey, and proceed to that time when they were ſafely lodged on the parade at Bath.</p>

As pleaſure was their ſole purſuit, their chief care was to ſpend their time with the greateſt ſatisfaction to themſelves: and as this is by moſt people ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſiſt in being a continued round of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they were the next day waited on by a number of people,

                     <p>"Yes, replied his maſter, with a ſullen diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,—I have,—her name is Hartry,—ſhe has
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032122_0166_0FF13ACACCF82CD8"/>
twenty thouſand pounds at her own diſpoſal, and as it will therefore be impoſſible to put my ſchemes into execution, I have reſolved to think no more of her."—</p>
                     <p>Impoſſible? there's nothing impoſſible to your lordſhip's parts, titles and fortune, rejoin'd Mellifont, I thought you had been a man of more intrepidity, than to give up a girl, becauſe ſhe has money; that will indeed prevent your making the intended pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, but it can be no impediment to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of your wiſhes."—</p>
                     <p>"How, how, demanded my lord, eagerly."</p>
                     <p>Why, replied he, it will be an eaſy matter to watch her ſome night from the rooms,—put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wrong chair,—have a carriage waiting.—force her into it,—whirl her down to your houſe in Wales, where it will be impoſſible for her friends to find her; and then you know force and fear may induce her to what her inclination perhaps would reſiſt."</p>
                     <p>"Bravo replied my lord, E'gad that will do; 'twill make a noiſe in the world, and give a double reliſh to delight; thou ſhalt be my oracle and direct all; I muſt now dreſs, and hope before morning, to nick Sir John Softhead out of a thouſand: call on me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow forenoon, and we'll ſettle the glorious plan of amorous operations."</p>
                     <p>Thus were theſe two villains planning ſchemes
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032122_0167_0FF13ACF0F6E0708"/>
for the ruin of an innocent girl, while ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowingly giving them an opportunity of putting them in execution, by going to the rooms a few even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after the above conference.</p>
                     <p>On her entrance the firſt object that ſtruck her eyes was Mellifont: who having already prepared every thing neceſſary, haſten'd to inform my lord of this lucky circumſtance; who thought proper not to make his appearance, till it was time to execute their project.</p>
                     <p>Unhappily for poor Maria, the night ſeemed to favour their deſign, being very rainy, accompanied with a great deal of thunder and lightning.</p>
                     <p>On her wanting to go home, to her great ſurprize, her ſervant was not to be found: and ſhe, of courſe, prevented from getting to her chair: while ſhe was ſtanding in this ſituation, my lord, who had taken care to have her ſervant made drunk at a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ale-houſe, appeared, and finding what was the cauſe of her dilemma, made her an offer of his ſedan, which was juſt by, and which after ſome little apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, ſhe was too eaſily prevailed on to accept.</p>
                     <p>While they were ſtanding together, in the courſe of converſation, he had aſk'd her, whether ſhe was afraid of the lightning? of which having expreſſed great apprehenſions, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

cloſe; which ſhe accordingly did. My lord, elate with joy at his ſucceſs, now walked as faſt as he could before the chairmen, to ſhew them the way; and whom the reward of a couple of guineas, made proceed at an unuſual rate.</p>
                     <p>They had already got upon the turnpike road, when our heroine, thinking they were very long in carrying her home, opened the curtains, to ſee where ſhe was;—but, good heavens! what was her aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, when ſhe ſound herſelf in an open coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, near a mile from Bath, and lord Dapperwit, whom by the moon being juſt riſen, ſhe could eaſily diſtinguiſh walking before, at a ſmall diſtance.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had ſo far recovered, from the firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent effects of her amazement, as to be able to ſpeak, ſhe begg'd the chairmen to ſtop, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She then too plainly ſaw into my lord's villainy; and with tears in her eyes, entreated the chairmen to return:—in vain did ſhe endeavour to perſuade them;—in vain did ſhe promiſe any reward;—it was all to no purpoſe:—had it been their inclination, it was impoſſible; her ſeducer was juſt before and had his eyes conſtantly fixed upon the chair.</p>

As her only reſource therefore, ſhe was obliged to call in patience to her aſſiſtance and hope the beſt.</p>
                     <p>The chair having now ſtopped, my lord handed her into a poſt coach; at the ſame time telling her, that it would be to no purpoſe to make any reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; which ſhe was too well convinced of before: and conſidering that, as it was impoſſible for her to eſcape, ſhe ſhould fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>DURING the firſt ten miles of their journey, poor Maria was diſſolved in tears, and her ſwell'd heart beat, as if it would have burſt its tender priſon, in which ſtate of melancholy inſenſibility, like an ox going to the ſlaughter, or a lamb dumb before its ſhearers, did ſhe remain for ſome time; till, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that her tears would do but little towards her enlargement, ſhe at laſt took courage to ſpeak to her ſeducer.—</p>
                     <p>In the moſt pathetic manner, ſhe intreated him
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032122_0171_0FF13AD99B6AFB60"/>
not to make her miſerable for life, by thus dividing her from all that ſhe valued upon earth:—ſhe made uſe of every argument in her power to perſuade him to reſtore her to her friends; but alas! ſhe found they were in vain.—Had ſhe been endowed with the perſuaſion of a Cicero, or a Demoſthenes, they would all have been ineffectual; he was therefore ſurely not to be worked upon, by what he deemed, the ſupplications of an unſchooled girl: he was pleaſed to the higheſt degree, at the ſucceſs of his ſcheme; and only anſwered to all that ſhe ſaid with ſullenneſs, or by a cutting miſplaced raillery.</p>
                     <p>They had travelled in this manner, about three hours, when they ſtopped to change horſes; which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

by aſking a long ſtring of impertinent queſtions; to all which ſhe anſwered with the utmoſt civility and complacence, thinking it beſt ſo to do; but her attention was too much engaged, by the melancholy proſpect before her, to ſuffer any one to ſhare in it but Melvill; of him indeed ſhe ſecretly thought, and for his ſake determined to part with her life, ſooner than, what was to her, and ſhould be to every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, dearer than life,—her honour.</p>
                     <p>About four o'clock they alighted to dinner, at a lone farmhouſe, from whence there was no poſſibility of her eſcaping, nor any perſon to compaſſionate her ſituation; ſo that the hopes with which ſhe had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto buoy'd herſelf up, were now entirely deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and not to trouble my readers with all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of a diſagreeable journey, I ſhall content myſelf with ſaying, that, after having proceeded at a moſt furious rate, for a night and a day, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Having no inclination to ſleep, for indeed her

                     <p>"Wretch that I am! where will my calamities end? am I forever doom'd to be the ſport of fortune?—alas! why was I not permitted to die while an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and by that means to have eſcaped the many miſeries I was born to ſuffer?—but let me not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign the All-wiſe, for through his goodneſs, I may ſtill be happy; although the path, to my weak ſight, appears inextricable."—</p>
                     <p>"Oh Melvill! were you but acquainted with my ſufferings, and knew how much I ſtand in need of your aſſiſtance—I'm ſure you would joyfully beſtow it; but why do I ſtill think of him? or, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe do I own my love? he quits his native land to fly from me:—but my poor mother!—what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures now muſt ſhe endure? alas! how muſt her dear heart bleed for her afflicted daughter?"—In this manner did ſhe ſpend the greateſt part of the night, while he that was the cauſe of her misfortunes, ſlept as ſerenely, as if bleſt with native innocence; but, as miſery cannot endure for ever, the tender nature of Maria, being almoſt wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>loaths, awakened her, to recollect the poignant ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſhe was in.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as ſhe was dreſſed, ſhe was conducted to my lord who after breakfaſt, began to take ſome unjuſtifiable liberties with her; upon which ſhe a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> again implored him on her knees, not to detain her longer againſt her will: and attempted to repreſent to him, the ſinfulneſs of his inhoſpitable treatment; but as, to uſe his own expreſſion, he was not then in a humour for moralizing: he left her, ſaying, that he would give her two days for conſideration thereon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that if, at the end of that time, ſhe ſtill obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſed to gratify his wiſhes—force ſhould prevail.</p>
                     <p>This was a terrible declaration for the afflicted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria; who fixing her lovely eyes ſtedfaſtly on the ground, ſeem'd for ſome time ſtupified by thought; at length riſing triumphantly, ſhe exclaimed "Yes—it ſhall be ſo—I am determined—firmly fixed—that if before the end of two days, no apparent means for my eſcape are found—I will at once put an end to all my heart-rending miſeries—by—by what? oh diſtracting thought! by ſuicide."—Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain dropping on her knees, and claſping her hands, ſhe cried, "I know the heinouſneſs of the crime, I

have reſolved to commit—I ſee it in its full force—terrible to think of, and ſhocking to human nature—but ſtill I hope for mercy—I hope that the abſolute neceſſity for the action—my prefering death, and that by my own hand too, to the loſs of my honor, will, in ſome meaſure, palliate and atone for the attroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the deed; and that the all-wiſe Being will in another world, pardon the wickedneſs of a crime, which miſery and deſpair have drove me to in this—a crime, which even under theſe circumſtances, makes my nature ſhudder, and almoſt abhor her own reſolves."</p>

poſſible expedition, in our endeavours to recover you; when, after waiting a tedious length of time, we found you did not return from the rooms;—you may eaſily imagine the conſternation we were in, and with what painful anxiety we ſpent the reſt of the night;—in the morning I made ſtrict enquiry after you all over the town, but to no purpoſe; nor could we tell what to think of ſo extraordinary an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; we had no ſuſpicion of lord Dapperwit, nor indeed of any one elſe; and ſhould have been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally at a loſs what courſe to have taken, had it not been for an anonymous letter, I that day received, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me, you were carried to London. This as I have ſince diſcovered, was ſent by the lord's own orders, to put us into a wrong track; however in conſequence thereof, I immediately ſet out for town, making inquiries after you at every inn on the road, tho', as you may imagine, to no purpoſe. I now began to ſuſpect the trick that had been play'd me; when remembering that Lord Dappperwit was miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Bath, at the ſame time with yourſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any one being acquainted with his deſign; and likewiſe recollecting that he had a houſe in Caermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſhire, I thought is moſt likely that were he your ſeducer, he had carried you thither, and therefore reſolved upon paying him a viſit; on my road to which place I was, when my joyful meeting with you, happily prevented me from purſuing my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: and I hope we ſhall ſoon diſtribute happineſs to a miſerable family by our arrival at Bath."</p>

Maria then made tender inquiries after her mother and Charlottee, whom he informed her were well when he left them; but that he was under great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, leſt the grief which lady Hartry muſt inevitably feel, for not hearing of her daughter, would be too much for her conſtitution, which was already not a little impaired, by the repeated ſhocks ſhe had lately undergone: nor were his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions groundleſs; as on their arrival they found her ill in bed, and Charlotte in a ſituation almoſt ſimilar.</p>

                     <p>Melvill finding from this laconic anſwer, that he did not ſeem deſirable of entering into particulars: from his unwillingneſs to give any man unneceſſary pain, dropped the ſubject: ſome general converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning England, then paſſed, and Melvill having bought what he wanted, was leaving the ſhop; when, by ſome accident, a ring dropped from the hoſier's finger, which being the nimbler of the two, our hero picked up, and was returning to its owner; when caſting his eyes on it, he ſaw under the chryſtal, on a piece of white ſattin, curiouſly work'd with hair: the letters,

                     <p>Having examined this ring very attentirely for ſome time, he exclaimed—"No, it is impoſſible; it can never be;" and returing it to the hoſier, with

a low bow ſaid—"Will you not Sir deem me very impertinent, if I deſire you to favour me with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how you came by this ring?" By no means, replied his countryman; it was given me ſome years ago by a young lady, to whom I then had, and ſtill have, a moſt inviolable attatchment; ſhe worked it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IT is ſurely unneceſſary for me to inform my dear Melvill, of the reaſons for my departure from Oakhall; he muſt, during my ſtay there, too often have ſeen the unhappy cauſe.</p>
                     <p>In my younger days, he muſt have obſerved, that unjuſt taunts, and menaces, were the only returns I received for duty and humility; but being once arrived at a diſcretionary age, when diveſted of every juvenile prejudice, I could ſee things in their true light; and, finding it was not in my power to pleaſe my father, by the moſt careful aſſiduity, I thought his behaviour juſtified me, in reſolving at once to rid him of an object, which was ſo diſagreeable, thrice happy, that I am no longer ſo, and myſelf of a life that I was moſt heartily tired of, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find that tranquility among ſtrangers, which the unaccountable caprice of a parent deprived me of at home. As it was, in all probability, the laſt time I ſhould ever trouble him, I made no ſcruple
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032122_0192_0FF12B6759584030"/>
of taking away fifty pounds, which he had given me to pay to ſome tradeſmen; and packing up a few cloaths in my portmanteau, I ſet out early one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, on my own horſe, as you muſt have heard, without communicating to any one what were my intentions; nor did I ſtop to take one farewell of my moſt amiable Charlottee; though I now declare to you, that could I have had the leaſt idea of what I afterwards ſuffered, only from the conſideration of the excruciating tortures, which my behaviour muſt neceſſarily give her, ſhe never ſhould have had ſo melancholy a cauſe for her affliction.</p>
                     <p>As London was a place which I had a moſt earneſt deſire to ſee, I determined to go thither immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by getting employment as a clerk, in ſome merchant's counting-houſe, for which, by my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I was very well qualified, at once make my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf independent of him, whom, by all the laws of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And London had opened to me ſuch a ſcene of falſe pleaſure, that I had not been there many days, before I found my money reduced to ſomething under thirty pounds: I now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the extravagant rate I went on, the remainder could not laſt long; and therefore began ſeriouſly to think of getting into ſome employment: in order for which, I conſtantly read all the advertiſements, in hopes of there meeting with ſomething to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to my great ſorrow, had every day the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I had now been in London a fortnight, and found myſelf no nearer gaining of my point than on the firſt night of my arrival; however, having ſtill twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of employing almoſt my whole poſſeſſions in an act of charity: you ſtare at hearing a man talk thus, in an age when many, whoſe riches are immenſe, would refuſe a ſhilling to aſſiſt a ſtarving fellow-creature: but ſuppreſs your aſtoniſhment, till you have heard the particulars. Having one evening been prevailed upon to ſup at the tavern, where I had fooliſhly thrown away a couple of gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, at the billiard table; I was walking home, condemning myſelf for my folly, when my attention was awakened in a very extraordinary manner.</p>
                     <p>It was between twelve and one o'clock in the morning; when, paſſing by a genteel houſe, I heard the moſt violent ſcreams, which gave me reaſon to ſuſpect that ſome injury was committing, on a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who, by the voice I knew to be a woman; and preſently after I ſaw the door opened, and ſomething white thrown with the greateſt violence into the middle of the ſtreet: but, gracious heaven! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

What her perſon was, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to diſcern:—her hair was diſhevelled, and hung looſe upon her neck, which, with her eyes, and face, was beat in a moſt terrible manner: however there was ſomething altogether, which loudly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for my compaſſion, and not being proof againſt her tears, I called a coach, and putting her into it, drove to my lodgings.</p>
                     <p>During our little journey, her tears ſeemed totally to impede all her powers of ſpeech; nor were they at all abated, by the difficulty, which on our arrival, I found in getting her admitted: my landlady objected ſtrongly againſt it, for the honor of her houſe; and indeed, every circumſtance conſidered, there was nothing very unreaſonable in her objections; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly taking an unknown female, at that time, to a ſingle man's lodgings, carried far from a good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>She was a tall, genteel, well made woman, and notwithſtanding her eyes, and the other parts of her face, bore apparent marks of the bruiſes ſhe had received—I could ſtill diſtinguiſh that ſhe was handſome; her teeth were remarkably fine, and as her dreſs now in ſome meaſure, correſponded with the dignity of her figure; ſhe had an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right to the title of a fine woman.</p>
                     <p>On her entrance, I ſaw that ſhe wanted to ſay ſomething to me, but could not—I ſaw the gratitude of heart hanging upon her lips, and preſſing her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance; conſcious that ſhe felt more than ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I never in my whole life, had more occaſion for words, than at this inſtant, and never made a worſe uſe of them. I wiſhed to ſay ſomething to ſooth her feelings; but for a long time, was at a loſs; the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of her appearance, joined to the penetrating ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her tears, quite overcame, me; and it was not till after a long ſilence, that I recollected myſelf ſo far, as to beg ſhe would not diſtreſs me, by ſaying any more on a ſubject equally painful to us both—to aſſure her, that I had done nothing, but what I hop'd every man would have done in the ſame ſituation: from which, as it was but my duty, I could claim no merit, and that if I really had any—I was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently overpaid by conſciouſneſs of having acted right:—that as I was a man, I could not ſee the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes

of my fellow creatures, and diveſt myſelf of tender feelings—nor indeed would I have parted with them at that moment, for the wealth of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>She now ſeemed ſomething compos'd, and I had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing her eat ſome breakfaſt; after which, ſhe again thank'd me in the politeſt manner, and in terms, which at once ſhewed her gratitude &amp; good ſenſethough at the ſame time ſhe loaded herſelf with reproaches, as the cauſe of all her misfortunes, and ſeem'd but little ſhort of a ſtate of abſolute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.—</p>
                     <p>I endeavoured to ſolace her afflictions, by begging that ſhe would look upon me, as a perſon, inclin'd to do every thing in his power to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My reply was natural, and came of courſe—"I could not think ſo, and that of a recital of her ſtory, would not give her to much pain, by the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of paſt misfortunes, ſhe could not oblige me more, than by favouring me with it:"—ſhe reply'd; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

my unhappineſs has proceeded: my father whoſe name was Barton, was a gentleman of a gooſt eſtate in Glouceſterſhire: when I ſay good, I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to mean, that it was amply ſufficient to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe every real neceſſary of life, though not large enough to furniſh the ridiculous and prejudicial ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, which his openneſs of heart wiſhed to command, and which he was imprudently determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at any rate to procure; you will excuſe me Sir, for thus touching upon the frailties of a parent; but as you have an undoubted right to my moſt candid ingenuity, I muſt acknowledge, that extravagance was his foible, and has been my ruin.</p>
                     <p>He married my mother, with whom he had a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of five thouſand pounds, while he was very young, &amp; from the uniform propriety of her conduct had never any occaſion to repent of his choice; about a year after which, ſhe was brought to bed of a daughter, who, being the firſt tender pledge of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love, call'd for all the attention of her parents, which they, in their fondneſs readily beſtow'd: nor while a child, was her innocent prattle ever tireſome, rather ever new; and in the extatic moments of parental joy, they too vainly thought their happineſs complete; but alas! how was that felicity damp'd, to have the mortification of obſerving, when their daughter was arrived at tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>No wonder, that her parents did not feel the ſame cordiality of affection for her, that they would have done, for one of whom they had leſs reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>It is eaſier for you to imagine, than me to deſcribe, the joy, as I have ſince been informed, which my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther felt upon this occaſion—I quickly became a favourite with the whole family, except my ſiſter, by whom I was ſecretly as much deteſted, as I was admired by my parents; which in their abſence ſhe always took care to expreſs, by the moſt cruel treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

not that it aroſe from conſciouſneſs of having loſt a place in their hearts, but her pride could ill-brook ſo powerful a rival therein as myſelf; and out of a falſe ſpirit of reſentment, at the age of two-and-twenty, ſhe went off with a neighbouring baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, for ſhe had external charms to attract a man of gallantry; with whom, after a long ſearch, her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents heard ſhe lived in a moſt ſcandalous manner, in open defiance of every law of modeſty or honour.</p>
                     <p>Her afflicted father, imagining that an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his affections was the cauſe of this imprudent ſtep, wrote to her, in the moſt ſoothing and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate terms, earneſtly intreating her to return, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to receive her with open arms;—freely to forget and forgive all her paſt behaviour:—when, would you think? that equally inſenſible to the juſtneſs of his remonſtrances, and the tender kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſolicitations, ſhe had the cruelty to return for anſwer, "that ſhe would never conform to all the capricious whims of a younger brat, while ſhe had the means of exiſtence in her own hands; and could live without the aſſiſtance of thoſe, whom the world called her friends."</p>

I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was too young to experience any degree of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but being completely bleſſed in the entire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of my parents, whoſe love for their darling ſeemed every day to increaſe.</p>
                     <p>My juvenile years paſſed in the moſt pleaſing and harmonious manner.—Thus happy, inattentive, did I live; nor ever knew what it was to feel the pangs of agonizing ſorrow, till my dear mother's death, which happened when I was about ſixteen years old.</p>
                     <p>With her I might juſtly ſay departed all my joy: thrice happy had I been, if heaven in commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my youth and inexperience, had kindly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered one grave to have contained us both; but fate reſerved me for ſuperior woe: ſure I was born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the influence of an unlucky planet, which on the thread of my exiſtence, ſtamped the party-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured doom of miſery.</p>

                     <p>"Oh my Betſy, I have cruelly deceived you;—nay, I have deceived myſelf and all the world; my unbounded love for you, has made me inattentive to my own concerns; I have lived too faſt, and have now the agonizing reflection, that I muſt quickly leave you, liable to every inſult, which unguarded virtue meets with, without having it in my power to provide for your ſubſiſtence; at a time too, when, from your age, you have moſt need of ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced band, to guide your unwary youth, through this wide, precarious, and turbulent world:—my whole eſtate is mortgaged for more than its real worth; a falſe miſtaken pride, with an unguarded,

When my poor eyes are cloſed in endleſs night, what will you alone—helpleſs and innocent do? no friendly counſellor to adviſe; no hand to lead your young feet, through the broad path of vice, which opens ſuch a ſcene of tempting, dangerous pleaſure to inexperienced youth, that they perforce muſt yield to it, and for a ſingle moment of ſenſe-deluding gratification, undergo a life, perhaps an eternity of future woe. But my child, arm your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with reſolution, and when I am no longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to aſſiſt you, remember the laſt precepts of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parent—Confide in the all-wiſe Being; do not diſtruſt him, and he will never forſake you: nor let the flow'ry, eye-catching paths of ſenſual enjoyment, tempt you to depart from the thorny, difficult one of virtue."</p>
                     <p>"While you are virtuous, my child, you may be happy in yourſelf, and deſpiſe the vanities of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken world: do thus while young, and when the ſtealing ſteps of age draw on, you will be delivered from the tortures of a ſelf-condemnation, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſhame, remorſe, or terror: embrace reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For three weeks I thought myſelf, and really was completely happy. She went but very little abroad, tho' there was no day paſſed, in which ſhe was not viſited by a number of gentlemen, moſt of whom took particular notice of me: but as I thought it no more than they would have done of any other perſon, not totally deſtitute of beauty, I looked upon all the compliments which were made me, as things of courſe, and therefore paid no further attention to them.</p>
                     <p>There was one gentleman in particular, whoſe name was Hartrop, who always behav'd to me with an uncommon degree of politeneſs and warm civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and he was really an agreeable man, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I was very much pleas'd with his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>I was frequently alone with him, when he never behav'd in any manner, that was not conſiſtent with the ſtricteſt reſerve and delicacy; nor had I the leaſt ſuſpicion of the villainy of his intentions, till one particular day, when having dined with us, my ſiſter left us alone, ſaying, that ſhe had ſome buſineſs which would not long detain her, and beg'd me to entertain Mr. Hartrop till her return.</p>

and deſired to know what he had ſeen in my behaviour, to authorize ſuch proceedings? but he only laugh'd, at what he call'd my airs and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be intolerably rude, caught me in his arms, and having inſulted me with language, too groſs for me to repeat, avowed the baſeneſs of his intentions.</p>
                     <p>On my crying out he begg'd me to be ſilent: to induce me to which, he added, that my noiſe would be but little regarded in a houſe of that kind.</p>
                     <p>Diſengaging myſelf, I deſir'd to know what he meant by caſting reflections on my ſiſter's habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?—but he would not enter into any altercation, and catching me again in his arms, notwithſtanding my utmoſt ſtruggles, would ſoon have overcome me, had it not have been for a great cry of fire, which made him leave me, in order to take care of himſelf; but luckily, the alarm was occaſioned by nothing more than a chimney at the next houſe.</p>

                     <p>I have ſometimes, in hopes of finding it, excluded myſelf from all ſociety; but though I could fly far from the ſcene of guilty pleaſures, ſtill I could not upon myſelf—to have forgot my own wickedneſs, I muſt have reſigned, or violently ſtopped all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſenſation; the former I could not do, and the latter I had grace enough to avoid.</p>
                     <p>I have endeavoured to drown recollection, in a continual round of noiſe and diſſipation; but nature cannot always live upon the ſtretch; and if one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pauſe intervened, then, cried ſhe, clapping her hand upon her breaſt, I found my judgment here; here I felt more than can be expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>The only amuſement that endowed me with the leaſt tranſient degree of tranquility, was reading; and that, tho' it molified my ſorrows for the preſent, could not effectually divert my thoughts, from the only ſubject I deteſted: I too painfully found, that ſtudy and penſive retirement, though they may ſooth for a time, in the main give additional force to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or acquired melancholy.</p>

After I have told you the heart rending trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which we poor wretches are doom'd to ſuffer, and many others, that it is impoſſible for me to give you the leaſt idea of; will you not be very much ſurpriſed, when I aſſure you that out of the number of unhappy proſtitutes, which infeſt this town, very few are to be met with, who do not deſerve the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ſenſible?</p>
                     <p>Impoſſible, you'll ſay, that ſenſible women would lay themſelves open to the many miſeries which, in ſuch a ſtate they muſt neceſſarily meet with—I agree with you, that nothing can be a ſtronger proof of their imprudence, tho' not of weak underſtanding: and ſorry I am to add, that by far the greateſt part of them may, with juſtice, attribute their afflictions to the perfidious hypocriſy of your ſex; nay, parents themſelves are frequently in a great meaſure acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereto: for if a girl, who has no other fault than her attachment to a worthleſs object of affection, has as is commonly the caſe, in an unguarded hour, been drawn in, under the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Here I cannot help obſerving that the injuſtice of the world is no where more apparent, than in the diſtinction made, in the cenſures paſſed upon the frailties of the two ſexes, is it not hard, Sir, that man, a lawleſs libertine, may roam, commit at large every folly, every vice which youth, intemperance, or his vicious inclinations prompt him to, and he ſhall not ſuffer in the eyes of the world?—when if woman, poor, weak woman, who being moſt liable to fall, ſhould have greater allowance made, if ſhe deviates ever ſo little from the narrow path of virtue, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ruin is the inevitable conſequence.</p>
                     <p>The generality of the world cruelly imagine, that when a woman has loſt one virtue, ſhe can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that goodneſs of principles, ſhe has ſo impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently thrown away; but I ſtand a fatal example, to the injuſtice of ſuch an aſſertion: however time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial, having rendered it, an almoſt thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received opinion, every attempt to aboliſh it muſt be vain, and fall of itſelf.—Therefore to return to my ſtory.</p>
                     <p>Being thoroughly ſatiated and haraſſed, with the infamy attendant on this deplorable courſe of life, I once determined, by learning ſome trade, whereby I ſhould be enabled to get my livelihood in an honeſt manner, to draw myſelf out of it: for which purpoſe
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032122_0224_0FF13B7D8F5B07C0"/>
I ſaved all the money I could, and learned the milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Having the good luck to ſucceed therein, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt recovered my peace of mind, when another of the trade, envious of my ſucceſs, ſound means to ſteal a quantity of fine lace, belonging to a lady of quality, which was then in my poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>There was no one but what believ'd me guilty of the theft or fraud—in vain did I aſſert my innocence—as I had no money to replace the goods, I loſt my cuſtom, and thought myſelf happy, in not being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for a robbery.</p>
                     <p>I now found myſelf in the ſame deplorable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as before: at laſt was taken into keeping, by a ſingle gentleman, which ſheer neceſſity forced me to accept.</p>

I ſtill was doomed to be the ſport of fortune;—for the gentleman with whom I lived, coming home one day in liquor, found me talking to a young tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of whom I was ordering ſome goods; and tho'
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032122_0225_0FF13B82D93DA3B0"/>
he did not mention any thing at the time, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in the evening, he ſtripp'd me, and having beat me in the moſt cruel manner reproached me with a crime I never had been guilty of, inconſtancy to him; and, as a proof thereof, named the tradeſman he had ſeen in the morning.</p>
                     <p>In vain did I proteſt my innocence: be turned me naked into the ſtreet, as you ſaw—where I ſhould certainly have periſhed, had it not been for your unmerited, unexampled kindneſs.</p>

there appeared ſuch an air of unaffected ingenuity and perfect contrition, that I could not diſbelieve her.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain charm in probity which ſtrikes upon the mind, like light upon our eyes; conviction attends it; and if what ſhe had told me was really true, as indeed I had no reaſon to ſuſpect the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I thought her much to be pitied; nay own, I felt myſelf deeply intereſted in her future welfare:—therefore made her an offer of my lodging, which, with a great many apologies, for the trouble ſhe had already given me, out of a principal of delicacy, ſhe modeſtly declined, and would have inſtantly depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but conſcious that ſhe had no other friend to apply to, and that neglect muſt renew her wretched ſcenes of life again, I would not ſuffer it:—I could not bear, that a perſon, whoſe temporal, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſpiritual welfare I had ſo much already contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to, ſhould again throw herſelf away, from a punctilio of civility; and therefore inſiſted on her remaining where ſhe was, till I could find her ſome employment in the millenery buſineſs, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined immediately, to look out for; and to my great ſatisfaction, in a few days had the luck of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a perſon, whoſe health obliging her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from London, ſhe was willing to yield up her ſhop, on the condition of being paid half the profits thereof, during her life time: and with the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of my landlady, who procured ſecurity,

I had in a ſhort time the pleaſure of conducting Miſs Barton to her new habitation.</p>
                     <p>I never heard ſuch expreſſions of ſincere gratitude, as this generous, ſenſible, though abuſed creature made me: expreſſions were the only way ſhe had of ſhewing it, and on my preſenting her with ten pounds for immediate uſe, I had the inexpreſſible pleaſure of hearing that ſhe thought herſelf happy—and though I conſiderably diſtreſſed myſelf by aſſiſting her, I muſt own, that an innate ſatisfaction, prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all the riches of this world, ſhed a pleaſing balm upon my delighted heart.</p>

                     <p>It was his greateſt glory, that he wanted nothing but a title, which he deſigned to purchaſe, on his
