         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>After which, in like fury the captain came up to me; but at my requeſt, he gave me quarter.

my eldeſt daughter <hi>Sarah</hi> to ſing them a ſong; then was brought into her remembrance that paſſage in the 137th Pſalm, <hi>By the rivers of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>there we ſat down, yea we wept when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd</hi> Zion; <hi>we hanged our harps on the willows in the mioſt thereof; for there they that carried us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captive, required of us a ſong, and they that waſted us, required of us mirth.</hi> When my poor child had given me this account, it was very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, and my heart was very full of trouble, yet on my child's account, I was glad that ſhe had ſo good an inclination, which ſhe yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſted, in longing for a bible, that we might have the comfort of reading the holy text at vacant times, for our ſpiritual comfort under our preſent affliction.</p>
               <p>Next to the difficulties of the rivers, were the prodigious ſwamps and thickets, very difficult to paſs thro'; in which places my maſter would ſometimes lead me by the hand a great way toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the greateſt difficulty that deſerves the firſt to be named, was want of food, having at times nothing to eat but pieces of old beaver-skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match-coats, which the <hi>Indians</hi> having hid (for they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

'Tis to be conſider'd further, that of this poor diet we had but very ſcanty allowance; ſo that we were in no danger of being over charged. But that which added to my trouble, was the complaints of my poor children, eſpecially the little boy. Sometimes the <hi>Indians</hi> would catch a ſquirrel, or a beaver, and at other times we met with nuts, berries, and roots they digg'd out of the ground, with the bank of ſome trees: but we had no corn for a great while together, tho' ſome of the younger <hi>Indians</hi> went back, and brought ſome corn from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> inhabitants (the harveſt not being gathered) of which we had a little allowed us: but when they caught a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we lived high while it laſted, they allowed me the guts and garbage for myſelf and children; but not allowing us to clean and waſh them as they ought, made the food very irkſome to us, to feed upon, and nothing beſides pinching hunger could have made it any way tolerable to be borne.</p>
               <p>The next difficulty was no leſs hard to me; for my daily travel and hard living made my milk dry almoſt quite up, and how to preſerve my poor babe's life, was no ſmall care on my mind; having no other ſuſtenance for him, many times, but cold water, which I took in my mouth, and let it fall on my breaſt, when I gave him the teat to ſuck in, with what it could get from the breaſt; and when I had any of the broth of the beaver's-guts, or other guts, I fed my babe with it, and as well as I could I preſerved his life till I got to <hi>Canada,</hi> and then I had ſome other food, of which more in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>Having by this time got conſiderably on the way, the <hi>Indians</hi> parted; and we were divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. This was a ſore grief to us all:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007160_0008_102B2D283A31DF78"/>
but we muſt ſubmit, and no way to help our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. My eldeſt daughter was firſt taken away, and carried to another part of the country, far diſtant from us, where, for the preſent, we muſt take leave of her, tho' with a heavy heart.</p>
               <p>We did not travel far after this, before they divided again, taking my ſecond daughter and ſervant maid from me, into another part of the country: ſo, I having now only my babe at my breaſt, and little boy ſix years old, we remained with the captain ſtill: but my daughter and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant underwent great hardſhips after they were parted from me, travelling three days, without any food, taking nothing for ſupport, but cold water; and the third day, what with the cold, the wet, and hunger, the ſervant fell down as dead in a ſwoon, being both very cold and wet, at which the <hi>Indians</hi> with whom they were, were ſurpriz'd, ſhewing ſome kind of tenderneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling then to looſe them by death, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got them ſo near home, hoping, if they liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by their ranſom to make conſiderable profit of them.</p>
               <p>In a few days after this, they got near their journey's end, where they had more plenty of corn and other food: but fleſh often fell very ſhort, having no other way to depend on for it, but hunting; and when that failed, they had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort commons. It was not long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re my daughter and ſervant were likewiſe parted; and my daughter's maſter being ſick, was not able to hunt for fleſh: neither had they any corn in that place, but were forced to eat bark of trees for a whole week.</p>
               <p>Being almoſt famiſhed in this diſtreſs, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo ordered, that ſome other <hi>Indians</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their miſery and want, came to viſit them;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007160_0009_102B2D29D67FEB10"/>
(theſe people being very kind and helpful to one another, which is very commendable) and brought unto them the guts and liver of a beaver, which afforded them a good repaſt, being but four in number, the <hi>Indian,</hi> his wife and daughter, and my daughter.</p>
               <p>By this time my maſter and our company got to our journey's end, where we were better fed at times, having ſome corn and veniſon, and wild fowl, or what they could catch by hunting in the woods; and my maſter having a large family, fifteen in number, we had at times very ſhort commons, more eſpecially when game was ſcarce.</p>
               <p>But here our lodging was ſtill on the cold ground, in a poor wigwam (which is a kind of little ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made with the rind of trees and mats for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, ſomething like a tent.) Theſe are ſo eaſily ſet up and taken down, that they oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them from one place to another: out ſhoes and ſtockings and our other cloaths being wore out, in this long journey thro' the buſhes and ſawmps, and the weather coming in very hard, we were poorly defended from the cold, for want of neceſſaries; which cauſed one of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'s to freeze; and this was no ſmall exerciſe, yet thro' mercy we all did well.</p>
               <p>Now tho' we got to our journey's end, we were never long in one place, but very often moved from one place to another, carrying our wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams with us, which we could do, without much difficulty. This being for the conveniency of hunting, made our accommodations much more unpleaſant than if we had continued in one place, by reaſon the coldneſs and dampneſs of the ground, where our wigwams were pitched,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007160_0010_102B2D2B6B1AA718"/>
made it very unwholſome and unpleaſant lodging.</p>
               <p>Having now got to the <hi>Indian</hi> fort, many of the <hi>Indians</hi> came to viſit us, and in their way wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd my maſter home; and held a great rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, with dancing, firing of guns, beating on hollow trees, inſtead of drums, ſhouting, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and feaſting, after their manner, in much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for ſeveral days together, which I ſuppoſe, in their thoughts, was a kind of thanks to God put up for their ſafe return and good ſucceſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but while they were in their jolitry and mirth, my mind was greatly exerciſed towards the Lord, that I, with my dear children ſeparated from me, might be preſerved from repining aginſt God, under our affliction on the one hand, and on the other, we might have our dependance on him, who rules the hearts of men, and can do what he pleaſes in the kingdoms of the earth, knowing that his care is over them who put their truſt in him; but I found it very hard to keep my mind as I ought, in the reſignation which is proper it ſhould be in, under ſuch afflictions and ſore trials, as at that time I ſuffered, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under various fears and doubts concerning my children that were ſeparated from me, which helpt to and to, and greatly encreaſe my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: and herein I may truly ſay, my afflictions are not to be ſet forth in words to the extent of them.</p>
               <p>We had not been long at home ere my maſter went a hunting, and was abſent about a week, he ordering me in his abſence to get in wood, gather nuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I was very diligent, cutting the wood, and putting it in order, not having very far to carry it: but when he returned, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got no prey, he was very much out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007160_0011_102B2D2E8F7F3190"/>
and the diſappointment was ſo great, that he could not forbear revenging it on us poor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. However he allowed me a little boiled corn for myſelf and child, but with a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry look threw a ſtick or corn-cob at me, with ſuch violence as did beſpeak he grudged our eating. At this his ſquaw and daughter broke out in a great crying. This made me fear miſchief was hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt us: and on it, I immediately went out of his preſence into another wigwam; upon which he came after me, and in great fury tore my blanket off my back, and took my little boy from me and ſtruck him down as he went along before him; but the poor child, not being hurt, only frighted in the fall, ſtarted up and ran away, without crying; then the <hi>Indian</hi> my maſter left me; but his wife's mother came and ſat down by me, and told me, <hi>I muſt ſleep there that night.</hi> She then going from me a little time, came back with a ſmall skin to cover my feet withal, informing that my maſter intended now to kill us; and I being deſirous to know the reaſon, expoſtulated, that <hi>in his abſence I had been diligent to do as I was ordered by him.</hi> Thus, as well as I could, I made her ſenſible how unreaſonable he was. Now, tho' ſhe could not underſtand me, nor I her, but by ſigns, we reaſoned as well as we could. ſhe therefore made ſigns that I muſt die, adviſing me, by pointing up with her fingers, in her way, to pray to God, endeavouring by her ſigns and tears to inſtruct me in that which was moſt needful, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> to prepare for death, which now threatned me; the poor old ſquaw was ſo very kind and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſhe would not leave me all that night, but laid herſelf down at my feet, deſigning what ſhe could to aſuage her ſon-in-law's wrath, who had conceived evil againſt me, chiefly as I underſtood,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007160_0012_102B2D30C0198728"/>
becauſe the want of victuals urged him ot it. My reſt was little this night, my poor babe ſleeping ſweetly by me.</p>
               <p>I dreaded the tragical deſign of my maſter, looking every hour for his coming to execute his bloody will upon us: but he being weary with his hunting and travel in the woods, having toil'd for nothing, went to reſt, and forgot it. Next morning he applied himſelf again to hunting in the woods, but I dreaded his returning empty, and prayed ſecretly in my heart, that he might catch ſome food to ſatisfy his hunger, and cool his ill humour. He had been gone but a little time till he returned with booty, having ſhot ſome wild ducks; and now he appeared in a better temper, ordering the fowls to be dreſſed with ſpeed; for theſe kind of people, when they have plenty, ſpend it as freely as they get it; uſing with gluttony and drunkenneſs in two days time, as much as, with prudent management, might ſerve a week. Thus do they live, for the moſt part, either in exceſs of gluttony and drunkenneſs, or under great ſtraits for want of neceſſaries. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in this plentiful time I felt the comfort of it in part with the family, having a portion ſent for me and my little ones, which was very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Now, I thinking the bitterneſs of death was over for this time, my ſpirits were a little ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, he got into the like ill humour again, threatning to take away my life. But I always obſerved whenever he was in ſuch a temper, he wanted food, and was pinched with hunger. But when he had ſucceſs in hunting, to take either bears, beavers, bucks or fowls, on which he could fill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ight occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This made me in continual danger of my life: but God, whoſe Providence is over all his works, ſo preſerved me, that I never received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny damage from him that was of any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to me; for which I ever deſire to be thankful to my maker.</p>
               <p>When fleſh was ſcarce, we had only the guts and garbage allowed to our part; and not being permitted to cleanſe the guts any otherwiſe than emptying the dung, without ſo much as waſhing them, as before is noted, in that filthy pickle we muſt boil them, and eat them, which was very unpleaſant: but hunger made up that difficulty, ſo that this food which was very often our lot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came pretty tolerable to a ſharp apperite, which otherwiſe by no means could have been diſpenſed with. Thus I conſider'd, none knows what they can undergo, till the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this time, what with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>atigue of ſpirits, hard labour, mean diet, and often want of natural reſt, I was brought ſo low, that my milk was dried up, my babe very poor and weak, juſt skin and bone; for I could perceive all her joints from one end of the back to the other; and how to get what would ſuit her weak apperite, I was at a loſs; on which one of the <hi>Indian</hi> ſquaws perceiving my uncaſineſs about my child, began ſome diſcourſe with me, in which ſhe adviſed me to take the kernels of walnuts, clean them, and beat them with a little water, which I did, and when I had ſo done, the water look'd like milk; then ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to add to this water, a little of the fineſt

of the <hi>Indian</hi> corn meal, and boil it a little toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I did ſo, and it became palatable, and was very nouriſhing to the babe, ſo that ſhe began to thrive and look well; which was before, more like to die than live. I found that with this kind of diet the <hi>Indians</hi> did often nurſe their infants. This was no ſmall comfort to me: but this comfort was ſoon mixed with bitterneſs and trouble, which thus happen'd; my maſter taking notice of my dear babe's thriving condition, would often look upon her, and ſay, <hi>when ſhe was fat enough, ſhe ſhould he killed, and he would eat her;</hi> and purſuant to his pretence, at a certain time, he made me fetch him a ſtick that he had prepared for a ſpit, to roaſt the child upon, as he ſaid, which when I had done, he made me ſit down by him, and undreſs the infant. When the child was naked, he felt her arms, legs, and thighs, and told me, <hi>ſhe was not fat enough yet; I muſt dreſs her again until ſhe was better in caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now tho' he thus acted, I could not perſuade myſelf, that he intended to do as he pretended, but only to aggravate and afflict me: neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could I think but our lives would be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his barbarous hands, by the over-ruling power of him in whoſe providence I put my truſt, both day and night.</p>
               <p>A little time after this my maſter fell ſick, and in his ſickneſs, as he lay in his wigwam, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his own ſon to beat my ſon: but the old ſquaw, the <hi>Indian</hi> boy's grandmother, would not ſuffer him to do it: then his father, my maſter, being provoked, caught up a ſtick very ſharp at one end, and with great violence threw it from him, at my ſon, and hit him on the breaſt, with which my child was much bruiſed, and the pain, with the ſurprize, made him turn as pale as death;

I entreating him not to cry, and the boy, tho' but ſix years old, bore it with wonderful patience, not ſo much as in the leaſt complaining, ſo that the child's patience aſuaged the barbarity of his heart: who, no doubt, would have carried his paſſion and reſentment much higher, had the child cried, as always complaining did aggravate his paſſion, and his anger grew hotter upon it. Some little time after, on the ſame day, he got up on his feet, but far from being well. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, tho' he was ſick, his wife and daughter let me know, he intended to kill us, and I was under a fear, unleſs Providence now intercepted, how it would end. I therefore put down my child, and going out of his preſence, went to cut wood for the fire, as I uſed to do, hoping that would, in part, allay his paſſion; but withal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re I came to the wigwam again, I expected my child would be killed in this mad fit, having no other way but to caſt my care upon God, who had hitherto helped and cared for me and mine.</p>
               <p>Under this great feud the old ſquaw, my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's mother-in-law left him; but my miſtreſs and her daughter abode in the wigwam with my maſter; and when I came with my wood, the daughter came to me, whom I asked, if her father had kill'd my children, and ſhe made me a ſign. <hi>No,</hi> with a countenance that ſeem'd pleas'd it was ſo; for inſtead of his further venting his paſſion on me, and my children, the Lord, in whom I truſted, did ſeaſonably interpoſe, and I took it as a merciful deliverance from him, and the <hi>Indian</hi> was under ſome ſenſe of the ſame as himſelf did confeſs to them about him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Thus it was, a little after he got up on his feet, the Lord ſtruck him with great ſickneſs, and a violent pain, as appeared by the complaint

he made in a doleful and hideous manner; which when I underſtood, not having yet ſeen him, I went to another ſquaw, that was come to ſee my maſter, which could both ſpeak and underſtand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and enquired of her if my miſtreſs (for ſo I always called her, and him maſter) thought that maſter would die?

               <p>Some few weeks after this, my maſter made another remove, having, as before, made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: but this was the longeſt ever he made, it being two days journey, and moſtly upon ice. The firſt day's journey the ice was bare, but the next day ſome ſnow falling, made it very troubleſome, tedious and difficult traveling; and I took much damage in often falling, having the care of my babe, that added not a little to my uneaſineſs; and the laſt night, when we came to encamp, it being in the night, I was ordered to fetch water: but having ſate a while on the cold ground, I could neither go nor ſtand; but crawling on my hands and knees, a young <hi>Indian</hi> ſquaw came to ſee our people, being of another family, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion took the kettle, and knowing where to go,

which I did not, fetcht the water for me. This I took as a great kindneſs and favour, that her heart was inclined to do me this ſervice.</p>
               <p>I now ſaw the deſign of this journey; my maſter being, as I ſuppoſe, weary to keep us, was willing to make what he could of our ranſom; therefore he went further towards the <hi>French,</hi> and left his family in this place, where they had a great dance, ſundry other <hi>Indians</hi> coming to our people, this held ſome time, and while they were in it, I got out of their way in a corner of the wigwam as well as I could: but every time they came by me, in their dancing, they would bow my head towards the ground, and frequently kick me with as great fury as they could bear, being ſundry of them barefoot, and others hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Indian</hi> mockoſons: this dance held ſome time, and they made (in their manner) great rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings and noiſe.</p>
               <p>It was not many days ere my maſter returned from the <hi>French;</hi> but he was in ſuch a humour, when he came back, he would not ſuffer me in his preſence. Therefore I had a little ſhelter made with ſome boughs, they having digged thro' the ſnow to the ground, the ſnow being pretty deep. In this hole, I and my poor children were put to lodge, the weather being very ſharp, with hard froſt, in the month called <hi>January,</hi> made it more redious to me and my children.

               <p>Retiring now with my maſter for this night, the next day I was redeemed for 600 livers; and, in treating with my maſter, the <hi>Frenchman</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, <hi>Why he asked ſo much for the child's ranſom?</hi> Urging, <hi>when ſhe had her belly-ful, ſhe would die.</hi> My maſter ſaid, <hi>No, ſhe would not die, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lived</hi> 26 <hi>days on nothing but water, believing the child to be a devil.</hi> The <hi>Frenchman</hi> told him, <hi>No, the child is order'd for longer life; and it has pleaſed God to preſerve her to admiration.</hi> My maſter ſaid, <hi>No ſhe was a devil, and he believed ſhe would not die, unleſs they took a hatchet and beat her brains out.</hi> Thus ended their diſcourſe, and I was, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, with my babe, ranſomed for 600 livers, my little bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I now having changed my landlord, my table and diet, as well as my lodging, the <hi>French</hi> were civil beyond what I could either deſire or expect. But the next day after I was redeemed, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> prieſt took my babe from me, and according to their cuſtom, they baptized her, urging if ſhe died before that, ſhe would be damned, like ſome of our modern pretended reformed prieſts, and they gave her a name as pleaſed them beſt; which was <hi>Mary ann Froſſways,</hi> telling me, <hi>My child, if ſhe now died, would be ſaved, being baptized;</hi> and my land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord ſpeaking to the prieſt that baptized her, ſaid,

                  <hi>It would be well now</hi> Froſſways <hi>was baptized for her to die, being now in a ſtate to be ſaved</hi> But the prieſt ſaid, <hi>No, the child having been ſo miraculouſly preſerved thro' ſo many hardſhips, ſhe may be deſigned by God for ſome great work, and by her life being ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, may much more glorify God than if ſhe ſhould now die.</hi> A very ſenſible remark, and I wiſh it may prove true.</p>
               <p>I having been about five months amongſt the <hi>Indians.</hi> In about one month after I got amongſt the <hi>French,</hi> my dear huſband, to my unſpeakable comfort and joy, came to me, who was now him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerned to redeem his children, two of our daughters being ſtill captives, and only myſelf and two little ones redeemed; and thro' great difficulty and trouble he recover'd the younger daughter: but the eldeſt we could by no means obtain from their hands, for the ſquaw, to whom ſhe was given, had a ſon which ſhe intended my daughter ſhould in time be prevailed with the marry; the <hi>Indians</hi> are very civil toward their captive women, not offering any incivility by any indecent carriage (unleſs they be much overgone in Equor) which is commendable in them ſo far.</p>
               <p>However the affections they had for my daughter, made them refuſe all offers and terms of ranſom; ſo that after my poor husband had wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made what attempts and endeavours he could to obtain his child, and all to no purpoſe, we were forced to make homeward, leaving our daughter to our great grief, behind us, amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſet forward over the lake, with three of our children, and the ſervant-maid, in company with ſundry others, and by the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of providence we got well home on the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of providence we got well home on the firſt day of the ſeventh month, 1725.

               <p>Now tho' my husband died, by reaſon of which his labour was ended, yet my kinſman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the thing, and left no ſtone unturned that he thought, or could be adviſed, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the obtaining my daughter's freedom; but could by no means prevail; for, as is before ſaid (ſhe being in another part of the country diſtant from where I was) and given to an old ſquaw, who intended to marry her in time, to her ſon uſing what perſuaſions ſhe could to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect her end, ſometimes by fair means, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ſevere.
