            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE two following Odes were compos'd on their reſpective Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, merely for the Author's Amuſement and the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Friends; but their Importunity and favourable, not to ſay partial, Judgment of them, have induc'd him to preſent them to publick View, not without ſome Hope, that they may meet with a kind Reception, if not by their intrinſick Merit, at leaſt by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to thoſe important and intereſting Events which gave them Birth.</p>
            <p>As the Life of Lord <hi>HOWE</hi> was unſpeakably valuable, ſo his Death is, and it were aſtoniſhing if it were not, moſt ſincerely and univerſally lamented: And indeed I know not, whether the ſad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe which ſucceeded his Fall, tho' attended with the Loſs of ſo many Lives, has occaſion'd more Regret, than the ſingle Fate of that illuſtrious and promſing young Hero. But the Reduction of <hi>Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> to his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty muſt needs give inexpreſſible Pleaſure, and afford a moſt delightful Proſpect, to every one, in proportion as he apprehends its Importance to, and prizes the Welfare of, the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this View of Things, and a critical Humour apart, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hopes theſe Performances with all their Faults (which he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of) may afford a pleaſing Entertainment to his Fellow Subjects, even at this Diſtance of Time; and if ſo, he wou'd have been glad if his Diſtance from the Preſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their being ſomewhat more ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>If the Character of Lord <hi>HOWE</hi> be, as doubtleſs it is, incompleat it muſt be conſider'd that this Sketch of it was copied from the Voice of Fame; and if any Gentlemen of the Army or Navy ſeem to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or not mention'd according to their Rank, in the Ode on the Reduction of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> I hope it will be imputed rather to the Ignorance than the Partiality, of</p>
