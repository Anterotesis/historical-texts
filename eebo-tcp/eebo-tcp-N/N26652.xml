            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN Artillery Election Sermon.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM cxlix. 6.</bibl>
               <q>LET THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD BE IN THEIR MOUTH, AND A TWO-EDGED SWORD IN THEIR HAND.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THREE interpretations may be given to theſe words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was the cuſtom of ancient, as it is of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, nations, to excite the courage of their armies, when going to battle, by inſtrumental muſick. The Etrurians, for this purpoſe, uſed the trumpet; the Lacedemonians, the pipe; and the Egyptians, the drum. The Hebrew people, ever inſtructed to borrow nothing of idolatrous manners, are here taught to acquire the neceſſary valour to combat and vanquiſh their foes, by ſimply employing their voices in ſinging the wondrous power and acts of their divine deliverer. This is one interpretation of the words.<note n="*" place="bottom">Conſult the argument to this pſalm in biſhop Patrick's Paraphraſe.</note> In its juſtification is adduced the following paſſage of the ſacred Chronicles.<note place="margin">B. II. Ch. xx. 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>And when he had conſulted with the people, he appointed ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto the Lord, and that ſhould praiſe the beauty of holineſs as they went out before the army, and to ſay, Praiſe the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever. And when they began to ſing and to praiſe, the Lord ſet am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhments
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035443_0004_1004C9D8D9B04758"/>
againſt the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, which were come againſt Judah, and they were ſmitten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond conſtruction of the text ſuppoſes the pſalm, from which it is taken, to have been compoſed in honour of ſome recent ſucceſſes, that had crowned the Jewiſh arms, for which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are exhorted to celebrate his goodneſs, and, at the ſame time, to retain their martial hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, as a conſtant terrour to their enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, It is notorious that the Jews, after returning from captivity at Babylon, were infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a dangerous oppoſition to their liberties at home and abroad, which, through remarkable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the divine providence, they finally cruſhed. Poſſibly the writer of this ſublime and animated hymn deſigned to inſpirit the patriots of his age to purſue and complete a triumph over their impious adverſaries: and this conſtruction is rendered almoſt probable by the context.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The Hebrew critick would probably render it, The ſaints <hi>ſhall</hi> be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, &amp;c. they <hi>ſhall</hi> ſing aloud, &amp;c. But I follow the common tranſlation.</note> 
               <hi>the ſaints be joyful in glory: let them ſing aloud upon their beds. Let the high praiſes of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged ſword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and puniſhments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his ſaints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since it is now impoſſible, however, to know the author and date of this production, it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult and needleſs to aſcertain the excluſive meaning of that portion of it, which is prefixed to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035443_0005_10049A8CD1E36C08"/>
this diſcourſe. Combining, therefore, in ſome ſort, its various ſenſes abovementioned, we will conſider the text as giving us the two-fold leſſon of <hi>piety</hi> and the uſe of <hi>arms.</hi> Let us examine the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both in the light of means, by which a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may retain its liberties, and defend its rights againſt unjuſt enemies.</p>
            <p>I. We will obſerve the tendency of national piety. It conduces to the obſervance of religious inſtitutions, to perſonal virtue, to the diſcharge of relative duties, and to the publick order, union, and proſperity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A principle of piety in a people induces its obſervance of religious inſtitutions. The heart, that is warmed with the admiration and love of the divine perfections, honours the means of moral improvement. If revelation had taught to her diſciples no forms of worſhip, which nature had not ſuggeſted to her children, the ſervant of God would ſtill have ſought in ſociety an enlargement of religious affections, which the ſecreſy and ſilence of his cloſet could hardly create. His benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, too, the offſpring of piety, would have led him to provide for the inſtruction and conſolation of creatures ignorant, weak, and dependent like himſelf. But now that the authority of religious ordinances is known to be divine; now that the law hath been diſpenſed by Moſes, and grace and truth have beamed upon mankind in the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, the man of piety is the obſerver of publick worſhip, not merely on account of its reaſonableneſs and utility, but from a principle of regard to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:035443_0006_1004C9DCE4E772E0"/>
Imagine now, my hearers, a whole community attending on the inſtitutions of religion from a principle of piety. What auguſt and influential notions do they hence receive of the object of their praiſes! What a ſenſe of mutual obligations and dependence; and what motives to relieve, to ſtrengthen, to defend, to bleſs ſociety! Indeed, whence but from religious inſtitutions can that portion of knowledge be derived to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of a ſtate, which is abſolutely eſſential to the maintenance of its liberties? Accordingly the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian of elder times and the obſerver of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent age uniformly report, that where the inſtitutes of chriſtianity have been moſt intelligibly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly reverenced, there liberty has dwelt with the greateſt ſecurity and pleaſure. Yes, ye deſpots of the earth, and ye, who cruelly invade the rights of mankind, it is undoubtedly your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to overturn the altar, and unhallow the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, becauſe the aſhes of theſe rites produce an ignorance, which will foſter your crimes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A principle of piety promotes perſonal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. As there can be no genuine religion without morality, ſo there is no ſafe morality without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. If morals are the lamp, the fear of God is the oil, which muſt give it a ſtrong and uniform luſtre. Regard to temporary health, tranquillity, and honour, forms, of itſelf, a character of imperfect goodneſs. On the other hand, reſpect to the will, and reference to the perpetual notice of the Deity, juſt views of his benevolence and purity, and a ſenſe of accountableneſs to him at the final judgment of the world, deeply imprinted in the ſoul, tend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035443_0007_1004C9DF7B520518"/>
to the ſanctification and exaltation of man. Becauſe he ſees ſuſpended over his head the ſword of retributive juſtice, he avoids anger, pride, and inordinate pleaſures; and he practiſes meekneſs and moderation, temperance and induſtry, becauſe, by the appointment of God, they are connected with eternal joys. Thus, a ſentiment of religion, whilſt it commands the will, enliſteth alſo the affections in the cauſe of virtue.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible here not to ſee the connexion between piety, and the political ſtrength and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If the citizens of a ſtate were univerſally pious, their labours and diligence would procure them wealth, whilſt their wealth would not be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by luxury, and the conſequent reign of the malevolent paſſions. <hi>Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your luſts, that war in your members?</hi> In a country, where private virtue is remitted proportionally to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the common opulence and grandeur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal competitions and ſtrife will certainly ariſe: theſe the ambitious of neighbouring ſtates will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy and point againſt its liberties, whilſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted citizens, enervated by indolence and vice, have only to chooſe between an inglorious death, and a life of ſervitude and repentance. It is piety, then, which, by promoting the virtue of individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, operates the ſalvation and happineſs of the community.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is piety, that excites a performance of relative duties. A moment's reflection informs every man, even in younger life, that he was not made ſolely for himſelf. He ſees his ſocial obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035443_0008_1004C9E2015F1EB8"/>
multiply with his years. His friend, his brother, his countryman, the ſtranger, all prefer him their claims. Is a principle of ſelf-gratification, of vanity, family-pride, or thirſt of diſtinction, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways competent to their diſcharge? The hiſtory of infidels and atheiſts proves the truth of the negative. Ungoverned by a principle of piety, the affluent and powerful will be inſolent and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive; the weak and dependent will be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and mutinous. Where motives of worldly intereſt and fame are ſuffered to hold the ſupreme rule, elevation of rank will be uſed merely to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify and control. The ſervant will tremble in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual apprehenſion of his lord's diſpleaſure, and the lord will be equally ſuſpicious of the ſervant's treachery. There will be a conſtant war among all claſſes of ſociety. Caprice and paſſion will break aſunder the ties of conſanguinity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and no bands will be found ſufficiently ſtrong, by which the moſt ſolemn and lovely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions in human life can be ſaved from diſſolution.</p>
            <p>Religion, on the contrary, ſtrengthens every tie, and fortifies every obligation.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a favourite idea of the celebrated Neckar. It is, in ſhort, the vital principle of his book "On the Importance of Religious Opinions."</note> It inſpires condeſcenſion and gentleneſs in the great, and clothes the powerful with the ſweet and reſiſtleſs charms of kindneſs. It helps the lowly cottager to ſuſtain the inferiority of his ſtation; the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent priſoner, the weight of his chains; and the wretched of every name, the burden of his woes; by preſenting to their full view the providence and agency of God; and by putting, in the place
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035443_0009_1004C9E38B4E3210"/>
of their feelings, a lively faith, that the virtues of ſubmiſſion and contentment are deſtined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne them in the kingdom of heaven. Mutual confidence is thus cheriſhed amid all ranks in the ſtate. Every citizen faithfully diſcharges his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective truſt; and from the conſtant tribute, which flows to the commonwealth from individual honeſty and domeſtick continence, her <hi>peace becomes as a river, and her righteouſneſs as the waves of the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Still more particularly and directly does a pious principle contribute to the publick order, union, and proſperity. It is this, which binds the ſubject to the governour. Without government, there can be no order in civil ſociety; without oaths, there can be no government; without piety, oaths have neither uſe nor meaning. It is, therefore, in religion, that the ruled finds the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antee of his rights. Convince him that there is no God, or, which is much the ſame, that he does not govern and judge the world in righteouſneſs, and you ſubvert his faith in the ruler. He will no longer willingly ſubmit to the reſtraints of power; he is at once prepared for inſurrection and pillage.</p>
            <p>It is the ſame principle, likewiſe, that obliges the magiſtrate to the ſubject. It places him beneath the immediate and perpetual cognizance of the king of kings. It arreſts him in every project of perſonal aggrandizement to the detriment of the citizen. It confines his ſtudies and toil to the general good.</p>
            <p>Hence the peaceful reign of law and order in the ſtate, the cement of national union, and the multiplication of reſources againſt the common danger. In no way can a ſtate realize theſe bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035443_0010_1004C9E61B3197F8"/>
and enjoy its liberties, except by diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the governour, obedience in the private citizen, obſervance of publick faith, and a prompt execution of juſtice; except, in ſhort, by national piety.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the frequent recurrence to antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on this ſubject is always juſtified, by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of proofs it furniſhes, of the riſe and glory of empires by righteouſneſs, and of their declenſion and downfal by wickedneſs. It ſhould be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither puerile nor pedantick in the moraliſt, when he tells us, that the ravages of impiety and luxury were more injurious to the Romans, than thoſe of Pyrrhus or Hannibal; and that vice was the ruin of the Grecian ſtates. Eſpecially does the page of Jewiſh hiſtory preſent to our view, in a luminous and impreſſive manner the influence and effects of piety on the Hebrew nation.

            <p>Wherefore it is a juſt and ſafe concluſion, that the piety of a people is one important and happy

means of its defence; that it directly ſerves its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wealth, population, order, and union; and that, as eminent virtue ſpreads a glory round indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals to the ſhame and dread of their enemies, ſo the righteouſneſs of a community erects, as it were, a wall of fire between it and its foes.</p>
            <p>Such, nevertheleſs, my hearers, is the diſjointed ſtate of morals in our world, ſuch the reſtleſs am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of man, corrupted by the love and poſſeſſion of power, that not even innocence and piety are ſecure from his depredating and oppreſſive hand. The devotion and beneficence of Elijah did not ſhield him from the perſecution of Ahab; nor did the ſanctity of the reverend Baptiſt divert the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the Galilean tetrarch. States, too, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſpoliations of ſtates; and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whoſe only defence is virtue, is ſometimes the prey of violence from an unprincipled power.</p>
            <p>In its patriotick addreſſes, therefore, the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian pulpit, contrary to its pacifick character, is compelled to be the advocate of arms, as well as of piety. <hi>Let the high praiſes of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged ſword in their hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. That there are caſes, in which both private and publick war is conſidered juſt on the principles of natural and revealed religion, is the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ethical writers.<note n="*" place="bottom">See eſpecially Hutcheſon and Paley.</note> How would the rights of the individual be deemed ſafe, if the thief might rob, and the aſſaſſin murder, him with impunity? If no violence were ſuffered to inflict puniſhment on the one, and extort reſtitution from the other, what value would be attached to property, or what
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035443_0012_1004C9E942571B18"/>
comfort to life? Unprotected from the rapacity of the covetous, and the rude blaſts of calumny, and unrecompenſed by the court of juſtice, the boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bleſſings of civilized man would be all an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Contraſted with his condition, that of the hermit, or of the ſavage, would be every way eligible.</p>
            <p>As long, therefore, as the diſſocial paſſions ſhall poiſon and convulſe ſociety, the civil ruler muſt be ordained to arreſt and reclaim diſturbers of the peace. Even the diſciple of the friendly Penn, if he would ſee the government effectual to its ends, muſt provide for its exigencies, and put a ſword into the hand of the magiſtrate. For what is command without power, or law without pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty?</p>
            <p>War between ſtates is juſtified for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which make it righteous between individuals. If the publick enemy of a country will not be gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by the rules of eternal order, nor by laws eſtabliſhed by the common conſent of nations; if he is neither awed into a pacifick temper by the luſtrous example of piety and meekneſs in the community he ſeeks to oppreſs, nor diſarmed of malice by its conciliatory propoſals, the intended victim of plunder and ſlavery may religiouſly arm in defence of its rights. Indeed an application of the principles of force is here publick ſpirited and humane. Tyrants of the world ſhould be taught to reſpect the liberties of their fellowmen; and their deſtruction in one age ſhould inſcribe a ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary leſſon on the page of hiſtory for ſucceeding oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:035443_0013_1004C9EEAA6D4848"/>
However, then, the pity and ſighs of the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart may be excited, from contemplating the horrible effects of war, we are obliged, under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances, to view an armed aſſociation one of the moſt neceſſary engines of ſtate. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborative of this ſentiment is the language of the ſcriptures, which thus animates the pious to reſiſt their inſulting and tyrannick foes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be of good courage,<note place="margin">2 Sam. x. 12.</note> and let us play the men for our people, and the cities of our God. Be ſtrong and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous,<note place="margin">2 Chron. xxxii. 7,8.</note> be not afraid nor diſmayed: for there be more with us than with him. With him is an arm of fleſh; but with us is the Lord our God, to help us, and to fight our battles.<note place="margin">Pſalm cxliv. 1.</note> Bleſſed be the Lord, my ſtrength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt we pay homage to the ancient revelations of the Deity, let us not be underſtood to militate with his more valuable diſpenſation by the great Reformer of mankind. We vindicate no war, which is not the legitimate offſpring of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; none, incompatible with any ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the precept, <hi>Reſiſt not evil;</hi> none, which embraces other objects, than ſuch a reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the injured ſtate, as ſhall inhibit future aggreſſions; none, in which a chriſtian country cannot conſiſtently appeal to the ſovereign arbiter of nations for the rectitude of its cauſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide the iſſue to his juſt deciſion.</p>
            <p>Hence, although national piety alone muſt be deemed an inſufficient defence of national right, in the preſent condition of humanity, it is yet infinitely preferable to a military ſyſtem altogether ſupported by ſelfiſhneſs and violence. Ruthleſs

ravagers of our race are they, who levy war for the ſake of widening their territory, and filling their coffers. Execrable plagues of mankind are they, who find an occaſion for their arms in the internal diſſenſions, or defenceleſs frontier of a neutral power, or who, for the ſake of connecting their names<note n="*" place="bottom">Read a rhapſody of Buonaparte in one of his letters to a friend.</note> with memorable events, lay waſte the dwellings of the juſt.</p>
            <p>The war of ſuch heroes is like the fury of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary cannibals, and the rage of the hungry ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Nay, it is impolitick. Their two edged ſwords muſt finally prove fatal to themſelves, as well as the people they ſpoil. After being, for a while, diſturbed by their outrages, the world will riſe and complete the repreſſion of their arrogance. So ſtrongly impreſſed on the human heart is a ſenſe of equity, and ſo happily is this ſentiment improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diffuſion of religious knowledge, that the time approaches, when the abolition of tyranny ſhall be conſidered the common cauſe of God and of man.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if a ſyſtem of national defence, wholly pacifick, be ineffectual to the general ſafety, through want of force and arms, a nation of ſoldiers is doomed to a tranſient exiſtence, from a deficiency of religious principle. The unarmed ſaint is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a defenceleſs dove, the almoſt certain prey of the ravenous hawk; but the impious warrior is a deſtructive ſerpent, whoſe head, inheriting the univerſal odium, will eventually be bruiſed.</p>
            <p>So then piety is a defence, and arms are a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but ſince neither, ſingly, will enable a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035443_0015_1004C9F2B433B178"/>

               <p n="1">1. If the preceding remarks have a foundation in truth, let them inſtruct us, my fellow citizens, in theſe eventful times. Probably at no period of her exiſtence, could our country have exhorted her ſons with greater propriety, than ſhe now can exhort them, to the exerciſe of arms. For a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years paſt, we have ſeen a powerful nation in Europe, evidently actuated by principles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and unrighteouſneſs, making war upon a great part of the civilized world. With a force of conqueſt, ſcarcely paralleled in any former age, the French Republick has diffuſed death and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces throughout all Europe. Its arms have made Germany a field of battle: they have overtured the republicks of Venice and Geneva, and waſted their beautiful provinces: they have vanquiſhed and plundered Italy: they have put the yoke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Spain: they have rent in pieces the kingdom of Naples: they have drained Holland of its wealth, have ſpoiled Switzerland of its liberties and its glory, and have, in fact, left to no country, they have aſſailed, ought but its moans. What is more intereſting, and juſtly alarming, to us, through each act of this ſanguinary drama in Europe, the emiſſaries of France have been erecting their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard in this land of neutrality, and on theſe, alas,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035443_0016_1004C9F44E04EDA0"/>
too hoſpitable ſhores, digging the grave of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can liberty!</p>
               <p>Columbian warriors! where are your ſwords? If with theſe facts and examples before your eyes, you permit them to ruſt in their ſcabbards, where is the expatriated Swiſs, or impoveriſhed Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, what ſhade of your fathers, who fell on Bunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's heights, or bled on the plains of Yorktown, who will not pronounce you unworthy the joys of freedom!</p>
               <p>But I forget that the United States has mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled her armies, and is prepared for her inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foe. God be praiſed, my countrymen, that we learn wiſdom from hiſtory and obſervation; that the Eye and Light and Strong Rod of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath developed the hoſtile machinations of France, pointed to the means of their defeat, and already ſcourged the Directory in its own cabinet; that our armament on the ſeas is protecting our commerce and adding to the naval diſgrace of the common enemy; that our troops are gathering from every corner of the Union to the accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed banners of the hoary Chief, whoſe ſingle name commands the faith and courage of every Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſoldier; and that our political proſpects are opening with brighter hopes, as a reward for the pious and manly efforts of our country to <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty, wherewith ſhe has been made free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us not, however, be deceived by ſpecious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. The fate of the unhappy Swiſs Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons continually awakens our ſad remembrance. Seven long years was France in diſſolving the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetick

If, in the ſame ſpace of time, ſhe has not been equally ſucceſsful in accompliſhing her deſigns againſt the United States, let the truth inſpirit, not relax, our perſeverance in thoſe meaſures, which, under the guidance of heaven, have thus far baffled her views. Whilſt we continue our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the divine providence, let us proceed to burniſh our arms and fortify our ſhores. The moſt correct information our country can furniſh<note n="†" place="bottom">Late proclamation for U. S.

It yet views our lands with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and our independence with rage. In ſuch a political juncture, every meaſure, which prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes the ſmalleſt ſupport to the government or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the ſtate, and eſpecially every armed eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, is unſpeakably eſtimable.</p>
               <p>In this point of view, therefore, gentlemen of the ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE ARTIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LERY COMPANY, we exult in the continued exiſtence of your inſtitution. We have loved and applauded your patriotiſm in the days of peace; but, in this hour of national danger, we honour and revere you. Permit us to hope, that a military college, which, for nearly two centuries, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the glory of Maſſachuſetts, and whoſe ſons, in times we well remember, have fought the battles of their country, will, by no means, in the preſent criſis, forget the purpoſes of its creation.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, Sirs, conformably to the ſpirit of our miniſtry, we wiſh you to conſider thoſe

arms, as the ſad emblems of an unnatural and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved ſtate of ſociety. Under this impreſſion, you will bear them not with pride, but reluctance, and will conſider the neceſſity of their aſſumption as a ſource of humiliation, and not of glory, to you in common with our kind. Hence, let your ambition direct itſelf to the attainment and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that piety, which we preach, and which, when univerſally practiſed, will render your ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance needleſs, and reſtore the order of our earth. You will thus be our permanent honour, as well as preſent defence. Your contemporaries will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek your virtues as their model, and your ſtandard as their protection. And, having lived with <hi>the praiſes of God in your mouths, and the ſword in your hands,</hi> a juſt and grateful poſterity ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe upon your tombs, Theſe are the men who died for their country.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our military brethren form not the only claſs, to which the ſubject applies itſelf. On the duties of piety, it addreſſes a meek, but ſolemn, leſſon to all our fellow-citizens. The rulers of France have not only ſought the wreck of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, but of the moral world. After profaning the temples in Europe, they have come hither alſo with their ſacrilege. On this ſide the Atlantick they have brought their artillery of deſtruction to the ſoul, their books, principles, vices. This is the cruel war they levy upon our churches, our religion, our Saviour, and our God. Theſe are the weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherewith they attack our families, our cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, our very boſoms; ſeeking to deſpoil us of the dear hope of immortality, and to darken that heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035443_0019_1004C9FCCEB87A78"/>
ſplendour, which hath irradiated the priſon of death.</p>
               <p>Happy for our country, had this war upon our worthieſt affections and hopes been as ſucceſſleſs, as that upon our civil privileges! The fact is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Chriſtians, you ſee its ravages in that dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of moral obligation, which characterizes a part of our citizens. Sabbatical inſtitutions, whoſe obſervance was once the praiſe of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have, in many places, received a wound, which will bleed before the eyes of all the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The houſes of publick worſhip, venerable from their appropriation, and endeared to our feelings from the conſtant viſits of our pious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, begin to be neglected, and the holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of pure chriſtianity to be contemned. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly do you ſee the triumphs of Gallick infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in that factious and diſorganizing ſpirit, which has ſtalked through the United States for the purpoſe of deſtroying our confidence in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Federal government, and of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the government itſelf. For ſtill we are obliged to aſſert the connexion between religious rituals, and the life of liberty. Our enemy well knows, that the <hi>amiable tabernacles of the Lord of hoſts</hi> are the only ſanctuary of the people's rights; that chriſtianity is the very temple of freedom; and that the deſpotiſm he adores cannot exiſt with <hi>the high praiſes of God.</hi> It is therefore he meets us on our ſacred ground. It is thence he aims at us his deadly weapons, <hi>weapons, not</hi> indeed <hi>carnal, but mighty through</hi> a vain philoſophy, <hi>to the pulling down of the ſtrong holds</hi> of virtue, <hi>caſting down</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035443_0020_1004CA014F764850"/>
of piety, <hi>and every thing that exalteth itſelf againſt</hi> diſorder, <hi>and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of</hi> the devil.</p>
               <p>Whoever, hence, in this war with atheiſts, will acknowledge the being, and celebrate the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of God, is a real patriot; and who, in this conteſt with infidels, will be <hi>a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhall have the honour of warring for his country. Here is a warfare, Americans, in which we all may engage advantageouſly; ſo eaſily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as to admit recruits without diſtinction of age or ſex, and yet ſo neceſſary, as that, without its ſupport, all other means of defence are nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>In vain is it for you, legiſlators, to levy taxes, and eſtabliſh armies, for the ſafety of the republick, if we, the ſubjects, by our luxuries and ſloth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the political body.</p>
               <p>Vain is it for you, faithful ſoldiers, to hazard your lives in the field, whilſt we, the citizens, by our diſunion at home, act in union with the enemy.</p>
               <p>And ye miniſters of religion, you may as well keep cloſed, as open, your churches, if we, your pretended hearers, expend that day in ſcenes of voluptuouſneſs, which is conſecrated to religious improvement. It is no longer needful for you to teach us the divine philoſophy of Jeſus Chriſt, your maſter, which was deſigned to make us the happy citizens of both earth and heaven, if we ſuffer the Voltaires and Volneys of our age to deſtroy our uſefulneſs in this world, and to terminate our hopes at the ſepulchre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:035443_0021_1004CA04D4F1F040"/>
Deſcendants of a brave and pious race, let us, therefore, univerſally reſolve to be the defenders and ſaviours of our country, by the devout obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of religious inſtitutions, by the practice of that perſonal virtue, which ennobles the human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and adorns the chriſtian profeſſion, by ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully diſcharging our relative duties, and by ſeeking with a ſteady and enlightened zeal the publick order and felicity.</p>
               <p>Thus, although we may fail of conquering our earthly enemies, we yet ſhall be victorious over foes infinitely more dangerous, I mean our vices; and though unſucceſsful in defending the country, which gave us birth, we ſhall, nevertheleſs, be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of poſſeſſing <hi>another and a better country, even an heavenly,</hi> where the <hi>high praiſes of God</hi> will <hi>be in</hi> every <hi>mouth, and</hi> the uſe of the <hi>ſword</hi> will be no more known.</p>
