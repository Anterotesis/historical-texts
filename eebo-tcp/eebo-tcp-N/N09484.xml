            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF the Publication of the following Letter needs any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy at all, I think it needs but a very ſhort one. For as there are many Chriſtians who practice Infant Baptiſm, not by the force of humane Tradition, but Conſcienciouſly upon a Scripture Warrant, as their Minds have been lead to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scriptures—So both Reaſon and Religion allow of the Publication and Manifeſtation of the ſame for the Benefit of others: which is the Deſign of the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and not merely to oppoſe, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I TRUST I may ſay truly, without nauſeous ſawning, or criminal flattery, by a little acquaintance with your perſon, and more with your writings, that I look upon it that you are favoured with ſome excellent endowments of mind, with a good and rare raſent, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in writing; and that for the moſt part your pen has been employed in the cauſe of truth—Yet however, I obſerve ſome things in your writings which brings an ancient but true obſervation to my mind, viz. <hi>That the beſt of men, are but men at the beſt.</hi>—Therefore, ſir, take it not ill if I point you to one or two of thoſe ſpots with my pen, ſince I can aſſure you I do not write with a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or diſpoſition to contradict, much leſs to diſguſt you or any of your baptiſt brethren, tho' I know not but this may be the event But the aim I have in view, (however <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eeble the effort may be) is, by the divine bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to endeavour to reſcue ſome injured truths, which have ſuffered abuſe by your pen.—And under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I undertake it chearfully, but upon ſome other accounts it is with reluctance. For having had the hap to dip a little in one or two public controverſies in time paſt, I have of late almoſt come to a determination to let polemic ſubjects alone, (unleſs where the eſſentials of religion are controverted) and leave diſputes to other people, who have more pleaſure and better ſkill therein than I, and higher expectations of doing good thereby. —Diſputes ſeem of late to be almoſt fruitleſs as well as endleſs; and the more work of this nature there is done,

            <p>But, ſir, in reading your anſwer to Mr. F—'s letter in favour of infant baptiſm, I confeſs you have drawn me a little out from my ſtate of neutrality; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I cannot be quite eaſy (however catholick) to ſee things gloſs'd ſmoothly, and then put off for truth, which are not.— However, being ſo very averſe to write upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I ſhould not have meddled with it, had you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected one thing in handling the controverſy, and that is, you ſay, <hi>That in order to maintain infant baptiſm, we conſtrue and interpret the new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſtament by the old, and the old by the new,</hi> (p. 58). Now this was ſo directly the reverſe of the truth reſpecting my eſtabliſhment in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of infant baptiſm, that I could not be eaſy, nor anſwer a good conſcience herein, to let it paſs unnotic'd. And as it was the new teſtament interpretation of the old that gave me an eſtabliſhment concerning infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; ſo I am ready to think, that if the baptiſts would
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012076_0003_0F8993DF73976D90"/>ſuffer the new teſtament interpretation of the old, to take place in their underſtandings, with their wills ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the light of truth in this particular, they would eaſily ſee more grounds for the warrant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm than now they can; for while they have a different way to interpret the old teſtament, from the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interpretation thereof, it neceſla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ly hides the truth, and the binding force of it from their minds, in this particular. And hence they peremtorily conclude that there is nothing in the ſcripture to warrant infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm becauſe they in theſe circumſtances can't ſee it; but I can't allow this to be demonſtration—I ſuppoſe that it is very probable, the ſolid and judicious among the bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then I began to take the ideas, as well as words, concerning the grounds of infant baptiſm. And my mind, I truſt, was led into the nature and ſpirituality of the vailed diſpenſation. There appeared then, more goſpel, more grace, and more glory under the ancient and typical diſpenſation, than ever I ſaw before, or any baptiſt author I ever read, would allow.

And, ſir, when Mr. F. in his letter in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of infant baptiſm, is ſpeaking of that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God made, or renewed with Abraham in the 17th of Gen. He ſays, <q>altho' we don't read the word, Chriſt, nor grace, nor faith, nor new covenant,</q> yet he ſuppoſes that all this was implied, and that Chriſt and all his benefits were contain'd therein.

            <p>But to proceed, Now as I ſaid, it was the new teſtament interpretation of the old, that was the means which gave my mind the firſt eſtabliſhment in favour of infant baptiſm, when I had been long heſitating there about.

I. <hi>Of God's Covenant with Abraham,</hi> which we find the firſt diſcovery of in 12th chap. of Gen. where God called Abraham and bleſſed him, and promiſed Canaan. And in the 15th ch. of Gen. we find the covenant renewed, a numerous ſeed promiſed, and a renewed promiſe of Canaan. And in the 17th ch. the covenant was renewed with Abraham again, and more explicit in ſome things; circumciſion inſtituted, directions given for the forming his family into a church-ſtate. And hence an external form of adminiſtration of the covenant commenced according to divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Now this covenant which God was pleaſed, out of ſelf-moving love, to take Abraham into with himſelf, I call the covenant of grace, containing ſpiritual bleſſings, with ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form of adminiſtration thereof, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, as God in his infinite wiſdom and ſovereignty ſaw fit to appoint.—For illuſtration, I ſuppoſe you will allow, that under the goſpel diſpenſation, where God takes a man ſavingly into covenant with himſelf, there are ſome externals, called <hi>privileges</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> annexed, and that theſe are included in, and belong to the external admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the covenant of grace, under the goſpel diſpenſation. So in the covenant with Abraham, there was certain duties and privileges annexed therewith, and belonged to the external adminiſtration of the covenant of grace, under that ancient diſpenſation; which were thankfully to be acknowledged, and chearfully and punctually complied with, until God ſhould pleaſe to add thereto, more rites and ceremonies, or take them
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012076_0006_0F8993E1B3A23748"/>all away, which were merely poſitive, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point new ones at his pleaſure. And yet in every period we are to acknowlege the covenant of grace, altho' under a different form of external adminiſtration.—The Abrahamatical form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while.—At the Sinai diſpenſation, the moral law was promulgated, and all the rites of the ceremonial law were added to the external form of the adminiſtration of the covenant of grace, until the goſpel day commenced, and the form of adminiſtration was altered.</p>
            <p>But now let us look and ſee how the new teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament interprets God's covenant with Abraham. I find Paul is ſpeaking directly of this covenant with Abraham, Gal. 3.17, 18. <hi>And this I ſay, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the promiſe of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promiſe: But God gave it to Abraham by promiſe.</hi> Here the covenant with Abraham is ſaid to be confirmed in Chriſt, and the inheritance given to him by promiſe. But what inheritance? why the heavenly inheritance, which is not obtain'd by the works of the law, but by free grace. But when did God give the inheritance to Abraham by promiſe? why in the promiſe of Canaan. Again, the new teſtament tells us Rom. 4.3. <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteouſneſs.</hi> Now if here was faith, imputed righteouſneſs, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication without works, and ſo Abraham had not whereof to glory before God, as the apoſtle ſhews
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012076_0006_0F8993E1B3A23748"/>in this chapter, then it muſt certainly be the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> covenant of works knows of no faith in a mediator, no imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no juſtification without works. And to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the good carried in the promiſe of the covenant, which God took Abraham into, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted ſolely, or principally, in the temporal good of the type expreſſed, is to contradict the new teſtament explaination of that covenant, and of the good contained in it, in theſe following chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which you may read at your leiſure, viz. Rom. 4. Gal. 3. Heb. 11. Luke 1.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee whether your interpretation of Abraham's covenant agrees with the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interpretation of it; and I think I find it don't You muſt not expect, in a letter ſo ſhort as I intend this to be, that I make a collection of the baptiſt authors in general, and cite their words upon the point; for if you are as ſound and as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, in the point, as they be in general, then your words may be cited as a ſpecimen of their general notion, about Abraham's covenant. You ſay, pag. 53, <q>The tenor of Abraham's covenant enjoins conditions and works to be performed by men; the neglect of which expoſed them to be cut off from their people.—Therefore the letter of it was <hi>do and live.</hi>
               </q> Here ſir, are your words, but I don't know what you really think Abraham's covenant was, notwithſtanding. Mr. F. ſaid it was the covenant of grace, but you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him in that, and mean to contradict him, which is evident to every one who reads your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. And to me it is evident you contradict the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012076_0007_0F8993E2747C5B08"/>new teſtament interpretation of it, whether you mean it or no. You deſcribe the covenant with Abraham juſt as the beſt of divines do the covenant of works made with innocent man, or Adam before the fall, <hi>do and live.</hi> And the ſcripture deſcribes that ancient covenant of works, or the moral law as a covenant, in the ſame manner, <hi>He that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> Well then, if you mean ſo, that is, if you mean as you ſay, that the tenor and letter of Abraham's covenant was <hi>works,</hi> do and live, then one of theſe things will certainly follow, viz that either, 1ſt. One man is gone to heaven by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, ſince the fall. Or, 2dly, Abraham is damned; for he never had a better covenant to go to heaven by than this. The language of it was, <hi>I will be thy God;</hi> and Paul ſays this covenant was confirmed in Chriſt. But if you don't mean Adam's ſevere covenant of works, <hi>do and live,</hi> requiring perfect holineſs as the condition of life, but ſome more mild and moderate covenant of works, and yet diſtinct in its nature from the covenant of grace, I don't think it worth while to ſpend time to talk about it: for if ſuch a covenant ever exiſted any where, 'twas but in men's imagination, for you never found ſuch a covenant in Geneſis; nor from there to the end of the Revelations. But let us examine the force of your argument a little: You ſay, Abraham's covenant enjoins conditions and works to be perform'd by men; the neglect of which expoſed them to be cut off from their people. Now by this argument you think to prove that the covenant with Abraham was not the covenant of grace, but of works. But ſir, your argument proves too much for you, and ſo juſt nothing at all. Your argument, if it was allowed to take place, would deny that God now under the goſpel takes his church into the covenant of grace, but the church is now form'd upon the covenant of works, <hi>do and live,</hi> for I truſt that you yourſelf will not deny but that in the external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the covenant of grace, even under the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012076_0007_0F8993E2747C5B08"/>goſpel diſpenſation, God enjoins duties and works to be perform'd by men, thro' grace influencing, as a condition of a viſible ſtanding and continuance in God's viſible church, the neglect of which now expoſes them to be cut off from God's people by ſolemn excommunication; and dying without repentance, muſt be cut off by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation; and what do you find more condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, awful, and ſevere in Abraham's covenant?—I grant that in the covenant of redemption, or if it ſuits you better, the covenant of grace, as it was made with Chriſt in the behalf of the elect, Chriſt only was to perform the condition of their ſalvation, by obeying the law, and ſuffering the penalty thereof, in their room and ſtead. And I allow that there were no works done by ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or foreſeen, as the condition of election, but election was free, ſovereign and abſolute. I alſo allow further, that that faith, by which one is united to Chriſt, and by which the believer is ſaid to be juſtified, is the free gift of God, and no previous conditions are performed by men, as procuring a right and title to that grace.—But yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, I think I have a ſcripture warrant to ſay, that in the goſpel declarations, and the external adminiſtration of the covenant of grace, there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions propoſed and required. Salvation is promiſed in the goſpel, to mankind in general, on the conditions of faith and repentance; and thoſe who don't through grace, come up to theſe conditions, are threatned with eternal damnation. So there are certain qualifications required, and duties to be performed, as a condition now, as well as in Abraham's day, of having a ſtanding and continuance in God's viſible church. And what if you ſhould now take the external adminiſtration of the covenant of grace, under the goſpel diſpenſation, which requires conditions, enjoins duties, annexes penalties, &amp;c. and call it a covenant by itſelf, diſtinct in its nature from the covenant of grace, even the covenant of works; would not this be a vile abaſe of the covenant of grace?
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012076_0008_0F8993E332E7A978"/>to rob it of its external form of adminiſtration thus? and yet this would be to do, but juſt as you have done, by the covenant of grace, under a different form of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, while you ſay that the covenant with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham was the covenant of works. Becauſe of duties and penalties annexed. But you attempt to give ſome further light about Abraham's covenant, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſome further proof that it was not the covenant of grace, by an ther particular way of deſcribing of it in the ſame 53. p. When you had been conſidering that in the 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God had enjoined circumciſion in the fleſh upon Abraham and his male children, then you add, <q>And God ſaid to Abraham, <hi>My covenant ſhall be in your fleſh.</hi> While he ſays in the new covenant, <hi>I will put my laws in their mind, and will write them in their hearts.</hi>
               </q> Here is your pretended illuſtration of the difference between Abraham's covenant, and the new covenant, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. One is in the fleſh, and the other is in the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I aſk, what is this darkning counſel for with words without knowlege? You in this ſame page ſpeak of the ſeal of Abraham's covenant, and call cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion the ſeal of it. And baptiſt authors abundantly ſay, to cut off infants from baptiſm, that circumciſion was a ſeal of the covenant of works. Now it is eaſy to ſee that a covenant, and the ſeal of it, are two things; the ſeal may be conſidered as a token and confirmation of the covenant, but not the covenant itſelf. But you ſeem to try to make it appear that Abraham's covenant was circumciſion itſelf, and ſo oppoſite to, or at leaſt diſtinct from the covenant of grace.

Abraham, he then adds, <hi>And it ſhall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.</hi> Here obſerve, there was firſt a covenant ſubſiſting between God and Abraham, and ſecondarily a ſeal, ſign, or token of that covenant, which was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: and not that circumciſion itſelf was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as you try to inſinuate. Here was ſuch plain ground to go upon, that it ſeems you could not have ſtumbled, and made this blunder, had you not took pains for it, or tho't to have ſerved a turn by it. But I ſay Abraham's covenant has the language of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace expreſly carried in it. Gen. 17.7 8. Where God ſays, <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant betwixt me and thee, and thy ſeed aſter thee, &amp;c.</hi> But what does he mean? why he adds, to be a God unto thee and to thy ſeed after thee. Now when God ſays by way of covenant, I will be thy God,
<note n="†" place="bottom">I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed after thee, ſays the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, in the promiſe of his gracious covenant with Abraham. But you ſay, and other baptiſt authors, that this was not the covenant of grace, and ſpiritual bleſſings are not included in this promiſe: But only externally God would be their God. But ſir, by this way of treating God's covenant and promiſe therein, you make me think of your own marginal note, where you give an account of what paſt in converſation that you had ſome knowlege of once, when a man ſaid he believed that one might ſincerely keep God's law externally, out of regard to an idol: which being pinched a little by queſtions, his opinion, in the nature of it, amounted to this, viz. that a graceleſs man, or worſhipper of idols, might <hi>love God with all his heart, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</hi> But ſuch an inconſiſtent profeſſion you ſeem'd well to think, might be jeer'd out of the world. But I query whether this opinion is not full as inconſiſtent. That when God ſaid to Abraham, <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed,</hi> that ſpiritual bleſſings were not meant; but only that God would be their God externally, and that this was the good contain'd in the promiſe. Then according to this there is juſt about as much ſincerity, reality and propriety in it, as there is in one's loving God with all the heart, externally.</note> or I will be their God,

And altho' theſe ſpiritual bleſſings were not ſo open, and clear, and explicit as they are in the goſpel-day, yet as truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; for as we before noted, this covenant was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of God in Chriſt. But the baptiſt often object, and think they may triumph in ſo doing, that if that covenant with Abraham, wherein God ſays, <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed after thee,</hi> was the covenant of grace; and if believers now under the goſpel ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to God by the ſame covenant, for the ſubſtance of it, and are under the ſame promiſe, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> as we plead for, and pretend. I ſay, the baptiſt often object and ſay, why don't we then ſee the promiſe fulfilled? Why were not all Abraham's children converted, and ſaved? And why are not all the children of believers now under the goſpel, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſaved? if this be the covenant of grace, and ſpiritual bleſſings are contain'd in the promiſe?</p>

            <p>But then obſerve, as I noted before, how Abraham's covenant is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e conſidered, viz. That it was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, containing ſpiritual bleſſings in the promiſe, with ſuch an external form of adminiſtration thereof as God in his wiſdom and ſovereignty he ſaw fit to appoint. And that you may not miſtake me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will explain myſelf a little further. Doubtleſs you will allow it to be poſſible, if not in fact the caſe, that God may, in a way of ſovereign grace, take a man ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly into covenant with himſelf from the midſt of an heathen land, convey grace into his heart, bring him into union to Chriſt, grant him communion with God here, in this world, and eternal life hereafter; and ſave him by Chriſt, in the way of free grace; and yet never bring him under any external adminiſtration of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, bring him into no viſible church, of any form of conſtitution, give him no external ſeals or ordinances, of a poſſitive nature, &amp;c. And if God in his wiſdom and ſovereignty had ſeen fit to call in all his elect in this wiſe, by the ſecret influences of his Spirit, and never had appointed any external form of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to the covenant of grace at all: Muſt not all creatures have yielded that God had a right to act his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012076_0010_0F8993E5C236C5C0"/>pleaſure? when it was his own free grace he was going to beſtow? Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n't he do what he will with his own? and as to the method, take what way he pleaſes?</p>
            <p>But we find God has not always took that method of calling in his elect, if he did ever; but has been pleaſed to appoint an external form of adminiſtration of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace. And ſurely God was at liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what this form ſhould be, whether it ſhould be always alike, or whether it ſhould differ in various peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of the church, the latter of which we find to be his will. Now one of theſe external forms of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the covenant of grace, which was to continue a certain period in the church, God was pleaſed to give to Abraham. For when God took Abraham ſavingly into covenant with himſelf, and determined a viſible and outward diſpenſation of the covenant of grace ſhould appear, he had a right alſo to determine whether any but Abraham, and ſuch as with him had ſaving faith, ſhould have any concern herein, or privilege hereby; and in way of ſovereignty God was pleaſed to connect Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's children with Abraham himſelf, in the external adminiſtration of his gracious covenant. So that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Abraham's duty, and his children's privilege, for him to apply the ſeal of his faith, and the token or bond of God's gracious covenant to them. And a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it was, if prized and improved as it ought to be, to ſtand thus related to God by his own gracious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and ſovereign appointment; tho' not ſo as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſalvation without faith: But here, by way of emin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they have the bleſſed means, and the greateſt obligation to faith.</p>
            <p>But I am ſenſible that the objection is not yet fully anſwered, the pinch of the objection is here; if it was the covenant of grace, containing ſpiritual bleſſings, in which God ſaid to Abraham, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> and if God ſays the ſame to believers now, why don't all their ſeed have ſpiritual bleſſings, and be ſaved? To which I directly anſwer.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:012076_0010_0F8993E5C236C5C0"/>

And in this ſenſe, it was, and is true, that God is a God of believers and their ſeed. And in this ſenſe it is, that the apoſtle clears this promiſe of the covenant of grace from falſhood, as you ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well he ſees now a queſtion will ariſe, men of a baptiſt turn of mind would be ready to aſk. <hi>What advantage then hath a Jew? or what profit is there in circumciſion?</hi> As much as to ſay, What good does it do to ſtand ſo related to God, by the external adminiſtration of the covenant of grace as to have the ſeal, token, or bond thereof applied? when all this may be, and yet no heart circumciſion, no regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no faith nor ſalvation? ſurely there was nothing meant of ſpiritual bleſſings in Abraham's covenant, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed:</hi> or elſe God is not true in the performance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now to this the apoſtle replies, and ſays, It is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage &amp; much every way; and altho' ſome ſuch don't believe, yet God is true to his promiſe notwithſtanding. What if ſome don't believe? ſhall their unbelief make the faith, that is, the fidelity, truth and faithfulneſs of God without effect? God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012076_0011_0F8993E63317E908"/>be accounted a liar, who ſhall ſay there were no ſpiritual bleſſings in the promiſe of God's covenant with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> or that ſhall ſay if there were, then God don't fulfil his promiſe, unleſs he converts and ſaves them all: for if ſome, yea thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands periſh thro' unbelief, that don't make the fidelity of God without effect, or his promiſe void.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, If Abraham's covenant was not the covenant of grace, and reſpected things of a ſpiritual nature, what was the matter that he was not a Jew which was one outwardly? If that covenant reſpected the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed of Abraham as ſuch, and as ſuch to remain the ſubjects of the covenant, and the good promiſed was only outward Canaan; and the requirements of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was only outward circumciſion, and an external conformity to outward rites and ceremonies: I ſay, if this was the caſe, is the baptiſts plead, then he was a Jew in the compleareſt and fulleſt ſenſe of that coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who was one outwardly; for according to them, that covenant reſpected, required, nor granted nothing but outward things.</p>
            <p>I grant, that in Abraham's covenant there were ſome things that reſpected his natural ſeed, as ſuch, viz that God would multiply them, make a great nation of them, give the land of Canaan to them. But theſe things were but a mere circumſtance; and as I may ſay ſome appendages added, and not the eſſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part of the covenant. Now by theſe appenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges attending Abraham's covenant God was pleaſed to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d them as very ſignificant things, and as types to preach, teach, illuſtrate, and ſhadow forth the ſpiritual good and glory contained in the ſubſtantial part, the eſſence and ſpiritually of Abraham's covenant. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's numerous natural ſeed promiſed, typified the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the covenant of grace, or his ſpiritual ſeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong both Jews and Gentiles, as God was pleaſed to honour him with the title of being called the father o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:012076_0011_0F8993E63317E908"/>all the faithful. And the gift of Canaan to Abraham's natural ſeed, typified the heavenly inheritance, given in Abraham's covenant, or the covenant of grace to all true believers. So that there was truly a goſpel cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and goſpel doctrines, and goſpel bleſſings in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's day. Now for the baptiſt to take theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages, theſe typical things in Abraham's covenant, and try <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o make the very eſſence of that covenant to conſiſt in them, is a vile abuſe of Abraham's covenant, and a counteracting the new teſtament interpretation of that covenant, as we have ſeen in part already, and may ſee more in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>But ſir, I muſt not forget to conſider the main pillar you ground your opinion upon; and your chief engine which you think to beat down all our arguments and proof, that Abraham's covenant was the covenant of grace. And that is what we find in Heb. 8. And eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe words cited by the apoſtle from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Jeremiah, ver. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. Now what ſeeming proof there is in theſe words, or whole chapter, to eſtabliſh the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt in the opinion that Abraham's covenant was not the covenant of grace, is wholly founded on a miſtake: which I think I can eaſily ſhew, and demonſtrate to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rational mind that will attend without prejudice,</p>
            <p>And this I ſhall do by conſidering two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That neither the prophet Jeremiah in his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor the apoſtle Paul in the Hebrews, do oppoſe this new covenant which the Lord would make with the houſe of Iſrael, to Abraham's covenant; but they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to ſomething elſe, which is quite evident if we do but attend cloſely to the matter. Do but ſee how the words run. <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah: not according to the covenant I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the Land of Egypt.</hi> Now if
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012076_0012_0F8993E6F441B750"/>the words had run thus, I will make a new covenant, &amp;c.—not according to the covenant I made with their fathers, when I took Abraham by the band, and called him out from his kindred and bleſſed him, &amp;c. I ſay if the words had run thus, I would freely give up the point to you, and allow the new covenant ſpoken of in Heb. 8. is in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Abraham's covenant. But I find the words of inſpiration run quite another way, even to Egypt and Mount Sinai. Therefore take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them again. I will make a new covenant —<hi>not according to the covenant I made with their fathers</hi>—But when?—<hi>in the DAY I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.</hi> Now it is as evident as words can make it, that this covenant ſpoken of, to which the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ſaid to be made in oppoſition to, was not made in Abraham's day, but four hundred and thirty years after, when the children of Iſrael came out of Egypt, and the Sinai-law given; (for we may note, that the Sinai-law was given the ſame year that Iſrael went out of Egypt); ſo that I have a right to tell you in the words of the apoſtle, Gal. 3.17. And this I ſay, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, (that is Abraham's covenant, as tis called) the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot diſannul. So that the covenant with Abraham, being the covenant of grace, as to the eſſence and ſubſtance of it, ſtill continues. But if you aſk what covenant it was, if it was nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's covenant that the new covenant in Heb. 8. is oppoſed to? I anſwer, that it is evident by
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012076_0012_0F8993E6F441B750"/>the main ſcope of the epiſtle to the Hebrews, and this 8th ch. in particular, that it was the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of ceremonies and legal ſervices given at Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, conſidered in the abſtract, or what they were in themſelves, weak and inſufficient to juſtify and ſave thoſe who attended thereupon, unleſs they by faith look'd to the end of theſe things which were to be aboliſhed, and ſaw Chriſt the ſubſtance of theſe ſhadows. <hi>For the law,</hi> in all the punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilios of ceremonies, <hi>made nothing perfect. And it was impoſſible that the blood of bulls, and of goats, ſhould take away ſin.</hi> Now the carnal Jews, who had no true faith, to apprehend Chriſt, in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's covenant, nor Chriſt the ſubſtance of theſe ſhadows; are ſaid to have a vail on their heart, and ſo could not look to the end of that which ſhould be done away, but thro' ſpiritual blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unbelief, they terminated in the ſhadow inſtead of the ſubſtance, to their own deſtruction. Therefore as a remedy againſt this melancholly ſcene, that encouraging prophecy was given by the mouth of Jeremiah.—Behold the days come ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſrael—not according to the covenant I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt—Led them to Sinai, and gave them a

                  </gap> that he ſaith, <hi>A new covenant,</hi> he hath made the firſt old." Heb. 9 15 <q>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the <hi>new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012076_0013_0F8993E7B2C1ED50"/>yet weak that could not take away ſin—a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that was vail'd—But it ſhan't always be ſo, Chriſt the ſubſtance of all theſe ſhall come, and cauſe theſe ſhadows to flee away: and I will pour out my Spirit in plentiful effuſions thereof, and multitudes ſhall be converted truly; I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts will I write them; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, in the ſenſe of my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious covenant with Abraham. And ſo Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias by the ſpirit of prophecy, viewed Abraham's covenant accompliſhing, in the beſtowment of ſpiritual bleſſings. Luk. 1.72, 73, 74, 75. To perform the mercy promiſed to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant, the oath which he ſware to our father Abraham, that he would
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012076_0013_0F8993E7B2C1ED50"/>grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might ſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the days of our life.</p>
            <p>So that this new covenant ſpoken of Heb. 8. is ſo far from really oppoſing Abraham's coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, that it does really accompliſh it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing I propoſed, or intended to conſider, as a proof that this new covenant, Heb. 8. was not oppoſed to Abraham's, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the effects and bleſſings of Abraham's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the effects and bleſſings of this new covenant are one: Now oppoſite covenants don't meet in oneneſs of effect. But I have partly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented myſelf herein, by what I have ſaid already. However, I will juſt add a word or two more.</p>
            <p>Now let us conſider the effect and bleſſings of this new covenant, ſpoken of in Heb. 8. <hi>I will put my law in their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> Here is the effect and bleſſings of the new covenant you allow. And I truſt you will not deny but that the privileges and bleſſings of the new covenant are ſpoken of in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſcripture, as well as this; and altho' not contradictory to this, yet with more enlargements on the privileges, and more minutely particular therein. And as the apoſtle cites this paſſage in Heb. 8.10. from the 31. ch. of Jer. ſo I truſt you can't deny but the next chapter, viz. Jer. 32.38.39. ſpeaks out alſo the promiſe of the new covenant, or covenant of grace. <hi>And they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God. And I will
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012076_0014_0F8993E874432E50"/>give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.</hi> So alſo is the promiſe of the new covenant ſpoken out in the 44. of Iſa. ver. 3. <hi>For I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>spring.</hi> Now let us in a word, conſider the effect and bleſſings of the covenant with Abraham. And we find, that when God graciouſly condeſcended to enter into theſe covenant engagements by his own free promiſe, he tells us what he meant by it, Gen. 17.7. ſpeaking to Abraham; <hi>To be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> The very ſame bleſſings carried in thoſe other promiſes of the new covenant, tho' not here ſo much enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, nor ſo explicit, in their ſpiritual nature. For the goſpel, and covenant of grace, and the ſpiritual bleſſings thereof, open'd gradually. But if at every degree of new openings, of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the covenant of grace, and enlargements thereof, and explicit promiſes made; I ſay, if we ſhould call the ſame, at every ſuch period, another covenant, inſtead of the ſame more enlightned into, we ſhould have new covenants, and new goſpels plenty enough in the bible. But when God ſays in Abraham's covenant, I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed, means no leſs than the ſame ſpiritual bleſſings contain'd in the new covenant, elſewhere expreſſed by a more particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bleſſings involved in theſe words, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> As pouring his Spirit upon them, giving them a new
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012076_0014_0F8993E874432E50"/>heart, and writing his laws in their heart, &amp;c. So we may look upon Deut. 30.6. a true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of Abraham's covenant: <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And ſurely this is the ſame ſpiritual bleſſing of having the law of God written in the heart. And when God ſays, by way of covenant, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> ſince the fall of Adam, it is evermore new covenant language, and new covenant bleſſing referred to.</p>
            <p>But I find baptiſt authors, and I think you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number, do allow, that in Abraham's covenant, that God did engage to be externally their God, altho' it was the covenant of works, that did not carry ſpiritual bleſſings in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>Now here I would juſt remark two things, for there is not a baptiſt among you all, but allow that in Abraham's covenant there were great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours thereby conferred upon the ſubjects of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay that Abraham's covenant cannot be the covenant of works, ſay what you will, if there were any favours or bleſſings at all in it, either ſpiritual or temporal. For the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the covenant of works, is to give life to ſinleſs, or perfect obedience, &amp; to curſe the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, and beſtow no mercy on the ſinner, no not the leaſt even of a temporal nature. And altho' God does beſtow many favours on ſinners, who are under the law, as a covenant of works, yet he does not do it by the covenant of works, or in the way of the covenant of works; but in a way of ſovereign grace thro' the Mediator, which the covenant of works knows nothing of.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:012076_0015_0F8993E933F42BC0"/>
2 What kind of a covenant, and what kind of a bleſſing is this? for God to engage to a people or a perſon, to be their God externally? and the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be according to the engagement. The plain Engliſh of it is this, that Jehovah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s their God in word, but the covenant leaves the devil to be their God in deed.</p>
            <p>I obſerve, ſir, that you allow that Abraham was an eminent ſaint, and was ſomehow, in the covenant of grace, but that covenant in<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The baptiſts pretend, ſome of them at leaſt, that there is an abſurdity in holding the covenant with Abraham, to be the coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of grace, the promiſe of which was, <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee;</hi> and to hold that believers are under the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and promiſe now; and yet to allow that many of Abraham's children were not ſaved, and many of the children of believers now under the goſpel are alſo not ſaved: they are therefore very averſe to allowing that theſe words in the promiſe, <hi>and to thy ſeed after thee,</hi> ſhould be conſidered indefinitely, that is not to fix abſolutely upon each individual, but only <hi>of their ſeed.</hi> But then, if they ſhould once allow this, they charge us o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> being guilty of another great abſurdity in baptiſing all the children of believers promiſcuouſly; why don't we wait, ſay they, until we ſee on whom the promiſe is made effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious by their ſaving converſion? and then apply the ſeal of the covenant, where the ſaving effects of the covenant are firſt ſeen. But to apply baptiſm to any who are not firſt inwardly waſhed, and to many who never at all are waſhed from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>That theſe abſurdities are not real, but only ſeeming, as I ſuppoſe they do ſeem abſurdities to a baptiſt. But what I would remark in this marginal note is, that the baptiſts interpretation of Abraham's covenant has ſeeming abſurdities juſt ſimilar to theſe, and ſome <hi>real ones</hi> to boot.</p>
                  <p>Now the baptiſts ſay that in Abraham's covenant, as it reſpected his natural ſeed God engaged to be their God in outward reſpects, would give them outward privileges and the land of Canaan, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd certain outward duties upon them, and circumciſion in the fleſh as a ſeal of this national kind of a covenant of works.</p>
                  <p>Now how can this promiſe be underſtood, even upon this explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the covenant? Did the promiſe reach each individual abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely? No. Iſhmael and his ſeed, were not intended in the promiſe, when God told Abraham I will give all the land of Canaan to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee. How can the promiſe be true then? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all Abraham's ſeed be meant in the promiſe? Why here the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts muſt underſtand the promiſe indifinitely, and then it is true.— Well, but if circumciſion was a ſeal of this covenant, in which Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was promiſed indefinitely to Abraham's ſeed, why did they not wait until God had told them which line ſhould poſſeſs Canaan, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſhmael's or Iſaac's, before they circumciſed any? and not go and ſet the ſeal of a certain covenant upon Iſhmael that never was deſigned to poſſeſs the good contain'd in that covenant. What is this but to ſet a ſeal to a blank? But the baptiſts will ſay in this caſe, God poſitively commanded it, he commanded Abraham to circumciſe Iſhmael as well as Iſaac. I anſwer, I know it, and I think that is enough to make the baptiſts hold their tongues, and never bring this objection againſt infant baptiſm any more, <hi>that 'tis abſurd, like ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſeal to a blank;</hi> for as abſurd as it is. God commanded it in a ſimilar caſe. But one real abſurdity I ſhall here mention, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily following the baptiſts interpretation of Abraham's covenant, while they deny it to be the covenant of grace, and that the promiſe of it, as it reſpected Abraham's natural ſeed, bad no reference to ſpiritual bleſſings, but temporal only. The abſurdity is this, viz. <hi>That the jewiſh nation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ood related to God by covenant, as creatures which had no ſouls, and the breach of the covenant in them would have been no ſin.</hi> For the obedience the covenant required, was but external, and the good promiſed in the covenant if it be kept, is but temporal. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they break it, they muſt not be charged with ſin nor puniſhed with hell. For to ſuppoſe immortal ſouls will be puniſhed eternally in hell for the breach of covenant with God, which if they had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the terms of, would not have rewarded them with heaven, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> abſurd with a witneſs. For altho' the baptiſt ſome times pretend that Abraham's covenant was the covenant of works, yet at other times they repreſent it as a meer outward thing, neither the covenant of works nor the covenant of grace.</p>
               </note> Gen. 17. of which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012076_0015_0F8993E933F42BC0"/>was the ſeal, was not it, but the covenant of works, likewiſe the Sinai diſpenſation was the covenant of works; and if ſo, all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aints from Abraham down to the goſpel day, were under the covenant of works, and went to heaven under the covenant of works; or elſe ſome how, without God's leave, they ſlipt their necks out of the covenant of works, and ſtole away to heaven in ſecret: I ſay without God's leave, becauſe God never gave his ſaints any liberty while that diſpenſation laſted, to depart from thoſe inſtitutions, which the baptiſt ſay, were of, and belonged to, the covenant of works. But I apprehend the grounds of your miſtake to be truly this, that you take the external form of the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012076_0016_0F8993E9F3FDC0E0"/>of the covenant of grace, and make in your own minds, a diſtinct covenant of it, by itſelf, even the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, as I before noted.</p>
            <p>II. I now in the ſecond place, as it was propoſed, proceed to conſider the new teſtament interpretation of circumciſion. I obſerve ſir, that in trying to get along with your ſcheme in denying Abraham's to be the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, one while you repreſent circumciſion to be a ſeal of the covenant of works, <hi>do and live,</hi> and then ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m to try to make Abraham's covenant to conſiſt in circumciſion, or that circumciſion was the covenant it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as I before noted. But I am after a more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic interpretation of circumciſion, than I take yours to be, even the new teſtament interpretation. And that tells us without heſitation, how we are to conſider cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. Rom. 4.11. <hi>He received the ſign of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith which he had.</hi> Now the righteouſneſs of faith, is nothing ſhort of Chriſt's righteouſneſs apprehended by faith, and ſuch evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obedience as is the effect of true faith; which is goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel righteouſneſs, as truly as any believer has now under the goſpel, and ſeals by baptiſm. Therefore circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not appointed as a ſeal of the covenant of works, becauſe it was appointed to ſeal a righteouſneſs that never belonged to the covenant of works, even the righteouſneſs of faith, which is goſpel-righteouſneſs, and evermore belongs to the covenant of grace. What will you do then for proof, that circumciſion was a ſeal of the covenant of works? It may be you will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Gal. 5.3, 4. where the apoſtle tells them that <hi>Every man</hi> (among them) <hi>that is circumciſed, is a debtor to do the whole law. Chriſt is become of none effect unto you: whoſoever of you are juſtified by the law, ye are falle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from grace.</hi> Now inaſmuch as the baptiſts think this text to be much in their favour, as a proof that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion belonged to the covenant of works, becauſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Paul told the Galations that if they became circumciſed
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012076_0016_0F8993E9F3FDC0E0"/>they were debtors to do the whole law, &amp;c. Therefore we will take this matter a little under conſideration.</p>
            <p>Now when Paul ſays to the Galations, If ye become circumciſed, ye are debtors to do the whole law; if he means the ceremonial law, then he would let them know that by being circumciſed, they brought themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an obligation, by that, to come under that heavy yoke, in all its branches, which Peter told his jewiſh bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren was a yoke which neither their fathers nor they were able to bear, Acts 15.10.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe that the apoſtle has a more ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the moral law, as containing the ſubſtance of the covenant of works. And when Paul told the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians, that if they became circumciſed, they would be debtors to do the whole law, viz. get a perfect law righteouſneſs of their own, ſuch as the law demands. But he don't ſay that circumciſion originally, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionally, laid all under an obligation to perform the covenant of works in order to juſtification: altho' cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially conſidered, and eventually it did the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians, and many of the ſelf-righteous Jews, thro' their ſinful abuſe, and wicked perverting the right order and uſe of things, as I ſhall ſhew. And that we may ſee in the light of truth how it came about that circumciſion laid the ſelf-righteous Jews, and the Galations who were corrupted by them, under an obligation to do the whole law, or perform the covenant of works, as a condition of juſtification and ſalvation, we ſhall conſider their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, and miſuſe of, both the Sinai-diſpenſation, and circumciſion. And this I find Paul has done to our hands already, in his allegory concerning Abraham's two wives; a very natural and beautiful ſimilitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the caſe in a true and ſtriking light. Now Sarah was a free woman, and in the allegory repreſents the covenant of grace. Hagar was a bond-woman and ſhe repreſented the law, as the covenant of works; or the Sinai diſpenſation received in the form of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012076_0017_0F8993EAB3999840"/>of works. Now obſerve, that Hagar in her firſt and proper ſtation, was Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ah's hand maid, to ſerve and aſſiſt her, and ſo long as ſhe did ſo, and kept in that capacity, all was harmonious, well, and quiet in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: but when Hagar came to be removed from the place of a ſervant, to the place of a wife, gets into Sarah's place, and bears a ſon to Abraham, all is in confuſion, and great diſturbance in the family. Altho' Hagar was a good ſervant, and would have done well in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; yet ſhe was not fit to be made a wife of, for being a bond woman her ſelf, her children are born in bondage, and not properly heirs of the inheritance. Therefore, what ſaith the ſcripture? Caſt out the bond woman, and her ſon; for he ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the free woman. Now when this is done, and Sarah comes to be wife alone, as ſhe ought to have been before; and bears Abraham a ſon, who is free, and truly the heir, and abundantly bleſſed; now all things are ſet right again, and peace takes place in the family.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things are an allegory, ſaith Paul, and thus he applies it: Satah repreſents Abraham's coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, or the covenant of grace made known to Abraham, into which God was pleaſed, of his ſelf-moving love, to take him, giving him ſaith, the pardon of ſin, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life altogether as the effect of free grace; not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt, and ſo Abraham had not wherewith to glory before God, Rom. 4.2. And this covenant of grace was propoſed to Abraham, as the only way of life to fallen man, and looked that God would bleſs his ſeed, in the ſame way and manner that he had bleſſed him, viz. of free grace, in and thro' the promiſed ſeed, on whom alone he depended for ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual bleſſings, both for himſelf and his ſeed, according to God's gracious promiſe.</p>
            <p>Now, four hundred and thirty years after this, the Sinai-diſpenſation was given, and Paul ſhews that it was not given to oppoſe the covenant of grace, nor to
<pb n="33"
                   facs="unknown:012076_0017_0F8993EAB3999840"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>propoſe another way of life. Is the law then againſt the promiſes of God? God forbid. Gal 3 21. But the Sinai law was given, to help forward the ſalvation of ſinners by free grace, and not to hinder it. And therefore the Sinai diſpenſation in its true and proper uſe, was to be like Hagar, in her firſt ſtation, which was to ſerve Sarah. And the Sinai diſpenſation was well calculated for this end; for there the moral law was firſtly publiſhed, which if underſtood aright, ſhews ſinners their death; &amp; then the ceremonial law, which if rightly underſtood would have ſhewn them the way of life, viz. by the way of free grace. And ſo Paul labours to ſhew and convince ſelf-righteous men, that the law never was given at S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> come by free grace. He puts a queſtion for them in their mouths; <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the law?</hi> Gal. 3 19 He anſwers, <hi>It was added becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions</hi> —And again, <hi>The law entred that the offence might abound;</hi> that is, that they might ſee their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and abounding ſins, and ſo the need they ſtood in of a Saviour. And ſo ſays Paul concerning the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai-law, it was ordain'd by angels in the hand of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and therefore to ſubſerve the covenant of grace, if rightly underſtood and improved.</p>
            <p>But now the carnal and ſelf-righteous Jews made a great miſtake here, concerning the right application, and improvement of the Sinai diſpenſation. For inſtead of being convinced by the moral law, of ſin, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing condition in themſelves; and inſtead of fleeing to Chriſt the only remedy, pointed out in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law, they ſubſtitute the duties there enjoined, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Chriſt, and ſo make a righteouſneſs of their own doings, and hereby marry the law as a covenant of works, and ſo remove Hagar from the place of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the place of wife, and ſo the bond woman brings forth children; and a dreadful bondage they are in, bound upon the pain of eternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012076_0018_0F8993EB73EF97E0"/>perfect law-righteouſneſs, without the leaſt defect; and for the want of it, will at laſt be caſt out and rejected, from having any inheritance in the heavenly world, and hell muſt be their portion. <hi>For they who are of the works of the law are under the curſe.</hi> And indeed this is the caſe with ſelf-righteous men now, as well as it was with the Jews and the Galatians of old, when any ſubſtitute rites and forms, and their own works, altho' under the goſpel diſpenſation, inſtead of Chriſt and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the bond-woman brings forth children yet, that muſt as aſſuredly be caſt out, as ever Iſhmael was.</p>
            <p>Now I apprehend it is quite plain from Paul's epiſtle to the Galatians that it is in this light he tells them, that if they became circumciſed they would be debtors to do the whole law; that if they ſet out upon that foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even ſo far as to be circumciſed, under a notion that it was part of their juſtifying righteouſneſs, (which they did, it ſeems, and hence was ſo loth to give it up) then they muſt go a thorow ſtich with it, and get a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as perfect as it demands; as he ſhews abundantly it muſt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wholly of works, or wholly of grace. Now if Paul had look'd upon it that circumciſion in every circumſtance, laid the ſubject of it under an obligation to do the whole law, in point of juſtification, he never would have circumciſed Timothy when he did. He knew that circumciſion as Abraham practiſed it, was a ſeal of the covenant of grace, and as he practiſed it, when he circumciſed Timothy it was but a meer indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing. But as the ſelf-righteous Jews and Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians did it, he ſaw it was like to prove fatal to their ſouls; hence he earneſtly diſſwades them from it. If the Jews had univerſally underſtood, and improved the Sinai diſpenſation as they ought, and kept Hagar as a ſervant, and not married her as a wife, circumciſion would have ſealed no other righteouſneſs than that of faith, as it did to Abraham, and other true believers, according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p>Now becauſe the ſelf-righteous Jews miſimproved the Sinai diſpenſation, and married the law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was given of God as the covenant of works, and that the Jewiſh church was form'd by God upon the covenant of works, and circumciſion inſtituted of God as the ſeal of the covenant of works. But your opinion herein is wholly on the ſend of ſad miſtake, as the new teſtament ſhews. Tho' ſo much is true. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reely allow, that when the ſelf righteous folks do cleave to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works as being agreeable to their legal temper, and wicked hearts, God holds them to the terms of that covenant they chooſe, and damns them eternally accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtrictneſs of it.</p>
            <p>But to ſuppoſe that the chief end and deſign of the Sinai diſpenſation was to give forth a diſpenſation of the covenant of works, and form the Jewiſh church upon that covenant, is abſurd with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I apprehend the natural tendency and deſign of the Sinai diſpenſation, when any thro' grace, fell in with the true deſign of it, was on purpoſe to bring the Jews off from the covenant of works, to which they and all men naturally are very fond of cleaving. It ſeems, that there God acted out, in an external diſpenſation, what he does internally by his Spirit upon every ſoul he brings off from the covenant of works, and to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the covenant of grace, in true converſion. Firſt the Spirit of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ets home the law upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's heart, not with a deſign to make the man cleave to the law as a covenant of works, but with a contrary deſign, viz. to make him cleave from the law, as a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012076_0019_0F8993EC33F9DCC8"/>underſtanding its ſtrictneſs and ſeverity. So in the Sinai diſpenſation, the moral law came forth in aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful terror, containing the nature and ſubſtance of the covenant of works, curſing the ſinner, to humble their pride, and make them ſenſible they ſtood in need of a Mediator, and ſo to fall in with the covenant of grace; and ſo the law was to ſubſerve the goſpel, and as Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in her right place, was to ſerve Sarah, and ſo the Sinai diſpenſation was to help forward and promote the ſalvation of ſinners by the covenant of grace. And thus I think it muſt appear to every underſtanding and unprejudiced mind, that circumciſion laid the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and many of the ſelf-righteous Jews, under an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to perform the covenant of works, or get a perfect law-righteouſneſs of their own, not from God's inſtitution, order, deſign and appointment, (had they fallen in with that) but from their own wicked perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things, viz their miſuſing and miſimproving the law, and miſapplying circumciſion. For my part I wonder how you, and other baptiſts, who pretend to be ſuch new-teſtament men, dare venture to go ſo right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt againſt the new-teſtament interpretation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which declares, (as it was inſtituted and rightly improved) it a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith.

            <p>I obſerve, ſir, that you, and ſome other baptiſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in order to get along with your ſcheme in annexing circumciſion with the inſtitution of the covenant of works, you chooſe to ſay little or nothing about this text, Rom. 4.11.

If you ſhould aſk me why I conjecture ſo, I will tell you one reaſon of it, and I think a ſubſtantial one, viz. That I have converſed with many of the baptiſt, one time or another, who aſſert as you do, that circumciſion was not a ſeal of the covenant of grace, but of the covenant of works. Then only aſk them how they reconcile that aſſertion with Paul's words, Rom. 4 11. where he ſays, Abraham received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith.

            <p>But what I have obſerved is not the only proof that circumciſion was the ſeal, token, or bond of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, as really as baptiſm is now, altho' under a different diſpenſation. Let us therefore conſider this matter a little further. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth circumciſion and baptiſm were of divine appointment, and conſiſted of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſign, and a ſpiritual miſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry ſignified there by: and altho' the outward ſign of circumciſion and baptiſm dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet the inward and ſpiritual ſignification of them but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> very much agree in one, as to the eſſential things therein, and point at one and the ſame thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both belonged to one and the ſame covenant. Let us ſee in the ſpiritual m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtery, ſomewhat of their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, agreement and harmony, altho' their outward ſign differs.</p>
            <p>Circumciſion in the outward ſign of it, was that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012076_0020_0F8993ECF3EA19A0"/>which was ſaid to be made with hands; the ſpiritual miſtery ſignified thereby was that circumciſion made without hands, viz. heart cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the effect of renewing grace.</p>
            <p>Baptiſm, in the outward ſign of it, is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of water in a ſacred manner ordinancial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the waſhing with water; "I baptize you with water," ſays John. The inward miſtery ſignified thereby is the baptiſm of the holy Ghoſt and of fire; or the inward waſhing and cleanſing from ſin in the blood of Chriſt; or the waſhing of regeneration and renewings of the holy Ghoſt, which is the ſame thing with heart circumciſion.</p>
            <p>Again, if theſe ordinances are conſidered as a convictive ſign, both of our diſeaſe and remedy, there ſeems to be an agreement here. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, rightly underſtood, doubtleſs carries a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and an acknowlegement of defilement, by natural generation, the ſign itſelf very ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeems to point that out; and the ſign being painful and bloody, carries alſo a conviction and an acknowlegement of the remedy in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt, that is, by his blood. So bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, by waſhing, acknowleges native defilement, as well as the virtue of Chriſt's blood to cleanſe.</p>
            <p>Again, if we conſider theſe ordinances as an obliging ſign, or bond of the covenant, there is an agreement here alſo.</p>
            <p>Circumciſion laid Abraham and his children, under a bond to look ſolely to Chriſt, and free grace, (the good contain'd in the covenant) for ſalvation; and ſtrength to ſerve God acceptably: which Abraham, and all the faithful in the jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012076_0020_0F8993ECF3EA19A0"/>church, thro' grace did, as really as believers do now under the goſpel diſpenſation. And thoſe of the circumciſed, who did not thus do, broke thro' a ſtrong bond, and their ſin became aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and without repentance, their puniſhment too, as the ſcriptures abundantly ſhew.</p>
            <p>So baptiſm may be conſidered as a bond, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the believer, and his ſeed, to look ſolely to Chriſt for righteouſneſs and juſtification, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy and ſanctifying grace; for ſtrength to ſerve God acceptably here, and a glorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality hereafter. And if the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, under the bond of baptiſm, don't thro' grace, come up to thoſe obligations, both their ſin and puniſhment will be dreadfully aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the nigher any ſtand related to God, and his gracious covenant, and the higher they are exalted, by their ſituation, with privileges, the lower they muſt fall, and the deeper they muſt ſink into hell, if they abuſe the ſame, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue impenitent.</p>
            <p>I don't ſay there is an exact parrallel, in every thing, between circumciſion and baptiſm, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need there be, as the baptiſts pretend there muſt be, a parity throughout, in order to have them both ſeals of the covenant of grace; but that is mere fallacy, or folly, as I could eaſily ſhew, were it not a needleſs waſte of time. But there being a parity and agreement in the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual miſtery ſignified by both, in the main eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials thereof, it is entirely ſufficient. Doubtleſs there was ſomething in circumciſion typical of Chriſt and of his death, as yet to come, who was
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012076_0021_0F8993EDB77A7420"/>to be born of the holy circumciſed ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and yet to be born of a woman, altho' the females were not circumciſed, to ſhew perhaps, while the bloody ſign was only to paſs upon the males, that Chriſt alone was to ſuffer for, and in the room of the church, his ſpouſe; <hi>for of the people there was none with him.</hi> And perhaps this may be one reaſon why females were exempted from the painful and bloody ſign of the covenant under the typical diſpenſation. But now under the goſpel diſpenſation, the ſufferings of Chriſt being over, the painful ſeal ceaſes, a mild ſeal commences, and females are brought under it, this ſignifying, that altho' the ſpouſe of Chriſt was not to ſhare with him in the curſe, yet ſhe is to ſhare with him in the bleſſings.</p>
            <p>III.|I come now to conſider the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interpretation of the jewiſh church, after the Sinai diſpenſation, and the yoke of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law, was laid upon them. The rites and ceremonies laid upon the jewiſh church, were very numerous; of which, as Paul ſays, I cannot now ſpeak particularly; but ſhall only obſerve in general, that that was a teſtament of blood. There was atoning blood, ſprinkling blood, cleanſing blood. For ſaith the apoſtle, Heb. 9.22. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all things are by the law purged with blood.</hi>— Now, altho' this ceremonial blood was weak in itſelf conſidered, and could not take away ſin; yet it declared there was blood efficatious enough to do it, and it pointed them right to Chriſt and his blood, that does make an atonement to the full ſatisfaction of divine juſtice; and does purge the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012076_0021_0F8993EDB77A7420"/>conſcience, and cleanſe from ſin. And all thoſe then in the jewiſh church, who underſtood the true nature of theſe ceremonial inſtitutions, and fell in with the deſign of God therein, read the atonement of Chriſt's blood therein, and by faith fled thereunto for cleanſing and for ſalvation.— And a baptiſt knows not what he ſays, nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he affirms, when he aſſerts that that was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the covenant of works, or denies it to be the covenant of grace. What, does the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works provide a Mediator for ſinners? and point out the way of life by the Mediator's death? A ſtrange ſort of a covenant of works, that points the way of ſalvation by free grace. But there are two things which I apprehend that the baptiſt do not rightly diſtinguiſh, which proves the means of their miſtake here, and has led them to conſider the Sinai-diſpenſation a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, upon which they ſay the jewiſh church was form'd, and not upon the covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I apprehend that the baptiſts do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the covenant of grace, appearing in an external form of adminiſtration, and, the internal efficacy on the heart. And therefore when they read of the legal ſervices, and ſo many carnal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as they are called, enjoin'd upon the jewiſh church, they are ready to ſay, theſe can't belong to the covenant of grace, for that is effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious to inſpire life into the ſoul, or put the law of God into the heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the baptiſts don't diſtinguiſh between the true nature and right improvement of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012076_0022_0F8993EE727F5A58"/>inſtitutions, and how the Jews in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral did improve them. How they did improve them, and how they ought to have improved them are two things. They ought to have improved them ſo as to have been led to Chriſt by them, and to have accepted of ſalvation by free grace in the way of the new covenant: But they did, the body of them, ſo improve the ceremonial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions as to make them a covenant of works to themſelves, and ſo clave to that covenant.— And what was in the event, the baptiſt pretend was the intent of that diſpenſation, viz. a coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of works. But it is all a miſtake. What if one ſhould ſay, that the goſpel diſpenſation was a diſpenſation of the covenant of works, and ſhould think to prove it by this, viz. that many profeſſors under the goſpel ſubſtitute the externals of goſpel duties, ordinances, rites and ceremonies; inſtead of Chriſt, and make a righteouſneſs of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges &amp; doings, cleave to the covenant of works, and live and die under that covenant. I ſay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this is a ſad and awful truth, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, with reſpect to many under the goſpel; yet will this prove that the goſpel diſpenſation is a diſpenſation of the covenant of works? Doubtleſs baptiſts and all will ſay no. And no better proof have they, that the typical diſpenſation was a diſpenſation of the covenant of works.</p>
            <p>But what I principally aim at, under this head, is, to conſider briefly, that notwithſtanding all the legal ſervices, carnal ordinances and indeed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, in the jewiſh church, yet things were not, even then, ſo altogether typical of ſomething
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012076_0022_0F8993EE727F5A58"/>future, concerning the covenant of grace, and the ſpiritual glory of the goſpel church, as to deny a diſpenſation of the covenant of grace, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual church then exiſting, altho' the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was comparatively low, &amp; vail'd with a type.</p>
            <p>Let us hear then how the new teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the jewiſh church under the ceremonial law. Gal. 4.1, 2. "Now this I ſay, that the heir as long as he is a child, diſſereth nothing from a ſervant, tho' he be lord of all. But is under tutors and governors until the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the father."</p>
            <p>Now this paſſage is, I know, by good divines, ſometimes applied to an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, before conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as differing nothing from others, but is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe and ſeverity of the mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> law, or the broken covenant of works, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and ſo obtains freedom and deliverance from the curſe thereof. But I dare ſay, this is not the principal meaning of Paul, nor the text. For by the heir, in theſe two different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Paul ſpeaks of; as firſt under age, there to be tutor'd, and that with a good deal of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as if he was but only a ſervant, and not a child: And then coming forth out of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, into liberty and freedom, as a child does who has got to be of age—I ſay, by this heir, Paul means to point out the church of God in two different periods: The heir in minority, under tutors, &amp;c. repreſents the church under the ceremonial law, which was very ſevere: But the heir coming into freedom, no more to be under his former tutors and governors, repreſents the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012076_0023_0F8993F00DD88288"/>church in the goſpel day, coming into goſpel liberty and freedom, and no more to come under that heavy yoke, the ceremonial law. And all who read Paul's epiſtle to the Galatians with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and take the chain of his arguments, will ſee this to be the caſe; yet I allow that the church under the goſpel, is favoured more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently with internal and ſpiritual bleſſings, and commences into a circumſtance more pure and ſpiritual than under the typical diſpenſation. But then what I aim to remark from this new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interpretation of the church under the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law, is, that there was the exiſtance and being of a ſpiritual church, even then, (tho' not in the goſpel form) although the ſpiritual glory of it was comparatively low, and vail'd with a type. If this was not ſo, Paul brought a very unſuitable ſimilitude to repreſent the caſe by. A man, an heir, at liberty and freedom, had exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and being, when but a child; and altho' now he throws away the habit he wore when he was a child, and bids adieu to his old ſchool-maſter, who then learn'd him his letters, &amp; betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf now to employment that more becomes a ſtate of manhood; yet he is to be conſidered as one and the ſame perſon, in theſe two different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the latter of which is much to be preferred before the firſt. So God conſidered his church as a child under age, and dealt with it accordingly under the typical diſpenſation, and by types and ſhadows did as it were, take the child by the hand, and lead it to the ſpiritual ſubſtance. But at the time appointed of the father, viz. in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012076_0023_0F8993F00DD88288"/>the goſpel day, God conſiders his church more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in age, and ripeneſs for freedom, and treats it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; which latter circumſtance of the church is much to be preferred to the former. But if the church was not under a diſpenſation of the covenant of grace, but form'd upon the covenant of works, as the baptiſts pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the baptiſts, there were no advancement to it; but were to be conſidered as two diſtinct churches in their nature, the one inſtituted and conſtituted by God to be a carnal church in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffer in their nature and eſſence, viz. that the jewiſh church was form'd upon the covenant of works, <hi>do and live.</hi> And the goſpel church only form'd upon the covenant of grace. And if this were the caſe, it ſeems Paul ſhould have took ſome other ſimilitude, and of different ſpecies, the one ſpecie to repreſent the Jews church by, form'd upon the covenant of works; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecie to repreſent the goſpel church by, form'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the covenant of grace, viz ſuch a ſimilitude as this, That the ox or the horſe was under tutors and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, but the child is free: yea, free as ſoon as it was born; for according to the baptiſt, the true church never had exiſtance until the goſpel day.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>afting in of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Now the apoſtle repreſents this in the 11th cha. Rom. by the ſimilitude of an <hi>olive tree, natural branches, and wild.</hi> By this olive tree, Paul means to repreſent the Jews in their covenant relation to God; by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches which were broken off, he means the Jews
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012076_0024_0F8993F0B4233E88"/>who fell by unbelief, and forfeited their ſtanding in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant relation to God, and in ſeverity God took the forfeiture at their hands, and rejected them. And by the olive tree, wild by nature, which was grafted in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the natural branches that ſtood, Paul means the Gentile church. From all which we may fairly and truly argue thus: That if the Gentiles, by being graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in among the natural branches that were not broken off, do ſtand related to God, as his church, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal adminiſtration of the covenant of grace, under the goſpel diſpenſation; then the natural branches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were broken off, did ſtand related to God by the ſame covenant, altho' under a different diſpenſation, or a different form of adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Again, If ſome of the natural branches were not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by unbelief, but by faith kept their ſtanding in covenant relation to God, and this ſtanding in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation to God, in the goſpel day, is a ſtanding in relation to God as his church and covenant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by, and according to the external adminiſtration of the covenant of grace under the goſpel diſpenſation: Then the natural branches did before, ſtand related to God by the external adminiſtration of the ſame coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of grace, altho' under a different diſpenſation of it. What ſenſe would there be in ſaying, that when the Gentiles came to be taken into a covenant relation to God, even by the covenant of grace, that they were grafted in, if the Jews had not ſtood in relation to God by the ſame covenant? but another covenant eſſentially different. Do you think, ſir, that the Gentile church is grafted into the covenant of works? and ſtand in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God by a diſpenſation of that covenant? Or do you ſuppoſe the Gentile church is grafted in to a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation to God, by a covenant that is merely nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, that does not mean, nor carry ſpiritual bleſſings in the promiſe of it? Yes, you muſt hold to this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable abſurdity; or elſe make Paul talk non-ſenſe; or give up your aſſertion wherein you deny Abraham's
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012076_0024_0F8993F0B4233E88"/>covenant to be the covenant of grace, and deny the jewiſh church to ſtand related to God by a diſpenſation of the covenant of grace. According to the baptiſts. Paul ſhould not have ſaid <hi>broken off, and grafted in;</hi> for when he ſays, ſome of the natural branches were broken off, it fully implies that there yet remained the ſtump, ſtock, and ſome of the natural branches which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued along, and the Gentiles by ingrafting, come in upon that root. And hence ſays Paul to the Gentile church, <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſt not, for thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee.</hi> Now by this roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſtock, and branches which were continued, can't poſſibly mean the typical or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial diſpenſation; for that had waxed old, and was vaniſhed away; therefore it was the eſſence of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant relation it ſelf, that did not change with the change of diſpenſations. But as I ſaid, according to the baptiſt notion, Paul ſhould not have ſaid, Some of the branches were broken off, and the Gentiles grafted in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> but that all the branches, ſtock, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> root, and all ſunk together, and a new ſtock and branches aroſe, eſſentially different. For if the church under the ceremonial law, was not under a diſpenſation of the covenant of grace, and the goſpel church is, there can be no ingraftment in the caſe, but two diſtinct things.</p>
            <p>But that we may learn further, what the breaking off the Jews, and the grafting in of the Gentiles meant, &amp; intended, the parable of the vineyard, Mat. 21. may afford us ſome light. None will deny, I ſuppoſe, but that the vineyard repreſented and meant the jewiſh church-ſtate, with the privileges thereof, which they fadly and wickedly abuſed, as you may ſee at large in the parable, as Chriſt there repreſents and ſets it forth. Then Chriſt demanded of his hearers, what they thought the lord of the vineyard would do to thoſe wicked huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen? They anſwer, <hi>miſerably deſtroy them, and let out the vineyard to other huſbandmen, which ſhall render him the fruits in their ſeaſon.</hi> Now it ſeems that Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012076_0025_0F8993F173E52030"/>of their anſwer, for he further adds and ſays; <hi>The kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> Now by the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God here, it is evident that the ſame thing is meant that the vineyard repreſented, which as I noted before was the jewiſh church-ſtate, with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s privileges; and ſays Chriſt, it ſhall be giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s thereof; referring to the Gentile nation, who was about to receive the goſpel, and thro' grace, did bring forth, in ſome meaſure, anſwerable fruit. But now obſerve here, that it was the ſame vineyard, the ſame kingdom of God, which was taken from the Jews, that Chriſt ſays ſhould be given to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Gentiles; that is, it muſt mean a relation to God by the ſame covenant, viz the covenant of grace, although not under the ſame diſpenſation of it.</p>
            <p>But it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ems that if you had been to have explain'd, or repreſented this matter, your principles would not allowed you to have explained it juſt as Chriſt has done. But your principles would have neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ated you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the matter ſome how after this manner, viz. <q>That the jewiſh church, by a certain covenant relation they ſtood in to God, diſtinct in its nature from the covenant of grace, had certain favours and privileges granted to them, which might be compared to a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard let out, the fruits of which they were bound to return in due ſeaſon; but for their unfaithfulneſs and unfruitfulneſs, God in righteouſneſs determined he would take the vineyard from them. And what will he do with it? Will he give it to the Gentiles, and try them whether they will render anſwerable fruit? No, but God will take away the vineyard from the Jews. and give the Gentiles another eſſentially d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>For certainly, if the jewiſh church did not ſtand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to God by a diſpenſation of the covenant of gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Chriſt ſays, the ſame vineyard, the ſame kingdom of God, ſhall be taken from the Jews, and given to the Gentiles; and who muſt I believe? when Chriſt ſays it is the ſame, I think it it ſafeſt and beſt to credit him, let the baptiſts ſay otherwiſe ever ſo peremptorily.</p>
            <p>But I think enough has been ſaid under theſe four foregoing heads, to ſhew, that what you charge us with is not true, viz. That we do not conſtrue and interpret the new teſtament by the old, in order to ſupport infant baptiſm: But contrarily, we adhere to the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interpretation of the old, and hence find a warrant for the practice. For from what has been ſaid above, we may, I think, remark theſe following things, as grounded and eſtabliſhed upon the new teſtament teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the covenant with Abraham was the coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of grace, containing ſpiritual bleſſings, Gal. 3.17. Luk. 1.72,—75.</p>

            <p n="4">4. That to ſtand thus related to God by covenant, even by the external adminiſtration of the covenant of grace, and brought under the ſeal and bond thereof, is conſidered as a diſtinguiſhing mercy, great favour, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege and benefit, Rom. 3.1, 2.

5. That the Gentile church is grafted in to the ſame covenant relation to God; that is, related to God by the ſame covenant of grace, as the jewiſh church once ſtood in, altho' under a more glorious diſpenſation of the one &amp; the ſame covenant, and are come under the promiſe and bleſſings of it, ſo that the bleſſing of Abraham is come on the believing Gentiles; to whom God ſaid, thro' the promiſed ſeed, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> as the language and tenor of his gracious covenant; by virtue of which gracious promiſe, Abraham did claim ſpiritual bleſſings to his own ſoul, and a place for his children, in God's viſible kingdom, and under the bond and ſeal of God's covenant, Rom. 10 17. Gal. 3 11.14.</p>
            <p>But that the bleſſing of Abraham is come on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles, and by their relation to God by the ſame covenant, they may claim the good of the promiſe, which is the ſame ſtill, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> the new teſtament will help us to ſome further confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation reſpecting this: For we do find in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that where one of the parents is a believer, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral holineſs of the children is aſſerted.—By God's gracious covenant with the believer, <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy ſeed,</hi> where there is one parent thus related to God, and his gracious promiſe, the wickedneſs of the other can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> make null the promiſe; for the children are conſidered as ſtanding in relation to the believing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and holds that relation, to that parent and God's gracious covenant, as much as if the other parent had no being. 1 Cor. 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi>—As for your baptiſt nauſeous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the word <hi>holy,</hi> here in this place, <hi>that it means the children are not baſtards,</hi> I don't think it worth while to ſpend time to make a reply to it, ſeeing it is ſo mean a plea, to get by the force of our arguments, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confuted many a time already: only this I ſhall obſerve, that it ſeems to be evident, by the drift and ſcope of the apoſtle's argument, that <hi>that</hi> holineſs he there ſpoke of, was in conſequence of one of the parent's being a believer.</p>
            <p>

Furthermore, the new teſtament confirms our opinion, becauſe it ſpeaks of, and holds forth houſhold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, or that a figure of baptiſm. 1 Pet. 3.21. But if we deny houſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old baptiſm upon the account of the believing houſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>older, and hold that baptiſm is to be adminiſtred to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals upon their own perſonal right, it more lamely, if at all anſwers, the one to the other, as a figure. But if we conſider believing Noah taking his family into the ark, and thereby gives them a figurative ſalvation, that is, inſtrumentally by him, and upon his account they had it, and hereby, and herewith, he taught them, (for he was a preacher of righteouſneſs) what was neceſſary to their eternal ſalvation. And then view the figure in baptiſm, while the believing houſholder takes his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold under baptiſmal waſhing on his account, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them they muſt alſo be waſhed with the waſhing of regeneration and the renewings of the Holy Ghoſt, in order to eternal ſalvation; which is an acknowledgement that water baptiſm does not put away the filth of the fleſh; but in it there is <hi>the anſwer of a good conſcience,</hi> viz. in the houſholder, while he himſelf ſubjects to the ordinance of baptiſm, in the belief that his ſins are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away in the blood of Chriſt, and brings his children under baptiſmal waſhing or ſpringling, a figure of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſhing in the blood of ſprinkling which cleanſes from all ſin.</p>
            <p>Agreeable hereunto we find that upon the converſion of the head of a family, the houſhold was baptiſed, Acts 16 15.33. 1 Cor. 1.16. And altho' there is no mention made of infants, yet houſholds do include infants, and that is ſufficient for our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>So that believers under the goſpel, I mean ſuch of them who have their underſtandings fruitful in the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012076_0027_0F8993F2F44005B8"/>knowledge of the word and will of God, in this point, relating to the ſcriptural grounds and warrant for the practice of infant baptiſm, may unite and ſing, with the underſtanding, faith, and gratitude, to the glory of God and free grace, the following ſong, when they dedicate their children to God in baptiſm, viz.</p>

            <p>Perhaps, ſir, you will ſay, that if I intended to write upon this controverſy, I ought to have taken the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts arguments in courſe, and anſwered them in their order particularly. To which I anſwer, in a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What I aim'd at principally in this letter was to dwell upon the poſitive ſide, and eſtabliſh that, or rather ſhew the eſtabliſhment of that, and ſo meddle with no more of the baptiſts arguments than naturally fell in my way, in order for ſo doing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That method would be too long and tedious, and not at all conſiſtent with my deſigned brevity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I apprehend that there is no need of taking that method; for if I aim'd to kill a tree of vile fruit, I think one ſtroke well laid at the root, would do as much good as three or four ſtruck at the boughs and branches.—
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012076_0027_0F8993F2F44005B8"/>And what I have here written, and the plan I have gone upon, if it ſtands the trial of the written word, ſaps your ſcheme to the bottom, and overthrows it by the roots, that the boughs and branches muſt die of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; I mean in ſcripture-informed minds.—And if the ſubſtance of what I have here written, and the main drift and plan I have gone upon, will not ſtand the trial of God's written word, I will turn baptiſt myſelf, as ſoon as ever I am convinced of it. Not that I expect this will ever be; for I never was more fully eſtabliſhed in the ſcripture warrant for infant baptiſm, than I have been ſince I read your anſwer to Mr. F's letter; to ſee how, ſuch a writer as you, was obliged to miſinterpret the plain ſpirit and meaning of ſome parts of the ſcripture, in order to get along with your ſcheme.</p>
            <p>I know that the baptiſt pretend that they can raiſe ſo many and mighty objections againſt this ſcriptural plan, I have been attempting to point out, for the warrant of infant baptiſm, that thereby they think they can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. But I think if they ſhould raiſe as many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt this plan, as there are ſtars in the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, yet I apprehend, that with all their multitude and magnitude they muſt be driven back before it, and made to diſappear, as all the ſtars in the fimament are driven back and made to diſappear before the riſing ſun. So that virtually, all objections are anſwered already, in this ſcriptural plan eſtabliſhed, for the grounds and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for infant baptiſm. However, I will proceed to anſwer one or two of the heavieſt objections, that I know of, which you have againſt the practice, before I conclude this letter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Objection,</hi> That to baptiſe infants makes them members of the church, and gives them a right to the Lord's-ſupper, as circumciſion gave a right to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover; for if infants have a right to one ſeal, they muſt to the other; for captiſm is as ſacred an ordinance as the Lord's-ſupper; and if they have a right to both, this is
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012076_0028_0F8993F3B2AE1B18"/>to build the church with unconverted men, as ſuch, which is contrary to the general language of the new teſtament,</p>

            <p n="1">1. I acknowlege that ſome who hold to, and practice infant baptiſm, do improve it according to the objection above, and ſuppoſe that the infant baptiſed has a right to the Lord's-ſupper, without any true grace, or the profeſſon of any. But I ſuppoſe it to be an abuſe and wrong improvement of the doctrine and practice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm. But ſhall we reject infant baptiſm for that? If we reject every thing that has been abuſed, we muſt reject the whole bible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The objection, or objector, don't diſtinguiſh what kind of right, nor in what manner, the believer's infant has a right to baptiſm. The child of a believer has not a right to baptiſm by perſonal qualifications, but relative? that is, ſtanding ſo related to his believing parent: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God in his gracious and ſovereign pleaſure, was pleaſed ſo to couple the believer and his child to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this matter, that in the External adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of grace, one ſeal ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to both parent and Child. And Iſhmael, tho' a wicked Child, and turn'd out wicked in the end, yet had the ſame relative qualification that Iſaac had; that is, he ſtood ſo related to his godly Father, that by God's gracious Covenant, it became Abraham's duty, and Iſhmael's priviledge, to have the ſeal of Gods covenant, and the parent's faith, applied to the Child. But Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael abuſing his prilviledges, growing profane and wicked, and not having, nor producing the perſonal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications requiſite for a continuance in God's church, even under that (comparatively) dark diſpenſation, was rejected, and purged out. So the children of believers, being baptized, or having the ſeal of God's gracious covenant applied to them, under the goſpel diſpenſation, 'tis upon their relative qualification, and their right comes by their parents, or parent; God's covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012076_0028_0F8993F3B2AE1B18"/>ſtill the ſame, with the believer, <hi>thou and thy ſeed.</hi> But now if theſe baptiſed children come to the Lord's-table, they are the actors, and not their parents; and coming upon their own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal right, they muſt have the perſonal qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons requiſite; and the new teſtament ſhews what they be, and inſiſts much upon them; as faith and repentance, or in a word, the <hi>truth of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I remark a miſtake in the above objection. When the baptiſt perceive, we hold with them, that true grace is requiſite in order to come to the Lord's-ſupper, with the divine approbation, they ſeem to triumph in bringing this objection againſt us, viz. That we pretend to hold infant baptiſm, from circumciſion, and yet won't let them come to the Lord's-ſupper upon that; whereas circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, ſay they, gave the Iſraelites a right to the paſſover. But here is ſome miſtake, and the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt ſeem to be quite willing to join with the

But I apprehend two armies againſt the truth, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overthrow it; eſpecially when both are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in one miſtake. The miſtake is this; they
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012076_0029_0F8993F47550C5F0"/>ſay that circumciſion gave the Iſraelites a right to the paſſover; whereas I find there was a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of other things and circumſtances neceſſary, in order to attend the paſſover with the divine approbation. Look in Gen. 12. where the paſſover was firſt inſtituted, and there we find perſonal directions how &amp; after what manner the paſſover ought to be attended. They were to eat the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, to denote that repentance accompanies faith: That thoſe who feed on Chriſt, the Lamb of God by faith, do it with bitter repentance for ſin. So there were perſonal directions further, they were to eat the paſſover with their loins girded, ſhoes on their feet, and their ſtaves in their hands; and was this to ſhew that they were circumciſed? No, but to ſhew that they were perſonally, and actually in a marching poſture from Egypt to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, and that the power and ſtrength of Egypt, that night was broke. And afterwards they never were to eat the paſſover but in the circumſtance of being found ceremonially clean; as well as to be circumciſed. Circumciſion was a duty previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the eating of the paſſover, I allow; and ſo is baptiſm previous to the Lord's-ſupper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in order thereunto, but I can't allow it qualifies therefor, but where there is the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of other things, viz. thoſe perſonal qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations the goſpel requires; when any can come and feed on Chriſt the Lamb of God, with that faith which true repentance attends, and ſhew that they are in a marching poſture to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And yet if I form my opinion upon the baptiſts repreſentation of things I muſt conclude that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly God was ſolax &amp; indifferent, that he required, and was content with only ceremonial holineſs; but now is grown ſo ſevere that he requires, and nothing leſs will content him, than real holineſs in his people.</p>
            <p>But while I attend to theſe things, I find I am led where I am beſet on both ſides with objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and need the two edged ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, that will cut both ways, and make the path of truth appear, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the attempts to block it up with objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and truſting I have the ſame at hand, I ſhall make a reply here both ways, And</p>
            <p n="1">1. To a Stoddardean objection, which is, that we have no right to keep a baptiſed perſon from the Lord's-ſupper, if he be outwardly moral, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he has no true grace, nor ſo much as profeſſes it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On the other hand the baptiſts ſay, it does the child no good to baptiſe it before it has faith, this don't enable it to believe, nor ſecure it ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore it is no benefit at all.</p>
            <p>Now both theſe objections ariſe from one root, however different the aims and character of the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012076_0030_0F8993F53471DF70"/>parties may be who make them, viz. from this they both ariſe, <hi>a ſecret kind of taking it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that it is not a perſon's ſin, even under the light of the goſpel, that he don't truly believe in Chriſt, or become converted.</hi> Now if this ſuppoſition were true the objections might poſſibly have ſome grounds to ſtand upon, but it being falſe, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are only like caſtles in the air.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall reply to the Stoddardean objection. And as I remark'd before, one who comes to the Lord's-ſupper, as it is a perſonal act, ſo the agent muſt come upon his perſonal right, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt be poſſeſſed of the perſonal qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations required, which I think is not merely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm, nor an outward moral life, but true faith. And as this might be proved from the new teſtament in general, ſo from the 11th. ch. of Rom. in particular. Paul is here ſpeaking of the Jews who were broken off from their church-ſtate by unbelief, and the Gentile church, who was grafted in by faith. Now the unbelief of the Jews who were broken off, and the faith of the Gentiles who were grafted in, are oppoſed to each other. But the unbelief of the Jews was damning, therefore the faith of the Gentiles was ſaving. And without any departure, or diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this kind of faith by which the Gentile church at firſt was grafted in, Paul tells them they muſt ſtand. <hi>Thou</hi> (O Gentile church) <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by faith.</hi> But what does Paul mean by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Why in continuance; as his own words explain, Be not high-minded but fear; for if God ſpared not the natural branches, viz. the Jews,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012076_0030_0F8993F53471DF70"/>take heed leſt hé ſpare not you. So that the Gentile church is to ſtand in continuance in that relation to God as his church, by <hi>ſaith,</hi> and not by baptiſm in infancy and outward morality merely, as the Stoddardean prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple pleads they may. But if the natural ſeed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who are diſtinguiſhed from other children, by God's ſovereign appointment, and their parent's act, and brought under the bond and ſeal of God's coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and hereby into an external nearneſs to God, and laid under additional obligations to repent of ſin, believe in Chriſt, chooſe God for their only portion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly to dedicate themſelves to him, even for time and eternity: I ſay, if they refuſe to do this, in theſe circumſtances, and continue in poſſitive damning unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, refuſing Chriſt, &amp; a cordial compliance with the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; they not only judge themſelves unworthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, but hereby render themſelves unworthy of a continuance in God's viſible church in the goſpel day, which is to ſtand in continuance, by ſaith; therefore ſuch muſt go out like a wicked Iſhmael, and a profane Eſau, who ſold his birth-right; and the blame muſt lie upon themſelves, and not upon God, who appoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s rules, nor upon his church who attends to them. But O! is not this hard? I anſwer, That if impenitency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in theſe circumſtances, was only their calamity &amp; not their ſin, it would be hard indeed: but if unbelief is their ſin, and the greateſt of ſins, in theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I don't know who would think this hard, that won't think damnation harder, to be inflicted for the ſame ſin.</p>
            <p>But a Stoddardean, upon the principle, will ſay, no, it is unreaſonable that a baptiſed child ſhould go out of God's viſible church, &amp; his ſeed with him, &amp; to become heathen, for the want of true faith; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſhall preſerve to himſelf and his poſterity a ſtanding in the church of God: that is, let him profeſs his ſpeculative
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012076_0031_0F8993F5F2FE94A8"/>faith and moral ſincerity, and he ſhall obtain a right to the Lord's-ſupper for himſelf, and baptiſm for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Therefore I ſuppoſe one breathing out the very ſpirit of the Stoddardean principle, may addreſs himſelf to a baptiſed child, now grown to adult years, and has children of his own, after this manner; <q>O! to my grief and ſorrow, I find that there is ſome ſuch cruel miniſters and churches in the land, who would ſain be ſo ſevere to perſons in your circumſtances, as to hold you off from the Lord's-table, and deny you baptiſm for your children, and cauſe that you, at leaſt that your children become heathen, becauſe you han't that ſpecial grace of faith, belonging, and peculiar to regenerate men; when notwithſtanding you are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſo many amiable qualities and virtues. I ſee you have a good converſation, a civil and moral life; and you hold to orthodox principles, and are ready to profeſs your ſpeculative ſaith and moral ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and willingneſs, on this wiſe, to come under covenant engagements to ſerve God for the future, as far as by his grace he ſhall enable you. God forbid that his miniſters and churches ſhould deny you and your children ordinances, and a continuance in the church upon ſuch an upright profeſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the principle ſooths up, and flatters the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, as tho' it was not his ſin that he don't truly believe, provided he is willing to come forward in the profeſſion and practice of the externals of religion. But I don't find that the goſpel thus paliates the ſoul-dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſin of unbelief, neither will it compound matters with the unbeliever, and accept of other things, in the liou of true faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And from the ſame root, as I ſaid, as ſuppoſing that unbelief is not much of a ſin, if any, does the baptiſt objection ariſe when they ſay, it does the child of a believer no good to baptiſe it before it has ſaith, for baptiſm don't ſecure ſalvation to the child, nor enable it to believe, &amp;c. To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:012076_0031_0F8993F5F2FE94A8"/>
The queſtion is not whether baptiſm ſecures the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the child of a believer, not whether it enables the child to believe. But the queſtion is whether the child is not hereby bro't under an additional obligation to believe and repent; and whether thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> additional ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation thus to do, is not a great privilege, and of the nature of a mercy: and this is what I aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt. But if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and unbelief is not the ſin of every man who enjoys the light of the goſpel, and continues therein, then the obligation to believe and repent can't be more bin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing in one circumſtance than another: and the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed child of a true believer, who by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the parent's act, is brought under the bond &amp; ſeal of the covenant, is not additionally bound to believe and repent. But if it be a duty to believe and repent truly and ſavingly, then the obligation to perform this duty may admit of degrees, and the higheſt degree the greateſt mercy. And God has a ſovereing right to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſome with a greater obligation laid upon them to believe and repent, than others. As for inſtance: A child born and bro't up in a land of goſpel light, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a greater obligation to love, fear, and ſerve God, than one born and brought up in a land of heatheniſh darkneſs. And this obligation is a great mercy &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, as all will allow; and beſtowed in a way of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty; for he came into being and exiſtance in this ſituation, without any planning or contrivance of his own; and here he is bound. O bleſſed bond! the ſtronger the better; but if broken, the condemnation will be the greater. And what hinders but that there may be higher degrees of obligations laid upon ſome child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in way of ſovereignty than what I have mentioned? even by God's appointment to be born in a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal nearneſs to him, than barely in a land of goſpel light; to ſtand ſo related to God, &amp; his church, as that by the external adminiſtration of the covenant of grace, to be placed under the bond and ſeal of it? Who dare
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012076_0032_0F8993F6B357EFA8"/>ſay this is not a mercy and privilege? or that there is no additional bonds to God in this ſtanding? Although thro' the ſin of unbelief, many times, the privileges are miſimproved, &amp; the obligations with all their ſtrength are broken, and the children of the kingdom, in this ſenſe, are finally caſt out and rejected of God; but they could not be caſt out of God's kingdom, if they had not had, in ſome ſenſe, a ſtanding in it.</p>
            <p>If men are not, and cannot be laid under obligations to believe and repent truly then I allow that the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be increaſed by difference of circumſtances; and for the children of believers to be included in the external adminiſtration of the covenant of grace, and to be baptiſed in infancy, does them no good. But I truſt that thro' grace. I never ſhall be left to embrace ſuch corrupt
<note n="†" place="bottom">Here, ſir, I would juſt put you in mind, that your great and celebrated Dr. Gill, whoſe writings you recommend ſo much, with all his eminency and greatneſs, has made a great miſtake in a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial point in divinity. I mention it becauſe there are many in the land who ſwallow down ſuch divinity as ſound and good.—Some years ago, I read a pamphlet with a preſace by Dr. Gill, who recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the book as good, and the divinity as ſound; but when I came to read it, I was ſurpriſed to find that Dr. Gill ſhould recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſuch ſtuff as good divinity. Now the author's name I have forgot, but the divinity of it (if it will do to call it by that name) I well remember. The author, ſpeaking of the final condemnation of the wicked, who periſh from under the light of the goſpel, ſaid, they would not be condemned becauſe they did not <hi>believe</hi> truly, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſaving faith, and repent evangelically: but they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned becauſe they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d not improve their hiſtorical faith, or ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative faith, in a better manner. And the weak grounds he thought to ſupport it upon, was this, that true faith, and true repentance, are the ſpecial gift of God, and therefore ſeem'd to think it could not be their ſin not to exerciſe theſe graces, unleſs God had actually firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them upon the ſinner. But this divinity and argument would excuſe the devil in hell, and the wickedeſt man on earth, from any blame for not loving God with all their hearts. For love to God is as much the ſpecial gift of God to a ſinner, as faith and repentance is; and if God don't give this ſpecial gift of love to himſelf, to the ſinner, he muſt excuſe the ſinner from blame and puniſhment, according to this argument, if the ſinner don't love God; altho' if the ſinner don't make as good an improvement of his common grace as he can, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent: with his reigning enmity, he ſhall be damned for that.—In a word, it ſeems by ſuch divinity, that all proper ideas of man's moral obligations to perfect holineſs, is entirely loſt; for what is the exerciſe of true faith, and evangelical repentance, but particular branches of holineſs? and ſuch branches of it too, as ſhews that the ſubject thereof is greatly wanting as to the degree of holineſs, which the moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations he is under, binds him unto.</note> divinity.</p>

2. Objection. To baptiſe infants, is to make the church national under the goſpel, like the jewiſh church, whereas according to the new teſtament, the church is conſidered as congregational only.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if infant baptiſm is ſupported by the word of God, then it may and ought to be practiced, let it make the church national, or what it will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the objection is not true; infant baptiſm does not make the church national, as to the eſſence of thoſe things which denominated the jewiſh church national.— While the jewiſh church was national, their worſhip &amp; diſcipline was ſo; they muſt come ſo often to Jeruſalem to worſhip, and had they ſet up the like worſhip any where elſe, they would have been guilty of idolatry. But under the goſpel, the worſhip is not fixed; <hi>neither in this mountain, nor at Jeruſalem, but they are the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers who worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the diſcipline of the church under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, it is congregational, with reſpect to the gathering, building, organiſing, cleanſing, or whatſoever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order for the well being thereof; I ſay it is, or may be altogether congregational, and not a whit the leſs ſo becauſe the individual members dedicate their children to God in baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Objection. But the plain letter of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, <hi>believe and be baptiſed</hi> To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That the church was then firſt gathering and forming upon the goſpel plan, and thoſe of whom it was required that they ſhould believe in order to receive baptiſm, were adult perſons, and coming to that ordinance upon
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012076_0033_0F8993F84FC5B458"/>their own perſonal right; and hence the perſonal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications were demanded: tho' it appears, that ſome ſuch brought their houſholds with them, and it ſeems, as I apprehend, were baptiſed upon their relative quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, as I before noted, and ſo ſhall not add here.— If I was going among the heathen, or in this land either, to baptiſe any upon their own perſonal right, I ſhould ſay, if thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt, and not elſe.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude this letter, I would juſt remark a word or two upon ſome things I find in your anſwer to Mr. F's letter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the 73 pag. you charge it upon the principle and practice of infant baptiſm, without making any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that ſuch parents cry peace, peace to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when there is no peace.</p>
            <p>Now I acknowlege that there is a diſpoſition in the fallen race of man, to cry peace, peace to themſelves, and to their children too, when God ſays there is no peace. And many who practice infant baptiſm, are awfully guilty herein, no doubt. But this is not to be charged upon the principle, but another cauſe. I have known ſome baptiſts, the rankeſt ſort of Arminians, but I never thought of fathering arminianiſm upon the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts principles, but upon another cauſe, viz. <hi>The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane nature, together with ſatan's influence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, on the other hand, there are ſome, not to ſay many, that go by the denomination of baptiſt, who were dipt deeper in the antinomian ſpirit than ever they were in the water; and from thence growing expert in ſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their invectives, againſt Babylon, anti-chriſt &amp; tradition, without making any proper diſtinctions; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling every thing to be ſuch that don't fellowſhip them in their antinomian travel, they commence very ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual chriſtians in their own op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012076_0033_0F8993F84FC5B458"/>of the law, with them is reproached as legal; and to preach up conviction, converſion, chriſtian experience and a growing conformity to God, in the work of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, with them is termed old faſhion religion, that uſed to be in vogue when religion run low. They are after higher things, and more glorious, in their own view, than merely increaſe of holineſs, growth in ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and greater and greater conformity to God, viz. the travel of Zion according to the work and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in the ſpirit, as having out grown, and left all creeds, articles of faith, principles, and written church-covenants as merely a dead letter, belonging to anti-chriſt's kingdom. And hence they are always a building, &amp; always a breaking: always upon the theme of union, and yet always contending; always right, and yet always altering; always in ſome glorious travel, but never get along (in the right way) a ſtep. Now if I ſhould meaſure the baptiſt principles and people, all off in a lump, by the principles and practices of theſe ſort of baptiſts I have above mentioned, you would, I doubt not, think it was unfair dealing; and yet, it would be doing but as you have done, while you charge it upon the principle, and all who hold and practice infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, of crying peace, peace to our children, as if ſafe enough, when we have once baptiſed them. Whereas this ſuggeſtion is a vile and wicked ſlander, let the man be ever ſo good from whom is came. For when, thro' grace, we act up to our principles, we are ſo far from crying peace, peace to our baptiſed children, that we cry wrath! wrath! the heavieſt end of the divine wrath will enevitably fall upon them, if they go on in ſin, and remain impenitent, ſeeing God has exalted them ſo high in point of privileges.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I remark, that with a good deal of ſatire and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, (not to ſay inſult) you attempt to reproach Mr. F. and all in general who have wrote in favour of infant baptiſm, that they uſe great ambiguity of words in this
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012076_0034_0F8993F8F3D47A78"/>controverſy; ſo that their ways, like the harlots, are <hi>moveable that one cannot know them</hi>—But in ſo doing, you bring to my mind the apoſtle's ſevere reprimand, Rom. 2 11 <hi>Thou therefore which teacheſt another, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not thy ſelf? thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal?</hi> v. 1. <hi>Wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt doth the ſame things.</hi> Yea, the very ſame that thou chargeſt them of doing. It is really marvellous to ſee with what ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity you expreſs yourſelf; a little hint by way of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen, I will here juſt drop. When you are denying the covenant with Abraham to be the covenant of grace, you ſay, <hi>the letter of it was do and live.</hi> Now I would aſk whether you mean by this, that the letter of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's covenant contradicted the true nature and ſpirit of it? if you don't, then I would aſk again, Whether you really mean, that Abraham's covenant, which you ſay was <hi>do and live,</hi> was an Adam's covenant of works, which required perfect doing, as a condition of life? Now if you meant thus, it would ſo unavoidably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve you into ſuch abſurdities that I don't know how to think you really meant ſo. Therefore you have hid your meaning under ambiguous terms, unleſs you meant to uſe ambiguity upon deſign, which to me is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. So again, ſpeaking of Abraham's covenant, you uſe thoſe ſcripture expreſſions where God told Abraham, when he had enjoin'd circumciſion upon him, <hi>And my covenant ſhall be in your fleſh.</hi> But you uſe them ſo ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guouſly that you don't diſtinguiſh whether you mean, as the ſcripture explains, that the token of God's cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould be in their fleſh, or the eſſence of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but the latter of which, with ambiguity of words you attempt to inſinuate. So ſometimes you ſeem to repreſent Abraham's covenant to be neither the coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of works nor the covenant of grace; at other times almoſt conceed that it was the covenant of grace: But your words are ſo ambiguous, and ways ſo moveable, that I cannot know them.</p>

3. I would remark a word or two upon the general vein, and ſtrain of your writings upon this ſubject. And truly, ſurpriſing it might well ſeem, to a chriſtian and catholic mind, to obſerve how that your principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and narrow up, with ſuch rigid ſuperſtition, a mind, which otherwiſe might be conſidered as noble, excellent, and praiſe-worthy. Placing the very offence of baptiſm in being put wholly under water; of which I ſhall not make any particular reply in this letter, for it has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſwelled in my hands much beyond my firſt intention, neither do I look upon the <hi>mode</hi> ſo material, as the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of baptiſm.—You write with ſuch peremptory airs of boaſt, as being, by way of eminence, in the cauſe of God, while you are ſetting yourſelf againſt infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and triumph ſo much in the ſuppoſed clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, if a man was to drop out of the clouds, wholly ignorant of the ſcriptures in general, and this controverſy in particular, and was to read your anſwer to Mr F's letter, and to form up a judgment by your repreſentation of things there, he would go nigh to think that there was no man of ſenſe, underſtanding nor conſcience in favour of infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And it ſeems by the ſpirit of your writings, that you mean to inſinuate and impoſe this notion on the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and credulous, that as faſt as any come to act honeſtly for the truth of reformation, and the cauſe of God, they come into your ſentiments and practice in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe things. And it ſeems as if you was ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that what Job ſaid once ſatirically concerning his three friends, ought to be applied to you and your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in ſober ſincerity. <hi>Doubtleſs ye are the people, and wiſdom ſhall die with you.</hi> But I query in this caſe, what would be the harm, and wherein the impropriety? if we ſhould repeat Job's words here, which his friends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted

Are ye miniſters of Chriſt? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I have obſerved, ſir, that with other things in your public writings, you have wrote, three or four times at leaſt, in the vindication of your peculiar, baptiſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and never have yet had, as I have known, or heard of any particular antagoniſt, in thoſe points, that has appeared to write againſt you. And it ſeems that you began to think that the day was your own, that you had ſtop'd every bodies mouth, or at leaſt had ſtruck all with ſuch intimidating fear, that there was not one ſtripting left who dare encounter with this great Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, that has been theſe ſeveral times, defying one branch of the army of the living God, viz. the little children of his gracious covenant, and viſible kingdom.—And it ſeems you have lifted your ſails rather too high—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to triumph before you h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſay, ſuch will ſee a ſolid foundation and ſcripture warrant for infant baptiſm, and feel firm and ſtable in the point, altogether unmoved, as having firm ground to ſtand upon, even in ſhaking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As God has united all true believers with Abraham, in the bleſſings of the one and ſame covenant, ſo all ſuch as have their underſtandings fruitful herein, will unite with Abraham, not only in acknowledging the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings thereof as it reſpects themſelves perſonally, but their ſeed alſo. While others who are wanting in fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of knowlege and underſtanding herein; altho' they profeſs to be the children of Abraham, yet in this point will not do the works of Abraham, but deny the ſeal of God's gracious covenant to their children, <hi>this did not Abraham.</hi>

            <p>AS in the foregoing letter I have wrote, as the grounds and warrant for infant baptiſm, the true ſentiments of my own mind, as it has been led, I truſt, to take the truth from the word of God it ſelf, and not from humane teſtimony; ſo I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with taking but very little notice, of what others have wrote on my ſide the queſtion before me.—So on the other hand, I don't pretend I have attended cloſely to a multitude of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which baptiſt authors have advanced to ſupport their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, only juſt ſome of them which fell in my way. For my deſign and aim has been, in the above letter, to dwell mainly on the poſitive ſide, and ſhew the ſcripture eſtabliſhment thereof — And if what I have advanced on the poſitive ſide, for the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of infant baptiſm, won't ſtand the trial of God's written word: tis not the anſwering of a thouſand particular baptiſt arguments will make it ſtand: but if the ground work and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation I have gone upon, is warranted by the ſcripture, then I think I may be excuſed from being obliged to go the tedious round of all particulars. Or if hereafter I ſhould judge it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and think I have a call thereto in providence, to anſwer any oppoſing arguments to the plan I have here laid down, I am ready to perſwade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſelf they may all be ſhielded off, in a ſhort
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012076_0036_0F8993FA73E5D7C8"/>and conciſe manner.—Therefore I give this public no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that if you, ſir, or any other baptiſt writer ſhall pretend to anſwer this foregoing letter, and don't attend immediately and directly to the ground work I have laid down; but leaving that unmoleſted, at leaſt I mean if you don't attempt to moleſt it, but hover round about, or dwell upon other points, I ſhall look upon it ſo impertinent a performance, in all probability, that I ſhall not think it worthy of any further reply.</p>
            <p>But to this it may be you will anſwer, that you alſo have been upon the poſitive ſide, endeavouring to ſhew the ſcripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the baptiſt principles, and had as good a right to require me to attend directly to your plan, and the ground-work thereof, but ſeeing I have took another method, you have a right to call my performance ſo impertinent a piece that it deſerves no anſwer.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould ſay thus, I am willing to ſay amen to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy; for I am far from deſiring to continue in it; but let the judicious and impartial judge which of theſe two poſitives, your ſide the queſtion and mine, both pretending to a ſcripture warrant; I ſay, let the judicious judge which in reality has it.</p>
            <p>In the ſchool of Chriſt we muſt, and may, learn to diſtinguiſh between a man and his ſentiments. The <hi>man</hi> we <hi>muſt</hi> love, his <hi>ſentiments</hi> we may hate. And thro' grace, I truſt I can ſay, truly, I remain a cordial friend to your perſon, altho' I have appeared againſt your ſentiments.</p>
