            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Treatiſe diſtributes the <hi>Whole Concern</hi> or <hi>Duty of a Chriſtian</hi> into the things which he ought to <hi>Know,</hi> and thoſe which he ought to <hi>Do.</hi> For the former are our Concern as well as the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Chriſtianity conſiſts in <hi>Principles</hi> as well as <hi>Practice</hi>: And therefore if we would approve our ſelves to be complete Chriſtians, we muſt take care of both theſe. In the Doctrinal part of this Book I have preſented the Reader with all the neceſſary Truths of Chriſtianity, and in the Practical part I have ſet down the peculiar &amp; proper Offices of All Perſons of what rank or quality ſoever, even of Rulers and Magiſtrates. Nor have I omitted the Duty of Spiritual Governors, that is, Paſtors and Teachers; for the Reader
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:039825_0003_10148C533A9669C0"/>
might juſtly think we are very Partial, when we pretend to aſſign the <hi>Whole Concern of Man,</hi> and yet omit our <hi>Own</hi> Duty.</p>
            <p>I have much Enlarged (beyond the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion &amp; length which I have obſerved in other Heads) on that of <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children, Maſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Miſtreſſes of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> and their <hi>Charge,</hi> but let it not be accounted as a fault, for I intended this Book chiefly for Houſholders and their Families, and therefore it was proper to <hi>Inſiſt</hi> on thoſe Duties which more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concern theſe.</p>
            <p>So as to the <hi>Reaſons</hi> &amp; <hi>Motives</hi> which I have uſed to excite to the practice of the Duties Diſcourſed of, I have more than ordinarily brought them forth when I had occaſion to make my Application to Parents &amp; Heads of Families, not only becauſe <hi>theſe</hi> generally need them moſt, but becauſe here they will have the <hi>greateſt</hi> Influence, and the <hi>largeſt</hi> Effect, if they prove ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>I have added a particular Diſcourſe
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:039825_0004_10148C8C8AEDF940"/>
concerning the nature of that <hi>Preparation</hi> which every Chriſtian ought to make for <hi>Death:</hi> which is a very uſeful and neceſſary Subject, and therefore could not be omitted.</p>
            <p>As to the wording and phraſing of the whole, tho' I did not intend it ſhould be ſo Plain as that there ſhould be nothing to entertain the Learned, yet I have calculated it chiefly for thoſe that are of ordinary underſtanding and low capacity, and accordingly I have uſed a free &amp; facile way of Expreſſion, as moſt ſuitable to that rank of Perſons.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Devotional</hi> Part, I have compoſed it not only of Prayers to be uſed in the Cloſet, but by the Family together, not being willing to be guilty of that Defect which is obſervable in the Book Entitled, <hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> where there is not one Family-Prayer for Mornings or Evenings. To render this part of the Book as unexceptionable as I could, I have conſulted and made ſome uſe of ſeveral <hi>Forms of Devotion</hi> publiſh'd by ſome of our moſt Eminent Divines
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:039825_0005_10148C55CD160960"/>
for the needs of pious &amp; well-diſpoſed Christians, that the Reader might have <hi>Choice</hi> of Words to expreſs his devout thoughts when he addreſſes himſelf to the Almighty.</p>
            <p>May the Divine Bleſſing vouchſafe to make the Whole ſerviceable to the Great Ends it was deſign'd for, the <hi>Glory of the Eternal Being,</hi> and the <hi>Welfare of Mens Souls.</hi>

In the <hi>Afternoon</hi> or <hi>Evening</hi> call your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily again together, and read one of the <hi>Chapters</hi> of this Book, in order as they lie: and ſo by reading a Chapter every Lord's Day, the whole Book will be read out thrice in a Year. And thereby your Family will be fully inſtructed not only in the <hi>Practical</hi> part of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, but in all the neceſſary <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of it, which of late are much neglected. When the Chapter is read over, Pray one of the Prayers which is appointed for the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> in the <hi>Evening,</hi> together with any other Prayer that you think ſin.</p>
            <p>On other days of the Week uſe the reſt of the Prayers continually, namely the Prayers for <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. BEFORE I proceed to diſcourſe of the ſeveral Particulars of the <hi>Whole Concern of Man,</hi> it will be requiſite in the firſt place to <hi>prepare</hi> the Reader by convincing him of the <hi>Neceſſity of the Care which be ought to have of his Soul.</hi> For unleſs he be throughly perſwaded of this, he will never think himſelf concern'd in the Directions that I ſhall lay down. We ſee daily that the greateſt Care of the generality of Men, is to ward off
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039825_0009_10148C5ACA29C2C8"/>
dangers from their Bodies and Eſtates, to guard and ſecure theſe by all means poſſible from thoſe Evils which they are moſt incident to; they very induſtriouſly take care to prevent Sickneſs and Poverty, and to live in Health and Eaſe, and to grow Rich in the World: but in the mean time they neglect a far greater and weightier Concern, and wilfully pull down all manner of Evil and Miſchief upon their Beſt and moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Part, their <hi>Souls.</hi> But certainly they muſt be reckon'd as very Unwiſe Perſons who act after this rate, and indamage theſe latter to ſecure and ſave the former, namely, their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Bodily Concerns. And on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is the trueſt Wiſdom, and the moſt rational Love of our ſelves, to prefer our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Souls</hi> before all worldly intereſts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages whatſoever. For a Mans <hi>Soul</hi> is his richeſt and moſt precious Treaſure: and the whole World is too mean a Price for it. This is the ſenſe of our Infallible Maſter in thoſe Words of his, Matth. 16.26. <hi>What is a Man profiled if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. In which Admirable Paſſage there is obſervable, Firſt a double Suppoſition, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a double Poſition or Concluſion grounded on thoſe Suppoſitions. The things ſuppoſed are, 1. That a Man may <hi>loſe his Soul.</hi> 2. That with the loſs of his <hi>Soul</hi> he may <hi>gain the whole World.</hi> For it is ſaid, <hi>If he ſhall gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul.</hi> The Things that are poſitively aſſerted and infer'd from this two-fold
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039825_0010_10148C958BF44D80"/>
Suppoſal are, 1. That the Man who gains the World and loſes his Soul, receives no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or profit by ſuch Gain. 2. That this wretched Man, having loſt his Soul, cannot poſſibly redeem and regain it, or give or take any thing in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>So then, theſe four following Propoſitions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the full meaning of our Saviour's words. The Firſt is this, that there are ſome Men, and thoſe too many in the World, who not only hazard but loſe their Souls. The Second is, that it often happens that their gaining of the World is attended with this loſs of their Souls. The Third is, that though Men gain the World, and yet loſe their Immortal Souls, they are unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loſers by ſuch a Bargain. The Fourth and laſt is, that there can be no Satisfaction or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe made for the loſs of a Mans Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. I begin with the Firſt of theſe, namely, that there are ſome Men, and thoſe too many, who not only hazard but loſe their Souls. Though this be a kind of <hi>Suppoſition</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd words of our Saviour, yet it is a moſt Poſitive Truth in it ſelf. This is too ſadly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, that the Sinner <hi>destroys his own Soul.</hi> Prov. 6.32. Not that the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man ſhall ceaſe to be,<note place="margin">Mans Soul may be loſt.</note> nor that it ſhall periſh, and vaniſh into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for it is an Immortal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is not capable of being deſtroy'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Almighty Power of God who created it. But he hath plainly declared that it is his Will and Pleaſure that Souls ſhall always exiſt, and remain either in Eernal Bliſs or Miſery.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039825_0011_10148C5F2B19C870"/>
By the <hi>loſs of the Soul</hi> then we are not groſly to imagine any ſuch thing as its being reduced to nothing: we cannot ſo <hi>loſe our Souls</hi> as that they ſhall not continue to have a being. What is the meaning then of <hi>loſing the Soul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, this may be learnt from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Word, that is, the Word which the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt here uſes; this ſignifies not only <hi>detriment</hi> or <hi>damage,</hi> but it denotes likewiſe <hi>privation</hi> or <hi>loſs</hi>: and ſo it may convey to us this double notion of the Souls being <hi>loſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">As given up to Sin in this Life, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in the next.</note> namely Firſt, in this Life, by the Damage it receives by Sin; Secondly, in the other Life, by the Deprivation of Glory, and excluſion from Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. There is a Temporary, and there is a Final Loſs of the Soul: and it is only Sin or departing from God which procures this Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>He that Converteth a Sinner ſaveth a Soul,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> ch. 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. Whence I gather, that if the Converſion of Sinners be the <hi>Saving</hi> of Souls; then by the Rule of Contraries, the <hi>Loſing</hi> of them is when they are Perverted and drawn away, Corrupted and Debauched by Luſt and Vice, when they contract habits of Sin, and perſiſt in them, and Revolt from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Redeemer, and are ſhut out from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and incur his wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Then they are properly ſaid to be <hi>loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. So they are ſaid to be more ſignally when this diſpleaſure follows them into the other World, and places them in the forlorn Condition
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039825_0012_10148C986705BF00"/>
of the Damned Spirits of Darkneſs. Then they are irrecoverably loſt in Hell, and Mercy it ſelf cannot retrieve them, for they are abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of God's Favour, debar'd of his preſence, ſhut out from it as Reprobates and Caſtaways, and irreverſibly deſtined to endleſs Torments. Hence our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlators have thus rendred that paralel Place in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in Chapter 9. ver. 25. <hi>What is a Man advantaged if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe himſelf, or be caſt away?</hi> Whereby they would let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that then a Man may properly be ſaid to <hi>loſe himſelf</hi> or his <hi>Soul,</hi> when he is <hi>caſt away</hi>; that is, caſt out of God's favour, which alone can create Eaſe and happineſs; when he is Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rejected by the Almighty, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied all tenders of Grace and Mercy. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt neceſſarily follow a moſt dreadful Horror and diſtraction of Mind, and the moſt exquiſite Pain and Torture: ſuch as no thoughts can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently conceive, no Tongue is able to expreſs; for in this the Torments of Hell, and the Joys of Heaven reſemble one another, that they are both Unutterable. It is impoſſible to tell you fully what the Damned loſe, and what they ſuffer; what they are deprived of, and what they feel.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Let us, before we paſs to the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſtand a while and ſeriouſly lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the forlorn ſtate of <hi>loſt Souls.</hi> I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you a brief repreſentation of it; and now let us ask our ſelves what can we imagine more ſad and dreadful? It would be well for the Sinner, if he could <hi>loſe his Soul</hi> in the Senſe which I firſt of all mention'd, that is, if he could ſlide into
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039825_0013_10148C60B03650D0"/>
nothing, and for ever ceaſe to be. But the will not be granted him: for he muſt remained Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monument of the divine diſpleaſure. This is the heighth of his Miſery, that he ſhall have a Never-failing Exiſtence, and his portion ſhall be in that <hi>Lake</hi> which Perpetually <hi>burns with Fire and Brimstone, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi> This the Holy and Infallible Book of God acquaints us with: and yet how Great are the Numbers of Men in the World, who throw themſelves into theſe Flames, and wilfully plunge themſelves into that horrible Lake, who not only <hi>Hazard</hi> but <hi>Loſe</hi> their Souls? <hi>Broad is the gate that leads to Deſtruction, and Many there are that go in thereat,</hi> and ſo are Everlaſtingly excluded from all hopes of Life and Salvation. Theſe Miſerable &amp; beſotted Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, though perhaps they ſufficiently underſtood their Duty, yet wilfully neglected the practice of it. They ruſh'd into danger, &amp; ſeem'd to court Death &amp; Deſtruction, neither minding the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgments of God, nor being affected with the Kindneſs &amp; Obligations they daily received from him. They cared not how they were to fare hereafter, ſo they might be Permitted to Gratify and Indulge their deſires here. They were no ways ſollicitous for the Future, but it was their Preſent Advantage only that they buſied themſelves about. And in this oftentimes they are thriving and ſucceſsful enough, but yet ſo as that they but the <hi>World</hi> with the Price of their <hi>Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Which brings me to the <hi>Second</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſition, which is this, that too often it happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the loſs of their Souls. Whilſt they purchaſe Earth, they loſe Heaven: they graſp at things Temporal, and let go thoſe that are Eternal. Or, <hi>to gain the whole World,</hi> in the fulleſt mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour's Words is this, To climb as high in the World as a Mans Avarice or Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can carry him, to immerſe himſelf as deep as he can in the delights of Senſe, to attain to as ample a fruition of Earthly Poſſeſſions as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to live in ſplendor and gallantry, to be Great and Powerful, to be Rich and Wealthy, to enjoy the affluence of all ſenſual pleaſures, and to have what heart can wiſh. And now I believe you perceive already, that we are in a fair way to prove the Propoſition: for whilſt the unbridled appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of Men are let looſe to the enjoyment of all they deſire and covet after, it is no wonder that their <hi>Immortal Souls</hi> are hazarded. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of the Parts in this clauſe of our Saviours Words, is no uncommon thing in the obſervation of all Intelligent Perſons. The <hi>Gain</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> is joyn'd with the <hi>loſs</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi> The frequent Examples of Mankind do too evidently evince, that Wealth and Worldly poſſeſſions are held without Vertue and real Goodneſs; nay, that theſe are too often made inſtrumental to the greateſt Vices: they uſually promote in Mens minds Luſt and Pride, forgetfulneſs of God, and a hatred of Goodneſs, a Prophane and Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirit, and an utter diſregard of another Life.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Would you know (or rather be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded of) the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this? It is no other then this, that it is hard to gain the World, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039825_0015_10148C638190CD78"/>
not let our Hearts upon it: and hence it is, that our never-dying Souls.<note place="margin">The immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate gain of the World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers the loſs of the Soul.</note> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by the acquiſition of theſe Temporal and Tranſitory Goods.

                     </gap>.</hi> 13.22. This Cheat, this Deluſion is too apparent in the World, and the ſad effects of it redo and to the depraving and corrupting our Better Part. What do not the Immoderate care and Sollicitude about this World betray men to? What do not this Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Love and Delight invite Men to, and even thruſt them upon? ſo true is that of the Wiſe Man, [<hi>He that maketh haſts to be Rich, ſhall not be Innocent.</hi>] Prov. 28.20. Which Words plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly import more than they expreſs; for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſpeaks of, is ſo far from being <hi>Innocent</hi> that he unavoidably involves himſelf in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Guilt,</hi> and runs into the worſt of diſorders and miſdemeanors. Thus the Traytor <hi>Judas</hi> was betray'd (if I may ſo ſay) into that Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Villany of Selling his Maſter by his Coveting the 30 Pieces of Silver. The true cauſe of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s forſaking St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and Apoſtatizing from his Chriſtian courſe, was his <hi>loving of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.10. This <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> of <hi>Mammon</hi> might be Demonſtrated in Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable other Inſtances, which I now forbear.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. I could Evidence to you likewiſe, that it not only Cheats Men of their Faith &amp; Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of Heaven and Eternal Happineſs, which indeed neceſſarily follows on the other. There are Two Notable Parables left us by our Saviour,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039825_0016_10148C9E4552B778"/>
to put us in Mind of this. The Firſt is of the <hi>Rich Man,</hi> Luke. 12.16. Who Built larger Barns and Granaries to Lodge his Stores and Proviſions in, and then Sung this <hi>Requiem</hi> to his Soul, [<hi>Thou hast much Goods lay'd up for many Years, Eat, Drink, and be merry.</hi>] But mark what was ſaid unto him by God, [<hi>Thou Fool, this Night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee.</hi>] The Loſs of his <hi>Soul,</hi> yea and the Eternal Perdition of it, was the Lamentable cloſe of all his Gains. The Reading or Hearing of this, ſhould ſtartle the Wealthieſt Poſſeſſors of this Worlds Goods, and remind them to ſecure their Intereſt <hi>Above,</hi> that when their Earthly Mammon fails, they may be receiv'd into <hi>Everlaſting Habitations.</hi> They have need of Repeating Our Church's Litany, <hi>In all time of our Wealth, Good Lord deliver us.</hi> They have Reaſon to Pray, and that moſt heartily, that they may not be ſo buſy in Gaining the Riches of this World, as thereby to hazard their welfare in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Other Parable is of the <hi>Wealthy Glutton, who Fared Deliciouſly every Day,</hi> Luke. 16.19. But in the 23. ver. You find him <hi>in Hell, lifting up his Eyes, being in Torments,</hi> beholding that Happineſs which he could not come at, and Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for that Refreſhment which he was never like to obtain. And what was the Reaſon? Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he had wilfully Excluded himſelf by his Voluptuous and Luxurious Living, by Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Glutting himſelf with the Delights of this Life, and never thinking of another. Theſe are very Lively Repreſentations and Convictions of the Truth of what we have been treating of.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039825_0017_10148C67CEBAFB18"/>
Therefore let us make this Excellant Uſe of it, to be exceeding Careful and Watchful through our whole Lives, that we be not Deceived and Inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Things of this World, that we ſuffer not our Minds to be Debauched by the enjoyment of them, that (as the Apoſtle adviſeth) <hi>we uſe this World as not abuſing it,</hi> leſt we be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe whom our Saviour ſpeaks of, who <hi>Gain the World,</hi> but <hi>Loſe their Souls</hi> into the Bargain.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. But theſe, you will ſay, are no Great Gamers: Which leads me to the <hi>Third Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> viz. That though Men Gain the World, and yet Loſe their Immortal Souls, they are unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Loſers notwithſtanding ſuch Gain. [<hi>What is a man Profited?</hi> That Queſtion is a downright Denying of the Thing, and the plain meaning is,<note place="margin">The Ballance of the Accompt in the Loſs of the Soul, and Gain of the World.</note> that a Man is not in the leaſt Profited; If he caſts up his Accompts, he will find that he is ſo far from having Enrich'd himſelf, that he is a mere Bankrupt.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. But ſome may ſay to me, How can theſe things be? Surely the <hi>Whole World</hi> is able to out-weigh that which you call the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man. If we can purchaſe the fruition of this Worlds Goods, we can't ſee how it is poſſible we ſhould be Loſers. This <hi>World</hi> certainly is no Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Bargain; we taſte the Sweetneſs, we behold the Beauty, we feel the Goodneſs of it. We have Liſtned, and our Ears have heard, and have been raviſh'd with its Charms: we have experienced
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039825_0018_10148CA149C776B8"/>
its Delights, and we cannot be deceiv'd: and therefore we conclude, that this <hi>World</hi> hath more worth in it then you imagine: and you vainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to beat down the Price of it. And then as for the <hi>Soul,</hi> we cannot ſay ſuch great things of that. Yea, many diſpute and wrangle about it's Nature and Properties, and certain it is, that no Nan ever ſaw it. But let it be what you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be, yet it cannot ſtand in Competition with the <hi>whole World</hi>: ſurely therefore you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value it, and ſet too high an Eſtimate upon it.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. To take off theſe Objections and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we may conſider the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> apart.<note place="margin">The Souls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worth argued from its Nature.</note> Let us lay theſe in the Scales one againſt another, and without doubt we ſhall find the former of theſe Two, to be moſt weighty and conſiderable. The great Worth and Value of <hi>Souls</hi> might be Evidenced from the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Excellent Nature and Frame of them, for they partake not of Dull and Senſeleſs Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but are Spiritual, Refined and Exalted Beings. Being Immaterial, they are Immortal and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying Spirits. Being Free and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,<note place="margin">Faculties.</note> they are able to Reflect on themſelves, to Underſtand their own Eſſence &amp; Nature, &amp; that of all other beings; eſpecially they are capable of Knowing, Loving, and Serving of God, in the Knowledge, Love and Service of whom the happineſs of Mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. And in a Word, the Souls of Men were made after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God,<note place="margin">Image of God</note> they are Copies of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039825_0019_10148C69523BC920"/>
that Excellent and Divine Original. Thus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls in their own Nature are of great Worth &amp; Excellency.<note place="margin">Price of your Redemption.</note> Again, we cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that they are ſo from the Conſideration of the Great Price which was Pay'd for them. God thought Mens Souls worth the expenſe of the Blood of his only Begotten Son. This ſhews how highly they were valued by God the Father, and Chriſt Jeſus the Merciful Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them. This ſhews that they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Precious, and that they are in the Sight of God of great Price.<note place="margin">Attempts of the Enemy.</note> Likewiſe, from the eager and buſy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Evil Spirit, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert &amp; ſeduce them, we may In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the great &amp; ineſtimable worth of them. He is reſtleſs in his Attempts to make a Prey of us, becauſe we carry within us ſo Great &amp; Rich a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: this makes it worth his pains &amp; utmoſt care, to Spoil and Rob us. So that the Indefatigable Aſſaults of this our Malicious &amp; Cunning Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, are an Argument of the Extraordinary Worth and Excellency of our Souls.</p>
               <p>But then for the <hi>World,</hi> weigh it in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and it will be found Light and Worthleſs. The Sum Total of it is thus computed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 2 chap. 16. ver. <hi>The luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life</hi>: that is, in other terms, Pleaſures,<note place="margin">The emptineſs of the World</note> Riches and Honours. This is <hi>all that is in this World</hi>; in theſe are couched, whatever the Voluptuous, the Covetous, or the Ambitious
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039825_0020_10148CA3E28FABE8"/>
can be Maſters of. Now, we have it upon infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Record, that the Wiſeſt and moſt Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Man upon Earth, diſparaged all theſe with the Inſcription of <hi>Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</hi> They entertain us with mere Shews and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and are not able to ſtint and ſatisfy the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Mind of Man: yea, they are Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are no ways ſuitable to the Soul: but thus far only they have relation to it, that they are wont to Deprave and Debauch it.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. But the moſt palpable diſparagement and blemiſh, of all the things that this World affords, may be comprehended in theſe Two Things, Firſt, They cannot allay or mitigate the Stings of a wounded Conſcience: they cannot avail us when God withdraws the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, when he writes bitter things againſt us, and diſcovers his wrath &amp; diſpleaſure for our Sins. Then the <hi>World</hi> will not yield us any ſolace and contentment.<note place="margin">It yields no Comfort, when we moſt need it.</note> Miſerable Comforters are all the Pleaſures, and Profits, and Honours of the World at ſuch a time. They are Phyſicians of no value, becauſe they cannot Cure and Heal our Inward diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: but they rather ſerve to Increaſe them. And Secondly, more particularly, the <hi>World</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak Peace to a Man when he is to leave it, and to go out of it, and conſequently, it cannot be of any great value and worth, for all its worth extends no further then this Life, which is ſhort and ſoon ended. But there is another Life after this, even an Endleſs duration, &amp; then this World will do us no ſervice at all. Whence we may
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039825_0021_10148C6AD6FAB890"/>
rationally conclude, that it is a very Mean and Sorry thing; and hence alſo it followeth, that a Man is not in the leaſt Profited, if he ſhall Gain the World by the Loſs of his Soul.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. I might further prove this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the next, as thus; That the man who loſes his Soul, though with the Acceſſion of Worldly Gain, is an unſpeakable Loſer, may be made good by the <hi>Fourth</hi> and Laſt Propoſition, which is yet behind, which you may remember was to this effect, That there can be no Satisfaction or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence given for the loſs of a Mans Soul: or, as 'tis here expreſs'd, there is no Exchange. The Greek Word hath reference to <hi>Contracts</hi> &amp; <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains</hi> about <hi>Buying</hi> &amp; <hi>Selling,</hi> which of Old were made not by Paying or Receiving of Money, but by Bartering or <hi>Exchanging.</hi> Whence the word is here made uſe of by our Saviour, to let us know, that there is no <hi>Traficking</hi> for Loſt and Damned Souls, there is no <hi>Buying</hi> of them again, when they are finally Sold and Loſt. And more particularly, the word is uſed in Good Authors to ſignify the <hi>Price of Redemption,</hi> and ſo it may very fitly be applyed here: and then this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truth is convey'd to us, that after this Life there is an utter Impoſſibility of Redeeming a loſt Soul. If the Sinner be once taken Captive by Satan, and bound in the Chains of Darkneſs, there is no hope of Redemption, there is no Counter-Price to be laid down and paid, to buy him back again. <hi>What ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:039825_0022_10148CA65D2B5C88"/>§ 14.<note place="margin">The Soul lost in Eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, can never be Redeem'd.</note> This being delivered by way of Queſtion, ſeems to imply this, that a Man would be willing to give ſomething, yea any-thing for the Recovery of his Loſt Soul. What is there that he would not part with? What can be too dear to make this purchaſe? Alas! the blinded Sinner goes on <hi>Now</hi> without controll; he only attends to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pleaſure of ſatisfying his Luſts and Exorbitant deſires. He thinks not of the Sting which muſt cloſe all, he conſiders not of the <hi>future</hi> checks of Conſcience, and that it will be bitterneſs in the Latter end. <hi>Now</hi> he undervalues his Soul, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons the loſs of it as a thing inconſiderable: but when he ſhall deſcend into the Regions of the Damned, then (but too late) he will wiſh he had Loſt all, ſo he had ſecured the Main Property. Then he will breathe out ſuch Relenting Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as this, O fooliſh and ſottiſh wretch that I was no neglect the Only Concern I had, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Eternal Torments for the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon! O how ſhall I now bear the reſtleſs groanings of a Deſpairing Mind! how ſhall I ſuffer the gnawing of this Worm that never dieth! What? muſt there be <hi>No Period</hi> put to theſe Infernal Flames? Cannot our Flouds of inceſſant Tears Extinguiſh theſe Burnings? Is there no Interceding with the Judge? May not a Man be upon his Probation once again? May I not be permitted to live over my Years once more? What is there no Releaſe from theſe chains of darkneſs? Is there <hi>no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> for Souls? No; there is a flat &amp; peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <hi>Denial</hi> couched in this Queſtion, <hi>What
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039825_0023_10148C6C86F96E50"/>
ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> That is, he can tender nothing which may be in the leaſt Available for the Retrieving of his Soul. Though he Would, he Cannot. This is a Loſs which is not to be repair'd. There is no Price or Ranſom that can fetch back the poor Captiv'd Sinner. All the World cannot Redeem one loſt Soul.</p>
               <p n="15">§ 15. And this will appear to be a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition too ſadly true if we conſider this one thing, that there is no Proportion at all, between the thing loſt and that which is offered in Exchange or Compenſation. The whole World affords nothing that can <hi>Anſwer</hi> the Loſs of a Soul; for (as I have briefly demonſtrated to you) all the World in reſpect of the Immortal Spirit of Man is Mean and Inconſiderable. There is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon at all between theſe Two: therefore the Gain of the whole World will not countervail the loſs of one Soul. And this alſo is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, that there is an Irreverſible Sentence paſt upon the Wicked as ſoon as they leave this World, and therefore there can be no Satisfaction or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change made for them. When once the Fatal Doom is pronounced by the Judge, there is no poſſibility of Evading it.</p>
               <p>Reckon then upon it as an Infallible Truth, that the Soul which Wilfully and Obſtinately miſcarries in <hi>this Life,</hi> ſhall not meet with any Relief in the <hi>Other.</hi> There is no Redemption after Death, maugre the fond opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which eſtabliſheth the contrary by maintaining the Fire of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> But be not deceived by ſuch Vain Deluſion; for the Enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039825_0024_10148CA8D0148808"/>
of their Prieſts is the only fuel which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that Fire. A conſtant Revenue comes into them from the <hi>Dirges</hi> and <hi>Maſſes</hi> for the dead, in hope of a Releaſe out of thoſe Flames. Thus this, and many other Popiſh doctrines are founded on their Secular Profit. They make their Gain their Godlineſs. To <hi>Gain the World</hi> they pretend to reſcue <hi>Souls</hi> out of the Infernal Priſon; whilſt in the mean time by their falſhoods and deluſions they palbably endanger the Salvation of men, and put them into the direct way of Loſing their Souls. But what can be more Plain and Peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory than that of the Royal Preacher, in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10. [<hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge in the grave whither thou goest?</hi>] As much as to ſay, the working out of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the proper and only employment of this Life, and after it there is no Redreſs. Whence it follows that the Loſs of Souls is not to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed in another World, and conſequently that it is ſuch a Loſs as is Ineſtimable &amp; Irrecoverable. [<hi>For what is a man profited if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a man give in Exchange for his Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. Thus I have diſtinctly conſidered the ſeveral branches of our Saviours words, with the Propoſitions that they afford. And I have done it with this deſign, that we might thence be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the Grand thing I propounded, namely, <hi>the Neceſſity of taking care for our Souls,</hi> and that above and before all other things whatſoever. This is the proper Inference from <hi>every</hi> one of thoſe Particulars that I have inſiſted upon: which I will
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039825_0025_10148C6EF5EF0990"/>
thus briefly make good. Firſt, If the Loſs of the Soul be no unuſual thing, then it highly concerns us to take Care, that we be not of the number of thoſe unhappy perſons who loſe their Souls. Secondly, If the Gain of the World contributes to this Loſs, then we are obliged to be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and circumſpect, in the uſe of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this World: which we cannot be, unleſs we have a great Care of our Souls, unleſs we watch over them with much diligence, and take ſome pains about the regulating &amp; well ordering of them. Eſpecially, if we conſider, Thirdly, that all the Worldly Gain &amp; Advantage we can expect to be poſſeſſors of by our ſinful and vitious behaviour, will be of no real Profit to us, this will further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to mind the welfare of our Souls, and to ſecure that, whatever elſe we fail in. And then laſtly, if we conſider that the Loſs of our Souls is of that nature that no Exchange or Recompenſe can be made for it, we are yet more ſtrongly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the duty I have ſo often mentioned. If we loſe our Souls, it is impoſſible to recover them: If by our wilful neglect we forfeit our Salvation, there is no way left to regain it.</p>
               <p n="17">§ 17. Wherefore let us be exhorted to value our Immortal Souls above all things elſe, and to think nothing too difficult to do, or too dear to part with for the enſuring and ſaving of theſe. As for our <hi>Bodies,</hi> the worth of them is, that they are the receptacles of our <hi>Souls.</hi> Theſe are the Jewels, the others are but the Caſket. And as for the World, and all things in it, they are not only vain and empty, and unable to ſatisfy the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional mind of man, but they are wont to mold
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039825_0026_10148CAB5DB54920"/>
and diſturb it, and to divert it from attending to the ſerious concerns of another World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may in good earneſt mind the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of our Souls, we muſt be careful not to buſy our ſelves too much with worldly affairs, we muſt not ſet our hearts on Earthly profits &amp; pleaſures. My meaning is not that we ſhould ſlight &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard our Bodies and our temporal concerns. We may lawfully look after theſe, we have free leave to mind our ſecular buſineſs in a moderate and due manner, and ſo far as Chriſtian Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires of us. But that which I urge is this, that we ſhould not ſo attend on our Earthly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as to forget Heaven, that we ſhould not be ſo ſollicitous about our bodily affairs, as to neglect the things which are Spiritual, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtle's complaint, <hi>that all ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſt's,</hi> Phil. 2.21.</p>
               <p>But we ought to liſten to our Bleſſed Maſter's Advice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his righteouſneſs</hi>; that is, mind Religion and your Souls in the Firſt place, &amp; then be not neglectful of your temporal Intereſt, &amp; the things which conduce to the advantage of your bodies and outward man. Know this, that your Eternal Salvation is the main thing you are to mind: you are to prefer your Spiritual advantage before all worldly and temporal conſiderations. For your <hi>Souls</hi> are more conſiderable than the <hi>whole World,</hi> and therefore the ſecuring of them is a matter of the greateſt moment, and of the higheſt concern. For theſe are Your ſelves, and your moſt Near and Intimate Poſſeſſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039825_0027_10148C7367E1DE90"/>
remember what is dictated to us in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles, <hi>If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf,</hi> Prov. 9 12. No man can give a greater teſtimony and proof of his Wiſdom than his look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> that is his own <hi>Soul</hi> in the Firſt place. The reaſon is evident, becauſe he cannot ſo much as pretend to common diſcretion who cannot afford to regard his own proper Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now, it is certain that the Salvation of our Souls is ſuch; the making ſure of their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is our own Peculiar Intereſt; and here we are concerned, or no where. Strive then to ſave your Souls, and account all Attempts mean in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this. Let it appear that you chiefly mind your future Welfare, by your early and conſtant proſecution of it, by your longing and breathing after it, and by your love and affection to thoſe who tender the Salvation of your Souls.</p>
               <p>What Our Saviour told the buſy <hi>Martha,</hi> is worthy of our daily thoughts, <hi>One-thing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is needful,</hi> (abſolutely neceſſary &amp; indiſpenſible) <hi>and Mary hath choſen that Good Part which ſhall not be taken away from her,</hi> Luk. 10.42. <hi>There</hi> lay the Excellency and Prudence of her <hi>Choice,</hi> that ſhe pitch'd upon that for her Portion which none could deprive her of, which none could take out of her poſſeſſion. And herein it is that <hi>we</hi> ought to give a Teſtimony of our true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Wiſdom, namely that we make choice of that for our Chief Good and Treaſure which is Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Durable, and which no Enemy or Croſs Accident can ſpoil us of. That is, we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Favour and Love of God before all things, and no Temptation whatſoever muſt bribe us to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039825_0028_10148CAED06835E8"/>
the neglecting of what he requires of us. Our conſtant ſtudy and endeavour, muſt be to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our Duty in the full extent of it, and when we know it, to purſue it with all Diligence, &amp; to do thoſe things which are pleaſing to the moſt High, and agreeable to the dictates of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences as they are enlightned and directed by the Holy Scriptures. And theſe are the things which I ſhall in the next place diſtinctly &amp; fully treat of.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the ſum of Religion. That it conſiſts in Knowledge and Practice. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of Chriſtian knowledge demonſtrated in five grand Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This Doctrine improved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ignorance of the Romiſh Devotion. The Purſuit of Knowledge recommended as a Duty and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our ſelves and others.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. THere are but theſe two things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religion, namely, the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of it, and both are equally neceſſary, becauſe one is as much our Duty as the other. Then we are truly Religious when we <hi>underſtand</hi> aright the things that are requiſite to be believ'd in order to our ſalvation, and when we <hi>act</hi> according to that Underſtanding and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039825_0029_10148C7506713350"/>
Knowledge: and it is impoſſible to conceive aright of Religion, if either of theſe be laid aſide. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the former of theſe: and firſt, I will endeavour to ſhew the abſolute Neceſſity of this Divine <hi>Knowledge,</hi> from ſuch Conſiderations as theſe; 1. Knowledge is the foundation of Religion. 2. The want of it is the root of Errors and Hereſies, and all pernicious Doctrines. 3. This hinders us from valuing and eſteeming the things of God. 4. This is the ſource of all Practical Evil. 5. This is deſtructive both to Body and Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. 1. Knowledge is the very foundation of Religion, and there can be no Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. I ſpeak of True and Real Religion, for what is falſe and counterfeit deſerves not the name of <hi>Religion,</hi> but is abuſively call'd ſo. It is granted indeed that Superſtition, which is but an Aping of Religion, is founded in &amp; proceeds from Error and Ignorance. There is <hi>a Zeal of God,</hi> which yet is <hi>not according to Knowledge,</hi> as the Apoſtle acquaints us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. And we find that the moſt Ignorant and Blinded wretches are the moſt Superſtitious Bigots. But if we ſpeak of True Religion, it is certain that that cannot be ſeparated from a due Knowledge. <hi>My Son, give me thy heart,</hi> is a juſt and befitting Command of the God whom we Worſhip and Serve,<note place="margin">Knowledge the foundation of Religion.</note> 
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. The <hi>Heart</hi> denotes the Underſtanding as well as the Will and Affections, and God will be ſerved with that no leſs than with theſe. Our Religion is ſtiled by the Apoſtle, our <hi>Reaſonable Service,</hi> Rom. 12.1. But how can it deſerve that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:039825_0030_10148CB056C39748"/>
if it be not accompanied with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and with Knowledge, which are the ground-work of Reaſon? If you Conſider things aright you will grant that no Action in Religion can be ſounded in Ignorance, and where there is not the Knowledge of God there cannot be the True Service of him. For our Ignorance of God and the things belonging to Him ſpoils all our Duties, taints all our Performances, corrupts all our Religious Exerciſes, and makes us uncapable of offering up an acceptable Sacrifice to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Nay, that Action which is done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge is ſo far from being acceptable to God, that it is not ſo much as a <hi>Moral</hi> act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proceeds not from a rational &amp; free Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, &amp; then certainly it can't poſſibly be an act of <hi>Religion.</hi> This may convince us of the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Divine Knowledge in general, &amp; more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the knowledge of the Principles of Chriſtianity. It is abſolutely requiſite that our Judgments be found in matters of Faith, or elſe our Actions, though they ſeem never ſo good &amp; pious, never ſo charitable or juſt, are of no value &amp; worth, becauſe they proceed from no True Principle and Bottom. What a Foundation is to a Building, that True Knowledge is to Chriſtianity; it is that which ſuſtains it, and bears it up. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly this is the ſtile of the holy Apoſtle, be calls theſe Grand Principles of Truth <hi>the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20 <hi>Heb</hi> 6.1. and that very juſtly, becauſe they are the Stay and Support of our Holy Religion, they are the Baſis and ground-work of the Chriſtian Structure.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:039825_0031_10146B1B30AE5B48"/>§. 3. 2. It is to be conſidered that the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God and of the things revealed in Holy Writ,<note place="margin">Ignorance the Root of all Error.</note> is the root of all Heretical &amp; Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrines. Truth is but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, but Error is various, and marches in ſeveral Diviſions. He that leaves the path of Truth is ſoon betrayed into a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of miſtakes. He is inclined to ſever him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more and more from the Center, and to fly off into Irregular motions, &amp; to entertain all ſorts of Errors and Follies. Thence was there ſuch a Swarm of Monſtrous Opinions among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, of which ſome of their Philoſophers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Thence alſo among Chriſtians hath the Catalogue of Hereticks &amp; Falſe Teachers ſwell'd. And believe it, This is no Inconſiderable thing: for Hereticks pervert the Eſſentials, corrupt the Vitals, &amp; undermine the Foundations of Religion. Heretical Seducements are like Poyſoning the Wells and Fountains, which is the moſt Pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing imaginable. The ſtreams of Divine Truth are thereby corrupted, and nothing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us but what is deadly &amp; fatal. This is Satans employment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.39. <hi>The Enemy that ſowed the Tares is the Devil.</hi> Accordingly Hereſies &amp; Falſe Doctrines are call'd by St. <hi>Paul, doctrines of devils.</hi> 1. Tim. 4.1. It is the moſt Helliſh deſign that can be to inſtill falſe Principles under the notion of true and ſound doctrine: for you cannot give Poyſon to any man ſo eaſily and ſo effectually as to him, who in taking it thinks he takes wholeſome Food or Phyſick: Evil Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are then moſt Hurtful when they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:039825_0032_10148CB4B1F94A08"/>
without any Diſtruſt. Thoſe are the Worſt Evils whereof we have no Knowledge or Apprehenſion. From whence you learn the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate of thoſe who are led into Error by being kept in Darkneſs &amp; Ignorance. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports how the Simple <hi>Satyr,</hi> when he firſt of all ſaw <hi>Fire,</hi> would needs kiſs &amp; imbrace it, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it as ſome very Harmleſs, nay Lovely thing. He did not know it would Burn, &amp; that Betray'd him to that fond Raſhneſs. Ignorance betrays men daily to the Like unadviſed attempts, and cauſes them to hug &amp; embrace thoſe Errors and Evil Doctrines which will prove Deſtructive to them, and end in Hell-fire, as you ſhall hear afterwards. He that is Truth itſelf acquaints us with the Dangerous effects of Ignorance and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>John</hi> 12.35. <hi>He that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth</hi>; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he muſt needs ſtray into every by-path, and wander into any wild opinion that depraves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and begets Atheiſm or Superſtition.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. 3. Conſider it is another Argument to perſwade you of the Neceſſity of Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the want of it hinders men from Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing and eſteeming the things of God, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Grace, and the Beauty of Religion &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. It is an old and true Maxim, that what is not known cannot be deſired &amp; loved, &amp; therefore it is neceſſary in order to the deſiring or loving of any thing, that there be a Knowledge of it firſt. Did men know what real worth there is in Vertue, and how baſe &amp; vile every Sin is, they would prize the former, &amp; abhor the latter. The reaſon why Men ſeek not after Divine and Heavenly things,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:039825_0033_10148C7B285823E8"/>
is, becauſe they are not Acquainted with them. This is ſignified by theſe words of our Saviour, in <hi>John</hi> 4 10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the Gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> Chriſt himſelf was <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> as he tells us in <hi>John</hi> 3.16. The Great obſtacle which hindred the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman from Asking this Gift was, that ſhe was Ignorant of the power and vertue of it; ſhe knew not that He who ſpake to her had the Beſtowing of it. The ſame may be ſaid concerning all the Gifts and Graces which the Goſpel tenders to men: they are Underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued and Slighted, becauſe the Worth of them is not known. Wherefore there is a neceſſity of being inſtructed in the Doctrine of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may gain the knowledge of theſe things. We muſt labour to underſtand our Religion, and have an inſight into the nature of Chriſtianity, and all the parts of it. For this is moſt certain, that none ever yet condemned it that throughly underſtood it: but on the contrary, all that have attained to a right underſtanding of it, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers and lovers of it.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5 4 It is to be remembred that the want of Divine Knowledge is the root of all Practical Abominations. If you think fit to Obſerve the Connection of the 4 firſt verſes of the 14th Pſalm, you will ſee this Confirmed. If the <hi>Fool, i. e.</hi> the Atheiſt (and Atheiſm is one of the Higheſt Inſtances of Ignorance and Folly) <hi>ſaith in his
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039825_0034_10148CB63590B520"/>
heart there is no God,</hi> he will neceſſarily be guilty of viſible and open Crimes in his Life:<note place="margin">Ignorance the Root of ſinful Practice.</note> for the wilful Ignorance of a Deity muſt produce very Strange &amp; Prodigious effects in his Manners. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly you read in the ſame place, that ſuch perſons <hi>are Corrupt, they have done Abominable works, there is none of them that doth Good. They are all gone aſide, they are all together become Filthy.</hi> And it might well be added in the next verſe, <hi>Have all the workers of iniquity no Knowlege</hi>? It is the want of <hi>this</hi> that makes them ſo Looſe &amp; Licencious, that renders them Diſorder'd and Exorbitant in their Lives. This may juſtly be aſſigned as the Great Cauſe of that Irreligion and Prophaneneſs which are to be ſeen in the World. The true Knowledge of God is loſt among men: Many brag of their Parts &amp; Acquirements, &amp; yet are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a Sound Underſtanding. Many men ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Diſpute and manage Controverſies, and are able to Wrangle and Quarrel, &amp; yet they fall ſhort of the attainment of thoſe Truths which are the Vitals and Eſſentials of Religion, whence their miſcarriages ariſe; for an Evil Life is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grounded on the ignorance of thoſe Truths. Which was long ago obſerved by that Pious Father of the <hi>African</hi> Church, St. <hi>Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> in his Book <hi>of the City of God,</hi> &amp; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he hath left us there this remarkable Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Men must needs live ill, if their belief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God be not aright.</hi> Their Morals can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be corrupted, when their Principls are unſound. And on the other ſide, a Religious and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039825_0035_10148C7E9248C170"/>
holy Converſation is the genuine reſult and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of right Apprehenſions of God, and of the Chriſtian Inſtitution which we profeſs.</p>
               <p>Let me Obſerve to you the Dependance of thoſe words in the firſt and ſecond verſes of the 4th Chapter of <hi>Hoſea.</hi> The Complaint at that time was, <hi>that there was no Knowledge of God in the Land:</hi> Whereupon it immediately follows that <hi>by Swearing, and Lying, &amp; Killing, &amp; Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and committing Adultery, they brake out, and blood touched blood.</hi> Ignorance of God hath theſe woful Conſequences, theſe diſmal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. He that knows not God, and is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in his duty, will be tempted to commit all manner of wickedneſs and impiety. If we look into the Body of Man, we ſhall find that there is a near conjunction between the Head and all the Members that are deſigned for action and motion: the Brain, the Seat of Underſtanding, conſtantly ſends forth Spirits through all the Nerves into the whole fabrick of the body, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſenſe and action. This may repreſent or ſhadow out to us an higher Notion, namely, the near Tye and Union, the conſtant commerce and correſpondence between <hi>Knowledge</hi> &amp; <hi>Practice,</hi> between the Underſtanding &amp; the Converſation. The Head being duly inform'd, affects the Heart and Life: and on the contrary, groſs Ignorance and falſe Apprehenſions defile the Manners, and pollute the whole Man. When vile Sinners ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to that pitch, <hi>to ſay unto God, Depart from us,</hi> we may then gather, that <hi>they deſire not the knowledge of his ways,</hi> as it follows in <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. And we may rationally gather, that this latter
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:039825_0036_10148CB7BB121DB8"/>
was the cauſe of the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the want of a due &amp; well grounded Knowledge is the root of Apoſtacy, or departing from God, &amp; revolting from Religion, becauſe none are ſubſtantially good, &amp; perſevere in Vertue, but thoſe that are Knowing.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Fifthly, &amp; laſtly, to ſum up all in ſhort, our ignorance of God (notwithſtanding ſome are pleas'd to excuſe and extenuate the guilt of it) is really dangerous &amp; deſtructive both to our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; Souls, it ruines us both here and hereafter.<note place="margin">Ignorance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; Soul.</note> As to the former, it is repreſented as an experimented Caſe by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> (Chap. 5. v. 13.) <hi>Therefore my People are gone into Captivity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no Knowledge.</hi> And the ſame is ſignified to us by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Chap. 4. v. 1.) <hi>The Lord hath a controverſie with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Land, becauſe there is no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God</hi> (as well as no <hi>Truth,</hi> nor <hi>Mercy</hi>) <hi>in the Land.</hi> This <hi>Controverſie</hi> held as long as the Captivity; and afterwards it began again, and ended at length in the final deſtruction of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of which it is probable <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophetically ſpeaks in the ſixth Verſe of this Chapter, <hi>My People are deſtroy'd for lack of Knowledge.</hi> Thus Ignorance (no leſs than poſitive acts of Sin and vitious Enormities) provokes God to ſend his ſevereſt Judgments on the Bodies of Men.</p>
               <p>And that their other &amp; better part is endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered is yet more evident, for <hi>that the Soul be without Knowledge it is not good,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2. which is that uſual way of ſpeaking wherein more is intended &amp; meant than is expreſſed: Wherefore the ſenſe of thoſe words
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039825_0037_10148C8062FE9670"/>
is this, that it is a very evil and deſtructive thing to the Soul to be without Knowledge. For this depraves the Soul, &amp; is the cauſe of many ſins; and if it be obſtinate, is the greateſt Sin it ſelf. This is well expreſs'd by the Apoſtle in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18, 19. where he tells us, that <hi>the Gentiles walked in the vanity of their minds, having their underſtanding darkned being alienated from the life of God by the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts.</hi> Obſerve it, <hi>darkneſs, ignorance, blindneſs,</hi> are attended with, and are the cauſes of <hi>vanity of mind,</hi> &amp; <hi>an alienation from the life of God.</hi> And if you peruſe the next words, you will take notice of other diſmal Conſequences, <hi>viz. Being paſt feeling,</hi> &amp; <hi>giving themſelves over to laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs, &amp; working all uncleanneſs with gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,</hi> which manifeſtly proves this Particular which I am now upon, namely, that Ignorance is deſtructive to the Soul, &amp; alſo is a Proof of what I ſaid before, that Ignorance is the Root of all practical Abomination.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. We are aſcertain'd that <hi>this is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to know the only true God &amp; Jeſus Christ,</hi> John 17.13. Where though the whole Chriſtian Religion may be included in the word <hi>knowing,</hi> yet ſeeing it is expreſs'd to us by this term, it is plainly intimated, that it can't be without <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>; nay, that it muſt neceſſarily be attended with it, &amp; that <hi>Life</hi> &amp; <hi>Happineſs</hi> depend upon it. Which is manifeſt from this, that Knowledge qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies us for the Viſion of God, &amp; renders us like him, &amp; fits us for the eternal enjoyment of him. Now, if this Knowledge of God the Father &amp; of his Son Chriſt Jeſus be <hi>life,</hi> it follows, that the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:039825_0038_10148CBA37273F58"/>
wilful ignorance of them is <hi>death,</hi> that is, will end in the deſtruction of the Soul. Which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth:</hi> Where we ſee both theſe are in Conjunction, <hi>Salvation</hi> &amp; <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>: &amp; then by the plain Rule of Contraries it follows, that <hi>Damnation</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> are link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. But behold this Doctrine aſſerted by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in more direct and downright terms in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. where he poſitively affirms, that <hi>the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Christ; who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not</hi> God, as well as <hi>not Obeying</hi> him, deſerveth (you ſee) eternal Damnation, &amp; ſhall be puniſhed therewith. A moſt horrid &amp; affrighting Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-clap into thoſe who willingly perſiſt in their Ignorance! This is a fault that merits everlaſting Burnings; &amp; if you continue in it, it will moſt certainly procure them. If you have not the knowledge of God now, you may expect to hear thoſe words from him hereafter, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi> Perſwade your ſelves of it as an undeniable Truth, that groſs and wilful Ignorance is a damning Sin.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. I grant you may be ignorant of ſome things which have reference to Religion without danger: Though you have no inſight into ſeveral points of Speculation &amp; Controverſie, yet you do not thereby hazard your Salvation. But if you
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039825_0039_10148C8250DB79B8"/>
be deſtitute of the knowledgs of the great &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Articles of Chriſtian Faith, &amp; if your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance be voluntary, &amp; you refuſe to be inform'd and inſtructed, then I may truly pronounce, that your caſe is exceeding dangerous, Your Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance being of this quality, is inexcuſable, and in plain terms damnable. If the Apoſtle blames thoſe who are <hi>always learning,</hi> &amp; yet <hi>never come to the knowledge of the truth</hi>; then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who refuſe to learn, &amp; affect Ignorance, are much more to be blamed, &amp; even condemned. And thus I have preſented you with ſeveral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Particulars, which give you an account of the Evil &amp; Miſchief, of the hazard &amp; peril of being Ignorant of God &amp; the things of Religion.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. I hope what I have here deliver'd will make ſuch an effectual impreſſion upon the Minds of thoſe that read it, that they will for the future entertain a very mean opinion of thoſe who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it as an undeniable Propoſition, that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a good Ingredient in Religion, &amp; that the knowledge of the Scriptures, &amp; Divine Truths, is a perilous thing among the People. He that would admit himſelf into their Society, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Proſelite, muſt do it upon the ſame condition that the <hi>Ammonites</hi> would have made a Covenant with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> namely, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man ſhould have <hi>his Right Eye thruſt out,</hi> 1 Sam. 11.2.

Notwithſtanding the Apoſtle directly forbids the uſe of an unknown Tongue in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation except it be interpreted, and ſhews, that it is againſt the Laws of Edifying in the Church that any ſuch thing ſhould be tollerated; nay, he intimates, that it is a wild &amp; frenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="10">§. 10. And being convinced of this, I beſeech you ſtrive to attain to that Knowledge which I have been commending to you. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the purchaſe of <hi>Knowledge</hi> under what denomination ſoever, is a thing which is much prized in the World, &amp; it buſies the minds of Men exceedingly. Arts &amp; Sciences are greedily ſuck'd in by inquiſite Minds, &amp; thence every Age brings new and freſh Diſcoveries. My Requeſt to you at preſent is, that the <hi>Divine</hi> &amp; <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Knowledge</hi> may be your Care alſo; nay, that it may be your chief Care &amp; Buſineſs. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039825_0041_10148C87FA0B4890"/>
if you duly conſider how this Knowledge ſurpaſſes all that which is Secular and Humane,<note place="margin">Excelling worth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> you will think it an Employment worthy of you. This is call'd by St. <hi>Paul, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Understanding,</hi> (1 Col. 9.) to diſtinguiſh it from that other kind of Knowledge and Science, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you that it is from the Holy Spirit, and that it is converſant about Spiritual and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vine things. This I conceive, is the reaſon of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet. Now it is an undoubted Truth, that the more excellent the Object is, the more excellent is our Knowledge of it: On which ground it will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, that the knowledge of Spiritual and Divine matters, ſuch as belong to our eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, far exceeds the moſt refined Notions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other things. Thus you are invited and encouraged to enquire into the great and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Points of your Religion, from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worth and excellency of them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, you may remember it is St <hi>Peter</hi>'s Advice, or rather his Command, that we be <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy always to give an anſwer to every one that asketh us a Reaſon of the hope that is in us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. That is, we are obliged to give an Account of our Faith and Religion: And if this be our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then Ignorance cannot be excuſeable; but we muſt enquire into the Principles &amp; Foundations of our Religion, and gain a ſufficient Underſtanding of them. And aſſuredly, in theſe times of Error and Deluſion this becomes our Duty more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially: We muſt endeavour to have right Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe great things, and the rather, becauſe miſtakes and miſapprehenſions about them are
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:039825_0042_10148CC0A2E22918"/>
too common in this Age. Yea, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to advance the Knowledge of God not only in ourſelves, but in others; for though we live in a Nation proſeſſing Chriſtianity, yet I may tender it to you as a great, but deplorable truth, that many thouſands of Souls in this Land have no more Knowledge of God than mere Heathens have; that is, they have only a general Notion of a Deity, and of ſome kind of Religion, but they are not able to give any particular account of either, and more eſpecially they are very ignorant of the main Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Therefore we muſt think it our concern to furniſh ourſelves and them with the neceſſary Doctrines of our Religion, with a right knowledge of God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and all the other Principles of true and ſaving Knowlege.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I come now to what I chiefly deſign'd as the Firſt Part of my General Task, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew you particularly and diſtinctly what that <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God is which is required of every Chriſtian.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. THE firſt Fundamental and neceſſary Principle of Knowledge is, that there is a God. This is the foundation &amp; ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of all: And the ſeveral inſuing Particulars muſt be built on this bottom. The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> makes this the firſt and loweſt ſtep of our Knowledge and Belief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh unto God</hi> (that is, in any way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip) <hi>muſt believe that he is.</hi> It is requiſite that he lay his foundation in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Belief of a God. And here indeed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, as well as Revealed Religion, directs us; for the Pagan World arrived thus far, namely, to acknowledge a Supreme Being, who was before all things, and is exalted above all, &amp; is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Diſpoſer of all. They had ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Being that was the Author of all other Beings &amp; is Infinite and Eternal, &amp; void of all Imperfections whatſoever. This is <hi>God,</hi> &amp; the truth &amp; reality of ſuch a Being are proved from that general Impreſs &amp; univerſal Stamp of a Deity which are on Mens Minds.<note place="margin">The Being of God a Dictate of Nature.</note> All of us, as we we are Men and Rational Creatures, have this Notion naturally implanted in our Underſtandings, that there is a Sovereign Being that made us, &amp; upholds us, and is continually ſhewing kindneſs to us, and is in himſelf infinitely good and perfect. We bring this Sentiment into the World with us, &amp; it is
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:039825_0045_10146B1E1E406E38"/>
ſo faſt riveted into our Minds, that we cannot ſhake it off and be rid of it, though we would. Now, this being a perſwaſion fixed in all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it follows, that it is a very Reaſonable Dictate: And the voice of Nature here is to be interpreted as the Voice of God. All agree una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly in this Acknowledgment, &amp; there are no Diſſenters in this Point, unleſs they be thoſe whoſe Brains are diſturbed &amp; ſhattered, or thoſe who being addicted to their Luſts and Vices, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe againſt a Deity, becauſe they would not have one to puniſh them for their miſdemeanours. Excepting theſe Men, the univerſal ſuffrage of Mankind is, that there is a God.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Again the Knowledge of a God, that is, of his real Exiſtence is proved not only from the natural Inſtinct of every Man's Mind, but alſo from thoſe occaſional Reflections which Men are wont to make upon themſelves &amp; their Actions. How frequently do their Conſciences tell them that they have done amiſs? And they pronounce themſelves guilty, &amp; fear &amp; dread poſſeſs their Minds. Now I pray tell me whence doth this proceed? Why are they afraid, &amp; find a diſorder in themſelves? Is it not becauſe they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended ſome Being or Perſon who knoweth what they have done, and who will call them to an Account, and will puniſh them for their miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages?<note place="margin">Proved from conſcience of guilt.</note> Who is this but <hi>God?</hi> It is their conſciouſneſs of his taking notice of their faults that diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them: And we read that the greateſt Tyrants and moſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering Perſecutors, who have defied and out-braved all Mankind, yet were not able to ſtifle
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:039825_0046_10148CC5C50BD308"/>
their Fears which they had in their Breaſts of a God. The apprehenſion of this hath made them quake and tremble, and amidſt all their Pleaſures and Luxuries, they could by no means divert the torments of their own Conſciences. Theſe cried aloud to them that there was a God, a God who would ſeverely animadvert upon their wicked Actions. Thus there are inward Evidences from Mens Souls and Conſciences, which are undeniable proofs of a Godhead.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. But beſides theſe inward proofs, there are theſe likewiſe which are outward and viſible. Open your Eyes, look abroad, and you cannot but behold a God in the Frame and Fabrick of the World,<note place="margin">From the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Frame of things.</note> in the upper and lower Rooms of this great Houſe, and in all the Gueſts &amp; Inhabitants of it. View and conſider theſe diſtinctly, and you will confeſs them to be no leſs than a demonſtration of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The exiſtence of a Creator appears unto us by his Creatures. We may know the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer of the World by the Works of his Hands, and that as certainly as we can gather from the ſight of a complete and exact Watch, that the Spring and the Wheels, and all the other parts of it, and the whole orderly motion of it, are not by chance, but are the product of ſome skilful Workman and Artiſt: Nay, we may gather this <hi>more</hi> certainly; for if ſuch a piece of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as a Watch, which muſt be wound up at a certain time, or elſe its Motion will fail, and the fineneſs and exactneſs of all its parts will ſignifie nothing, (I ſay) this Workmanſhip be not thought by any ſober Man to be caſual, or to be from its
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:039825_0047_10148C8B06FD98B8"/>
ſelf, then much leſs can we imagine the Fabrick of the World to be of that nature, when we ſee that after ſome thouſands of years it needs no winding up, no renewing, repairing, or recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but continues entire and perfect, as at firſt, and is moved and acted in the ſame way, courſe and method that it ever was. This ſhews its Almighty Author, &amp; All wiſe Maker, ſo that we have reaſon to eſtabliſh our ſelves in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a God from the conſideration of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the World, &amp; all things in it. <hi>His eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power &amp; Godhead are clearly ſeen &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the things that are made,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. And more particularly &amp; ſignally <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare the glory of God, &amp; the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſheweth his handy work,</hi> Pſal. 19.1. And his glorious Power, Majeſty, Wiſdom &amp; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are beheld <hi>every where</hi> in the Works which we ſee in the World. Whereſoever you look, he is before your Eyes, he may be taken notice of in every Creature. Therefore we may, if we pleaſe, be ſo favourable in our Cenſures as to imagine, that that excellent Natural Philoſopher, who in the beginning of his <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> aſſerts the <hi>World</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi> meant no more than this, that God is to be diſcovered in all the parts of this wonderful compoſure of the World, &amp; particularly in the Frame of our Bodies. Thus God <hi>is not far from every one of us,</hi> &amp; <hi>in him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> live, &amp; move, and have our being.</hi> The Works of the Creation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are an undeniable proof of a Deity. You muſt needs acknowledge a God when you take a ſurvey of the Heavens &amp; of the Earth, &amp; of the excellent Furniture belonging to them, eſpecially if you ſurvey your ſelves, &amp; conſider the make
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:039825_0048_10148CC842E731D0"/>
both of your Souls &amp; Bodies, the excellent Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip whereof is a pregnant confutation of Atheiſm. It is utterly impoſſible that theſe things ſhould make themſelves, &amp; that they ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in that wonderful manner in which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, without a Divine Contriver and Author.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. And here, to render this Argument yet ſtronger &amp; more forcible, we are to obſerve and remember, that all the Works we contemplate in the World ſhew <hi>Deſign</hi> &amp; <hi>Intention</hi> in the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, &amp; therefore are not the Works of Chance, but the reſult of an infinite Wiſdom. Behold the greater World, the whole Structure of the Heavenly &amp; Earthly Bodies; &amp; look into the leſſer World, your ſelves, &amp; you will find, that there is an excellent <hi>Harmony</hi> &amp; <hi>Connexion</hi> of all things, you will perceive that one thing was made and fitted for another, and that there are certain <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Purpoſes</hi> to which they tend, and for which they were contrived. So that from the contemplation of the Works that are before us, we cannot but infer an All-wiſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect and Diſpoſer.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. There are ſeveral other Arguments to prove the <hi>Divinity,</hi> as the many <hi>Revelations</hi> God hath made of himſelf to the Patriarchs and holy Men in the Old Teſtament, &amp; to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and others in the New: the <hi>foretelling of future Events</hi> many hundreds of Years before they came to paſs: The ſtrange and wonderful <hi>Preſervation of the Church</hi> in all Ages: The remarkable <hi>Puniſhing</hi> of notorious Offenders, ſo that <hi>the Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth,</hi> Pſal. 9.16. And laſtly, the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Rewarding</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of ſome religious
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:039825_0049_10148CC9C7A7F9E8"/>
and pious Men; which are ſo evident and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, that <hi>a Man ſhall ſay, Verily, there, is a reward for the righteous: Verily, there is a God that judgeth in the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 58.11.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let us firmly imbrace this leading Principle, which is the Source and Root of all the reſt, and the very prop and ſupport of Religion; for he that acknowledgeth not that there is a God, cannot worſhip or obey him. Let us be well grounded in this firſt and fundamental Point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Being of God: Let us have a ſolid and rightly ſettled perſwaſion of it, founded on thoſe clear and convictive Arguments before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. II. As we are to know there is a God, ſo we muſt know that he is but One, and that there is no other God but He. This Principle muſt be ſettled in us in contradiſtinction to the plurality of Gods which the Pagans vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. We muſt acquaint our ſelves, that it is a very groſs &amp; abſurd thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,<note place="margin">The Unity of God.</note> that there are more Gods than One.

this day, and conſider it in thy heart, that the Lord he is God in Heaven above, &amp; in the Earth beneath, there is none elſe.</hi> So likewiſe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael; the Lord our God is one Lord.</hi> The ſame is preſſed by the Apoſtle in 1 Cor. 8.4, 5, 6. And you may obſerve, that it is mention'd in that place alſo as a <hi>Principle of Knowledge: We know that an Idol is nothing in the World,</hi> (that is, though it be counted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nay a very Deity, by the ignorant and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Gentiles, yet it is no ſuch thing really): <hi>We know this,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, &amp; <hi>we know that there is no other God but one: For though there be that are called Gods (as there be Gods many and Lords many) yet to us there is but one God.</hi> Anſwerable to which is that which the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. <hi>There is one Lord</hi>: And Verſe the 6th, <hi>There is one God &amp; Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all</hi>; which is an excellent deſcription and portraiture of that One True God.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. The Philoſophers and ſober Men among the Gentiles, when they had a mind to ſpeak ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, &amp; to be underſtood ſo, aſſerted that there was but One God: And truly they might arrive to this by the very light of Nature; for the very Notion of a God, that is, of an infinitely and tranſcendently Good, Wiſe, and powerful Being, includes this in it, that there cannot be more Gods than one. For what is Infinitely Perfect can be but One, becauſe that which is moſt perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds and ſurpaſſes all others, and conſequently there cannot be any other of that tranſcendent Nature: It is impoſſible there ſhould be any more than One of that Rank. Beſides, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

Power and Majeſty being Supreme, cannot, on that very account, be divided. It might be proved alſo, and that undeniably, that the Firſt Cauſe, and ſuch is God, can be but One. The natural reaſoning of Men will conduct them to the belief of this Propoſition, that there can be but <hi>One Firſt,</hi> without any laborious proving of it.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. I might add here alſo, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Principle is neceſſary in order to the fixing and rectifying of our Devotion. For the knowledge of one God is the foundation of all our Addreſſes to him, it is the true Baſis of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Worſhip: For theſe Exerciſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſe from the excellency and tranſcendency of that One Being above all others. Hence we <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate</hi> Divine Adoration to <hi>Him,</hi> becauſe He, being of Infinite Perfection, and being but One, commands our entire Worſhip, and none elſe can.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. And I might obſerve, that this <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Only God</hi> is called the <hi>True God,</hi> John 17.3.<note place="margin">The true God.</note> where it is required that we <hi>know</hi> him under that Notion, that we acknowledge him to be the <hi>True God</hi> as he is diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Falſe and Feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods</hi> of the Heathens A God hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confeſſed in the World, but, alas! there hath been a huge miſtake and error about it: For thoſe Nations who owned a God in general had not the happineſs to own the True God, but being ſtrangely deluded and perverted, they ſet up Gods of their own making. What they fancied to be a God, was preſently reputed and taken to be ſuch. The vileſt and meaneſt Creatures, the worſt of Beings have been made Gods by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

Devotion and Superſtition. We are told that the Egyptians Deified Dogs and Cats, and they could ſtoop to Worſhip Leeks and Onions. Their very Gardens furniſh'd them with Deities. Other Nations worſhipped things which had not ſo much as a vegetative Life, Stocks and Stones were made up into Gods by thoſe vain and blind Bigots. The Gentile Devotioniſts would by all means have a God, let him be what he would. They cared not what a kind of Deity they imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſo they had one. But it is not enough to acknowledge a God, that is, ſomething that is taken for a God; but you muſt aſſert and believe the <hi>Only True God,</hi> that Infinite Being who gave exiſtence to all things, that Eternal Spirit who made the World out of nothing, that Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which is of Infinite Perfection, which is the chiefeſt Good, &amp; in the enjoyment of which our Happineſs conſiſteth. This is the <hi>Only True God</hi>: And you ſee how requiſite this Principle of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is. I paſs to the next, which is this.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. III. It is not ſufficient to have a general Notion of a Deity, but it is neceſſary that our Knowledge of God be more particular &amp; diſtinct, and that we believe &amp; acknowledge this Truth, that though there be but one God, yet there are Three Perſons in the Godhead,<note place="margin">Of the Trinity</note> and that though theſe three Perſons are really diſtinguiſh'd from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, yet they are equal in Subſtance Glory and Power, &amp; in all Divine Perfections &amp; Excellencies. The Holy Scriptures of the Old &amp; New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſure us of this; but more eſpecially this is the diſcovery of the New Teſtament. Here we are taught, that in the Divine Nature or Eſſence
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:039825_0053_10148CD11E6B9518"/>
there are Three Perſons ſubſiſting, the Father, the Son, &amp; the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; that every one of theſe is God, &amp; yet they are but one God. Thus we read the Sacrament of Baptiſm is commanded to be celebrated <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28.19. which joyning of the Three Perſons together in that ſolemn act of Divine Worſhip ſhews that theſe three are the ſame God: for no Man of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoughts can think that Baptiſm, being a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinance, ſhould be adminiſtred in any Name but that of <hi>God.</hi> And ſeeing the <hi>Father</hi> is acknowledged to be God, we cannot but own the <hi>Son</hi> &amp; <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be ſo too, becauſe they are joyned with the <hi>Father</hi> in this holy Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Worſhip. Another clear &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ull Text is that of St. <hi>John</hi> in his 1ſt <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> 5th <hi>Chapter,</hi> &amp; 7th <hi>Verſe, There are three that bear record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> That is, one in Nature and Eſſence. This is an impregnable Text, and was particularly mention'd &amp; refer'd to by ſome of the ancienteſt Writers of the Chriſtian Church, for the proof of the Holy Trinity.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. And moreover, the Scripture not only makes mention of <hi>Three</hi> to whom the Godhead diſtinctly belongs, but it gives the <hi>Name of God,</hi> and attributes the <hi>Properties of the Deity</hi> to Chriſt and to the Holy Spirit, as well as to the Father. Thus Chriſt is expreſly call'd <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Rom</hi> 9.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. and in other places.

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:039825_0054_10148D1097AE35C8"/>
aſcribed to theſe two Divine Perſons. Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, 'tis ſaid that he is the <hi>Almighty,</hi> Rev. 1.8. <hi>He knoweth all things,</hi> John 21.17. He was <hi>before the World was,</hi> John 17.5. Which is an Expreſſion in Scripture to ſet forth Eternity. The ſame eſſential Attributes of the Deity are aſcribed to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in Scripture: He is call'd <hi>the Eternal Spirit,</hi> Heb. 9.4 <hi>He ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth &amp; knoweth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10.11. And his <hi>Infinite Power</hi> is manifeſt from the <hi>Miracles</hi> which we read of in the Goſpel, which were acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that far ſurpaſſed all natural ſtrength, and were the immediate effects of the Holy Spirit: Which is the reaſon why the denying of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Acts to be done by the extraordinary power of this Divine Perſon, is call'd the <hi>the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 12.31. The ſum then is this, that we find in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that there are <hi>Three</hi> who are ſpoken of as <hi>God,</hi> &amp; to whom the Name &amp; the Divine Nature, and the eſſential Properties of God are attributed, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence we certainly infer that every one of theſe three is God. And more particularly as to Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, we have as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and evidence to believe that they are God, as we have to believe that the <hi>Father</hi> is God. And becauſe the ſame infallible Scripture aſſures us that there is but one God; we gather this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that theſe Three are One; and we not only gather it, but it is expreſſed in plain terms. And if they are One, they are all equally God, and he that ſeparates the Son and the Holy Ghoſt from the Godhead, doth in a manner alſo aboliſh the Divinity of God the Father, as St. <hi>John</hi> bears witneſs in his 1 Epiſtle, Chap. 2. ver. 3. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:039825_0055_10148CD2A0AE2278"/>
ſaith he, <hi>denies the Son</hi> (and with him the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>hath not the Father</hi>; that is, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies him to be God.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. As for the particular and exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Generation</hi> of the Son,<note place="margin">The Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son &amp; proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt remain Myſteries.</note> and of the Holy Ghoſt's <hi>Proceeding</hi> from the Father and Him, we are not to trouble our Heads about them. The <hi>manner</hi> how God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and glorious Eſſence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the other Perſons in the Trinity, is wholly above our apprehenſions, and is to be admired and adored by us rather than ſearched into and comprehended; for this is a Myſtery, and therefore we muſt not immodeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prie into it. And what I ſay concerning the Trinity, is to be applyed to all the great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Miſteries of the Chriſtian Religion, as our Saviours Incarnation, the Reſurrection of our Bodies, and ſome other Doctrines which are of ſo abſtruſe a nature, and accompanied with ſuch Difficulties, that we can't expect to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat underſtanding of them. You muſt not dive into theſe Secrets, which were deſign'd to be covered and kept cloſe. You ought to believe theſe Myſteries becauſe they are revealed to you from Heaven, but you muſt never think to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the manner of them. It is not requiſite that you ſhould anſwer all the ſubtile Queſtions that may be ſtarted about thoſe Doctrines. If you once give way to nice Queries, they will multiply without end, and you muſt act the part of wrangling Sophiſters rather than ſober and humble Chriſtians. Let me deſire you then to forbear Diſputes and ſtrife of words, to leave
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:039825_0056_10148D122A1DA1A8"/>
Speculation and Controverſie to the Schools. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Truth, although you cannot anſwer all vain Cavils that are made againſt it. Aſſert, maintain and defend the Principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though you be not arrived, to a compleat and adequate knowledge of them. There are ſome heights in Divinity which the moſt exalted Heads can never reach. Nay, there are ſome things hid and darkned on purpoſe that you may not ſearch into them. I beſeech you forbear curious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries here, amuſe not your ſelves with the contemplation of thoſe things which ſurpaſs the model of your Underſtandings: be not wiſer than God would have you to be.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which is the Subject I am now inſiſting upon, this only is required of us to be known and heartily believ'd, that the tranſcendent and Infinite Nature of God contains in it three diſtinct Perſons or Subſiſtencies, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt. This is the third Principle of your <hi>Knowledge</hi> concerning God: and it is proper &amp; peculiar to Chriſtianity, for neither <hi>Jews,</hi> nor <hi>Turks,</hi> nor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor any other profeſſion of Men whatſoever beſides the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> acknowledge this Doctrine. You are obliged therefore more eſpecially to own this as an undoubted Truth, and ſuch as is confirmed and eſtabliſhed by the word of God. You are concerned to defend this Article, becauſe the main points of the New Teſtament, and of our Chriſtianity depend upon it. For our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the whole work of our Recovery are founded on the undertaking of the Three Perſons in the glorious Trinity: The ſeveral parts of our Salvation are accompliſhed by the peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:039825_0057_10148CD516EA5928"/>
&amp; different operations of theſe diſtinct Perſons, as is evident from the New Teſtament. Therefore unleſs we know that God is one in Eſſence, and three in Perſons, we cannot have a true and right apprehenſion concerning our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. IV. The <hi>Attributes</hi> of God cannot be divided and ſeperated from the Divine Eſſence,<note place="margin">The Attributes of God.</note> &amp; therefore in the next place the knowledge of <hi>them</hi> is neceſſary. The firſt eſſential Attribute of God is his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he contrives all things for the beſt ends and Purpoſes,<note place="margin">Wiſdom.</note> which is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his foreſeeing all the events and ſucceſſes of things. <hi>All things are naked and open to his eyes,</hi> Heb. 4.3. The weak and ſhallow underſtandings of Men will not permit them to pierce very far into Objects, &amp; therefore it is no wonder to ſee them puzzled &amp; non-plus'd: But he who created all things, &amp; gave them their Beings &amp; Natures, cannot but have a full &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect inſight into them, &amp; be intimately acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all their Effects and Productions. He knows all things paſt, preſent, and to come, all things whether ſecret or open, all the thoughts and intentions as well as actions of every Creature. <hi>His eyes are in every place, beholding the evil and the good,</hi> Prov. 15 3. And this All-wiſe God governs the World in a moſt exact &amp; accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate manner; there is no error or ſtaw in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, every thing is managed &amp; conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greateſt prudence, although our dark and diſtracted Minds do not always perceive it. By this unerring Wiſdom he ſo orders and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:039825_0058_10148D156113F4E0"/>
all things, that <hi>he makes every thing beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its time,</hi> Eccl. 3.11. and directs them to ſuch Ends as are moſt conducible to his Glory: And therefore he is juſtly ſtiled <hi>the only wiſe God,</hi> Rom, 16.27.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14, Secondly, the infinite <hi>Power</hi> of God, which is another of his tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Attributes,<note place="margin">The Power of God.</note> is to be known by all that profeſs Chriſtianity. By this it is that <hi>he doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſeth both in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Pſal. 135.6. and actually accompliſhes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he hath in his Wiſdom determin'd to be. By this he brings to paſs thoſe ſtrange &amp; wonderful things which we ſee in the World &amp; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the utmoſt Power of Angels &amp; Men: And by this he defeats and confounds the Enemies of his Church when they are moſt proud &amp; inſolent. By <hi>this Attribute</hi> we are encouraged to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in the day of trouble and diſtreſs, and to expect help and deliverance, becauſe he being of <hi>Infinite Power</hi> is able to relieve us in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Streights, &amp; to reſcue us in our greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. This Attribute adminiſters comfort to us in all our Temptations, for we are aſſured that Satan and all the Infernal Powers are at the beck and command of this Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth. He can over-rule and controle them when he pleaſeth, he can effectually tread Satan under our Feet, &amp; he will do it if we truſt in him, and diſcharge our Duty faithfully. The <hi>mighty God</hi> is our ſupport in all our Difficulties: His Power being unlimited (as moſt certainly it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Infinite) we need not fear what Men and Devils can do unto us. By his Almighty Arm
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:039825_0059_10148CD6B28C8570"/>
he firſt created the World out of nothing, &amp; ever ſince hath continued it in its Being, <hi>upholding all things by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1.3. And by the ſame power he can, if he thinks good, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all things into their firſt nothing. In ſhort, there is not any thing whatſoever can prove dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult or impoſſible to an Omnipotent Being, and ſuch is the God whom we ſerve.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. Thirdly, we are to have right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God:<note place="margin">Of Juſtice.</note> Which is that Attribute where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhews himſelf <hi>Righteous in all his ways,</hi> Pſal. 145.17 and whereby in a more ſpecial manner he ſeverely and impartially animadverts on wilful and obſtinate Sinners, and ſuffers not vice and wickedneſs to go unpuniſhed. For although he is pleaſed to let ſome great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders perſiſt in their groſs Impieties, and not cut them off in the Career of their Sins, yet this is no argument of Impunity: For who knows what Laſhes &amp; Torments they feel in their Breaſts? Who can tell the exquiſite pains and anguiſhes which are in the Conſciences of theſe Men? But ſuppoſe they experience no inward regrets and remorſe, no black and diſmal reflections in their Minds, yet if we will have ſo much patience as to ſtay till the laſt Act of the Divine Tragedy wherein theſe perſons are concerned, we ſhall find no cauſe to impeach God of Injuſtice: For as <hi>the end of the righteous man is peace,</hi> ſo the cloſe of wicked men doth oftentimes prove trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, diſtreſſed, and calamitous, though they had ſome Comick mixtures at their firſt entring on the Stage, and acting ſome time upon it. But ſay that the Wicked go off with applauſe,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:039825_0060_10148D19E33CB0E0"/>
and nothiag direful &amp; fatal befals them, yet ſhall we queſtion and doubt of God's <hi>Juſtice,</hi> becauſe we behold things to be after this manner? There is no reaſon we ſhould do ſo, if we conſider that there is another World after this, there is a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of Being, &amp; in that theſe ſinful Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhall certainly receive the recompence of their repeated exorbitancies &amp; impieties, of their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obſtinacy and impenitency. Is not God <hi>Juſt</hi> becauſe he doth not remarkably puniſh all ſins in this life? Yea, rather ſay that he will be very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, becauſe he delays their puniſhment, and will certainly double it at laſt.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. The fourth Attribute of God is his <hi>Mercy</hi>: For as he is juſt in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offenders in due time,<note place="margin">Of Mercy.</note> ſo he ſhews himſelf merciful in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſing by offences, and not taking advantage againſt the Guilty. This was the illuſtrious Name and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle which he was pleaſed to be proclaimed and known by, <hi>The Lord God merciful &amp; gracious, long ſuffering &amp; abundant in goodneſs, keeping mercy for thouſands, for giving iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions &amp; ſins,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. And every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our lives atteſts the realty of this Divine Goodneſs &amp; Benignity. O how frequent are the Inſtances of Gods compaſſion and clemency of his favour and indulgence! He who might deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pour down the Vials of his Wrath upon our Heads, he who might utterly deſtroy us as ſoon as we offend, yet is pleaſed to let us experience his patience and long-ſuffering, and vouchſafeth to bear with our Follies, and by his forbearance deſigns to win us to repentance and amendment of life. O how often doth the great lover of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:039825_0061_10148CDB07A2ECF0"/>
Mankind extend kindneſs to poor Creatures, when they have nothing but their Miſery to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to him! <hi>The Lord is good to all,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145 9. There is an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Compaſſion in him, whereby he ſhowers down Favours &amp; Bleſſings on the whole World: There are ſignal Examples of the Divine Goodneſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. But eſpecially <hi>his mercy is great towards them that fear him,</hi> as the ſame holy Man hath obſerved, Pſal. 103.11. There is a favour ſhewed to them which is not common and ordinary, a love which is ſingular and peculiar. This is that which diſtinguiſhes them here from the reſt of the World, and Heaven hereafter will make a greater diſtinction.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. Beſides theſe Attributes of God alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy named, <hi>viz,</hi> His Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, and Mercy, there are others which we are to have a knowledge of, as his <hi>Immenſity,</hi> or <hi>Omnipreſence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the other Attributes of God.</note> whereby he is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and <hi>fills Heaven and Earth,</hi> Jer. 23.24.

And as for his Promiſes, we are certain of the performance of them, for he is (as he is called) <hi>the Faithful God,</hi> Deut. 7.9. and will keep his Word invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably.

the Chapter, wherein the ſenſe of this 12th Verſe is not again expreſſed. It ſeems it is ſo great and important a Truth, that the Apoſtle thought fit to repeat and inculcate it in almoſt half a ſcore Verſes together. Therefore this muſt be a <hi>main Principle</hi> of our Religion, and ſuch as we ought to <hi>know</hi> in order to our Salvation. From the whole Series of the Apoſtle's words in that place, it is clear, that we are all Criminals even by Birth, we inherit Death and Sin from the firſt Man. His Corruption becomes ours, not only by imitation and example (as ſome would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us) but by Propagation. Which is yet further aſſerted &amp; confirmed by the ſame inſpired Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>We all were by Nature the Children of Wrath, as well as others,</hi> Eph. 2.3. <hi>We all,</hi> that is, <hi>Jews</hi> (for the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelf and his Countrymen) as well as <hi>others,</hi> namely <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to whom he writes, <hi>we all, Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> (which comprehends the whole Race of Mankind) are <hi>by Nature,</hi> that is, by our Birth &amp; deſcent <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> liable to God's Wrath and Diſpleaſure, obnoxious to Puniſhment both here and hereafter.

               <p>Beſides, there was (as I ſaid before) a <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Adam,</hi> not only for himſelf, but all his Poſterity; wherefore on that account <hi>Adam</hi>

If then this latter part of the Covenant made with Man was juſt &amp; equal (as we acknowledge it to be) we have reaſon alſo to aſſert that the former was ſo too. Wherefore you muſt remember to urge upon your Minds, as a neceſſary Principle of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that upon <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s Apoſtacy from God and their Duty, we who are there Off-ſpring are become Guilty. There is a Pollution derived from them with our Nature, and together with that a lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to the everlaſting Wrath of God, as the puniſhment thereof. You ſee this is plainly and expreſly deliver'd in the Scripture of Truth; and therefore attend not to the Cavils of perverſe Men, who ſtudy to annul this Fundamental Point of our Faith.</p>

Being convinced that Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is infected and poiſoned, let us think our ſelves concern'd to know what is the Antidote, what is the Remedy of this Malady and Diſeaſe, what is the Method of our Recovery.

ſtate of Man, and is juſtly call'd the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> becauſe the tenor of it was that Men ſhould be recovered, and reſtored to the Favour and Grace of God, not by vertue of any works of their own, but by the Meritorious Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of Chriſt, whereby He was to make Satisfaction to God for their breach of the Divine Law, and to reſcue them from Hell and Eternal Damnation, and to purchaſe Salvation and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs for them. And their <hi>Duty</hi> is contained in this Covenant (it being the nature of a <hi>Covenant</hi> to include in it the Terms relating to both Parties) namely, that they <hi>believe</hi> in this Gracious saviour and Redeemer, and <hi>obey</hi> his Laws: which they are not able to do of themſelves, and therefore it is part of this New Covenant that they ſhall have ſtrength given them by the Holy Spirit to believe and obey. This is a brief account of the <hi>Second Covenant</hi> made by God with the Elect through the Meſſias, who is called <hi>the Seed of the Woman</hi> in the forecited Text.<note place="margin">The Work of Redemption.</note> The Reaſon is becauſe he was born of a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in a ſignal and unuſual manner, as being not the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Man,</hi> as all others are.

Be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous then (as it is your Intereſt) to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this way of Man's being deliver'd from his miſerable Condition. St. <hi>Paul</hi> briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes it is thoſe few words, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. <hi>If through the Offence of one many be dead, much more the Grace of God, and the gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Jeſus Christ, hath abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto many.</hi> And if you read what follows, you will find that this <hi>Happy State</hi> or Condition of Man, no leſs than the <hi>Miſerable</hi> one before treated of, is repeated and explained to the very end of the Chapter. <hi>The Judgment was by one to Condemnation, but the Free Gift is of many Offences unto Juſtification. If by one Man's Offence Death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of Grace ſhall reign in Life by one, Jeſus Christ. As by the offence of one Judgment came upon all to Condemnation, even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the Free Gift came upon all Men unto Justification of Life.</hi> And the final Cloſe is, <hi>As ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo Grace reigneth through Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto eternal Life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

               <p>I rehearſe this to you, to convince you of the Neceſſity of <hi>this Principle of Knowledge.</hi> If it were not a matter of vaſt Importance, and ſuch as you muſt by no means be ignorant of, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine the Apoſtle would urge and repeat it ſo often. I have not met with any Particular in the whole Bible that is mention'd over and over again in ſo <hi>many</hi> Verſes together. Now,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:039825_0072_10148D25F6BA25A8"/>
it is certain that the Apoſtle is not here guilty of vain and uſeleſs Repetitions, but it is the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Neceſſity of the Matter which cauſed him to inculcate it in ſo many words of the ſame Senſe and Import. Wherefore you cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently weigh and ruminate upon ſo worthy a Doctrine, you can never deſervedly prize ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Truth, namely, that as by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> Sin &amp; Death entred into the World, ſo by Chriſt Jeſus, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Life and Happineſs are procured for us, and convey'd to us. When our firſt Parents, and we in them, had deſerv'd ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Miſery, and utter rejection from God's Favour and good Will, he then vouchſafed to think thoughts of Mercy towards us, and laid help upon one that is <hi>mighty to ſave us,</hi> &amp; that <hi>to the uttermoſt.</hi> He open'd a Fountain of Life through the Blood of his only begotten Son, and prevented our eternal Death and Damnation: which is thus expreſſed by our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> John 3.16.</p>
               <p>Here it is to be obſerved that three Great <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> or <hi>Offices</hi> are conferred upon Chriſt for the ſaving of his People. He is a <hi>Priest,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But how was it poſſible that Man ſhould be pardon'd, and yet at the ſame time Sin be ſufficiently animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted upon? To accompliſh this, God appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Surety who ſhould ſuffer in Man's ſtead;<note place="margin">Christ our Surety.</note> and this Surety, this Sponſor was to be a <hi>Man,</hi> that he might ſuffer, and that Sin might be puniſhed in the ſame nature in which it was committed. But then he was not to be a <hi>ſinful Man,</hi> that is, one involved in the ſame Guilt with others: for he that is himſelf Guilty cannot ſatisfie for others: And thence we read that the Surety whom we are ſpeaking of <hi>was conceived by
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:039825_0074_10148D28A69A7628"/>
the Holy Ghost,</hi> Mat. 1.20. that he might be pure and ſinleſs as to his Humane Nature. But ſuppoſe him void of Sin and Guilt, yet if he were a mere Man, he could not be able to ſave us, for it is above the ſtrength of a Creature to redeem loſt Sinners; wherefore it was requiſite that this Surety ſhould be <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man</hi>: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it was ordained and appointed by the Sacred Trinity that one of that number, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Second Perſon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Surety muſt be God and Man.</note> ſhould undertake and accompliſh the Recovery and Reſtauration of loſt Mankind, and that in order to that he ſhould take upon him our Humane Nature.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. This is that which was foretold by the Evangelical Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Behold, a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſhall conceive, &amp; bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Emanuel.</hi> The Virgin's <hi>conceiving</hi> &amp; <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> him ſpeak his Humanity; and his name <hi>Emanuel, God with us</hi> plainly tells his Divinity.

This is the great and amazing Myſtery of the Goſpel, the Union of the Godhead and Manhood, in order to the Redemption of loſt Man; for Chriſt, as he was <hi>Man,</hi> ſuffered for us; as he was <hi>God,</hi> ſatisfied; as he was both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> accompliſh'd our Redemption. And after this gracious Redeemer had actually
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:039825_0075_10148CEBAEA96B58"/>
become a Sacrifice for us, <hi>and made himſelf an offering for ſin</hi> by his meritorious Death, <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to be the Son of God with power, by his Reſurrection from the Dead,</hi> Rom. 1.4. He thereby gave undeniable proof of his Divinity, and made it evident to the World that he had accompliſh'd the Work of our Salvation, and was accepted of God the Father. Of which we have a farther aſſurance, by his viſible, and glorious Aſcending into Heaven, and there ſitting at the Right Hand of the Father,<note place="margin">Chriſt's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliation.</note> to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us, preſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Sufferings before his Father, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering our Prayers and Supplications to him, and applying the Benefits of his Paſſion. Thus is the work of our happy Recovery wrought by the undertaking so Chriſt Jeſus, the eternal Son of God.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. And we are to know further, that this Redemption, and the whole Tranſaction of it, are from the free Bounty and Mercy of God: For he was not obliged to reſtore us to our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive State of Happineſs after we had fallen from it; he was not bound to enter into a new Covenant with us, after we had broken the firſt by harkning to the Suggeſtions of the evil Spirit, and had thereby loſt our Innocence, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Enemies and Rebels againſt God. We could not have accuſed him of Injuſtice, if he had left us miſerable for ever. Whence it follows, that we muſt aſcribe our Recovery to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Compaſſion and Goodneſs only. <hi>To us a Son is given</hi>; that is the Stile of the Prophet;<note place="margin">Salvation of pure Grace.</note> &amp; accordingly our Saviour calls himſelf <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> John 4 10. It is the free
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:039825_0076_10148D2B2ACD2740"/>
and undeſerved Donation of Heaven to Mankind, that this Jeſus, this Redeemer was ſent into the World. This is ſaid to be <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his Will, to the praiſe of the Glory of his Grace,</hi> his free Grace &amp; Mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. And what can be plainer than the ſame Apoſtle's words Chap. 2d, Verſe 8th? <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved,</hi> and that not of <hi>your ſelves</hi>: This (as well as <hi>Faith</hi> which he here mentions) is <hi>the Gift of God.</hi> It was from the Divine Bounty alone that a Saviour appear'd; and all the happy Effects and Conſequences of it are from his good Will and Favour. We muſt needs pronounce this Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be free, becauſe we had to hand in it, we were utterly incapable of doing any thing tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards our Relief. It was without the leaſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of any thing in us that favour was ſhew'd to us, becauſe after our Fall nothing remained in us that was lovely and deſirable, nothing Praiſe-worthy and Excellent. Then it was that our merciful and gracious Creator was pleaſed to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty our forlorn State, and freely to ſend his Son to accompliſh his deſigns of Love to us. Here is the only Foundation of all our Happineſs, this is the ſource of all our Comfort; and therefore let us thankfully admire and adore this free and gratuitous Diſpenſation of the Almighty. Let us attribute it wholly to the Favour and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of God, that we are in a capacity of being ſaved: Let it be aſcribed to the pure good Will and Pity of Heaven, that any of the lapſeſt Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> even as many as are given unto Chriſt by his Father, are reſtored to their loſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Angels fell, but irrecoverably: there was no Salvation for thoſe Apoſtate Spirits: but

God hath not dealt ſo with Man, he hath not left him under an impoſſibility of Recovery. Here the Riches of Grace, and the unmeaſurable Depths of Mercy are diſcover'd. O happy Souls, that loſe themſelves in the Contemplation of this Unſpeakable Goodneſs, of this infinite Bounty!</p>

conſider that peremptory deciſion of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. ch. 2. ver. 23 which I had occaſion to mention before, <hi>He that denieth the Son, hath not the Father:</hi> Whilſt they deny Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, they do in vain aſſert a Deity. You ſee then how greatly you are concern'd to know and own this fundamental Point of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: All your Knowledge of God the Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of the Knowledge of Chriſt is of no value.</p>
               <p>Nay, let me tell you, you cannot attain to a right Knowledge of the former, but through the latter. To this purpoſe I offer thoſe words of the Bleſſed St. <hi>Paul</hi> to your Meditations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give the light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, God is a bright and glorious Sun, whom we cannot look upon directly, the Rays and Beams of his Majeſty being ſo tranſcendently Illuſtrious. That we may therefore behold this Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not be ſtruck blind with it, whilſt we are gazing on it, it is neceſſary that we take a view of it, not as it is in it ſelf abſtractly, but as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it ſelf to us in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. There we may behold God in the beſt and ſafeſt manner. That we may know him aright, we muſt look on Chriſt who is the <hi>expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> and in whom he is well pleaſed. You have it from our Saviour's own bleſſed Mouth, <hi>John</hi> 14.6, 7. <hi>No Man cometh to the Father but by me. If ye had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father</hi> alſo.

               <p n="10">§ 10. And thus I have acquainted you with the Threefold State of Man. He was ſpotleſs and innocent by his Creation: He was corrupted by Satan's Temptations, and ſo apoſtatiz'd: But he is reſtor'd and renew'd by the wonderful Grace and Mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus. Or thus, Man was created at firſt according to God's Image, in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and conſequently was in a ſtate of Happineſs; but he wilfully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed God's Command, and thereby loſt his firſt Purity and Innocence: Thence came Sin into the World, and Death by Sin. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, God at firſt promiſed, and afterwards actually ſent his Son to deliver Man out of this miſerable Condition, and to Redeem him from Death and the Curſe, and to confer upon him eternal Life and Happineſs. And accordingly the Son of God, taking upon him humane Nature, recovered him from the ſtate of Guilt and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and reſtored him to Life and Bleſſedneſs. It is of abſolute neceſſity, that you inform your ſelves very diſtinctly concerning theſe three States, for otherwiſe you remain ignorant of the grand matters which are requiſite to be known in order to your eternal Salvation. Therefore I dwelt the longer upon this, that you might have a thorough apprehenſion of this ſo neceſſary a Principle of Religion, which every Chriſtian Man ought to furniſh himſelf with.</p>

cannot paſs from this State unto that of Grace but by <hi>Regeneration.</hi> You muſt be born again:<note place="margin">Of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> A new Nature muſt be planted in you. Are they not the plain and expreſs words of Chriſt, who beſt knew the Terms of Salvation? <hi>Except a Man be born Again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God, Joh.</hi> 3.3. He can neither ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the Kingdom of Grace here, nor of Glory hereafter. This Regeneration or new Birth is then wrought in us, when the Graces of the Holy Spirit are inwardly planted and rooted in our Hearts, and when they bring forth Fruit in our outward Converſations. For this is certain, that the internal habit of Grace and Holineſs will ſhew it ſelf in good Works, in all viſible and apparent acts of Sobriety, Righteouſneſs and Godlineſs. We muſt perſuade our ſelves then of the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable neceſſity of having our Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, our Hearts and Lives adorned with all ſpiritual Endowments, for otherwiſe we have no marks and ſigns of our being born again, and we have no hopes of ſeeing the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. And this muſt needs be ſo, becauſe theſe Graces and Vertues are expreſs <hi>Conditions,</hi> on our part, (as hath been ſaid before) of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

And in ſundry other places Pardon is offer'd, and Heaven is propoſed on the terms or doing what is commanded us. For though Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be the only meritorious Cauſe of our Pardon, and of our Salvation and Happineſs, yet our Faith and Repentance, and other Graces, are the previous conditions of them on our part. And we are not to wonder at this, becauſe it is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment &amp; Conſtitution; for it appears from the Holy Writ, that it was agreed from all Eternity between the Father and the Son, that Man ſhould not be ſaved but in a way of Duty, and that in order to this his Sins ſhould not be remitted but on condition of Repentance; and conſequently, though the Goſpel be a diſpenſation of Grace, yet it promiſes Pardon to none that perſiſt in their Rebellion. And this is the tenour

So we find in Scripture that there is a neceſſity of being Born again, of being religious and holy, and of obeying God's commands in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of eternal Happineſs, which is the End we aim at. Or, theſe divine Endowments may be called <hi>Inſtruments</hi> and <hi>Helps</hi> of our Salvation, becauſe they further and advance it in that way which is peculiar to them, &amp; which is of God's own appointment: &amp; particularly ſome of them may be ſaid to be Inſtruments of applying to us the Salvation wrought by Chriſt.

               <p n="4">§. 4. Thus under what conſideration ſoever you look upon the Graces of the Goſpel, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that we lie under a neceſſary obligation of adorning our Lives with them. We muſt be daily examining the Truth &amp; Sincerity of them, and we muſt ſtrive to increaſe and improve them.

The want of this Knowledge hath cauſed great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, &amp; groſs Diſorders among thoſe that have made the greateſt Pretences to Religion. There are a ſort of Men who think to go to Heaven a new way; they are <hi>above Ordinances,</hi> as they are pleaſed to boaſt; they deſpiſe the outward Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice &amp; Worſhip of God as a mean thing; every day is a Sabbath with them, &amp; every Meal is a Sacrament; &amp; the teaching of the Spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all Preaching &amp; Hearing.

Wherefore to vilifie theſe, is to vilifie the Holy Scriptures, yea, to deſpiſe God himſelf, becauſe it is a deſpiſing of that which the wiſe God hath ordered &amp; approved of. He promiſes no where to make void the Miniſtry of the Church, and to teach us from Heaven immediatly without the uſe of this, for this would be deſtroying what he had ſet up himſelf; for we read that our bleſſed Saviour gave Commiſſion to his Diſciples to <hi>Teach and Baptize,</hi> (which includes all the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt) and promiſed <hi>to be with them always unto the end of the World,</hi> Matth. 28.20. which ſhews that this Promiſe is made alſo to their Succeſſors in the Miniſtry; for the Apoſtles themſelves were not to be <hi>always,</hi> or <hi>unto the end of the World</hi>: Therefore this muſt be meant of all the Faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, in all the ſucceſſive Ages of the World.

Strength, and Comfort are derived to us by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's Word, by Reading, by Praying, by holy Conference and Communion, and by the reſt of the Exerciſes and Duties which God hath commanded.

But now concerning theſe <hi>Graces</hi> and theſe <hi>Religious Exerciſes</hi> which I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, we muſt entertain theſe two Principles of Knowledge, Firſt,<note place="margin">Our Graces &amp; Duties are not our Juſtifying Righteouſneſs.</note> That though we are to be careful to act our Graces and to diſcharge our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet this muſt not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if we were to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>for</hi> either, as if we merited God's Favour by our Vertues or good Works. For though it is true, that by the tenour of the Firſt Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Works, Man was to enter into Heaven by the merit of his Obedience, yet now ſince that Covenant is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and thereupon laid aſide, there is no entring that way. Our own Works are not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title us to Life and Happineſs; it is by another's Righteouſneſs and Merits that we muſt obtain the Favour of God, namely, by the meritorious Undertakings of Chriſt Jeſus our Mediator. According to the terms of the Covenant of Grace, our own Righteouſneſs will not avail us, as to the purchaſing a Right to eternal Salvation. This is done only by our Lord's Undertakings for us: Theſe are the only Source and Fountain of the Mercy we partake of, both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. It is not for the ſake of our Doings, nor on the account of our Graces, that God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us, but for the ſake of his only begotten Son, in whom he is well pleaſed. We are ſaved, not becauſe we are good and holy, but becauſe Chriſt hath effectually died for us, and becauſe
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:039825_0091_10148D0008E98A38"/>
God for his ſake accepts of us. Therefore when we have done our utmoſt, we muſt own our ſelves to be <hi>unprofitable Servants,</hi> (as we are taught to ſpeaki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Luk</hi> 17.10.) we muſt acknowlege the weakneſs and ſinfulneſs which accompany our beſt Actions, and we muſt wholly rely on the Mercy of God, and the Righteouſneſs of the Bleſſed Jeſus. Though we are to be endued with an inherent and perſonal Righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that renders us new Creatures; yet the Righteouſneſs for the ſake of which we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, and juſtified, and entituled to Happineſs, is the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> imputed to us.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. The other Principle of Knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this General Head which I am now upon, is this, that though the Graces and Duties I have been ſpeaking of are ours, becauſe they are exerted by us, yet none of them are the product of our own power and ſtrength. For we can do nothing acceptably in Religion without divine Aſſiſtance, we can do no ſpiritual good without the Grace of God. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.5. And if we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to <hi>think</hi> any good thing, ſurely it muſt be granted that we are not ſufficient to <hi>will</hi> any thing that is good. Whileſt a Man is Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and in a ſtate of Nature, He hath a Free Will only to Sin, but hath no Will towards that which is Holy and Divine, but on the contrary is Averſe to it: which proceeds from that Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which he contracted by <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall. But the Apoſtle tells us who is the Author both of our Willing and Doing any ſpiritual Good. <hi>It

Faith and Repentance, and all other Graces are the gift of God, and the vouchſafement of the Holy Spirit, and not the reſult of our own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſtrength. We underſtand but little, and are very ſhort ſighted in Religion, if we be not convinced of this. And we are to know this further, that our Graces, our Duties and all our Religious Performances are <hi>Acceptable</hi> unto God on this very account which I have now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, namely becauſe they are the Fruits of the Holy Spirit, the Bleſſed Sanctifier. They are not only accepted for the ſake of the unſpotted Righteouſneſs of Jeſus (as was ſaid before) but becauſe they proceed from the Holy Ghoſt, the Author of all ſpiritual Life and Goodneſs. He gives worth &amp; value to the Actions &amp; Duties of Believers; ſo that as they come from him, they are valuable and precious in the ſight of God the Father, becauſe he delights in whatever flows from that Sacred Fountain.</p>

them have reſpect to their outward Condition, and the things of this World; others have regard to their inward Man, and the things that are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Divine.

for that purpoſe. Accordingly our Saviour comforts his diſciples by telling them that <hi>great is their reward in heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.12: and the Apoſtle aſſures all the Godly that <hi>they have a houſe Eternal in the heavens,</hi> 2 Cor 5.1. This is called <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> Luke 23.43, and <hi>the third heaven,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.2. and <hi>the New Jeruſalem,</hi> 21 Rev. 2. <hi>There</hi> is endleſs reſt and peace, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction &amp; pleaſure, and freedom from all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and pain; and <hi>there</hi> is the perpetual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all that is good, excellent and deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>There</hi> is that <hi>far more exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of Glory,</hi> which will counterpoiſe all the heavieſt preſſures of this Life. But the Glories of that place are rather to be admired by us, than thought to be comprehended. If I could tell you how great they are, they would not be the Joys of Heaven, that is, immenſe and infinite. But we are ſure that there <hi>are</hi> ſuch Manſions of never-fading Glory and Happineſs in thoſe Heavenly Regions, becauſe the holy Scriptures, which were endited by the Spirit, expreſly aſſert it, and becauſe our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who was our Head and Repreſentative, is aſcended thither. Let us then be fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this Truth, that all faithful Souls, after they have left this World, ſhall inherit eternal Life and Happineſs in another, and receive the glorious Recompences of their Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

Work to pleaſe our great Maſter, who hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us in this World. We are to conſider that we are here in a ſtate of Pilgrimage, we are tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to the <hi>new Jeruſalem, the City that hath Foundations, whoſe builder &amp; maker is God</hi>; and therefore above all things we are concerned to behave our ſelves <hi>as Strangers &amp; Pilgrims,</hi> that is, as the Apoſtle explains it, to <hi>abſtain from fleſhly Lusts which war against the Soul, and to have our Converſation honeſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. and in our whole Behaviour in the World to live as thoſe that are paſſing to another.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. To think meanly and humbly of our ſelves, &amp; what we do, is another eſſential part of Sobriety.<note place="margin">Humility.</note> For this teaches us to be ſenſible of our manifold Infirmities and Deficiencies, our great Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and Vileneſs, and thence to think of our ſelves as becomes ſuch weak and vile Creatures. Wherefore it is Chriſtianity alone that lays the Foundation of the deepeſt Humility, by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with our fallen State,, and the true nature of our preſent Condition; which the wiſeſt of the Heathens were ignorant of, and conſequently knew not what true <hi>Humility</hi> was. This is taught us by the Goſpel only, which gives us a ſight of our ſelves, of the Corruption of our Nature, and of the vileneſs of Sin, and thereby lays us low, and cauſes us to abaſe and humble our ſelves. We ſhould always govern our ſelves by that Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Advice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Not to think of our ſelves more highly than we ought to think, but to think ſoberly</hi>; that is, to judge of our ſelves after an humble and modeſt manner, and not to pretend to more than we have, or to be better

Though we be never ſo well furniſhed with ſpiritual Endowments and Graces, we muſt not be proud of them: But the greater our other Gifts &amp; Graces are, the greater ſhould be our Humility. We muſt always have lowly Thoughts of our ſelves, by reaſon of our Failings and Offences both paſt and preſent. Our own Sins ſhould be thought to be the greateſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>the chiefeſt of Sinners</hi> in his own account. So as to Opinion and Judgment, a ſober Chriſtian follows that Counſel of the holy Writer, <hi>Be not wiſe in your own Conceits,</hi> Rom. 12.16. Do not arrogate to your ſelves, &amp; fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, prefer your own Judgment before that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; think this, that others may underſtand things as well, if not better, than your ſelves. Baniſh all Pride and Self-conceit, and be content that even others ſhould think meanly and lowly of you. This is true Humility, and conſequently <hi>Sobriety,</hi> for the humble Minded Chriſtian is the Sober Man.</p>

Minds and Conſcience. From that fond opinion which we generally have of our ſelves, we are wont to entertain falſe Perſwaſions concerning our Lives and Actions: We uſually take ſome fair appearances, ſome goodly ſhew &amp; ſemblance of Vertue for real Sanctity, and ſo we delude our ſelves, and make a conſtant practice of it: And the worſt is, we think to deceive God as well as our ſelves. Now then, we are concerned to take ſuch a courſe as may prevent or cure this deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Folly: And what more effectual way can we apply our ſelves to than this, <hi>viz.</hi> to deal impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially with our ſelves, and to diſcover our Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluſions, by ſearching narrowly into our Souls, and Ranſacking our Hearts and Manners? Let us then take ſome opportunities of retiring from Buſineſs and Pleaſure, that we may keep Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with our ſelves: Let us accuſtom our ſelves to retreat from the World, to be alone, and to enjoy a free &amp; undiſturbed Solitude, wherein we may mind the ſtate of our Souls, and effectually purſue this work of Self Examination, which is a neceſſary Ingredient of Chriſtian Sobriety.

So ſhould we fix and determine our ſelves by holy and religious Purpoſes, and not always paſs our days in an unfixed poſture, and ſo hover in uncertainty.

Thus you ſee how thoſe that are truly Sober manage their <hi>Thoughts</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. Secondly, The Grace of Sobriety fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with right Thoughts concerning the <hi>World,</hi> and all Things in it. Theſe may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Two Heads, the <hi>Croſſes</hi> and the <hi>Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences</hi> of this World. As to the former,<note place="margin">Sobriety with reſpect to the World.</note> the <hi>Croſſes &amp; Afflictions</hi> of this Life, we ought to have this right &amp; ſober Apprehenſion concerning them, that they may be made very uſeful and beneficial to us, if they
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:039825_0113_101661694E0EE468"/>
be rightly improved. Then they lead us to a ſight and ſenſe of our paſt Miſcarriages and Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they wean us from the over-luſcious Sweets of this World, and give us a reliſh of another, and a better State. They are Antidotes againſt moſt Vices,<note place="margin">Of Afflictions and their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</note> they are thoſe Grains of bitter <hi>Aloes</hi> which our wiſe Phyſician makes uſe of to purge away our Sins. They are ſerviceable, by the Divine Bleſſing, to quicken our Prayers, to haſten our Repentance, and to promote all our Graces &amp; Duties. Which was long ſince experienced by that holy Man who profeſſed, <hi>It was good for him that he had been afflicted, that he might learn God's Statutes,</hi> Pſal. 119.71. Another of later Experience declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>his Tribulations were more neceſſary for him than his Meal &amp; Drink.</hi> So ſaid the pious <hi>Martin Luther.</hi> If we have reſpect likewiſe to the future State, we ſhall find that Afflictions are uſeful to prepare us for that, becauſe they remind us of this great Truth, that this World which we are now in is not our proper Place, this Earth is not our Center; for if it were we ſhould find Reſt and Quiet in it: If this were the Place deſigned for our Happineſs, we ſhould not be uneaſy and troubled in it. When therefore we ſee that we are continually liable to Inconveniences, Diſtreſſes and Calamities in this lower World, we may thence rationally gather, that this was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be our reſting Place, that <hi>we have here no continuing City,</hi> and therefore we are put in mind of <hi>ſeeking one to come.</hi> Thus the adverſe Accidents of this Life fit us for Heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for a future Life. The Rod of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:039825_0114_1016616C71911E10"/>
bloſſoms into a never fading Crown of Glory. And therefore St. <hi>James,</hi> did rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that <hi>Man bleſſed that endureth Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, i.e.</hi> Afflictions, <hi>for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> Jam. 1.12</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. Let us then ſtrive to attain to this pitch of Chriſtian Sobriety, to think favourably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the croſs Occurrences of this preſent Life; whether they have reference to our Bodies, or to our Eſtates, or Names, or to thoſe who are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allied to us; let us look upon them as they really are, when ſanctified to us, Bleſſings from Heaven. And the rather let this found Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion prevail in us, becauſe it will put us into an utter incapacity of envying the Proſperity and Succeſs of our moſt implacable Enemies, or of over lamenting the Diſtreſſes that befal our ſelves or our deareſt Friends, for theirs and our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Afflictions will prove advantages to them and us, by increaſing the Felicity of another World. Thus a wiſe and ſober Man conſiders the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of worldly Things, and thence learns to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the World, and to be reconciled to the moſt afflictive Things in it, and to ſubmit all to God.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. And then on the other hand, Sobriety enables us to think a right concerning the <hi>Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences</hi> &amp; <hi>delightful Enjoyments</hi> of this World.<note place="margin">Of Sobriety as to worldly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</note> And this it doth by ſending us to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which give us the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe things, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially acquaint us that <hi>Vanity</hi> &amp; <hi>Vexation of Spirit</hi> are entailed upon them all, as <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had the ampleſt fruition of them, aſſures us from his
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:039825_0115_1016617028AF4880"/>
own Experience. And this muſt needs be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of the pleaſureable Entertainments of the World are but ſeeming and counterfeit, airy and fantaſtical, for <hi>even in laughter the heart is ſorrowful,</hi> Prov. 14.13. We can ſcarcely be ſaid to enjoy thoſe Delights whilſt we have them; and the time of our poſſeſſing them is but ſhort, for that of St. <hi>John</hi> is an experimented Truth, that <hi>the World paſſeth away, &amp; the Luſts thereof,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.17. The ſenſual Accommodations and Pleaſures of this Life ſoon forſake us, and leave us big of Deſires, but void of Satisfaction: and then we find the Wiſe Man's words verified, <hi>The end of our Mirth is heavineſs,</hi> Prov. 14.13. This is always the caſe of thoſe who extreamly love this World's Delights, and then are deprived of them; their extravagant Love of them breeds an exceſſive Grief and Anguiſh, Diſquietude and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Minds, ſo that they pay dear for the ſhort fruition of thoſe Pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="11">§ 11. And further, if we enter into a ſober enquiry concerning theſe things, we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are not only vain and vexatious, but even dangerous and harmful. It is certain, that there is a greater variety of Temptations in a plentiful Condition, than in that which is mean and afflictive. It is unanimouſly agreed by all underſtanding Men, That it is an eaſier Task to govern our ſelves in Adverſity than in Proſperity; becauſe the inconveniencies of the former are plainly ſeen and diſcover'd, but the evils of the latter are diſguiſed, &amp; we periſh before we are aware of it.<note place="margin">The danger of Proſperity.</note> The Man is wounded with a Sting dipt in Honey; he is pompouſly

ſlain, and diſpatched with a gilded Dagger. His Mirth is his Bane; he laughs himſelf to Death, and Dances to the Grave. It is impoſſible to reckon up all the Evils &amp; Miſchiefs which a great Abundance of the Things of this World betrays Men to. It is generally the Mother of Pride and Arrogance, it is the Nurſe of Wantonneſs, Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury &amp; Lewdneſs; it is the Parent of Sloth &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; it keeps Men at a diſtance from Vertue, and alienates them from Religion, &amp; makes them forget the Almighty, for <hi>they wax ſat, &amp; kick, and forſake God, who made them.</hi> Deut. 32.15. And by this means their Fulneſs and Proſperity prove fatal &amp; deſtructive to them. Like <hi>Haman</hi> at the Queen's Banquet, they are careſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galed, but are ſoon hurried away to Execution. This is the true State of thoſe that indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in worldly Affluence, Riches &amp; Pleaſures: And therefore a <hi>Sober Man</hi> will not glut himſelf with them, nor prize them at a high rate, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he will not prefer them before his immortal Soul, &amp; the Concerns of Eternity. He is one that will not be put off with the Things of this World: Theſe are not the Things that will ſatisfie him. He abhors to be of the number of thoſe wretched Creatures who <hi>have their good things in this Life,</hi> and hereafter muſt be miſerable. He reckons not upon the outward and tranſitory Enjoyments of this World; he values not himſelf upon the Thoughts of theſe; for he conſiders that theſe ordinary Gifts of Providence are no Arguments of God's good will to him; nay, he is apprehenſive that theſe common Bleſſings may in the iſſue turn into real Curſes and Judgments to him. Theſe are the ſober Thoughts which he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

as theſe, Let us be very little concerned for the Things of this World, and then we ſhall not free and vex our ſelves at any Diſappointment. Let us remember that all things are govern'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of by Divine Providence, and therfore it is unſufferable Folly to be diſpleaſed at whatſoever happens. Let us call to mind the Reaſon that St. <hi>James</hi> gives why <hi>every Man ſhould be ſlow to Wrath,</hi> namely, becauſe <hi>the wrath of Man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Jam. 1.20. that is, he that is of a wrathful &amp; angry Spirit will never be able to do that which was enjoined him by God, and the excellent Rules of the Goſpel; for this Temper is no ways ſuitable to the Evangelical Diſpoſition.

Neither eat nor drink to the prejudice of your Health.<note place="margin">Rules to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>&amp;</hi> judge of our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> It may ſeem ſtrange that any ſhould need to be directed to this, for bodily Health is ſo great a Bleſſing, that it invites us of it ſelf to take all care to preſerve it. But ſuch is the depraved Nature of Man, that he is careleſs of the Welfare of his Body, as well as of that of his Soul, and for the ſhort Pleaſure of gratifying his Appetite, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily brings upon himſelf Pains &amp; Diſeaſes. But this admirable Vertue which I am treating of, teaches you to correct this groſs Folly, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prize your Bodily Health, that it may be ſerviceable to that of your Souls, and that by both you may be fitted to diſcharge thoſe Duties which God requires of you. Therefore you muſt never indulge your ſelves in thoſe immoderate draughts, and that intemperate feeding which you know will diſturb your Healthful Temper, and end in Sickneſs and Diſeaſes: as it is certain moſt of the Diſtempers of the Body are occaſioned, more or leſs, by the undue and irregular uſe of Meats and drinks. Know then and remember this, that Health is too precious a thing to be thrown away for the pleaſing of an unruly Appetite, or the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the importunity of others.</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. II. Neither eat nor drink to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of you <hi>Reaſons</hi> &amp; <hi>Underſtandings.</hi> Bodily Health is a great bleſſing, but Soundneſs of Mind is a far greater, and therefore you muſt be careful to keep and maintain this. Which you cannot do if you give way to immoderate Eating &amp; Drinking. And hereby you may know whether you go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of true Sobriety, namely, when you
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:039825_0127_101661904CC23470"/>
ſo load your Stomachs as to render your ſelves dull and uſeleſs, and when you weaken and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair your Underſtandings by the portion of drink which you take. If you find your ſelves diſordered in your Minds, if the free uſe of your Reaſon be hindred, ſo that you are not under the Command of that ruling Faculty, conclude that you feed and drink to Exceſs, and that you tranſgreſs the Laws of Chriſtian Sobriety.</p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. III. Let your eating and drinking be ſo ordered, that you conſume not too much of your precious Time. If there were nothing but this, namely, the loſs of ſo many Hours, which are uſually ſpent in the Meetings of luxurious Perſons, it were enough to convince you of the Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this Exerciſe, and to diſſwade you from the practice of it. Though you proceed not ſo far as to diſtemper your Brains, or to impair your Health, yet the laviſhing away of ſo much Time, is contrary to the Laws of Chriſtian Sobriety. Your Time is given you for the neceſſary Works of your Calling, for the Buſineſs of this Life, but much more for the Concerns of another: And your Time is little enough for theſe. Therefore ſpend none of it in the Society of debauch'd Men; embezel not your precious hours, for if you do, you can't be reckon'd a ſober Man, though you ſhould avoid being drunk.</p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. IV. Cheriſh not any unlawful Paſſion by your eating and drinking. If you find that Wantoneſs, Luſt and Lewd Deſires are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by that quantity or kind of Meat and Drink which you take, know that it is immoderate, and learn afterwards to ſtint your ſelves. If you find that your Anger and Wrath are ſtirred up by the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:039825_0128_101661948300D838"/>
portions of Drink which you uſe your ſelves to, conclude immediately that you are guilty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and for the future take care to reſtrain your ſelves. Briefly, then you eat and drink beyond the meaſures of Sobriety, when you render your ſelves unfit for the Service of God, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of your Callings, and when you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote in your ſelves or others any vitious Habits or Inclinations.</p>
               <p n="26">§ 26. Secondly, The Grace of Sobriety compriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it <hi>Continence</hi> or <hi>Chaſtity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of Chaſtity.</note> which is not only a ſubduing of <hi>Luſtful Deſires</hi> &amp; <hi>Affections,</hi> as you heard before, but an actual refraining from all carnal Delights that are unlawful. This Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſtrictly enjoins us to avoid Fornication and Adultery, and all manner of Uncleanneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are direct Deviations from the natural End and Uſe of thoſe Paſſions and Enjoyments which are permitted us; and therefore the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Nature and rational Part of Man allow not of them. <hi>The Body is not for Fornication but for the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor 6.13. As much as to ſay, our Bodies were ordained for Holy and Religious Uſes, and therefore muſt not be prophaned by Luſt. They, as well as our Souls, were made to be employed in the Service of our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi>; they are dedicated and devoted to his Honour, and therefore it is a ſacrilegious Alienation of them to make them ſerviceable to Uncleanneſs. And as <hi>the Body is for the Lord,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle adds, <hi>the Lord is for the Body,</hi> that is, Chriſt came to ſanctifie and redeem our Bodies as well as our Souls, and therefore the one as well as the other muſt be conſecrated to his Service. And
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:039825_0129_101661967B89D240"/>
again, in the 15th Verſe he reminds us, <hi>That our Bodies are the Members of Chriſt:</hi> They to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our better Part are myſtically united to Chriſt their Head, and ſhall we then dare to defite them by Fornication, or any other acts of Concupiſcence? <hi>Shall we take the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot? God forbid</hi>; as the Apoſtle in the ſame place ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Our care ſhould be to be of the number of thoſe who (as our Saviour expreſſes it) <hi>make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 19.12. that is, ſuch who ſubdue their carnal Luſt, and mortifie the Fleſh, as knowing that otherwiſe they ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God. This is the meaning of that Exhortation to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> That <hi>every one of them ſhould know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel,</hi> that is, his own Body, <hi>in Sanctification and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, not in the Luſt of Concupiſcence,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.3, 4. that they preſerve themſelves in perfect Chaſtity, whether in a ſingle or a married Life. And to this end we are to obſerve the Apoſtles Rule, to <hi>keep under our Bodies, and to bring them into ſubjection,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. to fly from the Allurements and Enticements of the Fleſh, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and guard our ſelves againſt all its ſinful Charms, and never to tread in the ſteps of our firſt Parents, who longed after no Fruit ſo much as that which was <hi>forbidden</hi> Yea, this Vertue which I am ſpeaking of obliges us not only to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the unlawful Enjoyment &amp; Gratifications of the Fleſh, but to be moderate in the lawful and innocent ones. For if we take the liberty to go to the utmoſt verge and extert of what we

He conſiders that the uſe of Speech is an Eſpecial and peculiar Bleſſing conferr'd upon Man, for of all the Creatures in the World he alone is able to utter his mind by words: and therefore 'tis reaſonable that that whereby Man Excelleth, and is diſtinguiſh'd from all other Creatures ſhould be Employ'd to ſome Excellent purpoſe, &amp; there is none more Excellent then that of Religion. Wherefore we are to be careful about our words and ſpeeches, and this rather becauſe there is a general Neglect as to this very thing, &amp; too many of thoſe that make profeſſion of <hi>Sobriety</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, are defective and faulty here.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian Sobriety doth likewiſe diſcover it ſelf in the <hi>Countenance,</hi> rendring it grave and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, &amp; yet pleaſant &amp; amiable Our Saviour, upon occaſion found fault with his Diſciples for their <hi>ſad and dejected Looks,</hi> Luke 24 17.

We muſt have a care that we miſtake not Sullenneſs for Gravity, and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly for Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. But on the other ſide, to addict our ſelves to Gaiety and Jollity is abſolutely againſt Chriſtian Sobriety and Decencey, for a Chriſtian muſt be ſtaid and ſerious, and do nothing that argues a vain and frothy Mind. Therefore childiſh and fooliſh, trifling and unmanly Actions are unworthy of his excellent Profeſſion, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a light and fantaſtick Spirit.

He muſt ſhun all Paſtimes that are accompanied with Intemperance, Luxury, and exceſſive Mirth, or that ſtir Men up to Paſſion and Revenge, to Quarrels and Contentions, or to Coveteouſneſs, and a greedy deſire of Gain. He muſt avoid all ſuch Diverſions as take up too much Time, or carry off his Thoughts from Religion, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſerious: Such are <hi>Common Stage-Plays</hi> and the <hi>Games</hi> that are now in uſe among vain and diſſolute Perſons. They are the immediate Inſtruments of Vice and Folly, and in their own Nature adminiſter to Looſeneſs and Debauchery.

They corrupt Men not accidentally (as ſome would expreſs it) but directly, and for the moſt part by the deſign and intention of thoſe that uſe them</p>
               <p>Nay, we ought to be cautious in the uſe of thoſe Recreations which are in themſelves Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, leſt by our abuſing of them they become the occaſion of Sin and Folly, Though we are in the World, yet we are not to reckon our ſelves to be of it, and therefore we are to deny our ſelves as to ſome Cuſtoms and Practiſes, which though in themſelves ſimply conſider'd are not Vitious, yet are apt to betray us to what is ſo, and will certainly make us like the Men of the World.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. And I might add this, That we muſt always quit our <hi>private Accommodations,</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Profits for the publick and common Good, and more eſpecially for the ſake of God's Church; as it is recorded of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> &amp; <hi>Daniel,</hi> that they denied themſelves for a time the uſe of the Comforts and Refreſhments of this Life, to ſymphatize and condole with their afflicted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Nation, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3.10.3. And I ſuperadd this, with relation to theſe &amp; all other Accomodations and Delights of the World, that if God ſhall bring us into ſuch Circumſtances that we cannot keep theſe things, and at the ſame time retain a good Conſcience, we muſt then be willing to part with them all, that we may hold and keep the one thing neceſſary. This will be a convincing proof of our ſober and ſelf-denying Temper.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Moreover, if we will acquit our ſelves as thoſe that have this frame of Spirit, we muſt
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:039825_0135_101661ABF1F81958"/>
ſhake off all Sloth and Security, and be Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Vigilant.<note place="margin">Watchfulneſs.</note> Theſe two, <hi>Sobriety</hi> &amp; <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable Companions, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghoſt hath joined them together, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7.5.8. We cannot be Sober, unleſs we ceaſe to be drowzy and careleſs, unleſs we continually be upon our Guard and Watch, and be very diligent and circumſpect in ſhunning all Temptations to Sin &amp; Vanity. And to this end and purpoſe let us avoid all wicked Converſe and Society, let us not aſſociate with Jewd irreligious Perſons, but join our ſelves to the Company of the Godly and Pious, &amp; we ſhall find the Happy influence of their Converſation upon us.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. And next to our <hi>Company</hi> let us look to our <hi>Time,</hi> &amp; be careful how we paſs our Hours:<note place="margin">Of Redeeming our Time.</note> Of which I have partly ſpoken before, and now I cannot ſay enough of it. But this muſt needs be ſaid, that he that makes no Conſcience of ſpending his Time, will never be a ſober Man or Chriſtian. Wherefore let us ever be employed in ſome lawful and uſeful Buſineſs, either ſuch as belongs to our particular Calling, as we are placed in the World, or ſuch as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to our general Calling and Profeſſion, as we are Chriſtians. <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocence, had his Work and Employment appointed him by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and after his Fall we read he was ſet to his Work and Labour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. and no Man ſince can plead exemption, unleſs he diſclaims his deſcent from <hi>Adam.</hi> Every one muſt <hi>in the ſweat of his Face eat Bread,</hi> as we
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:039825_0136_101661AD79495C08"/>
find it determined in that forenamed place: he muſt live and ſubſiſt by his lawful Labour &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, by the ſweat of the Brow or of the Brain: he much ſpent his Time and Pains in doing what God hath ſet him about. We are not allowed to throw away our Hours on unneceſſary Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and impertinent Studies, which is the great fault of the World. Eſpecially let not our Time be ſquandred away in idle Diſputes, and needleſs Controverſies in Religion, let us not purſue Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, whilſt we let go the Subſtance. The Life of Religion is by this means devoured, for whilſt Men are taking up with needleſs Matters, they neglect the doing of many a neceſſary Action, and ſuch as would certainly pleaſe God, &amp; edify their Brethren. Let us then betake our ſelves with all care and application to the Practice of Religion, and ſpend our Days in that Employment. How precious is every ſingle Minute! And yet with what ſpeed doth it haſten away; And when it is paſt it cannot be recalled, it cannot poſſibly be retrieved. Therefore whilſt it is ours, let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, and not be laviſh of ſo rich a Treaſure; having this always in our mind, that in this ſhort Life is got or loſt that Life which is Eternal. And becauſe we have ſo ill Husbanded our paſt Time, let us be the more ſollicitous about the right ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging thoſe portions of it that are to come. Let us labour to prevent our future Revolts by our preſent cleaving unto the Lord with full purpoſe of Heart, by arming our ſelves againſt Sin by a firm and ſteady Reſolution: for this becomes a ſober and fixed Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8 I will mention one thing more, which neceſſarily relates to our Duty <hi>towards our ſelves,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:039825_0137_101661B1B60F7658"/>
and that is a Chriſtian care of our <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Self Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> on which the doing of all <hi>other</hi> parts of our Duty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. We muſt not wilfully neglect, hurt, or injure our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: as not by Exceſs &amp; Intemperance (of which I ſpake before) ſo not by denying our ſelves thoſe Things that are fitting and neceſſary, and are for the ſupport of our Lives and Health. But eſpecially we are forbid by the Laws of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Sobriety, to lay violent Hands on our ſelves. <hi>Do thy ſelf no harm,</hi> ſaid St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Jaylor, who <hi>drew his Sword, &amp; would have killed himſelf,</hi> Acts 16.27, 28. To bereave our ſelves of Life, and to procure our own Death, is not only a harming and injuring of our ſelves, but an affront to God's Authority and Sovereignty, it is a manifeſt proof of an unmanly Fear &amp; Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize, of Impatience, Diſtruſt and Deſpair; and in a word, is an argument of Madneſs, and not of Sobriety.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. And thus I have given you a Deſcription of that excellent Grace of <hi>Sobriety</hi>; which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally miſtaken, and therefore I have been the larger in ſetting forth the juſt Limits and extent of it. Vulgar Heads think, that to be <hi>Sober</hi> is only abſtaining from Drunkenneſs and ſuch like Exceſs; and others have a very lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect notion of this Duty. But the true and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat account of it is this, It is a rectitude of the Judgment, it is a freedom from inordinate Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is the Government of our Spirits, and the command of our Actions. It is that holy Diſcipline of the Soul, whereby its unreaſonable Motions are reſtrained, and its unruly Appetites
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:039825_0138_101661B437AF4790"/>
allay'd, and made to ſubmit to the Laws of Chriſt. Hereby we do nothing to diſcompoſe the healthful plight of our Bodies, nothing to dull the Faculties of our Minds, nothing to excite and inrage our Paſſions. Hereby we are taught to be chaſt and temperate, to be humble, ſubmiſſive and content, and to demean our ſelves in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as becomes us. Hereby we are taught modeſty in Words, Looks, Apparel and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Hereby we learn to be moderate in the purſuit of Earthly things, and to be wary and cautious in the uſe of them. Hereby we gain the Art of not being diſturbed with the Evils, or inveigled by the good Things of this Life. Here by we live comfortably in this World, and are fitted for a better hereafter. Theſe are the excellent Things which this Grace is compoſed of; or rather, it is not to be called a Grace, if you mean by it a ſingle one, but a complication of many.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. And this ſhews that thoſe who are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of thoſe admirable Things, are of a moſt excellent Spirit, and that they are acted by moſt excellent Principles. And I need not prove, I think, that ſuch Perſons live a very deſirable and pleaſant Life; for it muſt needs be delightful to keep the Mind ſound and clear, to be free from bomerous Paſſions and Luſts, to have none but wholeſom and regular Pleaſures, and to have our Thoughts continually in Heaven, and even here to caſt of thoſe unmixt Joys. Let the corrupt and debauched part of Mankind ſay what they pleaſe, it is moſt certain that there is no Life ſo pleaſant and raviſhing as this, none ſo ſweet, none ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious. So much for this firſt Part of Religion, which properly relates to <hi>our Selves.</hi> For though

               <p n="11">§. 11. The Second Part of <hi>Practical Religion</hi> conſiſts in thoſe Actions and Offices which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our <hi>Neighbours</hi> &amp; <hi>Brethren,</hi> and all Ranks and Qualities of Perſons that we converſe with in the World.<note place="margin">The Second Part of Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Religion, of Duty towards Others.</note> For being all Members of the ſame Body, we are joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a common Tye, and are to act for the good of the whole, and of each other in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And hence ariſes the neceſſity, as well as the reaſonableneſs of that ſort of Humane Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Duties, which the Apoſtle expreſſes by <hi>living Righteouſly</hi> or <hi>Juſtly.</hi> This comprehends in it not only all acts of <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, but likewiſe all acts of <hi>Mercy</hi> &amp; <hi>Charity,</hi> and in ſhort, our whole Duty that we owe to <hi>others.</hi> That I may the more plainly and diſtinctly ſet this <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> before you in its ſeveral Parts and Branches, I will begin firſt with thoſe acts of our Duty toward others which relate to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Ranks &amp; Degrees of Perſons in the World, and which have a mixture of both <hi>Juſtice</hi> &amp; <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Secondly, I will proceed to thoſe Duties, which ſtrictly may be ſaid to be acts of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And Thirdly, I will Diſcourſe of the Offices of <hi>Charity</hi> properly ſo called.</p>

Kings and their Subjects; together with Subordinate Magiſtrates, and thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Charge. 2. Spiritual Paſtors and their Flock. 3. The Husband and his Wife. 4 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and their Children. 5. Maſters and their Servants.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. The Firſt <hi>Relation</hi> is that of a King and his Subjects: and there are proper Duties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to both. The Office of Kings and Supreme Governours, or (as the Apoſtle calls them the <hi>Higher Powers</hi>) is thus briefly ſumm'd up in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. They are to be <hi>a Terror to Evil works, but thoſe that do Good are to have praiſe of them.</hi> It is abſolutely required of Kings,<note place="margin">The Office of a Pious Prince.</note> that they reſtrain Vice by puniſhing it: and if there be occaſion, they ought to augment the Penalties of Sin and Wickedneſs, and make them more heavy and grievous, that Vice may not be augmented and increaſed, by reaſon of the too eaſy reſtraints that are laid upon it. And as there is need of prudent and ſeaſonable Severity, ſo on other occaſions, Mildneſs and Clemency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Prince. To cruſh and ſqueeze his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is the moſt abhorrent thought imaginable, and the fartheſt from his practiſe, for he Remembers that he is the Father of his Country, &amp; therefore is to be Compaſſionate and Merciful, &amp; to bear a tender Affection to them, and to ſhew by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and Rewards, which he diſtributes, that he hath a ſingular Kindneſs and Favour for thoſe that are Vertuous and Worthy. A great part of his Royal work is to Preſerve and Aſſert
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:039825_0141_101661BAD3001708"/>
the Civil Rights, Liberties, and Privileges of his Subjects, to Defend &amp; Protect them in their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and Properties; not to make his own Will the ſtandard of his Actions towards them, but to keep the Law, as well as they. For a King is he that Rules according to the Laws, &amp; always makes the good of his People, his Grand and Principal End: whereas a Tyrant makes his own Will his Law, and never conſults the well-fare of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And as a good Prince maintains the ſecular Rights and Properties of thoſe over whom he is ſet, ſo in a more ſpecial manner, he upholds them in their Religion, and thinks it an Honour as well as his Duty, to promote the Fear and Worſhip of the moſt High among them. <hi>We think it well be comes our high Place and Station,</hi> ſaid the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Valentinian, to give Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions &amp; Injunctions to our Subjects concerning Religion.</hi> And thoſe were admirable words of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Honorius, We do nothing elſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the heat of War, or in the cool retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Peace, but Conſult and Order bow the good People of our Empire may truly Worſhip God, and ſpend their days in his Service.</hi> Thus it is the Glory of Crown'd Heads, to advance the Honour of the King of Kings, to be Guardians of the Church, to be Patrons of Religion, and to be eminently Pious themſelves. And certain it is, that nothing is ſo dear to Heaven, and ſo benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to Mankind as ſuch a Prince.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Again, there is the Duty of Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magiſtrates, who are call'd <hi>Governours that are ſent by</hi> the Supreme Power, 1 Pet. 2.14. And the Apoſtle there tells us, to what End and Purpoſe they are ſent, viz. <hi>For the puniſhment
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:039825_0142_101661BFAECAE5A8"/>
of Evil doers,</hi> &amp; <hi>for the praiſe of them that do well.</hi> So that from comparing this with what <hi>St. Paul</hi> had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">The general Office of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</note> it is clear, that the deſign of the Supreme Ruler, and of thoſe that are placed under him, ought to be the ſame, that is, to take care that Vice be effectually reſtrain'd and that Vertue be encouraged; that Puniſhments be Inflicted, and Rewards diſpens'd according to the Deſerts of Perſons. They miſerably pervert the End and Deſign of their <hi>bearing the Sword,</hi> if they turn the edge of it to the good, and the back of it to the Wicked. Yea certainly, becauſe the good are not ſo numerous as the Wicked, thoſe that are in Authority ought more eſpecially to exerciſe this Part of ſeverity, which conſiſts in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dverting upon theſe latter, and puniſhing all obſtinate Criminals and Offenders. And here in a more ſignal manner it is required of them that they take notice of thoſe Sins and Enormities which prevail moſt in the places where they are, the reigning Sins of the Age, ſuch as Idleneſs, Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Swearing, Forſwearing, Prophaning the Chriſtian Sabbath, exceſſive Pride and Luxury, which laſt have been cured hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Sumptuary Laws, but now the Diſeaſe breaks out afreſh: All theſe ſhould be chaſtiſed and kept under by publick Penalties.</p>
               <p n="15">§ 15. And it is requiſite in order to this, that Magiſtrates be Perſons of great Courage &amp; Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, &amp; no ways affrighted at the thoughts of that ill treatment they meet with in the diſcharge of of their Truſt, and the faithful Execution of their Office. They are the Phyſicians of the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:039825_0143_101661C23AF6F0B0"/>
and accordingly muſt remember, that it is ſcarce poſſible to oppoſe the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> with great ſeverity, and to pleaſe the <hi>Patient</hi> at the ſame time: And therefore they muſt reſolve upon the unwearied performance of their Duty, although they purchaſe ill will, and be loaded with oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy for their pains. All that I will add under this Head, is, that in Magiſtrates and Rulers a perſonal Goodneſs and Worthineſs, and a care of their own Families are requiſite to make them exactly fit for their Employment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for none can ſo effectually Rule over others, as thoſe that have the art of governing themſelves and the Perſons that more nearly belong to them. Beſides that, it is a ſhame for them to terrifie Vice abroad, and yet to cheriſh it within their own Doors. It is ſcandalous to ſtrike with the Sword of Juſtice at the Sins of the Town or Country they live in, and yet ſuffer their own Habitations to be a Refuge of Prophaneneſs and Irreligion, a Nurſery of Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Immorality. Muſt they check Vice only becauſe it is open and publick, and walks the Streets and Market-places? and at the ſame time muſt it be received into their Families and lurk within their Walls, and there find Protection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Puniſhment? No, by no means. The firſt thing they are to do is to extirpate Vice out of their own Lives, &amp; thoſe of their Houſhold, and then they may with confidence &amp; ſucceſs attempt the reforming of the Publick.</p>
               <p n="16">§ 16. On the other ſide there is the Duty of <hi>Subjects,</hi> and all ſuch as are under Authority. There is a <hi>Fighteouſneſs</hi> required of them toward their Rulers and Governours, and it is called <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> &amp; <hi>Submiſſion.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands

But more eſpecially with regard to the former, that is, the Perſon whom God and the Laws have inveſted with the Sovereign Power, our Duty is to pay a due <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.21. for God hath communicated his Authority to the Supreme Powers, and made them his Deputies and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, and therefore we ought to Reverence God in them.

Nor are we bound only to give Reſpect &amp; Honour to them, but to <hi>Love</hi> them, as they are Good and Vertuous, as they are Religious and Pious, as they are lovers of their People and ſollicitous to promote their Welfare in every thing, &amp; to rule them in the fear of God. It is our Duty to <hi>Pray</hi> for them, according to the pattern ſet us in the former part of the 20th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and according to the Injunction of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. We are to implore the Almighty to preſerve them as the Inſtruments of his Glory, the Protectors and Fathers of their Country, and that they may ſerve the true ends of Government and advance the Scepter and Kingdom of Jeſus</p>
               <p>It is our Duty alſo to pay them <hi>Taxes</hi> &amp; <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> for the ſupport of their Government, <hi>Rom.</hi>

Word and Sacraments. And theſe have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Duty &amp; Office with reſpect to their Charge. They whoſe work it is to teach others their Duty, have a peculiar one of their own, and that of a very large extent, and they, of all Men, are the moſt obliged to diſcharge it with the greateſt care &amp; exactneſs. A Miniſter, of all Perſons, is more ſignally obliged to underſtand and purſue the ends of his Calling, for though all other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be made uſe of to pious Purpoſes, that is, in the honeſt &amp; faithful diſcharge of them, the reſpective Perſons ought to glorifie God, and do ſome good to Mankind; yet this Calling is more eminently deſigned for thoſe Ends, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fitted for them. The Office of publick Inſtructers and ſpiritual Paſtors is expreſſed in Scripture by ſuch general Terms as theſe, <hi>Feeding the Flock of God, &amp; taking the overſight thereof,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.2. <hi>Waiting on the Miniſtry,</hi> Rom. 12.7. and <hi>taking heed to it,</hi> Col. 4 17. <hi>taking heed to themſelves, and to all the Flock,</hi> Acts 20.28. Firſt according to the Apoſtle's Order &amp; Method, they are to look to Themſelves, that is, their own Lives and Behaviour: Here they muſt begin, or elſe all their Labour will be in vain. Piety and Holineſs muſt ſhine in their Converſations, or otherwiſe their Doctrine will have but little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on their Hearers. They are to addict themſelves to Religion above the ordinary rate of Mankind, becauſe thoſe that teach others to be good and holy, ought to be much more ſo themſelves. They are to conſider that if they be Vitious, their Actions and Behaviour will do more harm than their Tongues can do good: But on the contrary, the ſtrictneſs and unblameable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:039825_0148_101661CE9D403478"/>
of their Lives, will Effectually commend their Admonitions &amp; Precepts to the People: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are concerned to be <hi>Examples to the Flock,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.3. To be Spotleſs and untainted in their manners, &amp; to ſtrive to out-do all others in Vertue and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Then as to the particular branches, of their Care and Overſight of their Flock, they are ſuch as theſe, to admit Perſons into the Church by Baptiſm, to Eject thoſe that are Scandalous, to Reſtore the Penitent, to Adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to thoſe that are worthy, to viſit the Sick, to offer up Publick Prayers, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to adviſe, admoniſh and Inſtruct; and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Preach the Goſpel, which is their greateſt and weightieſt work. Here their peculiar Office is to deliver to the People, in a Plain and Methodical way, thoſe ſubſtantial heads of Religion, which they are to be Inſtructed in for their Souls health. They muſt lay their Foundation well, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint their hearers with the Neceſſary Principles of Chriſtianity, and ſo build them up in their moſt Holy Faith. They muſt endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Chriſtian Religion to them in its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſhape, that they may have a true account of it, and thence be throughly convinc'd of its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency. They muſt take care to Feed the Flock of Chriſt with wholeſome Food, with ſound Doctrine, ſuch as is grounded on the Holy Scriptures, and not on humane Invention; and following St. <hi>Pauls</hi> example, they muſt <hi>keep back nothing that is profitable to them, Acts</hi> 20.20. They muſt <hi>warn them that are unruly, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the feeble-minded, &amp; ſupport the weak,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflicted in body, or under the ſenſe of Sin
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:039825_0149_101661D18B72F820"/>
and guilt. Every way they muſt apply themſelves to the needs and Exigencies of their Flock.</p>
               <p>Nor is it their employment only to Inform and Inſtruct mens minds, and to adminiſter ſolace to them, but it is required of them, that they labour to reform their Lives, &amp; cauſe them, through the aſſiſtance of the Divine Grace, to ſhew the vertue of their Principles in the holineſs of their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. To which purpoſe they ought to uſe their utmoſt diligence, joyn'd with great Zeal &amp; Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, in laying open the faults and miſcarriages of mens lives, in a Free and Impartial reproving of all Sin, and denouncing the Judgments of God againſt offenders, in Pathetick Exhortations to a Religious and Godly Converſation, in quickning and exciting them to the performance of all Chriſtian Duties, and a Conſcientious obſervance of all the Sacred Ordinances and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and a conſtant devoting themſelves to the Service and Worſhip of God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; and a humble Submiſſion to the Diſcipline of the Goſpel: all which are deſign'd by the Wiſdom of God, for the advancing of his Glory in the World, &amp; for the promoting of the Converſion and Salvation of Mankind. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ought to be the chiefeſt deſire, Prayer &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of a Miniſter of Chriſt, to convert Sinners from the evil of their ways, and to make men Everlaſtingly happy, and thereby to enlarge the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviovr Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. This is the nature of the Miniſterial charge, this is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Ministry.</hi> Col. 4.17. <hi>And making full proof of their Miniſtry.</hi> 2 Tim 4.5. That is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it throughly &amp; fully &amp; diſcharging all the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:039825_0150_101661D31B8E8CD8"/>
parts of that Office. There is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Miniſters of the Goſpel &amp; others, that the latter are more eſpecially to Look to their own Salvation, but the former are obliged by vertue of their particular Function, to make it their great buſineſs to look after the Salvation of others. And therefore they can't be ſaid to Act <hi>Righteouſly,</hi> that is, to perform the task which is required of them toward <hi>others,</hi> unleſs they mind this great work. Yea, if they wilfully Neglect it, they are faithleſs &amp; perfidious, they betray the Cauſe of Chriſt, and are falſe to men's Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. There is alſo the proper and Peculiar Duty of the <hi>Flock</hi>; for the Eccleſiaſtical Rulers, as well as the Civil ones, call for your Obedience and Subjection: according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Remember them who have the rule over you who have ſpoken unto you the word of God,</hi> Heb. 137.<note place="margin">The Duty of a Church to Ministers.</note>

Therefore they may rightly Challenge from you Reſpect and Honour: you are (as the Apoſtle adviſes 1 Cor 4.1. <hi>To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them as of the Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> (who come not in their own Name and Authority but in Chriſt's) &amp; <hi>as Stewards of the Myſteries of God,</hi> ſuch as have the Honour to be intruſted by him with the care of his Houſe, with the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments

of the Church which are full of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Myſtery. This is <hi>to know them who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among you, &amp; are over you in the Lord, &amp; admoniſh you,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12. as the Apoſtle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets himſelf in the following Verſe, <hi>Eſteem them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi> And if you eſteem &amp; love the Paſtors of the Church, you will ſupport them with an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maintenance, ſeeing this alſo is of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. <hi>The Lord hath ordained that they who preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that rule well, eſpecially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine, to be counted worthy of double Honour</hi>; and he adds this Reaſon, <hi>For the Labourer is worthy of his Reward,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17, 18. Thus it is the Will and Appointment of our great Maſter and his Apoſtles, that thoſe who ſerve him faithfully in the Office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſhould be provided for and rewarded by you, and that thereby you ſhould ſhew that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard which is due to them on the account of their Excellent Employment and Function.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. But in the next place I will mention your Duty toward your Spiritual Paſtors, as it exactly anſwers to the ſeveral parts of <hi>their</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice towards you. Thus as they are to be Patterns to you of all Goodneſs and Piety, ſo you are to follow their Example, and to imitate them in all thoſe Praiſe worthy Actions which you obſerve in them.

Eſpecially in this corrupt Age you are concerned to beware of Seducers, who make it their buſineſs to unſettle and unhinge Religion, and call into queſtion the moſt ſubſtantial Points of our Faith. But ſee that you attend to the Apoſtle's advice, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>Believe not every Spirit</hi> (that is, every Teacher, every Doctrine that pretends to the Spirit of God) <hi>but try the Spirits whether they be of God,</hi> try them by the Holy Word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially expounded.

Again as they are by their Office ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to reprove and rebuke you for the omiſſion and neglect of your Duty, and for the actual Miſcarriages of your Lives, ſo you are bound to be thankful to them for their plain Dealing with you, &amp; to improve thoſe ſharp Methods for your real benefit and advantage. And when Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Judgments are denounced by them againſt you out of the Book of God, you ought to entertain them with that fear and dread which becomes you, and to look upon the ſevereſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of his Miniſters as the proper means of procuring your Good and Welfare. And as it is another part of the Work of Spiritual Guides to adminiſter Conſolation to you when you are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and dejected, ſo it is your buſineſs not to refuſe to be comforted, not to ſpill your Cordials, but to make uſe of them for your Refreſhment, and in the ſtrength of them to perform your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with greater alacrity and readineſs.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Further, as it is a Branch of the Paſtoral Care and Employment to admoniſh, exhort, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and in Chriſt's Name to command you, ſo you lie under an obligation to hearken to &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their Admonitions, Exhortations, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties &amp; Commands, &amp; not to hinder the happy Operations of all thoſe Arguments, Motives and Inducements wherewith they labour to prevail upon you, and gain you to the practice of what is required of you.

Wherefore Parents are indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly obliged to make proviſion for their Children, to ſupply them with Food and Raiment, and all things neceſſary for Life, to conſult their bodily Health, and endeavour to preſerve them from Sickneſſes and Diſeaſes, and to take care of their Breeding and Education. There ought not only to be a preſent Maintenence, but a provident care for their future Suſtenance according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>The Parents ought to lay up for their Children,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.14. You are bound chiefly to contrive their Welfare and Support hereafter by bringing them up to ſome commendable Art or Employment which may adminiſter to them means of Livelihood when you are gone. They muſt not be ſuffered to eat the Bread of Idleneſs, and thereby become unprofitable Burdens of the Earth, and like the barren Fig-tree cumber the Ground: but as ſoon as they are capable, they are to be ſet into ſome way of Action, in order to their future well-being in the World; that in ſome honeſt Calling or Station they may be able to provide for themſelves when they come to the Age of Men; that in a lawful way they may eat their own Bread, and enjoy the Labour, not the Filching of their Hands.

Parents ſhould obſerve the Inclinations and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies of their Children, and accordingly in due time fix them in ſuch an Employment or way of Living as is moſt ſuitable to their Genius. But the principal care of Parents ſhould be with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſpiritual Welfare of their Children; and therefore all the following Rules will aim at this.</p>

And all the other Principles of Divine Knowledge, ſo far as they are able to receive them, are to be communicated to them. To which end I deſire Parents to conſult the firſt part of this Treatiſe, where I have ſet down all the neceſſary Articles of Religion which are to be known and believed. Let them thence furniſh themſelves with Principles of Religion, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to their young ones; but let them take care to propound them in the moſt uſeful and edifying manner, otherwiſe they will be of little uſe to them. If you are deſirous that they ſhould effectually receive Inſtruction in thoſe Divine Matters, forget not to proceed leiſurely and by degrees.

But by no means trouble and amuze their Minds with unneceſſary and doubtful Opinions. This is the way to confound them, not to edifie them. And therefore till they approach to ſome greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of underſtanding, uſe the utmoſt plainneſs toward them, and let them have no Doctrines propounded to them but what are very neceſſary and uſeful, and alſo ſuch as they are able in ſome meaſure to apprehend.</p>

               <p n="13">§. 13. 4<hi>thly,</hi> Intercede with Heaven for your Children: Make Addreſſes and Petitions in their behalf at the Throne of Grace,<note place="margin">Praying for your Children</note> for this is a proper way of deriving Bleſſings to them. It was <hi>Plato</hi>'s Judgment that no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were heard ſo ſoon as thoſe of <hi>Parents</hi> for their <hi>Children.</hi> There is no doubt of it, If they be the Prayers of the Faithful; and 'tis certain that thoſe <hi>Children</hi> rarely miſcarry who are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently &amp; heartily recommended to God in the ardent &amp; affectionate Petitions of their <hi>Parents.</hi> It cannot be, ſaid St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to <hi>Monica,</hi> St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Mother, that a Child of ſo many Prayers and Tears ſhould periſh; and ſhe found the Truth of it in the Converſion of her Son.

Wherefore be frequently on your Knees for your Little Ones: Begin to ſollicit for them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their Infancy; when the poor Babes cannot ſpeak for themſelves, ſpeak to God for them.

Nor doth this exclude the perſonal praying of your <hi>Children</hi> on their own behalf; wherefore you muſt often remind them of this great Concern, namely, to pray as well as they can for themſelves; and you are to take care that they every day practice it. Take it not ill if I exhort you to bring up your Children to be Beggars, that is continually to crave and beg the Mercy and Favour of God, humbly to beſeech him to beſtow upon them all things neceſſary for Life and Godlineſs, all Temporal and Spiritual Bleſſings.</p>

In their firſt budding and ſpringing forth take notice of them with harſh Language, with Anger and Frowns, and ſevere reprehenſions. Be warn'd by Old <hi>Eli,</hi> that indulgent cockener of his Sons, who could not find in his heart to ſnib and check them for thir ſoul miſcarriages, but cheriſh'd their Sin, and favour'd their Crimes by a ſlight and Superficial reproving of them.

If the crooked branches of a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Plant be warily &amp; gently bent, they will grow ſtreight: but if you handle them too roughly, you take the way to break them.

Let me tell you, all your Inſtructions, Exhortations and Perſwaſions, all your Reproofs and Corrections, yea and your Offers of Rewards will ſignifie little without this. You will pull down more by your bad Example than it is poſſible you can build up by the other means. Nor indeed can you reaſonably expect that your Children will be good and vertuous, when you endeavour not to be ſo your ſelves. Whilſt you indulge your ſelves in all manner of Sin and Folly, you can't have any ground to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they will be ſtrict and circumſpect in their Lives; for great is the force and prevalency of Example, eſpecially among <hi>Children.</hi> It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they generally live by it, and even then when you think they take no notice of you, they diligently mind how you behave your ſelves, and what courſe you take, and they readily ſquare their Manners by your Deportment.

               <p n="19">§. 19. And thus I have given you a ſhort Draught of the <hi>Duty of Parents toward their Children</hi>? which may be more briefly ſummed up in this one thing, <hi>Religious Education.</hi> I have inſiſted the longer upon this, becauſe upon it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Succeſs &amp; Happineſs of whole Nations: for Children being the great ſupport &amp; Hopes of Families, and theſe of Churches and Kingdoms, and all publick Societies, if the former be not vertuouſly brought up, we may deſpair of the Welfare of the latter. For which reaſon I thought it was requiſite to be very particular in laying down Rules and Directions for the pious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children, that <hi>Parents</hi> might not be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of Helps in this matter.</p>

A Conſideration of the Judgments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the neglect of ſuch Education.

Parents muſt give an Account of their Children. Of the Advantages and Bleſſings following the diſcharge of this Duty of Pious Education.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. 1. I. YOU that are <hi>Parents</hi> are the Perſons that firſt convey'd Sin and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your <hi>Children,</hi> and therefore you are bound in an eſpecial manner to do all you can toward the Rooting Vice out of them, &amp; the implanting of Grace and Holineſs in them. By your means Defilement was derived to their Nature, and by reaſon of that defiled Temper they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a proneneſs to all Evil, and an averſeneſs to whatever is good: So that you are engaged on this account to endeavour, as much as in you lies, to heal that Infection which they catched of you, to cure that contagion which you imparted to them. You ſet them into a ſinful &amp; miſerable World, and therefore you muſt prevent their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beguiled by it: You muſt labour to enlighten and rectifie their Minds, and to bring them to a love of Holineſs &amp; Piety. It muſt be your chiefeſt care that your Children may be <hi>Born again</hi>; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe their firſt Birth will be ſad &amp; deplorable, they will have cauſe to Curſe the Womb that bore them, and the Paps that gave them Sack.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. II. You that are <hi>Parents</hi> have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Room in the Affections of your Children, and therefore on that account you have the advantage, above all others, of inſtructing them, and doing all Offices of Religion toward them. Your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are prompted by the Dictates of Nature to love you, and what is there which Love will not
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:039825_0168_10166206C4807B28"/>
excite them to do? You are their beſt Friends and Benefactors: They are beholding to you for their Being, and their whole allowance is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from your hand. They will therefore hearken to you, and comply with your Directions and Admonitions, when you call upon them to conſider their Ways, and bring Credit both to you and to themſelves by a vertuous Behaviour. Your kindneſſes to them are ſo many &amp; ſo great, that, beſides the natural Inſtinct of Love, they will find themſelves obliged to do any thing that you fairly propound to them, and to return your Kindneſſes in that way which they are capable to do. The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Women, when their <hi>Children</hi> proved undutiful and refractory, were wont to lay open their Breaſts, &amp; to ſhew them their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ps, to remind them of their Love &amp; care in ſuckling of them &amp; bringing them up, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (if it were poſſible) to reduce them to a ſenſe of their Duty, &amp; to ſhame them into Obedience and good Manners. And certainly with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of any Ingenuity this is a very cogent and powerful way of dealing with them? but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they conſider further that they were not only nouriſhed by their Parents, but have ſince received all manner of good things from them, they will ſee that they have yet a ſtronger Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on them to do whatever their <hi>Parents</hi> enjoin them. Wherefore on this ſcore you have a vaſt Influence upon them, and may hope to prevail with them, and fix your pious Counſels and Precepts upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. III. As <hi>Children</hi> are tied by the Law of Nature to love their <hi>Parents,</hi> ſo you that are <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> are bound by the ſame Law to love them.
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:039825_0169_101662088ECEC198"/>
They are part of you, and therefore the natural Affection which is in your Breaſts teaches you to love them as your ſelves. Eſpecially the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Love is reckoned as the greateſt, becauſe ſhe is ſuppoſed to have Nurſed and Suckled her <hi>Children,</hi> which is not only a ſign of natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but a great increaſer of it in that Sex. But though this be much laid aſide of late by an ill Cuſtom, yet however, there is an inbred princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Love in <hi>Mothers,</hi> as ſuch. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> promotes and improves the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inſtinct of Love in <hi>both Parents,</hi> and alſo directs it to the higheſt end. It ſtirs them up not only to conſult and procure the bodily good of their Iſſue, but it bids them love them chiefly in ſuch a manner as is moſt conducible to the good of their Souls, and their everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The active Principle of Love in them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly moves them to this; for if they really love their Children, they will ſtrive to make them poſſeſſors of the greateſt Good, and of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bleſſings; and ſuch are the Favour of God, Grace and Holineſs, and eternal Life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you that are <hi>Parents</hi> muſt mind this in the firſt place, elſe you cannot be ſaid to love your Children as you ought, that is, to love them with the true Love of a <hi>Parent.</hi> This we may gather from thoſe places of Scripture where the Great God is pleaſed to expreſs his Love and Care to us by <hi>Paternal Affection,</hi> yea not only by the Love of a <hi>Father,</hi> but of a <hi>Mother</hi>: For can we think that he conſults only the Welfare of our Bodies? Doth he not ſhew his Love by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to our Souls and our future Happineſs? What a poor Affection is that which extends no
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:039825_0170_1016620D29847E88"/>
further than the outward Man?</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Say not then that you <hi>love your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> when you are not concerned in the leaſt for their better Part, and the Welfare of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirits. Say not that you love your Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, when with indiſcreet Fondneſs you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at their Faults, of even allow of them. You do not love, but hate them, whilſt you act thus; for the Softneſs and Indulgence which you uſe to them will but ſooth them into Hell, &amp; thus you become unmerciful and cruel to their Souls; you ſhew your ſelves more ſavage and barbarous than thoſe Idolatrous Parents of old, who made their Children paſs through the Fire to <hi>Moloch.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no one will call this <hi>Love.</hi> But then you may be truly ſaid to exert this Affection toward your <hi>Children,</hi> when, beſides your care of that part of their Education which relates to their Bodies, and outward Concerns, you look to their Souls, and mind their everlaſting Good, when you help them, through the divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, to the poſſeſſion of the <hi>one thing neceſſary which cannot be taken from them,</hi> which Thieves and Invaders cannot rob them of, which Power or Policy cannot extort from them, which Poverty and Exigence cannot deprive them of, which Sickneſs and Diſeaſes cannot impair in them, which Baniſhment and Perſecution cannot ſpoil them of, which Death it ſelf and the Grave can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder them from, but rather help to put them into a full fruition of. This is the true Love you ought to bear to your <hi>Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. And the reaſon of it is plain, becauſe the Souls of your <hi>Children</hi> ought to be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to you than their Bodies and temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:039825_0171_1016620FD40BC278"/>
Whence it follows, that it is an huge inſtance of Folly and Indiſcretion to be very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious about leaving an Eſtate to your <hi>Children,</hi> and yet not to concern your ſelves in the leaſt for their ſpiritual Welfare and Happineſs. This is a very prepoſterous and abſurd way of acting, and ſuch as becomes not Reaſonable Agents; and yet you are every day putting it in practice. So if your Child falls into the Fire or Water, you lament and cry out moſt paſſionately, and the whole Family is diſorder'd at the unhappy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and not without cauſe: but who can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that you are grieved and troubled when through your wilful negligence your Child runs headlong into Hell-fire, and drops into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit, and the Lake which burns with Fire and Brimſtone? Doth not this ſhew that you have not a true &amp; real Affection for thoſe whom you pretend moſt heartily to love? I beſeech you lay this ſeriouſly to Heart,<note place="margin">Wherein true Parental Love conſiſts.</note> and for the future convince the World that you bear a <hi>True Love</hi> to your Children, whilſt you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſecure their eternal Bliſs, by inſtructing them betimes in the Principles of Religion, and by being inſtrumental in ſeaſoning their young Years with Grace. Promote this good &amp; neceſſary Work, though it be with ſome Coſt and Charges to you. Perſwade your ſelves that your Money is well and wiſely laid out, when you disburſe it in order to Religion, and particularly when you are at ſome Expences to Educate your Children in the Knowledge of God and their Duty, &amp; to procure wholeſom Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their Souls, and to build them and your
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:039825_0172_10166211562AE188"/>
ſelves up in your moſt holy Faith, and to be in conſtant Enjoyment of thoſe Means which thro' the Divine Bleſſing, will make you wiſe unto Salvation. For this you muſt always bear in your Minds, that the Souls of your Children are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be taken care of, and that in order to that they are to be fraught with godly and vertuous Principles; and that this is the moſt eligible Portion &amp; Eſtate that you can provide for them.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. We find that thoſe who were moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd among the <hi>Pagans</hi> were not void of this apprehenſion, as appears from what <hi>Phocion,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Athenian,</hi> uſed to ſay when he was ſollicited to look after his Children, and get them Eſtates. If my Sons, ſaith he, be Vertuous, I ſhall leave them enough: but if they be Vitious, more would be too little. And that was an admirable ſaying of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> He that makes his Son a Man of worth, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſound Principles and good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, gives him much, and makes him a very Rich man, although he leaves him but a very mean Fortune. You then that are Parents may learn hence, how to ſhew your Affections to your Children: then you approve your ſelves very kind to them, &amp; then you entail upon them the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Riches and Revenues when you furniſh their Minds with Divine knowledge; and bring them up in the Service of God &amp; the Exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Set about this in good earneſt, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate your Children unto <hi>God.</hi> Let theſe little Images &amp; Pictures of your ſelves have <hi>his</hi> Image upon them. Shew your tender <hi>Love</hi> to them by making them like to him. For <hi>that</hi> is the Motive I have been uſing all this while, <hi>viz.</hi> That your Natural and Inbred <hi>Love</hi> to your Offspring, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages

The Law of natural Affection leads you to this, becauſe if you truly love your Children, you will love them in the beſt way, &amp; procure them, as far as you can, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bleſſings: for then you Act like Loving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents indeed.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. 4<hi>thly,</hi> Inſtruct your Children in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; bring them up in the Fear of the Lord, becauſe this is the <hi>Fitteſt Seaſon</hi> for this work. <hi>Now</hi> you may hope to be ſucceſsfull in your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps of Planting Grace in them, and Seaſoning them with Religion. Which is not ſo ſpoken or meant, as if it were in the abſolute Power of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to Extirpate Vice out of their Children, or to Implant the vertues of the Holy Spirit in them: No, it is not Birth or Breeding that entails Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on a Family. <hi>Cain</hi> &amp; <hi>Abel</hi> were Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alike, as well as they were from the ſame womb: and ſo were <hi>Eſau</hi> &amp; <hi>Jacob.</hi> And in daily Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we ſee that Education doth not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, Religion runs not in a Blood, is not by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from the Parent to the Child. It is God's Grace that makes the diſtinction between Perſons. But yet it is as true that God makes uſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Parents as Inſtruments for the inſtilling of Holy Principles into thoſe of younger years, and ſowing the ſeeds of Grace in them betimes, and he is pleaſed to give a Bleſſing to their Endeavours. And Parents may be Excited and Animated to ſet about this work on this double account, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is moſt probable that thoſe Inſtructions which they infuſe into Perſons in their Firſt and Early years, will have the eaſieſt Reception. 2. They will be the more deeply Impreſſ'd, and laſt the longer.</p>

The Spring of the Year is the fitteſt time for Purging &amp; Cleanſing the Body, in order to the Eſtabliſhing a good State of Health. It is certain, that the early and bloſſoming Years of Youth (which I may call their Spring-time) are the moſt proper and advantageous Seaſon you can chuſe to cleanſe and purifie their Minds, to cure their Diſeaſed Inclinations, and to prepare them for a ſound and hale Temper of Soul in the remaining part of their Lives. Your <hi>Children</hi> are to <hi>remember the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But leſt they ſhould neglect this, it lies upon <hi>you</hi> to be their faithful <hi>Admonitors</hi> &amp; <hi>Remembrancers,</hi> often to remind them of this Duty, and to urge them to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it: And you have this to encourage you, that this is the fitteſt Time to begin, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Work, becauſe now they are in the prime of their Years, in their budding A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, which is more eaſily managed than that which ſucceeds it. You cannot then diſcharge this Office at any time better than now: it is not probable you will ever be more ſucceſsful than in this preſent juncture. This <hi>Manna</hi> muſt be gathered in the <hi>Morning,</hi> in the Morning of Youth, in the early dawning of
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:039825_0175_1016621ADBBEE3D8"/>
their Years; or elſe afterward this <hi>Manna</hi> may become unſavory, loathſome and uſeleſs. This moiſt &amp; ſoft Clay (for that hath been the fit and proper Compariſon, as well as Character, to ſet forth Youth) will ſuffer it ſelf to be moulded and wrought as you pleaſe; but if you let this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſlip, it will grow hard and dry, and you will find it a difficult, if not an impoſſible Task, to handle and faſhion it as you would.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let this encourage you, that the good and wholeſome Leſſons which <hi>Parents</hi> give their <hi>Children</hi> in their younger Years, are generally obſerved to make a deep impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and are commonly retained by them a long time. The reaſon why the wiſe Man advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Parents</hi> to <hi>train up their Children in the way they ſhould go,</hi> is, becauſe <hi>when they are old, they will not depart from it,</hi> Prov. 22.6. Religious and holy Admonitions beſtowed upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, will not looſe their vertue &amp; power upon them, but will be happy Conducters of their Life even in old Age. There are indeed ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to the contrary in all Times, but that which we can gather from them is only this, that if good and vertuous Principles ſuck'd in betimes are not always able to preſerve Perſons from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, and running into all ſorts of evil, how dangerouſly infected muſt thoſe needs be, and how unavoidable is their Sin and Deſtruction who in their very tender Years were brought up in the practice of Vice, and were acquainted with no other Principles but ſuch as lead them to it? The conſideration of which ſhould prevail with the Perſon I am applying my ſelf to, to devote their Children to Religion whilſt they are young, to
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:039825_0176_1016621C799151E8"/>
ground them in Knowledge and Vertue at firſt, as ever they deſire they ſhould adhere to God and Goodneſs, when they arrive to riper Years. For ſuch is the influence and efficacy of Religious Education, that thoſe who are dedicated to God in their early days, <hi>generally</hi> &amp; <hi>for the moſt part</hi> prove very good and holy Men.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. Wherefore be perſwaded to inure your <hi>Children</hi> to the Yoke of Chriſt in their younger Days, and then it will be eaſie to them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for by your ſuppreſſing and taming their youthful Luſts and Inclinations, the remaining part of their Lives will become more compliant with Religion. So that this is the beſt Method you can uſe for the fixing and eſtabliſhing them in Goodneſs, and hindring them from revolting from it when they grow up in Years. But if you be neglectful in this point, if you take no care of your Children betimes, you do in vain promiſe your ſelves that they will do well hereafter. <hi>Children are like Arrows,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> they are indeed like them in this, that if they go wrong from the String at firſt, they are generally ſhot at rovers, and reach not the mark deſigned. And then they will prove <hi>Arrows</hi> in another ſenſe; they will be fatal Shafts in their <hi>Parents</hi> ſides, yea, they will wound and pierce their Hearts.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. This may be ſufficient to commend a pious Education to you, for it is this that through the Divine Bleſſing gives <hi>Parents</hi> hopes of the Welfare of their Children for the future.

It was the uſual Saying of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus,</hi> one of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings, who made very wiſe Laws about the bringing up of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>We muſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>teach Children now what they ſhall do when they are Men.</hi> And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Miſchiefs that follow the want of a ſtrict and vertuous Education have been noted by the wiſeſt and moſt intelligent Men, inſomuch that <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who was one of them, painly and boldly tells us, That <hi>by the neglect of this ſort of Education &amp; Diſcipline, Mankind becomes the worſt of all God's Creatures.</hi> Whence we learn the abſolute neceſſity of Diſciplining of Youth unleſs we are content that our own kind ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into that which is Bruitiſh, yea and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worſe than that. Hence alſo we learn, that it is a Task worthy of a <hi>Chriſtian Parent</hi> to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Children betimes in the way of Godlineſs, for this lays the Foundation of their future Life and Happineſs; and the greateſt Things to come are owing to this preſent undertaking. See as it is in Husbandry, the whole expectation of a plentiful Crop and Harveſt lies upon the Sowing, Tilling and Cultivating of the Ground; ſo it is here, the hopes of a good and religious Life hang very much on the firſt Principling and Seaſoning of Youth, the ſowing in them the Seeds of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs betimes. All the future and laſting Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of your Children depends upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ordering and managing of them. And the reaſon is, becauſe thoſe Impreſſions that are made in Youth, generally remain afterwards, and are not eaſily defaced. The Veſſel retains the ſmack and ſavour of that Liquor which it was firſt of

               <p n="12">§. 12. V. Another Motive that I will make uſe of is this, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſideration of the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> &amp; <hi>Puniſhments</hi> which attend the wilful neglect of this Duty.<note place="margin">The Judgments that uſually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the neglect of pious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> God generally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes thoſe <hi>Parents</hi> who are guilty in this kind with undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful &amp; ungodly <hi>Children, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Belial,</hi> &amp; ſuch as prove unſucceſsful in the World, &amp; meet with ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mark of the Divine Diſpleaſure.

               </p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. I pray conſult another very notable Paſſage in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence you will be convinc'd that even the Sins of Young Children do not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Wrath of God, &amp; their Parents are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in their Puniſhment; for he is wont to ſend his Judgments on Children, to puniſh both them and their Parents. The Narrative runs thus, <hi>Eliſha went up unto Bethel, &amp; as he was going up by the way, there came forth little Children out of the City, &amp; mocked him, &amp; ſaid unto
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:039825_0180_1016622818ECFB40"/>
him, Go up thou Bald-head, Go up thou Bald-head. And he turned back, and look'd on them, and Curſed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth Two She bears out of the Wood, and tare Forty and Two Children of them.</hi> As the Pſalmiſt informs us, <hi>that out of the Mouth of Babes &amp; Sucklings God hath ordained ſtrength,</hi> Pſalm 8.2. Even theſe little ones may have the Seeds of Grace Sown in them betimes, ſomething of God and Goodneſs may be found in them; ſo on the contrary, <hi>here</hi> theſe little Children by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Natural Depravity, and Evil Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Ill Examples ſet before them, diſcover the Diabolical Spirit in them. As ſoon almoſt as they have the uſe of their Tongues they employ them againſt God, and jeer at his Servants. Alas poor wretches they had heard Older ones Flout at this Man of God, they had ſeen Prophets abuſed and affronted, they had learnt of their Parents at home to deſpiſe the Meſſengers of God, and to ſpeak unworthily of the Aged: &amp; now they think they may ſafely follow their Parents ſteps; there could be no fault in imitating of them.</p>
               <p>Think of this, you that are Parents, remember how prone your Children are to do as you do, to make you their Preſident and Example, and to look upon your words &amp; actions as the ſtandard of theirs. Conſider this, that if Holineſs be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, and Religion laught at, and the Miniſters and Ambaſſadors of Chriſt derided by you, you muſt expect that your Children will behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after the ſame ſort. The Children cried <hi>Hoſanna</hi> unto our Saviour, and here they cry, <hi>Go up thou Bald-head</hi> to that Prophet: it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this diverſity of behaviour was ſhaped
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:039825_0181_1016622B0F88F978"/>
by different Education and Example. The good Prophet could not paſs the way, but a Company of rude Children followed him at his heels, and abuſed him: and it is not to be wondred at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and conſequently bred up an Idolatry from their Cradles, and by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Examples before their Eyes, were taught to mock at God's Prophets, and to vilify their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp; contemn &amp; ſcorn their Function. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ought to have Reverenced this Holy Man, to have Reſpected his Age, and honoured his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Profeſſion, and that Extraordinary Spirit which he was endued with, and which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Famous throughout all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they on the contrary Irreverently ſcoff'd at him, &amp; reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Old Age, &amp; hooted at him for his Years: They whoſe hair was ſcarcely grown, derided the Prophet becauſe his was fallen by Age.</p>
               <p>Where by the way let Parents be reminded to inculcate this betimes on their little ones, that they muſt by no means deſpiſe any Perſons for their Years, nor mock at any for their natural Defects and Infirmities. If they be not carefully check'd as to this particular, they will in time laugh at their Parents, &amp; ſcorn them when they are Old: they will upbraid them for their Weakneſſes and Failings, which are the Conſtant and Inſeperable attendants of declining Years. Let Parents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rehearſe this Remarkable Story in the Ears of their Children, and cauſe them to Remember what was the Fate of that young crew who vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Man of God. They jeer'd him for his Old Age; and their puniſhment for it was, never to Arrive to it. They laugh'd at <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Bald-head, and for a Recompenſe, were not honoured

themſelves with grey hairs. They Ridiculed his Years, and for a Reward were not permitted to live out half their Days, no not a leſſer porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for we read that they were <hi>forthwith</hi> devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch Savage Beaſts as the next adjoyning Wood was furniſh'd with. So dangerous it is to mock at the Aged, to affront our Elders and Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, eſpecially the Meſſengers of God. There are Inſtruments ready to Execute the wrath and Diſpleaſure of the Incenſed Majeſty of Heaven, ſo that Sin ſhall not go unpuniſhed. Yea, we find that it was doubly puniſhed here, for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Children were ſeverely dealt with, but the Parents were puniſhed in the loſs of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſeriouſly concern'd for the Sins and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of your Children, becauſe you know not how ſoon you may be ſharers in their puniſhment.

<pb n="176" facs="unknown:039825_0183_101662348FC91F58"/>
in Ezek. 16.20 21. <hi>Thou haſt taken thy Sons and thy Daughters, &amp; theſe haſt thou ſacrificed unto them</hi> (that is, the Idols) <hi>to be devoured. Is this of thy Whoredoms</hi> (that is, of thy Spiritual Whoredom, which is Idolatry) <hi>a ſmall matter that thou haſt ſlain my Children, &amp; delivered them to cauſe them to paſs through the fire?</hi> Where you are to take notice that <hi>your</hi> Children are <hi>God's</hi> Children and therefore are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of according to his will: and it is his will and pleaſure that you ſhould dedicate them to him and his Service, and nor Sacrifice them to <hi>Moloch,</hi> not devote them to Satan, and deliver them up to him to be devoured. They are <hi>my Children,</hi> ſaith God, but he hath appointed <hi>you</hi> to take care of them: he hath given them to you to Inſtruct them, and to make them better. Therefore you are not permitted to do what you will with them, you are not left to your liberty to neglect them if you pleaſe. But as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel are <hi>to watch for mens ſouls, as they that muſt give an Account,</hi> ſo you muſt be watchful and careful about the Souls of your Children becauſe you muſt reckon for them: and as God ſaid to the negligent Prophet, that if any Soul periſh by his careleſneſs, <hi>the blood of that Perſon ſhall be required at his hands,</hi> Ezek. 10.20. So if you that are <hi>Parents</hi> wilfully ſuffer theſe who are your peculiar Charge to miſcarry, you muſt anſwer it to God at your peril. O that you would conſider this, you that let your Children go on without controul in all manner of Vice, and reſtrain them not!

But though you unfeignedly Repent of it now, yet the Reflection on ſuch a miſcarriage, which is like to prove ſo Fatal to any of your Children, will be very Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and Tormenting to you as long as you live, for it muſt needs make you very uneaſy, to conſider that you have brought up any to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Regions of Darkneſs: that by your means the number of the Damned is Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that any of your Offspring are gone out of your kind Imbraces, into the Arms of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable and Malicious Spirits below.</p>

Do what you can to ſecure to them the Divine Favour and Bleſſing, and then you need not be ſollicitous about what may befall them after your Death. The more helpleſs they are, the more ſignal and remarkable will the Providence of God be towards them. Queſtion not God's Goodneſs, but be careful to do your Duty towards him, and towards your Children whilſt you are with them. I pray pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe that notable place of Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.11. <hi>Leave thy fatherleſs Children: I will preſerve them alive; and let thy Widows truſt in me.</hi> The ſtrange Situation of which words is worth our taking notice of, for in the four preceding Verſes, &amp; in the twelve following ones, nothing but Calamity, Ruine &amp; Deſtruction are threatned: So that there ſeems to be no connection or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this Paſſage on the Context; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one would be apt to wonder how this Verſe is brought in and inſerted in this place. But you may ſuppoſe with me that the words were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on this or the like occaſion: Some good Man or other in the midſt of the publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Judgments, foreſeeing yet greater and more grievous Plagues which were to come, and being deeply affected with his Countries Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and overcome of Grief, was weary of living any longer: But that which in a more particular manner took up his Thoughts at this time, was the Concern which he had for his dear and near Relations. What will become of them, ſaith he, when I am departed from them? Who is there that I can leave them too, and expect they

ſhall meet with good uſage? Who will be ſo kind as to look after them? Whom can they truſt and rely upon in theſe evil Times?

and accordingly he took care to bring them up in the practice of Godlineſs, as appears from the pious care he had about his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Marriage, and from the happy propagation of Religion in that Race and Family. Another illuſtrious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Godly Parents concern for his Children is holy <hi>Job,</hi> of whom it is thus recorded, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it was ſo when the Days of their Feaſting were gone about, that Job ſent &amp; ſanctified them, &amp; roſe up early in the Morning, &amp; offered burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings according to the number of them all: For Job ſaid, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> may be that my Sons have ſinned and curſed God in their Hearts. Thus did Job con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> It is evident, that <hi>Job</hi>'s Piety was not only Perſonal, Chap 1. Verſe 1. but relative, that is, extended to his Children; of which here is a very ſingular proof from his godly Fear and Jealouſy. He was afraid his Children had too freely indulged ſome unlawful practice in the time of their Feaſting &amp; Mirth, and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or, ſuppoſe they were not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and viſibly prophane, but had been ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and in their Thoughts, for that may be the meaning of <hi>Curſing God in their Hearts</hi>: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their Words and Actions did not betray any Irreverence towards the Majeſty of God, yet he fear'd their Minds might inwardly conceive ſomething unworthy of him. Which excellent Pattern ſhould remind all <hi>Parents</hi> of rendring the good of their Childrens Souls, &amp; taking care that they offend not God in any thing. They are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally heard to ſay when their young ones are long

out of their ſight, It may be the are come to ſome harm, it may be ſome Evil hath befallen them, they have been beaten, or abuſed, or the like. Thus do <hi>Parents</hi> expreſs their <hi>Fears</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Children, but ſeldom or never in the Language of this good Man, <hi>It may be they have ſinned, &amp; curſed God.</hi> Obſerve the Stile, <hi>It may be:</hi> a poſſibility of the thing, and a mere ſuſpicion were ground enough, you ſee, for his Godly care and fear; ſo extreamly tender was he of his Childrens good.</p>
               <p>Which alſo appear'd from the Means he uſed for their ſafety, <hi>He offered burnt-offerings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of his Children,</hi> &amp; in order to this <hi>he ſanctified them,</hi> that is, he ſolemnly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them for that ſacred performance, that it might prove ſucceſsful. <hi>Job</hi>'s Children had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed themſelves with free Eating &amp; Drinking at one anothers Houſes: Now he takes care that their Minds be intent upon Religion. Friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt is followed with Piety &amp; Devotion. As they Feaſted together, ſo <hi>Job</hi> would have them meet and Pray together, and lament their paſt Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and thankfully acknowledge the Mercy and Goodneſs of God to them, and jointly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by Sacrifice to avert his Diſpleaſure. <hi>Thus did Job continually,</hi> that is, as often as his Sons and Daughters met together, he never forgot to call upon them to examine their Hearts, &amp; ſearch into their Ways, &amp; to make their Peace with God. The ſame Principle that ſet him on work at firſt, carried him through it, and cauſed him to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to the End.

And if Mothers can thus prevail on their Sons when they are arrived to ſome Maturity of Age, and are as it were at their own diſpoſal, much more are they able to influence upon them when they are younger, and under their Wings, and wholly at their Command.

Therefore I do not ſee there is any reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:039825_0199_10146BE8956FDAA0"/>
theſe words concerning the bleſſed Fruit of the Virgin's Womb. Others underſtand the place concerning Womens eſcaping ſafe from the pains and perils of Child-birth, but this cannot be the meaning becauſe very few of that Sex are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the <hi>pains</hi> and difficulty of Child-bearing, and becauſe ſeveral of them are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that <hi>Fatal Peril</hi> which ſometimes attends it. And beſides, to be <hi>ſaved</hi> or <hi>delivered</hi> in this Senſe, is a favour granted not only to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but others; whereas this Text ſpeaks of ſome particular Act or ſpecial Behaviour which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to ſome Women only, and that is bringing up their Children in the fear of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the true ſenſe of the Words, for it is likely that <hi>Child bearing</hi> is here put for the whole diſcharge of the Office required of a Married Woman in her domeſtick Capacity, which is uſually moſt exerciſed &amp; ſeen in bringing forth and breeding up of her <hi>Children.</hi> By <hi>Child bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as I apprehend, is chiefly meant Educating of Children, becauſe in vain are they <hi>Born,</hi> unleſs they be <hi>Inſtituted</hi> &amp; <hi>Educated</hi>; the one is wholly in order to the other, and therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it is mentioned in the place of it. To ſtrengthen the Interpretation it may be obſervable, that it is uſual in Scripture to mention and aſſign one particular thing inſtead of all the reſt of that kind and ſort: And ſo here, conformably to that way of ſpeaking, <hi>Child bearing</hi> is named, but it comprehends under it all other Duties that belong to the Miſtreſs of a Family, and eſpecially with relation to the <hi>Children</hi> of it, who are to be brought up by her in a religious Manner.

and Happineſs. For ſo here we are told by the Apoſtle that the wedded Woman by her <hi>bringing up</hi> her Children after ſhe hath borne them, by her careful looking to them, and conſulting the good of their Souls as well as their Bodies, by this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courſe, I ſay, as well as by other Chriſtian means and ways, the Woman ſhall be <hi>ſaved</hi> And <hi>that the bearing of Children</hi> is here put for <hi>breeding them up,</hi> is manifeſt from the next Clauſe of this Verſe, <hi>If they continue in Faith, &amp;c.</hi> where the word <hi>they</hi> refers to <hi>the Children</hi> ſo bred up and continuing in Faith, and all other Vertues: And then the ſenſe is, If Mothers take care that their Children be taught their Duty, and be religiouſly brought up, and thereby <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Faith, Charity and Holineſs with Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> they ſhall be happy both here and hereafter, for that is meant by their being <hi>ſaved.</hi> Thus it is manifeſt that Religious Education equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to the Salvation both of <hi>Parents</hi> &amp; <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>

That we ought to have a great Paſſion and Zeal for thoſe who have provided and taken care for us from the beginning, and have expreſſed a tender concernedneſs for us all our Days?

In Hiſtory there are eminent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Divine &amp; Severity upon them: but becauſe the Bible is of unqueſtionable Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I will only ſelect ſome thence. We read that <hi>Cham</hi> was Curſed for mocking and deriding his Father; we read that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> &amp; <hi>Eſau,</hi> whoſe Irreverence and Diſobedience to their Parents are particularly taken notice of, were Accurſed both in their Perſons and in their Seed, and were ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church of God. <hi>Onan,</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Judah,</hi> was kill'd by God's own hand for Diſobeying the Command of his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38 9, 10.

                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:039825_0207_10146BFF0EB53A70"/>§. 17. Finally, I ſuggeſt this as another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Motive, that the more Holy any Perſons are, the more Dutiful they are to their Parents. This is an Obſervation that will never fail, and it hugely Commends unto us the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this Duty, and convinces us that it is an high ſtrain of Goodneſs and Religion. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf <hi>that he was Subject to his Parents,</hi> Luke 2.51. And when he was on the Croſs, and leaving the World, he took particular care of his Mother, &amp; commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to the care of the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> who accordingly look'd after her, &amp; provided for her, and uſed her as kindly as if ſhe were <hi>his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> John 19.27. Behold an eminent Example of Filial Piety! Our Lord in the midſt of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Agonies and Torments ſhew'd his Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and Love to his dear Mother. This proves what I ſaid, that the holieſt Perſons are moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of their Parents: as on the contrary, there is no greater ſign of profligate mind than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them. And we find that thoſe that are <hi>Diſobedient to Parents,</hi> are reckoned among the moſt Heinous Sinners and Offenders, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2 Such as are juſtly to be hated both of God and Man. This I hope is ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all thoſe who are in the Relation of Children from being guilty of this Sin.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Duty of Maſters.</note>§. 18. The <hi>Fourth Relation</hi> that I ſhall ſpeak of is that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Maſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Servants</hi>; for this muſt not be omitted when I am Diſcourſing of Acts of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> or our <hi>Duty to others.</hi> I begin then with the Duty of <hi>Maſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Miſtreſſes</hi> (for they are both concern'd

in a Family, and therefore may be mentioned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) and what I have ſaid concerning the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>Parents,</hi> may be applyed to theſe with a little alteration. You then that are Maſters or Miſtreſſes ought to take care of your Servants, and eſpecially of their Better Part. After you have laid a good Foundation, and Inſtructed them in the neceſſary Doctrines of Religion, and the grand points of Chriſtianity, you are to look to their Lives and Manners, and by Admonitions and Exhortations to acquaint them with and ſtir them up to their Duty. And more eſpecially you are to call upon them to Read thoſe Portions of Scripture which contain their <hi>particular Duty towards you</hi> (which I ſhall mention anon,) &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to meditate upon them, and pray unto God that they may be inabled to practice them. To theſe you muſt add Reproof, for Sin is to be check'd in your Servants, as well as in your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The old <hi>Spartans,</hi> forc'd their Slaves to drink to Exceſs, that their Children thereby might be brought to a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by all other ways, you muſt ſhew your ſelves deſirous to promote the Spiritual welfare of your Servants, and the good of their Souls. To which end, it will be requiſite to enquire what Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they keep, for this hath a mighty Influence on their Lives and Practices; and all your Almoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Precepts of Religion will be quite loſt without this.

               <p n="19">§. 19. Again, you muſt conſult not only the good of your Servants Souls, but of their Bodies. Wherefore you muſt provide for theſe latter, and let them have convenient Food, and whatever elſe is neceſſary and fitting for them. They are part of the Family, and therefore you muſt make proviſion for them, and not imitate the ſcandalous practiſe of ſome Houſe-holders, who though they are kind to their Children, yet almoſt ſtarve their Servants, and allow them not ſuch conveniencies as are proper for them, eſpecially in time of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is not only Unjuſt but inhumane. And you are concern'd alſo to provide for their Future Livelyhood, by Teaching them that Art or Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which you have Undertaken and Engaged to Inſtruct them in, and to which end they were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into your Family, and became your Charge. Too many Maſters make no Conſcience of this, and thereby the Money which was given with the Servants and Apprentices is loſt, and their time is ſpent in vain, &amp; the Youths are diſappointed of a Livelyhood. This is both Unjuſt &amp; Uncharitable, and indeed down-right defrauding of them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Man of Conſcience will allow of ſuch a Practice.</p>
               <p n="20">§ 20. Further, you that are Maſters ought to Correct and Humble thoſe Servants who ſtand in need of ſuch Diſcipline. For if you forbear to do it, this likewiſe may be called a defrauding them of what is their due. If they will not be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by Admonitions and Reproofs, you are permitted to uſe a ſeverer courſe, and to Chaſtiſe

And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if you Exerciſe ſuch Diſcipline, &amp; that Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, towards your own Children, it can be no harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (whatever ſome think) to treat your Servants after that manner. For nothing Inhumane and Cruel is meant by this; the <hi>Divine Law</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Jews</hi> to be merciful to their Servants, <hi>and not to Rule over them with Rigour,</hi> Lev. 25.43. and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which is a gentle Inſtitution, much more requires it. You muſt by no means delight in Severity towards them; you muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Chaſtiſe them without a neceſſary cauſe; and when you are forced to it, your Correction muſt be mixed with mild Admonitions and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The ſhort is this, avoid this ſevere method as much as you can: but leſt your Authority ſhould be wholly neglected, make uſe of it when there is occaſion, towards thoſe who by Reaſon of their Age are not above it, and who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged themſelves by free Submiſſion and Compact to be at your Command and Diſpoſal. If theſe will not obey you out of a Principle of Love, they muſt be made ſenſible of your Power, &amp; comply with your commands out of Fear and Dread.</p>
               <p n="21">§ 21. This alſo muſt be added that <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> is due to Good and Faithful Servants. When you find ſuch, remember to put the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

There is this Juſtice owing to Servants, to take notice of their Care and Induſtry, and to Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them. And this will be Advantagious to Maſters themſelves, becauſe it will be an Encite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Servants future Diligence.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. Laſtly, you are wanting in your Duty towards your Servants, if you do not ſet them a Good Example, eſpecially ſeeing they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very much enclined to follow it. If you would have them live in the Fear of God, and the Practiſe of Holineſs, you muſt reform &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench your own Lives if they be amiſs; &amp; then by your Exemplary Behaviour you will produce the like in thoſe that are under your Roof. This will be an effectual means of winning thoſe to Goodneſs &amp; Vertue who are daily obſervers of your Lives. But on the contrary, it is fond and unreaſonable for a prophane &amp; diſſolute Maſter, to expect a Religious and Well-ordered Servant. Nay, aſſure your ſelves that if you be Vitious and Wicked, they will think that all their Crimes are juſtifiable. Wherefore above all things order your Converſations aright.</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. Thus briefly I have told you what is required from you towards your Servants.<note place="margin">The Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of keeping Religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> The ſum of all is, that you are obliged to do them good both with reſpect to Religion, and to their outward concerns: but more eſpecially take care to train them up to the former, and that for theſe

three Reaſons; Firſt, becauſe thoſe Servants who are moſt Religious towards God will prove moſt faithful to you. If their care of your Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be founded on an upright Conſcience, and a true ſenſe of the Obligations which are laid upon them by Chriſtianity, they will then behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their places as it becomes true Chriſtian Servants. Think not that any will do their Duty aright, &amp; perſevere in it, unleſs the Principles of Godlineſs &amp; Righteouſneſs have taken faſt hold of their Hearts. We read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 39 9. what it was that made <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo true to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> his Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: <hi>how can I do this great Wickedneſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſin againſt God</hi>? As much as if he had ſaid, I cann't be falſe to my Maſter who hath entruſted me with his Houſhould Affairs and all his Eſtate: I cann't be injurious to my Miſtreſs by comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her Temptations, I cannot be unfaithful to either, becauſe I have a greater Maſter to ſerve, and I dare not diſpleaſe &amp; offend him. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was urgent with <hi>Philemon</hi> to take <hi>Oneſimus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into his Service, becauſe being Converted he would be <hi>profitable to him,</hi> Ver.11. he being now a good Chriſtian, would prove a good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant. You then that are Maſters and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of Families, be exhorted to inſtruct your Servants in Religion, call upon them to make Conſcience of their ways, and to be truly Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe thereby they will be in a capacity to ſerve you faithfully. It is your Intereſt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the Will of God, and to allure them to the love of it: Your very worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage obliges you to this, for you will find a preſent Benefit accruing to you by it, and you will be abundantly recompenſed for your Care and
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:039825_0213_10146C115ED0FE08"/>
Pains; for moſt certainly Religion makes the beſt Servants; and they are always found to ſerve their Maſters beſt, who ſerve them for God's ſake.</p>
               <p n="24">§ 24. Secondly, This is another Reaſon to be thought of, That pious Servants derive a <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> on a Family. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whom I mentioned before, is an eminent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

You that have Servants under you, uſe your utmoſt endeavours to further Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp; Goodneſs in them, for one Religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may bring down a Bleſſing upon a whole Houſe. By minding the Spiritual Good of your Servants you may be rewarded in your ſecular and wordly Affairs. As on the contrary, you may be blaſted in your worldly concerns for the ſake of one or more impious Servants that you keep in your Families. For as I obſerved before that <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> mutually derive a Bleſſing or Curſe on one another, ſo it is as tru<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Maſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Servants</hi> do the like.</p>

So full and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate is Chriſtianity in giving Directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter. From theſe Texts &amp; ſome
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:039825_0216_10148D4B4AE05510"/>
others that treat of the ſame Subject, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſome part of the Duty of Servants to their Maſters is the ſame with that of Children to their Parents; but other Parts of their Duty are proper &amp; peculiar to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. The Duties that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both are theſe two,<note place="margin">Reverence.</note> I. <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>; and therefore in the foregoing Directions it is ſaid, That Servants are to diſcharge the Office of their Places <hi>with Fear and Trembling,</hi> with Reverence and Awe of their Maſters, ſo as to be afraid of incurring their Diſpleaſure. Which is the Senſe of another Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Be ſubject to your Maſters with all fear.</hi> And this Paſſion is always attended with a due reſpecting and honouring of them; <hi>They muſt count their Maſters worthy of all honour,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.1.

The Apoſtle acquaints us, That the ready compliance of Servants with their Maſters Will muſt be teſtified by their <hi>not anſwering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> by their not diſputing or contradicting their Commands: But eſpecially a ſawcy and rude Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying or Anſwering again is here forbidden. They muſt not uſe ſuch words as betray an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Spirit, and ſignifie that their Will not their Maſters, ſhall take place. This is wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that Obedience which is required of them.</p>

                  <pb n="210" facs="unknown:039825_0217_10148D4EB1097398"/>§. 3. The peculiar Duties of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are theſe that follow, Firſt, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> in their reſpective Callings and Employments. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s chief Servant, whom he ſent on Buſineſs, would not eat or drink, when he came to his Journeys end, before he had done his Maſter's Meſſage, <hi>before he had told his Errand,</hi> Gen. 24.33. So likewiſe a Servant is to mind the Work he is ſet about, or the proper Charge which is incumbent on him, as he is of ſuch or ſuch a Trade or Profeſſion. Here then Negligence is to be condemned in one of this Relation. All Careleſneſs and Sloth &amp; Idleneſs, yea and even that <hi>Sanntring</hi> Humour which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes ſome Servants, are unſufferable; for it is of the very Eſſence of a good Servant to have his Thoughts upon his Buſineſs, and induſtriouſly to purſue it.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Secondly, <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> or <hi>Honeſty</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother peculiar Requiſite in one of this Relation.<note place="margin">Fidelity</note> He muſt <hi>ſhew all good Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> he muſt in every thing be True and Truſty. And more particularly the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns all <hi>Purloining</hi> in a Servant, that is, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back &amp; detaining to himſelf any part of that profit which belongs and is due to his Maſter. Honeſty requires of him that he waſte not or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezel his Maſters Goods, that he no ways <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Defraud</hi> him, or be privy to others doing ſo; but that he conſult his Maſters advantage in all things, and prefer his Intereſt before his own private concerns, In ſhort he muſt remember that he is under an Obligation to do his Maſter True and Faithful Service, and he muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to perform his Engagements.</p>

                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:039825_0218_10148D509456CD68"/>§. 5. Thirdly, <hi>Sincerity</hi> is another qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for you ſee this it often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,<note place="margin">Sincerity.</note> and that in variety of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Servants are bid to Obey their Maſters <hi>in Singleneſs of heart,</hi> or (as 'tis in the Greek) in ſimplicity of heart, out of a Simple and Uncorrupt Principle, out of a hearty deſire and Intention to do their Duty, and to diſcharge a good Conſcience. And they are enjoyn'd to do Service unto their Maſters <hi>as unto Christ,</hi> as if he were the Immediate Maſter under whom they ſerv'd. And the Apoſtle adds that they muſt look upon themſelves <hi>as the Servants of Christ,</hi> they muſt own his Authority in that of their Maſters, &amp; they muſt chiefly indeavour to pleaſe Him, &amp; not Act as <hi>men-pleaſers,</hi> that is, for Baſe and Siniſter ends; they muſt not obey <hi>with Eye-Service,</hi> that is, do the Part of Servants only when their Maſter or Miſtreſs is preſent, and hath an Eye upon them: but they ought to Act out of a ſenſe of their Duty, &amp; therefore do it Faithfully, whether any takes notice of them or no. <hi>With good will they do Service,</hi> they perform it Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Chearfully, becauſe God hath enjoined it, and it is pleaſing to him. Thus you ſee what is required of Servants as to the Principle and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Behaviour towards thoſe who are ſet over them: it muſt be with Sincerity &amp; Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart. And they may conſider further, that the Apoſtle in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">The Duty of Husbands and Wives.</note>§. 6. The Fifth and laſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> is that of <hi>Husband and Wife</hi>: &amp; there we ſhall ſee what are the mutual Acts of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Juſtice,</hi> mix'd with <hi>Charity,</hi> that they owe to each other. If this pair of Relatives do not diſcharge their Duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the reſt of the Family never can; yea, the miſcarriage of Perſons in this State of Life may not unfitly be Aſſigned as a main cauſe of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour in thoſe other Conditions and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before mentioned; and therefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that I ſpeak particularly concerning theſe, that the good Deportment of theſe Chief Heads of the Domeſtick Body may be ſecured. In order to this a Good Foundation is to be laid at firſt: the Married Life muſt be commenced Wiſely and Diſcreetly, with great Deliberation &amp; Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. The Man muſt make choice of <hi>a Meet Help,</hi> one that is Religious &amp; Vertuous, and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him as to his Eſtate, Age, Calling, and other Circumſtances. And the Woman muſt make choice of a Godly and Prudent Guide, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Yoke-fellow, elſe the State of Matrimony, like an Error in the firſt Concoction, will never, or very rarely be mended. Here then great Care and Study, Prayers and Endeavours are to be made uſe of, that a condition of Life which is of ſo vaſt moment and importance, may be bleſſed with a good beginning and afterwards proſper'd with a conſtant Happineſs. And this cannot he otherwiſe than in the careful practiſing of thoſe
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:039825_0220_10148D55916F45A8"/>
Duties which are required of theſe Perſons. And theſe Duties are either Proper or Common.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. The Duty proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the <hi>Man,</hi> is,<note place="margin">The Duties proper to the Man.</note> to Maintain and Provide for his Wife. For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſolemn Ingagement, he is to make her partaker in his worldly Goods: And by help of that Calling or Employment which Providence hath determined him to, or of the Eſtate and Revenues which he either brought to her, or had with her, or by both, it is incumbent upon him to make ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for her, that they may jointly ſhare in that comfortable Subſiſtence which their Station and Rank in the World call for. But yet this is to be taken with ſome Limitation; for if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Circumſtances of the Woman be ſuch, that ſhe is in a capacity to contribute perſonally towards the maintenance of the Family, by ſome Skill in a lawful Employment of her own, or by giving aſſiſtance to her Husband in his, ſhe then is engaged to be ſerviceable in the ſupport of her Houſhould. But however, ſhe is always obliged to be inſtrumental in adding to the Incomes of the Family by her good Houſe-wifery &amp; Frugality.

This is what the Apoſtle means by <hi>giving honour to the Wife, as to the weaker Veſſel,</hi> 1 Pet. 3 7.

to be highly eſteemed and reſpected by all, and ſo is <hi>the Bed undefited,</hi> the Bed that is kept free from Adultery; but on the contrary, the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Conjugal Vow is to be abhorred and avoided by all, not only becauſe it is a perfidious breach of a ſolemn Promiſe made to each other, but becauſe it will certainly be attended with a Curſe, as the Apoſtle in the ſame place adds, <hi>Whoremongers</hi> &amp; <hi>Adulterers God will judge,</hi> Heb. 13.4.

themſelves to God in their conſtant Addreſſes to him, and moſt devoutly and heartily to pray for one another: That ſo as they live together here, they may be undivided Companions in the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Manſions hereafter. Thus they are to ſanctifie the ſtate of Wedlock, thus they are to be helpful to one another in the ways of Vertue and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, they are to ſtrive &amp; contend which of them ſhall ſerve God moſt entirely and faithfully. This is a happy Conteſt between Man and Wife, this is a commendable Strife, and will prepare their way to the Regions of undiſturbed Peace and Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. Thus I have given you an account of the ſeveral diſtinct <hi>Relation,</hi> wherein the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Acts of <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> together with thoſe of <hi>Charity,</hi> are plainly diſcerned. And (to cloſe this Head) we muſt know that True Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is always accompanied with unfeigned Deſires and Endeavours of glorifying God in our <hi>Relative Capacities.</hi> We can neither ſatisfie our ſelves concerning the realty of Grace in us nor give an evidence to others of the true ſenſe of Religion on our Minds and Conſciences, unleſs we let them be ſeen in the Government of our ſelves as we are related to others.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. But beſides the Duties Founded in theſe <hi>Individual Relations,</hi> there are General ones, which refer to all Perſons whatſoever. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we may obſerve that after the Apoſtle had acquainted the <hi>Roman Chriſtians</hi> what was due from them and all others toward their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, he proceeds to an univerſal diſplay of their Duty &amp; informs them that they ſtand obliged by Chriſtianity to <hi>render to all Men their dues,</hi> Rom.
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:039825_0226_10148D65F2DA6AD8"/>
13.7. They muſt deal juſtly and rightly with every one, for <hi>Justice</hi> is giving to every one his due. And here I ſhall paſs to the <hi>Second Part</hi> of my propoſed Method: <hi>viz.</hi> to mention thoſe Acts and Performances which in the ſtricteſt ſenſe are Branches of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and therefore are carefully to be obſerv'd by us. For tho' the word <hi>Juſtice</hi> be not in this New Teſtement, yet the Exact Rules and Meaſures of this Vertue are there ſet down, and we are not only forbid by the Evangelical Laws to Injure others, but we are commanded to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form poſitive acts of Juſtice, and they are ſuch as theſe,</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. Firſt,<note place="margin">Of Honeſty.</note> it is neceſſary that you be righteous &amp; Juſt in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Traffick,</hi> in all your <hi>Commerce, Contracts,</hi> and <hi>Covenants.</hi> Do all things fairly &amp; honeſtly, without couzening &amp; over-reaching, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>go beyond &amp; defraud your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in any thing,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4 6. In buying and ſelling, in Trading and making of Bargains addict your ſelves to honeſt Dealing; and that Golden Rule of Juſtice preſcribed us by our Saviour, will carry you ſafe through all Caſes and Emergencies of this nature; <hi>Whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them,</hi> Mat. 7.12. This alone, if conſcientiouſly and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attended to, will direct you in all Matters of Traffick &amp; Commerce with your Neighbours, and is certainly the exact and unerring Standard of all your Dealings with them. if you be a Buyer, it will not ſuffer you to diſparage and vilifie other Mens Wares, on purpoſe to bring down the price of them. If you be a Seller, it will not allow you to Deceive any by hiding the Faults of what
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:039825_0227_10148D68AC346BE8"/>
you ſell: It will not permit you to Screw up a Chapman, to get as much as you can of him. It will inſtruct you to demand no more for your Goods than they are really worth, and above all things to hate <hi>Falſe Weights &amp; Meaſures,</hi> which are ſo particularly forbidden in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If you he guided by this Rule, you will never be immoderate &amp; griping, you will not purſue any Methods of beguiling &amp; impoſing upon your Brethren, be they never ſo weak &amp; ignorant, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo careleſs and neglectful of what they do: you will not take Advantage of the Poverty or the Ignorance of any Man, but in all your Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings you will be juſt and Upright.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14 We are to be guided alſo by the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and Practice of the moſt underſtanding and upright Perſons: which perhaps one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients referred to when he defined <hi>Juſtice</hi> to be a Vertue conſiſting in Mediocrity, as a wiſe Man ſhall determine it. Likewiſe in matters relating to publick Commerce and Juſtice, we are to have reſpect to the Law of Nations, namely, what whole Countries and Kingdoms have agreed upon and practiſed as moſt conducible to the good of Society. Moreover, we muſt govern our ſelves by the known Laws &amp; Conſtitutions of the place we live in, they being generally moſt agreeable to our Circumſtances; but eſpecially we muſt act according to the dictates of our Reaſons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences as they are improved by the Sacred Laws preſcribed us in the Writings of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> for the Goſpel requires of us an exact, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Integrity in matters of Traffick.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15, And as in <hi>making,</hi> ſo in <hi>keeping</hi> and <hi>performing</hi> your Bargains and Contracts you muſt
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:039825_0228_10148D6D03DF5928"/>
be very Juſt and Righteous. You muſt uſe no Arts and Fetches to bring you off from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your Promiſes &amp; Engagements. Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep your Faith, although you are loſers by it: In ſome caſes, though it be <hi>to your own hurt,</hi> you muſt <hi>not change, Pſal.</hi> 15.4. If that were Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Juſtice under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> it is certainly ſo now under the <hi>New,</hi> which obliges Men to ſtricter Rules of Vertue. Chriſtianity requires that you be very punctual, that you ſtand firm to your word, and that you perforn the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Things you engaged your ſelves to do.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. Under this performing of Contracts (which is one of the moſt eſſential Parts of <hi>Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi>) I might reckon the paying of Debts. Not to diſcharge theſe according to our known Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, is a groſs injury to the Creditor, and an high act of Injuſtice. So to detain the Wages or Hire of Workmen and Labourers, is a ſignal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Unrighteouſneſs and unjuſt Dealing; for though in ſuch caſes ſometimes there be no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Obligation and Contract, yet by Conſcience and Cuſtom, and the Reaſon of the thing it ſelf, Perſons are interpreted to have bound themſelves to ſatisfie thoſe whom they ſo employ, &amp; ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their work, inſomuch that to deny them Payment is a palpable detaining of their Dues, and an open violation of Honeſty.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17.<note place="margin">Of Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Among the ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of juſt Dealing I muſt not forget this, That there is <hi>Reva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to be made for any wrong or damage we have done to our Neighbours. As we muſt make <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of what was taken away from them unlawfully, ſo if we have wronged them in any
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:039825_0229_10148D6E88BBB3D8"/>
other kind whatſoever, we muſt make them what <hi>Satisfaction</hi> we are able. This I may call an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Juſtice, a making ſome Amends and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe after we have been guilty of unjuſt Acts: and we find it expreſly commanded by God in the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c. Num.</hi> 5.6.7. and practiſed by a Goſpel-Penitent, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8.</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. And laſtly, under this Head, I cannot but mention <hi>Speaking the Truth,</hi> as another ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of Juſtice to Mankind. If we muſt give every one his own, then it is certain we ought not to detain the Truth from them, for this is their own, and they may claim it as their due. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the contrary may prove very hurtful to them, and ſo we ſhall be injurious to them. For a Lyar, one that loveth and maketh Lyes, wrongs and injures his Brethren; yea, he ſpoils all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Converſe, for there can be no Faith or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit among Men (which is the ſupport of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society) if Truth be laid aſide, and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood takes place. Speech was given us by God to declare our Minds and Thoughts to others, that thereby a mutual Converſe and Communion might be maintained: But Lying, which is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to what we think or know, perverts this end and deſign of Speech, and therefore muſt needs prove very deſtructive. Wherefore follow the Apoſtolical advice, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Lye not one to another,</hi> do not utter and deliver that as Truth which you know to be falſe; but <hi>putting away Lying, ſpeak the Truth every Man with his Neighbour,</hi> Eph. 4.25. And the Apoſtle there adds this Reaſon, <hi>For we are Members one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi>: As much as to ſay. All Men are fellow-Members, they belong all to the ſame Body and
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:039825_0230_10148D702FF223B0"/>
Society of Mankind: Therefore it is unatural and monſtrous for one Member to defraud &amp; deceive another. On this account we muſt not Lye to any Man in the World. And not only as we are Men, but much more as we are Chriſtians, we are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one another, being united unto Chriſt Jeſus our Head: &amp; therefore we muſt not dare to Lye, and thereby deceive &amp; hurt our Brethren to whom we are ſo nearly related. Nay we are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to tell a Lye, though we were ſure it would hurt no Body, nay, though we were certain it would tend to our own or others Safety and Advantage: And the reaſon is this, becauſe we are forbid <hi>to do evil, that good may come of it,</hi> Rom. 3.8.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. Next unto Lying is <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> which is no leſs pernicious and hurtful in the Life of Man,<note place="margin">Flattery.</note> for they that uſe themſelves to this ſort of Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never ſpeak as they think, and they endeavour to make others think contrary to the Truth and Reality of things; which are both very miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. The Complimenting Humour of this Age may be reckon'd under this Head. Who ſees not fair and plauſible Words &amp; mere Flouriſhes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of what is real? It is now grown a modiſh Thing, under the Notion of being Genteel and Civil, to forget to utter what is True. Their Language hath nothing of their Heart; &amp; Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony &amp; Diſſimulation have almoſt baniſh'd Truth and Sincerity out of the World. Wherefore it is high time to retrieve our ſelves, and to become true and hearty in Converſation, eſpecially when it is that which the very Laws of Juſtice &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs challenge of us.</p>
               <p n="20">
                  <pb n="224" facs="unknown:039825_0231_10148D73A9979540"/>§. 10. Beſides theſe Acts of <hi>Juſtice</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Commerce, there are ſeveral other parts of it which we owe to our Neighbours. The next I will mention is our Duty to them in reſpect of their <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Credit.</hi> If detaining of Truth from our Brethren be a great act of Injuſtice and Wrong, then we ſhall be much more unjuſt if we ſpeak Evil of them.<note place="margin">Of Injuſtice to our Neighbours good Name.</note> Therefore it is one of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s excellent Directions for Converſation, That <hi>we ſpeak evil of no Man,</hi> Tit. 3 2. which is backed by St. <hi>James,</hi> ch. 4. ver. 11. <hi>Speak not evil one of another.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives the ſame advice, namely, That <hi>we lay aſide all evil ſpeakings,</hi> Epiſt. 1. chap. 2. ver. 1. Thus thoſe three great Apoſtles call upon us to obſerve that uſeful and neceſſary Rule of Righteouſneſs, whereby we are forbid to hurt or endamage our Neighbours good Name by any of our Words and Speeches. We are apt to cheriſh too high Thoughts of our ſelves, and to applaud our own Actions, but we are too forward to indulge groundleſs Suſpicions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, and to ſpeak meanly of their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, yea, to cenſure and condemn them: but herein we act very unjuſtly, becauſe generally this paſſing of a raſh Sentence upon others, redounds to their prejudice and harm. It is unworthy of a Chriſtian to make the worſt of Mens Actions, and to repreſent them to others as ſuch; but it is much more baſe and unworthy, ye utterly to be abhorred, to detract from our Neighbours Credit out of a Principle of ill Will &amp; Malice toward them. It is abominable either to invent or to take up falſe and evil Reports concerning others, and to
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:039825_0232_10148D7627EA3360"/>
Back-bite &amp; Slander them, &amp; ſay thoſe ill things of them which they no ways deſerve, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we bear a hatred to them. This is highly unjuſt; and hence it follows, that it is an Act of Juſtice to have a tender regard to the Reputation of our Neighbours, and to preſerve their good Name &amp; Credit as far as in us lies, and when we know them to be Reproached &amp; Defamed, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their Reputation. And our hearts muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with our Tongues in this work.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. Next,<note place="margin">Of Theft.</note> according to the Laws of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, we are obliged not to injure others in their <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods and poſſeſſions.</hi> For they have a juſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to what is their own, and it is not Lawful for any man to invade it. Wherefore if either privily or openly we take away or detain from another, without his conſent, what is his proper Goods, we are guilty of the Sin of <hi>Stealing.</hi> The moſt heinous kind of Theft is <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> which is a taking away or miſemploying of thoſe Goods or Lands which were given to charitable uſes,<note place="margin">Of Sacriledge.</note> and ſet apart for Religious purpoſes, and even conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God and his Service. This is a great Prophanation, as well as Injuſtice, &amp; therefore is deſervedly condemned in the Word of God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. And indeed it muſt needs be a Sin of a very high nature, to alienate and abuſe ſacred things, and ſuch as were peculiarly Devoted to Pious and Holy uſes; for this is properly <hi>Robbing of God</hi>; but becauſe the things are in the poſſeſſion of, and for the uſe of Men, I bring it under this head.</p>
               <p n="22">
                  <pb n="226" facs="unknown:039825_0233_10148D7A044A4FF8"/>§. 22. To <hi>Stealing</hi> may be reduced <hi>Unlawful Uſury,</hi> againſt which the Scripture ſo often ſpeaks:<note place="margin">Of Unlawful Uſury.</note> for by <hi>Uſury</hi> in the Sacred Writings, is always meant that which is Griping and Unlawful. And the reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Uſury</hi> that was generally then in practice was Unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Cruel. It is this that is forbid, and no other abſolutely. For it can't be Unlawful and Sinful in it ſelf, for a man to demand a moderate benefit for the uſe of his money, if he hath let it out to one to whom the lending of it was a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He may without doubt lawfully take ſome Allowance for the courteſy he hath done. And the borrower finding this Beneficial to him, may Lawfully recompenſe the Lender. Even Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude dictates this; beſides that Juſtice and Equity require it of him. So that it is plain, that Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is no Sin when it is not againſt Charity &amp; Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. But when it offends againſt both theſe, or either of them, it becomes Sinful and Wicked, and no good man ought to plead for it, nay, he ought to deteſt &amp; abhor it, and to declare againſt it. Uſury is always Unlawful and Vitious when it is exerciſed towards the Poor and Neceſſitous, for to ſuch we muſt freely <hi>Give,</hi> or <hi>Lend without looking for any thing again,</hi> as our Saviour hath enjoyned us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. Again, it is unlawful to require Increaſe for the uſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, when it appears that there hath been a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere &amp; Honeſt Endeavour in the Borrower, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove What he borrowed, and yet he hath been hindred by ſomething that hath happened to him not by his own fault. It is certain that Rigour
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:039825_0234_10148D7B8A9BD200"/>
and Exaction in demanding the Intereſt, where there have been unavoidable Loſſes and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, is Unjuſt and Inhumane. We muſt ever make Abatements, as we ſee occaſion: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we Act unchriſtianly, and againſt that Law, <hi>Do as ye would be done to.</hi> We muſt never uſe Extremity and Severity, or take advantage of the Diſability and Neceſſity of the Borrower. In ſhort, let us be firmly perſwaded of this, that it is abſolutely Unlawful &amp; Sinful to retrieve Increaſe for money lent if there be any Injuſtice &amp; Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uſed in it. This is Biting and Oppreſſing Uſury, and may well be ranked with <hi>Stealing</hi> and <hi>Thieving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. And ſo may all the ways of Defrauding and Cheating our Neighbours, as Falſifying and Counterfeiting of Writings and Inſtruments, the making or putting off of Falſe Coyn, all Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gaming, all over-reaching of others by Tricks of Law, and all the Arts of Trapanning, which are now ſo numerous &amp; ſo frequent in the World. Theſe are plain Tranſgreſſions of that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Steal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. But there is likewiſe a Poſitive part of our Duty which hath Relation to this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that is to do what lies in our power to preſerve and ſecure the Goods and Poſſeſſions of our Neighbours. It their Right be invaded, we are according to our ability to help them to regain and recover it: and in all our Dealings and Converſe with them we are to maintain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their juſt claim and property.</p>
               <p n="26">§. 26. As we muſt not injure our Neighbours as to their Goods and Eſtates, ſo not as to their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Perſons.</hi> Therefore all maiming and
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:039825_0235_10148D7D1844EFB8"/>
wounding, or any other way of hurting the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of others, but eſpecially the ſhedding of their Blood, and bereaving them of their Lives are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Acts of Injuſtice. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theſe,<note place="margin">Of Murder and Perſonal Abuſes.</note> if it be wilful, is the horrid Sin of <hi>Murder.</hi> The Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of which is ſufficient to deter us from the Acting of it: For it is in its own nature the moſt Execrable Fact that we can be guilty of, and hath always been reckoned ſuch by thoſe that have any ſenſe of Humanity or Religion. This is a Crime that for the moſt part meets with a ſevere Puniſhment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this Life. Murderers have ſeldom eſcaped the Judgment of God in this World. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it is confirmed by the Experience of all Ages, that this Crying Sin hath been diſcovered and brought to light in a moſt Strange and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner. Let our hearts then be wholly ſet againſt this ſoul ſin, which is ſo heinous in it ſelf, and which God hath made ſuch proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt, and which he ſo ſeverely puniſhes.</p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. The beſt Direction that I can offer to you is this, Be careful to ſuppreſs &amp; avoid thoſe ſinful deſires and corrupt Inclinations which are the Root of this Vice: as firſt, Luſt &amp; Lewdneſs, which have frequently betray'd men to this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practice, as we ſee in the Example of <hi>David,</hi> who contrived the Death of <hi>Uriah,</hi> that he might Accompliſh his luſtful deſires. Again if you would guard yourſelves from this ſin, you muſt avoid Drunkenneſs &amp; Intemperance, &amp; Exceſſive heating of your Blood by Wine and other ſtrong Drinks; for the World can witneſs that theſe have
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:039825_0236_10148D82EA4B3988"/>
oftentimes ended in Slaughter and Bloodſhed. Likewiſe, Anger &amp; Exceſs of Paſſion, which puſh men on to Contentions and Quarrels, are the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſions of this Bloody Crime: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are concerned to cheriſh a meek &amp; pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable temper, and to Baniſh all Wrath and Fury. Further, we are to be ſenſible that Covetouſneſs and Love of Riches have ſtirr'd up ſome to this wickedneſs: and others have been moved to it by Ambition and a greedy deſire of Greatneſs &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: for which reaſon both theſe vitious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are to be kept under &amp; ſubdued. And ſo is that dangerous ſin of Pride, which hath often been the ſpring &amp; cauſe of Bloodſhed. For a Proud and Haughty Spirit thruſts men on to Revenge, and will not ſuffer them to think of any ſuch thing as paſſing by of affronts, and forgiving of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: and then it is no wonder that the effects of Rage and Fury are ſeen, and that <hi>Blood toucheth Blood.</hi>

               <p n="28">§. 28.<note place="margin">Of Duelling.</note> Hence ariſes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice among us of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Duels.</hi> The Perſons who are concerned in this Bloody Enterprize, are not acquainted with the Chriſtian Duties of Forhearing &amp; Forgiving: but their minds are poſſeſſed with this ſtrange and unchriſtian apprehenſion, that it is baſe &amp; Ignoble, and unbecoming a Gentleman to put up Affronts and Injuries: and therefore, rather than they will do ſo, they venture on a Combate, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent hazard of their own and other mens Lives. But if their minds were furniſh'd with the true ſenſe of things, they would pronounce it a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and diſhonourable thing either to give or accept a Challenge; for that muſt needs be ſo,

which outbraves not only the Laws of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but of Chriſtianity.

And as for the Commonneſs of the Fact, let no man think that the Heinouſneſs or Scandal of it are thereby abated, but rather that they are Increaſed and Aggravated: as moſt certainly they are.

               <p n="30">§. 30. And as for <hi>Adultery,</hi> which is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching of a Married Woman, that is a Fact which is yet much more Unjuſt and Unrighteous, for beſides the ſtain of Lewdneſs there is a breach of Faith, and a perjurious violating of the Bond of Matrimony. Therefore of the Adultereſs it is ſaid, Prov. 2.17. <hi>She forgetteth the Covenant of her God,</hi> that is, ſhe prophanely breaks that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and Sacred Covenant which ſhe made at Marriage. For the Conjugal Bond is fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Covenant of God,</hi> becauſe it was at Firſt Inſtituted &amp; Ordained by him, And as God is the Author of it, ſo he is the witneſs to it, his Sacred Name being called upon for the Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ratifying of it. Further, it will appear that Adultery is an high Act of Injuſtice becauſe it is an Invading and Encroaching upon the Rights of the Conjugal ſtate, which ſhould remain firm and untouch'd: it is a Robbing of the offended party of his Rightful Poſſeſſion, which is ſuch an Injury as can never be repaired. And where this ſort of Lewdneſs is tolerated, it muſt needs be very injurious to the Community, for by this means it often happens, that Children are not owned, nor provided for, Husbands are hated or deſpiſed, Women become cotemptible as ſoon as their Beauty fades, or their Youth declines, or Luſt is ſatisfied, and ſo a great part of humane

Wherefore it is reaſonable &amp; fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Carnal Commerce be kept within the bounds of Lawful Marriage, for this gives a due check &amp; confinement to Concupiſcence, and is a Legitimating of thoſe Deſires, which othewiſe would be exorbitent: For this reaſon it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to exert or enjoy the Carnal Delight in a due and lawful manner, unleſs in a ſtate of Wedlock.

It is a ſignal act of Grace that they are admitted into Favour at laſt. So <hi>few</hi> are the Perſons that are pardon'd and ſaved, in compariſon of the great Multitudes that periſh in this Sin, that they are here ſaid to be <hi>none.</hi> Such is the Nature of this heinous Vice, when perſiſted in, that it is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed generally with Impenitence. For (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tells us) <hi>Whoredom</hi> (no leſs than exceſs of <hi>Wine</hi>) <hi>takes away the heart,</hi> Hoſ. 4.11. that is, it is a Sin of that quality that it deprives the mind of all ſenſe of Goodneſs, it ſtupifies the Conſcience, and naturally hardens thoſe that commit it. It makes them inſenſible of their Guilt, though it is the greateſt imaginable; and it cauſes them to take no notice of their Danger, which yet is as great as can be. For thus <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſes the miſerable Condition of a Lewd Woman, and thoſe that have ſinful Converſe with her, <hi>Her houſe enclineth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, &amp; her paths unto the dead, Prov.</hi> 2.18.

                  <pb n="236" facs="unknown:039825_0243_10148D93B0B24F00"/>§. 1. I Proceed now to the Third Thing I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> that Branch of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which is commonly known by the Name of <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Mercifulneſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of Charity.</note> By Vertue of which we are bound to do all the good we can to our Neighbours whether they ſtand in need of our Spiritual or Temporal Aid. Our Charity which reſpects their Spiritual Good, conſiſts firſt in teaching and inſtructing thoſe poor Souls that are blind and ignorant and are not acquainted with their State or with their Duty. We muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>enlighten thoſe who ſit in darkneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of Charity to Mens Souls.</note> 
                  <hi>and in the ſhadow of Death,</hi> and to bring them to the acknowledgment of the Truth, which will be both Light and Life to them.<note place="margin">Inſtructing the Ignorant.</note> It is not enough, That <hi>no corrupt Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceed out of your Mouths,</hi> but that moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Diſcourſe be <hi>good to the uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter Grace unto the Hearers,</hi> Eph. 4.29. that it may be ſuch Communication as is ſerviceable to infuſe divine Knowledge into their Minds, and to make them fall in love with that which is vertuous and good. If you meet with poor ignorant People (and there are too many of that ſort every where) take occaſion to inſtruct them in the great Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion, acquaint them with the things of another World, direct them into the Way that leads to Happineſs. Where you ſee any making profeſſion of Religion, but denying the power of it, placing the whole buſineſs of Godlineſs in Words &amp; Shew, labour to undeceive ſuch Perſons, and to convince them of the true Nature of Chriſtianity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:039825_0244_10148D962DBAB5F8"/>
a Practice proportionable to our Knowledge, and forbids us to uſurp the Title of Chriſtians, when we are Strangers to the Temper and Genius of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Secondly,<note place="margin">Reducing them that go aſtray.</note> Your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Charity</hi> muſt be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only in your directing Sinners into the right way, but by bringing them back again when you ſee they are gone out of it, and wander in the ways of Error and Vice. This is beſt of all managed by ſevere Reproofs &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes. The Man who is in a Swoon, muſt not be gently ſtroked: It is a courteſie to uſe him roughly, and ſo he will eſteem it when he is come to himſelf. <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me; it ſhall be a kindneſs: and let him reprove me; it ſhall be an excellent Oil, which ſhall not break my head,</hi> Pſal. 141.5. If we would effectually recal and reclaim Sinners by our Admonitions, we muſt be downright &amp; ſevere with them, we muſt come home to them (as <hi>Nathan</hi> did) with a particular Application, <hi>Thou art the Man.</hi> If we deal not thus with them, we ſpare their Sins, and thereby endanger their Souls, and ſo under the pretence of being tender &amp; compaſſionate we prove moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el to them. And yet I do not mean that he who reproves Sin, ſhould not do it courteouſly, meekly and lovingly, that the Party who is the Delinquent may plainly ſee that he bears a love to his Soul. If the Reproof ſhould be otherwiſe, it would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly offend againſt the Apoſtle's Rule in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>If any Man be overtaken in a fault, you that are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekneſs.</hi> But this doth not hinder you from a bold and impartial correcting of Vice, for you

ſhew your compaſſionate Meekneſs in your free Reprehending and Rebuking of your Brother for his Faults. To this purpoſe we may take notice of the Connection of thoſe words in <hi>Lev.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart: thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer Sin upon him.</hi> If you would ſhew that you hate not your Brother, but that you tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love him, you muſt rebuke him. Some think it unneighbourly and unkind to reprove others for their Miſcarriages; they pretend that they ſhall diſoblige them, &amp; be thought to ſhew themſelves uncivil to them, if they find fault with their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But this is a falſe Notion, for we never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige our Neighbours more than when we freely lay open their Faults before them. And truly I look upon it as one great cauſe of the General Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Lives of Men, that we are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent as to this matter, that we do not take the boldneſs to check Vice, and thereby give a Proof of our Charity to our Brethren. And we may ſhew this Charity further, in adding pathetical <hi>Perſwaſions</hi> to our Reproofs, and in an earneſt <hi>Exhorting</hi> them to leave their Sins, and to return to the Ways of Vertue and Godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. A Third act of Mercifulneſs in reſpect of Mens ſpiritual Condition is to comfort the Weak and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate,<note place="margin">Comforting the Diſconſolate.</note> to chear and encourage thoſe that are drooping, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve &amp; ſatisfie the Scrupulous, to ſupport &amp; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the Deſponding. This &amp; the two former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Charity to the Souls of Men are, as I have ſhew'd before, the more eſpecial concern of thoſe that are Diſpenſers and Preachers of the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:039825_0246_10148D9B23A843F0"/>
Goſpel: But yet they are in ſome meaſure to be the deſign and endeavour of you all. This more particularly, which I'm now ſpeaking of, is an univerſal Duty: When you ſee any of your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren dejected, reckon them the deſerved Objects of your Chriſtian Pity and Compaſſion. Labour to be inſtrumental, by that Knowledge and Experience which you have, toward the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of them; excite their ſlagging Spirits; pour Oil and Balſams into their wounded Conſciences, and tell them what God hath done for your Souls, and what they may expect God will do for theirs. According to Chriſt's own method of dealing with ſuch, you muſt <hi>not break theſe bruiſed Reeds,</hi> but ſtrengthen and confirm them, you muſt <hi>not quench this ſmoaking Flax,</hi> but blow it up into a flame.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4.<note place="margin">To pray for the Miſerable.</note> It is another indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Act of Compaſſion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Pray for others, to make your humble &amp; ardent Addreſſes to Heaven in their behalf, to beſeech God to alleviate their Sorrows, to ſupply their ſpiritual Wants, &amp; to be every way gracious &amp; merciful to them. <hi>Pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Jam 5, 16.

               <p>I might add in the next place, that to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I am now ſpeaking of belongs the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints.</hi> If there be a true Love ſtirring in us, it will put us upon converſing together in the

way of Religion.

This is the meaning of that Command in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt talk of them (that is, of the Laws &amp; Precepts of God) when thou fitteſt in thy Houſe, &amp; when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſest up.</hi> As much as to ſay, Religion and the concerns of it ought to be the matter of your daily Conference; you muſt take all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Opportunities of diſcourſing about them, and of being thereby beneficial to the Souls of your Brethren.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. And if you have arrived thus far, you will not forget to evidence your Love and good Will to the Souls of your Neighbours, as well as to your own, by putting in practice that large and comprehenſive Duty commended to us by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Be not partakers of other Mens ſins</hi>; be not ſharers in their ſins, by advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and counſelling, by perſwading or enticing them to what is Vitious: Partake not of other Mens Guilt, by aſſiſting and aiding them, or by ſetting them an ill Example; no nor by ſinful ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and connivance. But, in brief, take all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of advancing the Welfare of Mens Souls, that ſo <hi>by all means you may ſave ſome.</hi> Endeavour the promoting of Goodneſs in the minds of Men, labour that the Image of God may be more viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prevailing in the World; do what you

can to make them Serious and Pious, and diſcover unto them the Excellency of that Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you find ſo much content and ſatisfaction your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. And to excite you to this work, let me remind you that there is great need of it every where. For want of this ſo few are ſaved, and the moſt go to Hell. Becauſe this Duty is ſo ſeldom practiſed, the Devil hath a very numerous Retinue, and a great multitude of Servants and Votaries. How neceſſary a work then is it to ſnatch Men out of Satans Hands, to pluck theſe Firebrands out of the Fire, to bring ſeduced and periſhing Sinners into the right way, and ſecure their Everlaſting Happineſs? And farther to ſtir you up, let me remind you of this alſo, that this is a Divine and Heavenly Employment, and ſuch as is truly worthy of a Chriſtian. To ſhew Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Souls of Men is the greateſt and nobleſt Charity, The ſaving of one Soul is infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the Gain of the whole World. I will ſhut up all with the words of the Prophet <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> chap. 12. ver. 3. <hi>They that are wiſe</hi> (or, as it is in the Original, <hi>they that are Teachers,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters or People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim &amp; convert others) <hi>ſhall ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Firmament; &amp; they that turn many to Righteouſneſs as the Stars for ever &amp; ever.</hi>

and willing to communicate.</hi> This Rank of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are particularly charged to make their Plenty ſerviceable to the Relief of thoſe that are in want: for it is not fit that theſe ſhould ſtarve whilſt the other are glutted. It is juſt and equal that thoſe who enjoy the freedom of a Feſtival, and the plenty of a well-furniſh'd Table, ſhould not forget the empty Bellies of the Poor. The <hi>Rich Man</hi> mentioned in the Goſpel is ſignally deſcribed by his <hi>Purple &amp; fine Linnen,</hi> by his coſtly Proviſion, <hi>and faring deliciouſly every day</hi>: But this had not been objected againſt him as a Crime, if <hi>Lazarus,</hi> poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> had not laid almoſt famiſh'd at his door. That was it which heightned his Fault, and inhauſed his Doom, that he enjoyed ſo much of this World's Goods, and yet had no heart at all to part with any thing to the Poor: That he could keep a great Houſe, and have abundance of coſtly Fare, and ſeed a great Retinue of Servants, and of <hi>Dogs</hi> too (as appears from that Story) and yet a poor diſtreſſed Begger could not find an Alms at his Gate, no not ſo much as the <hi>Crume</hi> which ſell from his Table. His Quality and Eſtate allow'd him to eat and drink freely, and to be richly clad; but then he was bound to relieve his neceſſitous Neighbour, to feed and clothe him, and to ſave him from periſhing. God gave him plenty &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, not to maintain his Wantonneſs &amp; Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, but to enable him to abound in Charity and good Works toward the Diſtreſſed.</p>
               <p>So muſt it be with you, whoever you are that God hath bleſſed with great Revenues &amp; Incomes; if he hath <hi>prepared a Table for you</hi> (as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt expreſſes it) you muſt remember to prepare and provide ſomething for the Poor: Or elſe your

Plenty will prove a Curſe and Judgment to you: And when you come to ſit down and conſider of it, it will be a bitter and tormenting Reflection to you; eſpecially if God ſhall be pleaſed to blaſt your Eſtates, and ſuffer you to fall from great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance into grett penury. How ſad and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating will it be for a Man to reflect thus upon himſelf, and ſay, I had once the Bleſſings of this Life in a conſiderable meaſure, I enjoy'd the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this World, I might then have ſpared my poor neceſſitous Neighbours many an Alms, I might have clothed ſome naked Orphans, I might have cheared ſome ſorrowful Widows, &amp; many a good Action lay fair in my way. But I paſſed them by, and pamper'd my ſelf, and indulged my Folly. I threw away Pounds upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſpent that in Sin &amp; Vanity which I might, and ought to have employed in charitable Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. That which I ſhould have beſtow'd on the Needy, I ſquander'd away in Gaming and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Pride and Lewdneſs, in contentious Suits and Controverſies, in pleaſing my own extravagant Fancies, or that of others. What comfort now can there be in ſuch Reflections as theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, how great moſt the Anguiſh and Torment be which always accompany ſuch Thoughts? For when a Man thinks with himſelf that he had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do good, and yet that he wholly neglected it, it is the moſt dreadful Sting of Conſcience ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. The Exhortation therefore of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle takes place here, <hi>As we have opportunity, let

us do good,</hi> Gal. 6.10. Let every one to whom God hath given this World's Riches and Plenty, remember to give again, for he knows not how ſoon he may be deprived of them, for his abuſing them.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt and moſt powerful Motive to <hi>Brotherly Charity,</hi> is that which the Goſpel fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with, and which was unknown to the moſt improved Moraliſts among the Heathens, <hi>viz.</hi> the tranſcendend Love which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhew'd to us.<note place="margin">The Love of Chriſt the moſt powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Charity.</note> Seeing he was ſo compaſſionate as to lay down his precious Blood and Life for us, let us not think it too much to part with ſome Portions of our earthly Goods to our afflicted Brethren.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. Put becauſe we learn from the Apoſtle, That a Man may <hi>beſtow all his Goods to feed the poor,</hi> and yet <hi>have not Charity,</hi> 1 Cor 13 3.

Some ſcrape together great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues by their baſe, ſordid and parcimonius way of Living, and then at laſt make the Poor their Heirs, but this is not true Charity, for the Materials of it were ill got; and it is certain, That Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ought not to be the Foundation of Liberality. Others gripe and oppreſs their Neighbours, and by their unjuſt Dealings with them ſqueeze out an Eſtate; but if theſe ſhould build Alms-Houſes, and turn Benefactors to the Poor, they cannot be ſaid to be Charitable, for we muſt not call that <hi>Charity</hi> which was gotten (and perhaps partly from the Poor) by Extortion and Oppreſſion. We are not to think that <hi>Charity</hi> is to be built upon Injuſtice: but in ſuch a caſe as this, Reſtitution ought to be made.

                  </gap>ry great and urgent neceſſity we may do that which at other times is not fitting for us to do. We may ſtrain our <hi>Charity</hi> upon an Extraordinary Account. But the uſual and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtandard of it is that of our Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.41. <hi>Give Alms of ſuch things as ye have, or, as ye are able,</hi> for ſo it is rendred in the Margin: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the needs of the poor according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of that Eſtate or thoſe Incomes which God hath Bleſſed you with, for Religion doth not Teach men to be Ill managers and Bad Husbands of what they have: it directs them to provide for themſelves and their own Families, and then to take notice of the condition of others, and to help and ſupport them according to their power: for though <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> bids us be <hi>Charitable,</hi> yet it forbids us to be Profuſe &amp; Laviſh.

For this is certain that all are not the Equal Objects of our Charity, though they be Poor and Indigent. It is ſo far from <hi>Charity,</hi> that it is a Fault to Relieve <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Lewd</hi> Beggars, becauſe thereby we Encourage and Uphold them in their wicked ways of Living, and becauſe we throw away that upon them which ſhould be given to others, who really deſerve it. Here we are to Remember not to Judge always of mens Neceſſities and Wants by their Low'd and <hi>Clamarous Complaints,</hi> for there is Poverty that is ſilent, and it is the part of our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſcretion to make ſearch after this, and to relieve thoſe who are aſhamed to Beg. And when we have found out the Right Objects of our <hi>Charity,</hi> we muſt then make uſe of our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prudence in diſtributing our Alms according to the wants of the Perſons, and not to all alike, for this was the Rule obſerved by the Primitive <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Acts</hi> 2.45. <hi>They parted their Goods to all men, as every one had need</hi> they proportioned their <hi>Charity</hi> to the Needs &amp; Exigencies of thoſe that wanted it.</p>

               <p n="23">§. 23.

overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> Requite good for evil, and conquer your Enemies by Kindneſs and Patience. And 'tis obſervable, that when St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts us to <hi>have compaſſion one of another, and to love as Brethren,</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adds this, as the natural reſult of it. <hi>Render not evil for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwiſe, bleſſing,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.8, 9.

Laſtly,<note place="margin">It excites to univerſal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence &amp; Kindneſs.</note> To comprehend all in few words, Charity bids us undertake &amp; perform what we can for the Benefit of Mankind. As <hi>Love worketh no ill to its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Rom.</hi> 13.10. ſo it doth all the good it can to him. In our whole converſe in the World, in every Capacity and Station we are placed in, we muſt be mindful of that excellent Advice, <hi>By Love ſerve one another,</hi> Gal. 5.13. Let your Love be ſeen to be an effectual and powerful Principle, by making you actually ſerviceable for the good and advantage of your Brethren.</p>
               <p n="25">§. 25. And this concerns you the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the deplorable Practice of Men in this Age we live in.

               <p n="26">§. 26. You may more particularly be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Love of your Neighbours, and to works of Charity towards them, from the conſideration of the Worth and Excellency of this performance There is nothing ſo amiable and graceful in the Life of Man, as the prudent exerciſe of this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nothing renders him ſo uſeful and beneficial, eſpecially if you take it in its full extent. This conciliates him Reſpects, and cauſes him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; but without this a Man is a miſchievous Creature, a kind of noxious Vermine, &amp; deſerves to be loathed and abhorred. Let then the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Excellency of this Grace prevail with you, and move you to liſten to thoſe Exhortations, <hi>Above all things have fervent Charity among your ſelves,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.8. <hi>Above all things put on

Charity,</hi> Col. 3.14. Which ſeems to be a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Expreſſion taken from <hi>Cloaths &amp; Apparel,</hi> no unuſual Metaphor with the Sacred Writers. Charity is that excellent rich <hi>Upper-Garment,</hi> which is to be worn <hi>over</hi> or <hi>above</hi> all the reſt, that is, all other Vertues and Graces. It is (as this ſort of Garments is) the biggeſt and wideſt, it is a Grace of a large extent, &amp; encompaſſes all the others. My Faith &amp; Hope do my ſelf good, but my Charity doth good to others, Thus the tranſcendent Worth of this Grace may commend it to us.</p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. If you want any farther Incitement to this Duty, conſider not only the great <hi>Excellency</hi> but <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of it. It is no arbitrary Thing, and left to our determination whether we will obſerve it or no, but it is abſolutely requiſite, &amp; is indeed one of the greateſt Acts of <hi>Juſtice</hi> that we can perform. Towards the proving of which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Beneficence to the Poor</hi> is uſually call'd by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> and accordingly in the Stile of Scripture it is to be obſerv'd, that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Mercifulneſs</hi> are words ſometimes of the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. Thus of the Godly man, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor, his Righteouſneſs endureth for ever.</hi> Pſal. 112.9. The Connection of which Clauſes ſhews that Charity is meant by Righteouſneſs. And ſo the word is taken in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.18, <hi>To him that ſoweth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> (that is, to him that is Merciful, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth, is Alms to the needy) <hi>ſhall be a ſure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> And the ſame Judgment you may make of thoſe words, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Break off thy ſins by Righteouſneſs, and thine iniquities by ſhewing
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:039825_0269_10148DDAD6FAD000"/>
Mercy to the Poor</hi>: Where the latter Clauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the meaning of the former. So <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſuppoſed Husband, is called a <hi>Juſt Man, Mat.</hi> 1.19. that is, a good, kind &amp; charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man, as appears from the ſubject Matter in that place. And in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1. according to ſome Copies, <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is put for <hi>Alms deeds,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the uſual manner and ſtile of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">§. 28. And this interchanging of the Words is founded on the thing it ſelf, for Juſtice or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is a part of Charity, as appears from this, that if we act injuriouſly toward others, we are uncharitable to them: If we grind the Faces of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and wrong the Fatherleſs &amp; Widows, nay, if we deny them convenient Relief, no Man will ſay we are Charitable, for Injuſtice is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Breach of Charity; and therefore it follows on the contrary, that we ſhew our ſelves Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in doing the <hi>Poor</hi> Right, and in being Juſt to them.</p>
               <p n="29">§. 29. And further, it is manifeſt alſo, that Charity is built upon Juſtice, becauſe whilſt we ſhew our ſelves Charitable and Merciful to our Brethren, we do but give them what is their due, and what is indeed their own. This <hi>Solomon</hi> was fully perſwaded of when he gave us that Leſſon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3 27.

But there is yet a higher ſenſe of this Paſſage of the Wiſe Man, as we render it ſtrictly according to the Original,
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:039825_0270_10148DDC5A04B0B8"/>
which muſt be thus, <hi>Withhold not good from the Owners or Maſters thereof,</hi> as if he had ſaid, Keep not back your Alms from thoſe who have ſo juſt a Right &amp; Title to them, that they may be ſaid to be <hi>Masters</hi> &amp; <hi>Lords</hi> of them, whereas you that are Rich are only Diſpenſers of them. Which is agreeable to the Language of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who lets us know that we are but <hi>Stewards</hi> of thoſe Gifts and good Things which we have received from God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. and conſequently we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to diſtribute them according to our Maſter's direction. We are but Receivers and Truſtees for the <hi>Poor,</hi> &amp; therefore we muſt diſpoſe of thoſe Portions of our Riches to them which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for their uſe, &amp; of which they may be ſaid to be <hi>Owners</hi> and <hi>Proprietors.</hi> If we fail here, we are unjuſt <hi>Stewards,</hi> and we detain that which is anothers due.</p>
               <p n="30">§ 30. That is a remarkable Injunction of St. <hi>Paul, Rom</hi> 13.8. <hi>Owe no Man any thing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but to love one another</hi>: Intimating to us that Brotherly Love and Charity is a juſt <hi>Debt</hi> which we muſt ever be paying, and yet always owing. For we have every day freſh obligations on us to diſcharge this Duty.

               <p n="1">§. 1. THE Third and Laſt Branch of the Chriſtian Religion, as it reſpects our Practice, is our more eſpecial Duty toward <hi>God.</hi> For though all thoſe Duties of Chriſtianity before-named have relation unto Him (it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible there ſhould be any acts of Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it) yet this which I am now to ſpeak of hath a more immediate and direct regard to Him, and therefore from the ſpeciality of its Object it is called <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the other

two Branches of Practical Religion already treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. And truly <hi>This</hi> is the nobleſt and moſt exalted part of Religion, becauſe thereby we ſo nearly and intimately converſe with <hi>God.</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs</hi> are the moſt elevated Crimes, and the blackeſt Imputation that any Man can be charged with, becauſe hereby we wilfully alienate our ſelves from God, and are Strangers to all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. What the nature of this part of Religion is, and wherein it conſiſts, I will diſtinctly ſhew you in theſe following Particulars.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. I. It requires of us to acknowledge <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> in the Univerſe,<note place="margin">Of Godlineſs, and wherein it conſiſts.</note> and to live in a conſtant ſenſe of them.

which you are convinced of. You muſt own it to be a great eaſe and ſatisfaction to your Minds, to conſider that the All-wiſe Creator concerns himſelf with the World, that it is filled with his Preſence, and govern'd by his Care, and that nothing comes to paſs without his diſpoſal. This is the firſt part of our immediate Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the moſt High, and it is the Foundation of all the reſt that I ſhall name.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. II.<note place="margin">Juſt thoughts concerning God.</note> It is contain'd in our immediate Duty toward <hi>God,</hi> that our Thoughts be employ'd in the Contemplation of him. We muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repreſent his Excellencies to our Minds, and poſſeſs our Hearts with ſuch high &amp; worthy Conceptions of him as theſe, namely, that he is infinitely Powerful, Juſt, Wiſe and Good, that all his ways are holy, and that he can do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and that we ought to acquieſce in his Word and Works as moſt Reaſonable and Righteous. But becauſe <hi>his ways are not like Man's ways,</hi> but are in many things <hi>unſearchable &amp; paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out,</hi> therefore we muſt not too boldly pry into them, and call them into queſtion. When we think of God, we muſt lay aſide all audacious Curioſity, as becometh poor weak Creatures who are not able to comprehend an Infinite Being. Such Thoughts and Reſolves are neceſſary in order to the right diſcharging of our Duty toward God. We muſt not only acquaint our ſelves with his manifold Perfections, which was the Subject of the Firſt Part of this Treatiſe, but (which is the thing that I now urge) we ought to call them to mind frequently, to revolve them in our Thoughts, conſtantly to meditate upon them, and regulate
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:039825_0274_10148DE8C793F100"/>
our Lives by them. This is matter of Practice.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. III. <hi>Godlineſs</hi> requires that we ſhew a Reverence to the Supreme Being in our Words and Speeches.<note place="margin">Expreſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to his Name and Being.</note> As the Mind and Thoughts, ſo the Tongue muſt be concerned in our Duty towards God. There muſt be no irreverend and undecent mentioning of his Name, no Preſumptuous and rude Language concerning ſpiritual Myſteries; no vain, light and fooliſh Words concerning Things that have relation to Religion; no treating the Holy Scriptures with Diſreſpect and Irreverenec; no wreſting and diſtorting of them; no ſpeaking Irreligiouſly concerning any of God's Works; no prophane and blaſphemous Expreſſions; nor any Words that are derogatory to God's Honour: for all this <hi>is taking the Name of the Lord God in vain,</hi> which is abſolutely forbidden.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Again, all unlawful &amp; prophane <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and even the uſe of vain and ſight <hi>Oaths</hi> are to be deteſted and ſhun'd as another Inſtance of <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> in Words. A Modern Author tells us, That this wicked Interjection of Speech is ſo much practiſed &amp; approved of, that ſome Maſters of Language in <hi>France</hi> make it their Third Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to their Scholars, to get by heart ſo many <hi>Oaths,</hi> old &amp; new. One would think that <hi>England</hi> (as well as our Neighbouring Country) had ſome of theſe Tutours, were it not that we find many ſo ready to Swear, that they need <hi>not be taught.</hi> The Streets and Markets, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Houſes, &amp; Places of Converſe,<note place="margin">Ungodlineſs of Prophane Swearing.</note> and even private Dwellings, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments teſtifie the Truth of this,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:039825_0275_10148DEA588D85C0"/>
and bear witneſs to the common Guilt which is now grown ſo crying, and, if not ſpeedily ſuppreſſed, will bring down Judgments on this Nation of a very high quality. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is the moſt unreaſonable thing imaginable that poor dependent Creatures, who cannnot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt one moment without the ſpecial ſupport and immediate influence of the Almighty, ſhould dare to prophane his Holy Name by raſh and impious Oaths: This is one of the moſt unaccountable and ſtrange Enormities that the Inhabitants of a Land can be guilty of, and therefore, if it be perſiſted in, it will meet with ſome ſtrange and unuſual Puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <note place="margin">Perjury.</note>§. 6. With this may be joined all Falſe and Deceitful Swearing, which is generally known by the Name of <hi>Perjury,</hi> and is too frequent a practice in theſe days. But it is a direct Violation of that Divine Law, <hi>Thou ſhall not for ſwear thy ſelf,</hi> Mat. 5 33. and is the Root of infinite Miſchief in the World. And here I will alſo mention that Helliſh Practice which ſo much prevails amonſt us, namely, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God's Name in <hi>Curſing</hi> &amp; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Curſing.</note> We daily hear Men crying out to Heaven to inflict the greateſt of Plagues and Judgments not only on others, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves. Is it not moſt amazing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious that in a Civilized Nation, profeſſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there ſhould be Perſons who every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute call on God to <hi>Damn them</hi>? All theſe Acts of <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> we are perfectly to abhor and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, &amp; to do what we can to prevent the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="269" facs="unknown:039825_0276_10148DEDDAFE85C0"/>§. 7. More eſpecially as to the Sin of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Prophane Swearing (which prevails ſo much every where at this day)<note place="margin">Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt prophane Swearing.</note> be careful to ſecure your ſelves from the Commiſſion of it by ſuch helps and means as theſe, Firſt, Check your ſelves at the firſt Tendencies to this Sin. The neglecting of this hath proved very pernicious to many Perſons: they inſtead of ſtifling and ſuppreſſing their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to this vice, give way to it, and ſo it grows up into a Habit and Cuſtom, which they can never afterwards maſter. And they generally are ſo free as to own this, that by a Continued Practice they have ſo fixed themſelves in this way, that they can't rid themſelves of it: though they are not ſo Ingenuous as to confeſs that this Excuſe adds to their fault. Wherefore be careful to uſe an early Diſcipline upon your ſelves; reſiſt this ſin betimes, and you will get the conqueſt of it.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. Secondly, Avoid all the <hi>Occaſions</hi> of Swearing. Among which <hi>Anger</hi> &amp; <hi>Paſſion</hi> may be mentioned in the firſt place, for it is evident that thoſe who are of a Wrathful temper are moſt inclinable to <hi>Raſh</hi> &amp; <hi>Prophane</hi> Swearing. Their Choler ſupplies them with this Helliſh Rhetorick, and they never more abound with it than when they are Incenſed and enraged. Therefore it is your concern to nouriſh <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and to promote in your ſelves a quiet and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid temper, and to baniſh from your breaſts all undue Anger, that it may not become the fuel of this Vice.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="270" facs="unknown:039825_0277_10148DF15ED18E90"/>§. 9. Again, <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is another Occaſion of this wicked Practice, as is too frequently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Clubs of the Debauched and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ring aloud with this Curſed Noiſe. It is as 'twere natural to thoſe who conſtantly inflame themſelves with Wine to be guilty of this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe then they have no guard upon their lips, &amp; their Tongues uſually are as diſtempered as their Brains. So that it will be abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, in order to your not being liable to this fault, to abhor all Exceſs in Drinking, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your ſelves to Moderation and Temperance, and to keep your ſelves always Cool and Sober. <hi>Gaming</hi> is another Incentive to this Sin, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that old ſaying, <hi>a Gameſter is preſumed to Curſe &amp; Blaſpheme.</hi> It is an Eſſential part of the Character of ſuch a man, that he is given not only to Lying, but Swearing and For-ſwearing. Wherefore let no Temptation prevail with you at any time to comply with this Unlawful and Scandalous practice.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. Moreover, that you may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this deadly Poiſon, carefully avoid the Company of thoſe that are. For the Society of Swearers is Contagious, &amp; will certainly have a Fatal influence upon you if you joyn your ſelves to them. Therefore firmly reſolve to keep always at a diſtance from them, and never to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any that are addicted to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs. Laſtly, let me add this, be careful that you rehearſe not other mens Oaths. This is a fault in many, who though they will ſeldom or never ſwear themſelves, yet they will not refuſe to repeat other mens Swearing. But this may in time prove an Occaſion of Greater Evil: by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:039825_0278_10148DF2F6198C60"/>
the impious words of others, they may come at laſt to imitate them. Be very cautious then in this particular: be not eaſily induced to pronounce expreſſions that were evil in the firſt uttering; eſpecially if they be Oaths, take them not into your mouths: for whilſt you Repeat and Recite others unneceſſary &amp; prophane Swearing, you make it your own, and will in time learn to do the ſame.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. Thus you ſee what <hi>Ungodlineſs</hi> is as it hath reference to our words and Speeches: and I need not add that it is our Indiſpenſable Duty to Hate and Shun every part of it. Nor is this enough, for we are to promote the oppoſite prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices both in our ſelves and others. We muſt not only never venture to be ſo impious as to invoke the Sacred Name of the moſt High in prophane Wiſhes and Execrations, but we are to obſerve that injunction of the Apoſtle, <hi>Bleſs and Curſe not,</hi> Rom. 12.14. We muſt not only hate all Raſh and vain Swearing in common diſcourſe and ordinary Communication, which is the faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vice of this prophane Age; but whenever we have a lawful call to ſwear before a Magiſtrate, we muſt be very careful to <hi>ſwear in Truth, in Judgment, and in Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 4.2.<note place="margin">Of taking a ſolemn Oath.</note> The taking of an Oath ought to be a matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with us, and not to be done out of Cuſtom or ill Deſign.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. Alſo,<note place="margin">Keeping of Vows and Oaths.</note> we muſt be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious in <hi>keeping our Oaths</hi> which we Lawfully make with Relation to others, &amp; likewiſe thoſe Solemn Vows which we at any time make to God of a
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:039825_0279_10148DF48E4BBAA0"/>
Religious and Holy Life, whereby we oblige our ſelves in a moſt Sacred manner to adhere to God and our Duty, and eſpecially to ſome particular part of it. As the making of theſe Vows to God is a great help to Godlineſs, ſo it is a part of it, and is due from us to God, when there is occaſion for it. When we find our ſelves very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſhrink from our duty, we are to make uſe of this as a Remedy againſt our Inconſtancy; we are by this means to ſettle and eſtabliſh our ſelves in the practice of Holineſs, for it will be of great advantage to us to tye our ſelves by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred promiſe in the preſence of God to undertake and perform this or that particular Duty, or to forſake this or that vice. For this we have the Example of the holieſt men: <hi>thus Job made a Covenant with his Eyes,</hi> Job. 31.1. That is, he bound himſelf by a Solemn Engagement &amp; Vow before God not to offend with his Bodily ſight. <hi>I have ſworn,</hi> ſaith the pious <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> that I will keep thy <hi>Righteous Judgments,</hi> Pſ. 119.106. He calls it Swearing becauſe there is a Solemn calling of God to witneſs in this Act of Religion, and therefore ſo far it is of the nature of an Oath. We muſt be exceeding careful that we Live and Act according to the tenour of theſe Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations and Vows; or elſe we Increaſe our guilt by the breach of them Wherefore let us take up that reſolution in <hi>Pſal</hi> 66.14 <hi>I will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered.</hi> And ſo as to all other Sacred Engagements and Oaths we muſt Remember to keep them as Religiouſly as we made them. <hi>Thou ſhalt perform unto the Lord thy Oaths, Mat.</hi> 5.33 And if we obſerve not this, we Diſhonour &amp; Prophane God's name
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:039825_0280_10148DFA616B4C40"/>
and wound our Conſciences by our Oaths &amp; Vows. The ſhort is, we are bound to make uſe of God's Name, and to mention his word and works, and all that belongs to him with Holy Fear and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence: Religion muſt ſanctify and govern our Tongues: and all our Words ſhould ſavour of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Godlineſs. I proceed to other Acts of Godlineſs, and thoſe that are more Spiritual and ſublime, as</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. IV. <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of Faith its nature &amp; Acts.</note> which is indeed the Root of all <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and without which no man can pleaſe God. By this we firmly aſſent to all the Truths that appertain to our Religion, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially all the Doctrines of the Goſpel, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo difficult, and to humane reaſon impoſſible. For Faith doth not enquire whether they be hard to be aſſented to, but whether they be Aſſerted and delivered by God himſelf; and being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this, it readily believes them to be true; becauſe the Teſtimony of God is Infallible, and therefore commands our Aſſent. An other act of Goſpel Faith is an hearty <hi>Approving</hi> of the Truths of the Goſpel, for it is an Act of the Will, as well as of the Underſtanding. Faith is therefore a ſincere Accepting of Chriſt in that manner as he offer'd in the Goſpel, and as he hath ſhewed himſelf in his diſtinct Offices of King, Prieſt, and Prophet. In true and ſaving <hi>Faith</hi> is included a voluntary ſubmitting to all the Laws and Precepts of Chriſtianity, and ſhewing our readineſs to practice them. Thus Evangelical <hi>Faith</hi> doth not only denote our <hi>Aſſenting</hi> to the Doctrines of the Goſpel, but our hearty <hi>Allowing</hi> and <hi>Approving</hi> of them. We not only believe
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:039825_0281_10148DFBE60A1538"/>
them as True, but embrace them as Good, and worthy to be received by us.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Both theſe are comprehended in that excellent definition of <hi>Faith</hi> which the Apoſtle gives us in <hi>Heb</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Where by <hi>the things not ſeen</hi> are meant all thoſe Spiritual and Divine things which are Revealed and Diſcovered to us by God, and which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings treat of. Theſe are inviſible, and fall not under the Cognizance of Senſe, but they are the greateſt Realities that can be, and it is by <hi>Faith</hi> that they are made ſo to us: for though theſe Heavenly things are at a diſtance from us whilſt we are here below, yet Faith brings them near to us: and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and an accurſed Death to ſave us from eternal Death and Deſtruction. Though we were born Children of Wrath and Enemies of God, yet by Him we are reconciled, &amp; made the Sons of God, and Heirs of everlaſting Glory. Here, here is the ſtable Baſis, and the immoveable Foundation of our Bleſſedneſs, &amp; therefore on this we muſt reſt and rely, otherwiſe we can't be reckon'd in the number of the Faithful. Here we muſt fix and place our Truſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the only Author of our Salvation and Happineſs. Seeing we can do nothing that will be acceptable without the Merits of this our Bleſſed Surety and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, let us not reſt on any of our moſt religious Performances, but have recourſe to his All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Righteouſneſs, and his meritorious Death and Sufferings. For the ſake of theſe alone we can find acceptance with the Father, and obtain the Pardon of our Sins: and it is by Faith alone that the vertue of theſe is applied to us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us exert this Grace with great Vigour, and lay hold with this Hand on our Bleſſed Lord; that ſo (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>Chriſt may dwell in our Hearts</hi> (that is, live and operate in us) <hi>by Faith.

                  <note place="margin">Hope.</note>§. 17. V. Another immediate Duty owing unto God is <hi>Hope,</hi> which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtiled <hi>hope towards God,</hi> Act. 24.15. By vertue of this Endowment a Godly Man is filled with comfortable expectations of Good even in the midſt of thoſe Evils which ſurround him: he deſponds not of God's favour to him though he feels the ſmart of his ſevereſt Rod. Yea, the

more he find himſelf deſtitute of worldly helps, with the ſtronger confidence doth he wait upon the Great <hi>Jehovah.</hi> In his moſt preſſing Streights and Difficulties he can in the Holy <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage expoſtulate thus with himſelf, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul, &amp; why art thou ſo diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted within me? Hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance &amp; my God.</hi> But the more eſpecial Object of our Hope, as we are Chriſtians, is the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who for that reaſon is called <hi>our Hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. for his Merits are the only ground we have to expect Salvation. Becauſe of the infinite value and worth of his Righteouſneſs we may entertain ſure hopes of Mercy and Favour with God. And all the precious Promiſes of the Goſpel were made to this very end, namely, to get &amp; ſtrengthen this comfortable Grace in us. Theſe are that <hi>ſtrong Conſolation</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, which he calls <hi>the Hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 6.18. <hi>Which Hope,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>we have as an Anchor of the Soul both ſure &amp; ſtedfaſt,</hi> v.19. This is that <hi>Anchor</hi> which will never fail us, but hold us ſteady, and keep us ſafe, againſt all the Storms of Temptations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having ſuch a ſtrong ſupport for our Hope, let us rely upon the Mercy of God through Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; let us look &amp; wait for the Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſes &amp; Rewards of another World; for if we be genuine Chriſtians, we are <hi>begotten again unto a lively Hope,</hi> 1 Pet 1 3. that is (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle explains it in the next Verſe) to the hope of <hi>an Inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for us.</hi>

The former of theſe is exerciſing of Hope where there is no ground for it: As when Men hope for God's Bleſſing in this World, and Life and Salvation in the other, and yet continue in their Sins &amp; never think of obeying the Laws and Precepts which Chriſt hath enjoined. They ſooth &amp; flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Thoughts of God's Mercy; but never conſider that he is Juſt as well as Merciful. This is no other than an abuſing of the Divine Goodneſs and Mercy, and making it adminiſter to Security &amp; Licentiouſneſs. But we muſt not forget this, That the Hope I'm ſpeaking of is a <hi>purifying Hope,</hi> 1 John 3.3. The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that they muſt <hi>ſhew diligence to the full aſſurance of Hope unto the end, Heb.</hi> 6.11. That is, they muſt perſevere in a diligent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Duty, if they deſire to be fully. confirmed in their Hope of future Bleſſedneſs. If we cleave with full purpoſe of Heart unto God, and dedicate our Souls and Bodies, &amp; all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties &amp; Powers of them, to his Glory, and if in the whole courſe of our Lives we conform our ſelves to the Life of our Bleſſed Maſter, then, and not otherwiſe, we have comfortable ground for our Hope, &amp; we may exert this Grace with great chearfulneſs and boldneſs.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <note place="margin">Deſpair.</note>§. 19. Another Extreme is <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,</hi> which is a refuſing to lay hold on the Mercy of God, and a neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Things that may make us capable, on our part, of the Favour of God.

                  </gap> neglect of our Duty. Wherefore, to prevent or cure this black and horrid Sin, we muſt faithfully and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially repreſent to our ſelves the merciful and loving Nature of God, and the matchleſs Love and Compaſſion of Chriſt Jeſus who came down from Heaven on purpoſe to ſave &amp; redeem Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And hence we muſt aſcertain our ſelves, That Mercy is intended for us, and that we ſhall be partakers of it, if it be not our own Fault. There is <hi>help laid upon one that is Mighty, one that is able to ſave to the uttermost all that come unto God by him.</hi> And this compaſſionate Saviour invites <hi>all to come unto him that labour and are heavy laden:</hi> and he further aſſures us, That <hi>thoſe that come unto him, he will in no wiſe cast out.</hi> Wherefore we have all the Reaſon and Ground imaginable to lay hold on this Merciful Jeſus, and to hope in his free and infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to loſt Sinners. We muſt not be too ſevere to our ſelves, when we have ſo Kind &amp; Indulgent a Saviour: but we are to ſupport our deſponding Minds with this, that though we have a long time been in Rebellion againſt Heaven, yet, if we return by ſincere Repentance, we ſhall be pardon'd and accepted. And that we may not in the leaſt doubt of this, it is confirm'd to us by an Oath, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, &amp; live,</hi> Ezek. 33.11. Wherefore let us comfort our ſelves with theſe words, which are the Foundation of a ſtrong and lively Hope.</p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. VI.<note place="margin">Humility.</note> Another Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God is <hi>Humility.</hi> For (as
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:039825_0287_10148E0A104E7040"/>
I ſuggeſted before) there are ſome Graces &amp; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that have different Aſpects and Relations; they refer not only to our ſelves, or our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but to God. The Grace I am now to ſpeak of is of that ſort, it is not only a part of our Duty to our ſelves and our Brethren (as I have ſhew'd already) but it is that diſpoſition of Soul, and that compoſure of Manners which we owe to the Divine Being. Thus to be <hi>Humble</hi> is to act according to the true nature of the State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition He hath placed us in, it is to live according to that dependance which we have upon him, and that abſolute Authority and Dominion which he hath over us. <hi>Humility</hi> teaches us to aſſent moſt readily to all that God ſaith, to acquieſce in all that he doth, &amp; to behave our ſelves ſubmiſſively under the Afflictions and Calamities which he thinks fit to exerciſe us with. All this is couch'd in thoſe ſhort Admonitions of St. <hi>James, Submit your ſelves to God,</hi> James 4.7. <hi>Humble your ſelves in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> ver. 10. and of St. <hi>Peter, Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6. By Humility we are taught how great, how powerful, how dreadful the Divine Majeſty is. <hi>All nations before him are as nothing: and they are counted to him leſs than nothing, and vanity,</hi> Iſai. 40.17. And we are taught how vile, how poor, how inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we are, <hi>He hath made our Days as an hand breadth, and our Age is nothing before him: verily every Man at his best ſtate is altogether vanity,</hi> Pſal. 39.5. Nay, <hi>Humility</hi> gives us a ſenſe of our Vileneſs, not only as we are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but as we are Sinners and Tranſgreſſors: It puts us upon a conſtant reflecting on our paſt

Miſcarriages in the ſeveral Stages of our Lives, and by ſuch a ſad Review of our ſelves we are humbled in the Duſt.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. There is <hi>Humility</hi> likewiſe in reſpect of the Mercies and Bleſſings, the Gifts &amp; Graces beſtowed upon us by God: we are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we are beholding to Heaven for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good thing we have, that we owe all to the Divine Riches and Bounty; and therefore we are to caſt away all fond conceits of deſerving any thing at God's hands. It becomes us humbly to confeſs our utter inability to merit in the leaſt of the Almighty. Such language as that of the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi> will fit our mouths, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be the praiſe.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have or hope for is not the Fruit of our deſervings, but of God's free Bounty. Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meaſures of Grace and our expectation of a future felicity muſt be reckoned as the product of the unmerited favour of our Merciful God, who out of mere compaſſion to mankind gave his Son to redeem them and make them happy. Hence it follows that we ought to bear down all Pride and Arrogance, and to be throughly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our weakneſs and it ſufficiency, and always to diſtruſt our ſelves. This is to <hi>walk humbly with God.</hi>

would not fear thee, O King of Nations?</hi> Jer. 10.6, 7. His Glorious and Divine Majeſty ſhould create in us an unſpeakable awe and Reverence. Again, God is to be feared as he is Juſt, as he is inclined by his holy and pure Nature to puniſh evil Doers. Thence we hear ſuch Language as that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgmenns</hi> Pſal. 119.120. And even now under the Goſpel, ſince there have been made by it plainer Diſcoveries of God's everlaſting Vengeance which he will ſhew towards the Damned in Hell, we are to fear God as a Judge, and (as he is called by the Apoſtle) <hi>A conſuming Fire.</hi> Our Saviour himſelf commands us to <hi>fear him who is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell,</hi> Mat. 10 28.

               <p>Further, his Omniſcience may juſtly create in us a holy Fear of him: He is of infinite Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and all Things are naked and open to him, and therefore when we conſider this, we can't but live under an awe of his All ſearching Eye, we are obliged to the practice of Holineſs even in ſecret, and we are concerned to take care of our Thoughts and inward inclinations; for God, who ſees all Things, ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the moſt retired Thoughts of Mens Hearts.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, God is to be feared as he is Good and Merciful. Which may partly be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s words, <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130.4 God's Goodneſs and Clemency towards Sinners call for Reverence.

We are obliged to fear God as he is our Father, as well as our Judge. This Paſſion in us is to ſpring from Love; that is, we are to make it appear in the whole courſe of our Lives, that we are afraid of diſpleaſing and offending him who hath been and continues to be ſo loving and gracious to us.

the over flowing redundancy of his Love which brought us into being: Our firſt riſe and exiſtence were from the mere Goodneſs of God.

               <p>And that we may give an evidence to our ſelves, and others of Truth &amp; Reality of our Love to God, let us ſhew it by ſuch undoubted Marks as theſe, namely, by our hearty deſiring and endeavouring to pleaſe God in all things, by our earneſt ſtriving to be like him, by our long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the full Enjoyment of him, by our delight in Converſe and Communion with him, by our conſtant thinking and ſpeaking of him, &amp; laſtly by our obeying of his holy Laws, for this is our Saviour's Rule, <hi>If ye love me keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, John</hi> 14.15.</p>

Joy: Wherefore if you love God, let not Sorrow and Penſiveneſs ſit on your Brows; put on a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Look; Let the Light of God's Countenance add a brightneſs and Luſtre to yours. If you are bleſſed with God's Favour, you have no reaſon to Repine and live Diſcontentedly. If the Lord be your Shepherd, you cannot want.

For this is neceſſary unto Godly Sorrow that we grieve for Sin as it is a Diſhonouring of the moſt High, as it is an oppoſing of Divine Soveraignty, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp; Holineſs. Yea, we muſt weep bitterly that we have more particularly diſhonour'd, abuſed and injured our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that we have by our perſiſting in our Sins crucified the Son of God afreſh, and trampled his Blood under our Feet.

Nor do I mean here by Repentance only a true Mourning for our former evil Ways and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miſcarriages, but a betaking our ſelves to the Practice of the contrary Duties: For compleat Repentance is a turning from Sin and Vice to all that is holy &amp; good,<note place="margin">Its Nature.</note> or, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>a turning from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Mat. 26.18.

If the Blood of Jeſus will not fetch Tears from thine Eyes, nothing will. Here then let us fix our Thoughts, and look upon our Saviour on the Croſs, and thence learn to crucifie our Sins.

And therefore we are diligently to hearken to their earneſt Admonitions &amp; Exhortations.

Let it be our care to make all theſe ſerviceable to our Converſion and Repentance. God calls upon us by thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties which he hath endued our Souls with,<note place="margin">Various calls to Repentance.</note> and by that dominion which he hath given us over our outward man: both which kinds of powers are implanted in us on purpoſe that they may be made uſe of to the curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Luſts &amp; reforming of our Lives. For though we cannot infuſe vertue into our Souls, yet we can reſtrain them in ſome degree from vice: though we cannot change our hearts, yet we have power to regulate our Bodies, and to order our outward Converſation &amp; manners. Though we
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:039825_0301_10146BD667D60750"/>
cannot render our ſelves inwardly holy, yet we can in ſome meaſure do the outward Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, &amp; ſhun the Occaſions of Sin. We cannot make out ſelves good, but we can hinder our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly bad, if we employ and improve the powers that God hath given us: which is therefore our indiſpenſable Duty and higheſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p>But chiefly God calls us to Repentance by his Spirit, by the ſeaſonable Admonitions &amp; checks of that Holy Inſtructer and Monitor: wherefore let us be careful not to withſtand his motions and ſuggeſtions, but moſt willingly to comply with them, &amp; to imbrace all his tenders of grace. If we wilfully give a repulſe to him, he may juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to viſit us again, &amp; then our caſe is unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably miſerable. Let us then kindly entertain and make much of this Holy Spirit: when he ſtirs us up to Prayer, let us cheriſh that good motion; when he invites us to read the word of God, let us comply with that ſeaſonable invitation; when he calls upon us to Meditate, let us betake our ſelves to that employment; when he ſolicits us to do any other Religious action, let us be glad that we are thus moved by the Spirit of grace, who is ſo deſirous of our Repentance &amp; Sanctification, and conformity to the Divine will, for theſe are the deſigns of his viſiting us, if we belong to the Election of Grace. And truly there cannot be a nobler one, nor can we deſire any thing greater, for Holineſs is the higheſt Exaltation of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this is the choiſeſt Accompliſhment we are capable of, becauſe this renders us like unto God, and makes us partakers of the Divine nature.</p>

But beſides this, thoſe who act thus, ſhew themſelves very ſottiſh and ſtupid in vilifying of that which would be of the greateſt advantage to them, and without which they cannot be happy. For even of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament it is ſaid that they were <hi>able to make men wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. And therefore much more are the Writings of the New Teſtament able to effect this, for theſe are a more perfect Tranſcript of the Divine Will, and more fully acquaint us with the Nature of God and his Attributes, and his gracious dealings with the Sons of men: theſe furniſh us with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manifeſtations of his Compaſſion and good will through Chriſt Jeſus the Son of his Love.

For we read that our Saviour <hi>bleſſed the little Children that were brought to him,</hi> Mat. 10.16. and ſhew'd thereby that it was his Intention that theſe ſhould be admitted into the Church by Baptiſm, which is a Sign &amp; Seal of the greateſt Spiritual Bleſſing, <hi>viz.</hi> The inward waſhing of Regeneration, which accompanies that outward Rite or Ceremony in thoſe for whom it was deſigned. This we muſt grant; otherwiſe we cannot think that our Saviour, who did all things wiſely and to ſome real purpoſe, would have Inſtituted the External and Bodily Waſhing; for what doth this avail without the inward one?

of the efficacy of our Saviour's meritorious Death, whereby our Redemptiom was wrought, and whereby a New Covenant, namely, that of Grace and Mercy &amp; Pardon was eſtabliſhed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cup in this Sacrament is called the <hi>New Covenant in his Blood,</hi> Luk. 22.20. as much as to ſay, it is a Confirmation of all the Benefits and Advantages which are convey'd by the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſealed with the Blood of Chriſt. And conſequently this Sacrament was appointed on purpoſe to confirm our Faith, &amp; to aſſure us of the reality of all the great Things promiſed to us in the Goſpel, and thereby to eſtabliſh our Joy and Comfort. Moreover, this Ordinance was inſtituted as a Bond of Love and Union among Chriſtians. Our Saviour intended to unite us together in Communion &amp; Brotherly Affection, when we ſolemnly call to mind his Paſſion and Death, which were ſuch undeniable Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his infinite Love to us. Yea, for the right underſtanding of the nature and deſign of this Sacrament, we muſt know that the due Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of it contains in it All Exerciſes of Piety and Devotion, for here we have occaſion to act all our Graces, to renew all our Duties, and to exert all the Parts of Chriſtianity, and here it is that we are ſtrengthned and confirmed in them all.

our abſolute Duty, &amp; is continually to be practiſed as long as all the other Means of Grace are made uſe of, for we are bid to remember our Saviour in this Sacrament till he cometh, at the end of the World. So that this is not only a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Duty, but a durable one, it is to laſt in the Church of Chriſt till the Conſummation of all Things. If we think otherwiſe, we bely our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; Conſciences, as well as the Holy Scriptures. Wherefore let not thoſe who pretend to be Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſtain themſelves with ſo groſs a Crime as the refuſing to comply with a plain and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Command of Chriſt. Let them not pretend to be his Followers, &amp; yet deſpiſe that which he intended to be one great Mark and Character of thoſe of his Religion, for this (as well as the other Sacrament) is to diſtinguiſh us from Pagans and Jews, &amp; all others that diſſent from the Chriſtian way of Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5.

Wherefore we ſhould not neglect to obſerve ſolemn Times of Faſting and Humiliation, when the condition of the Church or Nation, or of both requires it: and we ſhould accuſtom our ſelves to private Abſtinence in a Religious manner, humbling our Souls (as well as our outward Man) with ſecret Mournings &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations before the Lord: For this Duty muſt be directed to him, and it muſt be done to fit us for his Service, becauſe it is a proper act of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>

You ſee then what Authority you have to encourage you to give orders to thoſe that are under your charge, to repair to the Publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Devout Chriſtians. And truly without conſulting your Bibles, you may find ground and reaſon enough for this practice in the very nature of the thing it ſelf, for it is fitting and neceſſary that you ſhould inure your Children and Servants betimes to a reverence of the Publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that they ſhould have an early knowledge and ſenſe of their Duty towards God, not only as it reſpects their private but their Publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and that they ſhould be taught that this latter is as requiſite as the former.</p>
               <p>This then is the method and courſe which you ought to follow, firſt you muſt worſhip God in ſecret, in your Chambers and Cloſets, where no Eye ſees you: then you muſt keep up Family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion and Worſhip: and then come forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſerve God in the Publick Aſſemblies, and be ſure to bring your Family with you. To conclude, take this for a Rule, you muſt not ſtay at home, when you ſhould be at the houſe of God, though you are never ſo well employ'd in your own houſes.</p>

Nor is it ſufficient to perform and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate all theſe Religious Duties which I have commended to you as puts of Godlineſs, unleſs you do them in a right manner. Therefore you muſt be very careful as to this, and in all your attendance on God in his holy Ordinances, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Publick Aſſemblies, you ought firſt to ſhew all lowlineſs both of Body and Soul. In ſolemn exerciſes of a viſible and audible Devotion we muſt uſe external ſignifications of Reſpect and

The Apoſtle thought fit to take notice of and to cenſure ſome perſons for their <hi>praying &amp; propheſying with their heads covered,</hi> (1 Cor. 11.4) either as they were ſpeakers or hearers, to let us know how cautious we ſhould be even as to our bolily behaviour in that kind in the time of Publick Worſhip. So without doubt to talk or whiſper one to another about worldly matters, or to let the eyes wander and rove, and to feed our vain and rambling thoughts by gazing and looking about, is a very irreverent behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and no ways ſuitable to the ſervice of our maker.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. And for ſleeping, it is yet more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and offenſive, becauſe it argues a greater neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect &amp; diſregard of the Service of God, whether it be by Praying or Preaching; &amp; it hinders thoſe who are addicted to it from reaping benefit by either of them. Wherefore we muſt beware of this rule and careleſs practice, and reſolve when we come into the Congregation, not to be idle and unconcerned, but to be attentive to the holy performances we are called to, &amp; are at preſent at. We muſt mind that ſacred employment we are engaged in, we muſt be intent upon, what we do, and depart our ſelves Decently &amp; Religiouſly, as thoſe who are in the preſence of the All-ſeeing God, and are more immediately intereſted in his Service and Worſhip: remember this, that he will be ſanctified in all them that draw high unto him.</p>

the right Methods of fitting our ſelves for it. It is true a Religious Life is the beſt Preparative, and I have given you an account of that: but there are ſome more Particular <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> that are neceſſary for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this work,<note place="margin">Rules particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</note> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impoſſible we ſhould accompliſh it aright. Theſe Rules I proceed now to let down in the laſt place, &amp; they have reference to the three forementioned objects of our Duty, namely God, our Brethren, and our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="20">§ 20. I. The Preparation which we are to make for our leaving this World hath reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and ſo is an act of Piety. Thus it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we earneſtly beg of God <hi>ſo to teach us to number our days,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To number our days.</note> that we may be enabled <hi>to apply our hearts unto wiſdom. Pſal.</hi> 90.12. The Divine and ſaving Wiſdom, which is to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling. It is from him alone that we can be taught that Divine Arithmetick, and therefore let us make our humble and importunate addreſs to him, that he would vouchſafe us the Heavenly skill to compute our years, and ſo to caſt up the number of our ſhort days, that we may be provided for Eternity, and be in readineſs to enter on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, whoſe duration is endleſs and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. Another act of this Preparation, as it hath regard to God, is to be ready to ſubmit our ſelves to his diſpoſal as to the manner and time and all other circumſtances of our Death. Who ſhould determine theſe but the great Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and in whoſe hand is the Soul of every living thing? Job</hi> 12.10. And therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we die in our younger years, or our life be prelonged till Old Age; whether we be viſited with tedious ſickneſs, or be called away on a ſudden; whether a natural or a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death be our portion, we ought to acquieſce in the wiſe Providence of God, and not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at the Divine diſpenſation.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. Again,<note place="margin">Repair to Chriſt the Conqueror of Death.</note> another effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way of providing for our laſt end, is to repair unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> as the Sole Conqueror of Death, and by a ſteady &amp; unſhaken Faith make our ſelves capable of ſharing in the vertue of his Conqueſt. He by his meritorious Paſſion and Death hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled all ſufferings, &amp; even Death it ſelf to us. When he expired on the Croſs he diſarmed this Serpent of his venemous and deadly Sting, ſo that he is not able now to hurt us. He hath conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Grave by lying in it, he hath ſweetned the ſtench and perfumed the rottenneſs of our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres. Wherefore let us be incouraged to dye by our Saviours dying: ſeeing he hath laid down his Life for us, let us be willing to lay down ours to go to him: yea let us by the Eye of Faith look up, and behold Chriſt reaching forth his Arms to imbrace us, &amp; to take us to himſelf.

<pb n="324" facs="unknown:039825_0331_10148E5ECE624FE0"/>
Everlaſting Life and Glory for us. There is no ſuch effectual proviſion againſt the aſſaults of Death as this is; and therefore let us firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in this Bleſſed Saviour: let us, when our hour approaches, vigorouſly exert our Love &amp; Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and all our other Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="23">§. 23. II. To prepare and provide our ſelves for Death is our Duty as it hath reference to other Men. For, Firſt, we cannot be fit our ſelves to leave this World, unleſs we remind others of their latter end, and call upon them to prepare for the ſame common Allotment of mortal Men. For this being a matter of ſo great Concernment, if we truly love our Neighbours, &amp; have a ſenſe of their future Welfare; we cannot but be Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to them of their Diſſolution, and be glad that they will hearken to our Admonitions. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, when we ſee our Brethren wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of their departure hence, and every day giving too manifeſt proofs of that ſtupid forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, we are obliged to rouze and awaken their Memories, and to repreſent to them the danger of their ſtupidity; otherwiſe we cannot die our ſelves with peace of Conſcience.</p>

                  <note place="margin">To ſet our Houſe and Eſtate in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note>§. 24. Secondly, There is a Preparation due in reſpect of others upon this account, that we are obliged to take care about our Eſtate and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs before we die. When the Summons of Death were ſent to good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:039825_0332_10148E6244B51018"/>
was bid at the ſame time <hi>to ſet his Houſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> 2 Kings 20.1. And this is incumbent on all others whom God hath Bleſſed with a competent Portion of the good Things of this World: Or elſe it is probable they will by their Negligence be injurious to others, even to thoſe that are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allied to them, and moſt concern'd in them. Their Families and Relations, and thoſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd their Benevolence for, may thereby be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, and their Revenues may be thrown away upon unfit Perſons, yea, a great part may be ſpent in Contention and Law Suits. Wherefore it is both Juſtice and Charity to ſettle and diſpoſe of their Eſtates, whilſt they are Maſters of Health and reaſon, that there may be no Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter after their Deceaſe. This is to be done by a formal <hi>Will and Testament:</hi> and if they make the Will of God the Rule of their <hi>Last Will</hi> (as Mr. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe that wait and attend upon us, and adminiſter to our needs, thoſe that are our Relations and Acquaintance, and all that come to viſit us at ſuch a Seaſon are to be treated with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Language and Chriſtian Behaviour; and we are to refrain (as much as in us lies) from all Anger &amp; wilful Peeviſhneſs, from all Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Impatience, &amp; to reſign our ſelves to the

The words in the largeſt Senſe, may be meant of the whole extent and compaſs of Man's Life, &amp; his duration here in this World.

At ſuch a time what will it profit a man to look back upon the Riches, or Honours, or Pleaſures which he hath enjoyed? what advantage can theſe things bring to him now when he is to be deprived of them, and that for ever?

makes Death look with ſo ghaſtly and formidable a countenance on him.</p>
               <p>But it is otherwiſe with the Righteous Man, he is willing to reſign his Breath, and to quit the World, and to go to him whom he hath ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (though with great Imperfection) ſerved.

There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Chriſtianity but what is productive of Purity of Life, of a vertuous and godly Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yea, if our Knowledge doth not contribute towards this, it is of no worth at all, it is empty and inſignificant, and doth not deſerve the Name of True Chriſtian Knowledge. <hi>Hereby we know that we know him if we keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 John 2.3.

ſinful Wretches dare to appear before Thee? We are defiled in our Natures, having in Us a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to all Good, and a Proneneſs to all Evil. But we have defiled our ſelves yet much more by our Actual Sins. We have tranſgreſſed, and that not only through Ignorance &amp; Frailty, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and willfully, againſt the Motions of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Checks of our own Conſciences. And now, O LORD, what ſhall we ſay, or how ſhall we open our Mouths, ſeeing we have done theſe Things? The Wages of Sin is Death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore This may juſtly be our Portion; yea, Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Death and Damnation are due to us. But LORD, ſince Thou haſt been pleas'd to accept of that Ranſom, which thy Bleſſed Son hath paid for loſt Sinners, let us be of the Number of Thoſe that have a ſhare in it. For his ſake Pardon all our Offences, and be reconciled to us, and receive us into thy Favour. When Thou haſt ſpoken Peace to our Souls, let us not turn any more to Folly; but ſo Eſtabliſh us with thy Grace, that no Temptation of the World, the Devil, or our own Fleſh, may be able to withdraw us from our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Thee. Increaſe in us daily all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy Holy Spirit. Work in us ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> as may be acceptable in thy Sight, that it may be that Victorious Faith which may enable us to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World, and to conform our ſelves to the Image of Chriſt on whom we believe. O LORD, who art the Hope of all the Ends of the Earth, let us never be deſtitute of a well-grounded <hi>Hope</hi>

the Fore-runner is for us entred, even Jeſus, Chriſt our High Prieſt. Inflame our <hi>Love</hi> to Thee more and more. Thou art pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our Hearts, &amp; Thou only haſt Right to them. Let us render them up whole and entire to Thee. Let us love Thee with ſuch a Degree of Love, as may make us endure any thing for Thy ſake, ſuch a perfect Love as caſts out all Fear &amp; Sloth; that nothing may ſeem too grievous to us to ſuffer, or too difficult to do, in Obedience to Thee. O Holy LORD, who requireſt <hi>Truth</hi> in the Inward Parts, purge us from all Hypocriſie. O Thou who ſearcheſt the Heart and the Reins, ſearch and try us, and make us ſincere in all our Doings. Suffer us not to ſpeak Peace to our ſelves when there is no Peace; but grant that we may judge of our ſelves as Thou judgeſt of us. Wherefore do Thou throughly acquaint us with our ſelves, and ſhew us the Condition of our own Souls. If there be any ſecret way of Wickedneſs in us, any unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Luſt, any Vice unrepented of in our Hearts or Lives, O LORD diſcover it to us, and give us true Repentance for it, and for all the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which at any Time we have been guilty of; and do Thou work in us ſincere and ſtedfaſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Amendment of our Lives for the future. O Thou High and Lofty One, whoſe Throne is in Heaven, and yet art pleaſed to dwell with the Humble Spirit, pour into our Hearts that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Grace of <hi>Humility.</hi> By this do Thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of our own Meanneſs and Unworthineſs, make us to ſee that we are in our ſelves Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Poor, and Blind, and Naked; that from a due Conſideration hereof, we may walk Humbly before Thee; and in all thy Diſpenſations toward

us, ſubmit our ſelves wholly to thy Good Will and Pleaſure. Give us Grace, we beſeech Thee, in all our Difficulties and Diſtreſſes to truſt and relye upon Thee, to reſt ſatisfied with Thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and to caſt all our Care upon Thee. O that we may always reſign our Wills to Thine, and be content with thy wiſe Diſpoſal. To this End do Thou purge out of our Hearts all Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Deſires and Affections. Give us ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the fading Riches of this World, that whether they increaſe or be diminiſhed, we may never ſet our Hearts upon them, but that all our Care may be to be rich towards GOD, and to lay up Treaſure in Heaven. Enable us to ſet our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on Things above, that when Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, we alſo may appear with Him in Glory. Grant, O Gracious Father, that we may continue and perſevere in all thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces which we deſire of Thee. Let not our Goodneſs be as the Morning-Cloud, and as the Early Dew that paſſes away; but cauſe us to cleave ſtedfaſtly unto Thee, that whatſoever Good Work Thou haſt wrought in us may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and brought to Perfection. LORD, Thou ſeeſt our Weakneſſes, and knoweſt the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Strength of thoſe Temptations which we ſtruggle with. Leave us not to our ſelves, but in all our ſpiritual Combates make us more than Conquerors. Make us unmoveable and ſtedfaſt, that we may abound in the Work of the LORD, and by patient Continuing in Well-doing, ſeek, and at laſt obtain, Glory, and Honour, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and Eternal Life.</p>

               <p>And we ſtill wait upon Thee, O LORD, for farther Inſtances of Thy Goodneſs. Thou who haſt watched over us this laſt Night, be pleaſed to continue thy Good Preſence with us this Day. Vouchſafe to receive us into thy Protection and Tuition, and to defend us, if it be thy Bleſſed Will, from all Dangers and Perils; and do Thou enable us to diſcharge thoſe Duties aright which this Day requires of us.

               <p>MOST Holy and Ever Bleſſed God! Thou art the Maker and Preſerver of all Things, on whom all Creatures depend, both for their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and all the Comforts they enjoy. For with Thee is the Fountain of Life, and with Thee art all the Treaſures of Love and Goodneſs. And Thou takeſt Delight in communicating the ſame to all the Creatures Thou haſt made, according to their Wants and ſeveral Capacities. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore waſt Thou pleaſed to create Angels and Men, and to furniſh them with Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Thou mighteſt manifeſt thy Self and thy Goodneſs to them, and make them moſt Bleſſed in the Enjoyment of Thee for Ever. And when we the Children of Men were fallen from Thee, and had thereby brought our ſelves into a State of Miſery, Thou waſt pleaſed, out of thy own Free Grace and Mercy, to give us thy Son from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to reveal unto us thy Readineſs to pardon us, thy Willingneſs to receive us again into thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and even to advance us to Eternal Life and Glory, that hereby we might be encouraged to return unto Thee, and repent of our Evil Doings, and cleave unto Thee for Ever. O Bleſſed LORD! what are we wretched Sinners, that Thou ſhouldſt manifeſt ſo great Love to us, and ſhouldſt be ſo deſirous to make us Happy? What are we, that Thou ſhouldſt delight in our Service, of which Thou ſtandeſt in no need? But thou art Good, O GOD, and therefore Thou doſt Good, and that is thy Delight and Happineſs. Thou art Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love it ſelf, and thence haſt invited us
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039825_0370_10148EC6528C3310"/>
to partake of Happineſs, which alone is to be found in Thee. As Thou art pleaſed to call and invite us to come unto Thee, ſo it is by thy Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Help and Aſſiſtance, that we ſhall be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to come. Wherefore we earneſtly intreat Thee to put forth thy Almighty Power, and to reſcue us from Satan, and from the Power of Darkneſs, and to tranſlate us into the Kingdom of thy Dear Son. We are weak and infirm Creatures, and are diſabled by our Natural Corruption, and by our accuſtoming our ſelves to Sin: Wherefore unleſs Thou vouchſafeſt to exert thine Infinite Power, we ſhall have no Ability to ſtruggle with Our Spiritual Enemies, and to conquer our Luſts. Help us therefore, or we periſh.</p>
               <p>And that we may be made capable of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy both Here and Hereafter, do Thou open our Eyes, that we may ſee our Sins and Follies, &amp; be heartily ſorry for them. And give us ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Underſtanding in the Way of Godlineſs, that we may chooſe to walk in it with Delight and Pleaſure all our Days. Grant that the Welfare of our Immortal Souls may be the great Buſineſs of our Lives, that it may be our principal Care to obtain thy Love in Chriſt Jeſus, and to arrive to a ſolid and well-grounded Hope of Eternal Life. Convince us, O GOD, that the main Work we have to do in this World, is to glorifie thy Name, and to work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling. Cauſe us to regard this as the One Thing Neceſſary, and without which, nothing will or can avail us. To this End give us a hearty Compliance with the Gracious Terms of the Goſpel, wherein Thou haſt plainly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Will, and the Way to Happineſs. Whileſt

we have this Light, make us faithful in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provment of it, that we may examine and judge our Lives by it, and be guided and directed by it in all our Ways. Suffer us not to miſtake our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eſtate, and to deceive our own Souls. Make us careful to build our Hopes on a ſure Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not on the Sand. Let us not content our ſelves with a meer Profeſſion and Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, without the Power of it. But effectually perſwade us that the Grace of God in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which bringeth Salvation, teaches us to deny all Ungodlineſs &amp; Worldly Luſts, and to live So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, Righteouſly and Godlily in this preſent World. LORD, Help us to bring forth fruits meet for Repentance; and give us that Faith which works by Love, and produceth a conſtant Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thy Commandments. Enable us to devote our ſelves wholly to the Service of our Bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and to live unto Him who dyed for us; imitating the Example he hath given us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedient to Death, if we are call'd to it. Let our Affections be fixed on Things above, where Chriſt is at thy right hand, and let us ever be waiting for the Times of Refreſhing, that ſhall come from the Preſence of the Lord, when he ſhall appear to judge the World in Righteouſneſs.

Let us live ſo, that we may not be afraid to dye; but that whether we live, we may live unto the Lord; or whether we dye, we may dye unto the Lord: So that living and dying we may be the Lords, through Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, our moſt Bleſſed Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; to Whom be Everlaſting Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Amen.</hi>

We were in Danger, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Danger, and we cryed unto Thee; and Lo! Thou heardeſt the Voice of our Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Bleſſed be thy Glorious Name, that Thou haſt not deliver'd us over as a Prey unto our implacable Adverſaries, that Thou haſt once more appear'd in ſo ſingular a manner, for this Land of our Nativity. Whereas we deſerv'd to be utterly conſum'd and deſtroy'd by thoſe who

If it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, we may now tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, if it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, when Men roſe up againſt us, when they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their Fury was kindled againſt us. Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a Prey to their Teeth. Our Soul is eſcaped, as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowlers; the Snare is broken, and we are eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our Help is in the Name of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth. Wherefore unto Thee, O LORD, we return Thanks; and we praiſe and magnifie thy Glorious Name, earneſtly Beſeeching Thee to make us ſo throughly ſenſible of this great and Wonderful Mercy conferr'd upon us, that we may not relapſe into our former Sins and Miſcarriages, which juſtly provok'd thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt us.

Defeat all their Enterprizes, and let it be ſeen and known, to the Glory of thy Name, that wherein they deal proudly, Thou art Above Them; and that Thou wilt not forſake thy People, who call upon Thee in the Time of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Trouble; but that Thou art a God hearing Prayer, and that Thou wilt deliver the Poor and Diſtreſſed, when they cry unto Thee in their Extremities. We confeſs, O LORD, we are not worthy to be heard in theſe our Petitions, for we have done wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and have rebelled againſt Thee. O LORD, Righteouſneſs belongeth unto Thee, but unto us Confuſion of Face. But unto the Lord our God belong Mercies and Forgivneſſes, tho' we have rebell'd againſt Him.

our Hearts of thoſe Holy Affections, which all thy Glorious Attributes and Perfections call for?
