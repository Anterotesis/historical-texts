            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PROV. XXII. Ver. 6.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Train up a Child in the Way he ſhould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>BLindneſs and Ignorance in Things of the higheſt Moment for us to know, is one of the greateſt Miſeries that can poſſibly happen to the Soul in this Life; for as Souls are deſign'd to live happy or miſerable for ever, which Happineſs depends upon the right Uſe of their Liberty; and that upon their Knowledge how to uſe and determine it; it will be impoſſible for them to attain eternal Happineſs, or eſcape e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Miſery, without Knowledge to ſteer, or direct them right.</p>
            <p>From hence appears the great Importance of train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Children in the Ways of Vertue, that ſo early Cuſtom may reconcile them to their Duty: And it is ſo much the more indiſpenſibly neceſſary, becauſe the Seducer is always at Hand to lead them aſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004478_0004_100D538CA4E36BA0"/>
My Buſineſs therefore ſhall be, to enforce the good Work of training up Children in the Way they ſhould go, for the important Reaſon intimated in my Text, that, <hi>when they are old, they may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall then make an Application ſuitable to the Occaſion of our preſent ſorrowful Meeting.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am to enforce the good Work of training up Children in the Way they ſhould go, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Reaſon intimated in my Text, that, <hi>when they are old, they may not depart from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not here be underſtood to ſuggeſt, that this general Rule admitted of no Exception; there have been, and will be again, Inſtances to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But ſuch Inſtances are very uncommon; and it rarely happens, that ſuch Perſons totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſcarry.</p>
            <p>It is a great Advantage to Religion to have been ſeaſonably planted in the tender Soil, and to have taken the firſt Poſſeſſion: And Education has the moſt conſiderable, tho' not the only Share in our Tempers and Manners.—Children are very early capable of ill Impreſſions, and what is imbibed in Youth, is more laſting &amp; influential.—The human Mind is as prone to bring forth Error and Vanity, as the Earth is to bring forth Thorns and Thiſtles; for by Nature we are Children of Wrath, and by the earlieſt Practice Children of Diſobedience. The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations and Thoughts of our Hearts, from our Youth up, are only Evil continually. It is a <hi>lively</hi> tho' <hi>dreadful</hi> Picture, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of our natural State, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. 17 <hi>v</hi> That Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Miſery are in our Ways, and the Ways of Peace we have not known. Yet theſe very Souls thus vitiated by Sin, are capable of being reſtored
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004478_0005_100D53AF05333510"/>
and ſanctified, and of being prepared to ſerve God graciouſly in this World, and to enjoy him in Glory in the World to come.</p>
            <p>Shall ſuch Souls then as theſe be thrown away? Are they to be let alone? Are no Means to be uſed to enlighten them, to turn them, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from their Folly &amp; Miſery? The dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſequences of ſuch a Neglect, are worth our Conſideration.</p>
            <p>As has been already obſerved, we are naturally inclined to Evil; the neglect therefore of Education lays Children under a kind of Neceſſity of purſuing what they are by Nature inclined to; Sin and Vice become ſoon habitual to them; and when once theſe are grown familiar, there ſeems to be an End of Liberty and Choice; they are then for the moſt Part deaf to good Counſel and Inſtruction: or if they are diſpoſed to hear, they want the Power to follow it, being bound in the Chains of their Sins, and led Captive by Satan, at his Pleaſure. And when they are reduced to this Condition, their Ruin ſeems to be ſeal'd, and without a Miracle of God's Grace, are never to be reclaim'd. It fares with our Minds, as it does with our Bodies; They are ſupple and pliable in their firſt and early Years, eaſily bow'd and turned this way or that: but they grow fix'd and ſtiffen'd as they ripen into Age, then preſerving the ſame Shape, Figure and Frame into which they had been firſt moulded. The very Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Turn of Mind depends much upon it: and perhaps a great deal of what we call <hi>natural Temper,</hi> is little more than that particular Frame of Heart, which was firſt infuſed in our Education. This ſhews the Neceſſity of ſowing the Seeds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion early in ſo tender a Soil, and the evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch a neglect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004478_0006_100D538E2BA293F8"/>
How invaluable a Bleſſing then is it, to have been ſet right at firſt? How eaſily, I had almoſt ſaid inſenſibly, may ſuch arrive at the greateſt Heights? They run thro' the Difficulties of a religious Courſe, without ſo much as feeling the Pain and Toil of it. Happy they who have been thus conducted through the Paths of Virtue! Who have never known what it is to have been captivated to Sin and Satan, never felt the weight of prevailing Luſts, corrupt Cuſtoms, or vicious Habits. How eaſily may they obtain a Crown? which muſt coſt others dear, and be hardly gain'd, (if gain'd at all) after many doubtful Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, many Sighs and Tears, many bitter Pains and Agonies of Mind.</p>
            <p>To be then a Parent is ſurely a Concern of great Weight and Moment, every Child being a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Charge intruſted with ſuch by God: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' Parents are not expreſly named, yet are they neceſſarily implied and ſuppoſed in the <hi>Text,</hi> for all Acts muſt have their Agents, as well as their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But what is hinted <hi>proverbally</hi> in my <hi>Text;</hi> is <hi>elſewhere</hi> more <hi>expreſly declared,</hi> Deut. 6. Ch. 6. v. 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and thou ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the Way, when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> Nor is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in this particular leſs preſſing than the <hi>Law. Fathers provoke not your Children to Wrath, but bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6. Ch. 4. ver. (i. e.) In a literal Senſe, bring them up in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> teach them their Duty, what they are to believe and practice; inſtruct them in the Knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and of Jeſus Chriſt; ſhew them in what Condition they are by <hi>Nature;</hi> and to what they are advanced by <hi>Grace;</hi> let them know, that without believing in Chriſt, they can
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004478_0007_100D53B08DDEACA8"/>
reap no Benefit from his meritorious Undertakings; that without Holineſs there can be no Happineſs; and that therefore they muſt be careful to keep a good Conſcience towards God and Man, and by a blameleſs Converſation to adorn the Doctrine of the Goſpel. Above all, inform and endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that there is a Life after Death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men ſhall receive from God, a mighty and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reward, or a terrible and endleſs Puniſhment, according as they have done, or neglected their Duty in this Life; and therefore urge it upon them as an undeniable Truth, that if they live unholy Lives, they ſhall die miſerably; and that tho' their Lives be never ſo long and proſperous, yet if they die in their Sins, it would be better, far better for them they had never been born.</p>
            <p>And as it is the Buſineſs of Parents, to inſtill into their Children's Minds the Principles of Religion; ſo ſhould it be their Care, to frame their Lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules and Precepts of it: to train them up in the exerciſe of Obedience, and Modeſty, of Diligence and Sincerity, of Tenderneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, as the general Diſpoſitions to Religion; to accuſtom them to the government of their Paſſions and Tongues, as the Foundation of it; and to inure them to the Practice of Piety &amp; Devotion towards God; of Sobriety and Chaſtity with regard to themſelves, and of Juſtice and Charity towards all Men, as the principal Parts of it.</p>
            <p>By conducting themſelves in this manner, Parents no leſs conſult their own Good, than that of their Children; for by this faithful diſcharge of their Duty, they ſecure to themſelves ſome of the prime Bleſſings both for this World and the other; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured the refreſhing Teſtimony of a well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004478_0008_100D5390EBBD6B10"/>
charged Conſcience, ſo as to waſh their Hands in innocency from the Guilt of ſharing in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Sins, and Ruin, ſhould they miſcarry; and taking the moſt effectual Courſe of enjoying the unſpeakable Bleſſing of good and dutiful Children while they live here; and of lying down at laſt in their Graves, with the tranſporting Hopes of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all again with endleſs Joys in Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Neither finally, will the <hi>Publick</hi> be leſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obliged: ſince Families are both Nurſuries for <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> on the Management whereof their Happineſs or Miſery doth wholly depend; ſo that Men can in no other Way deſerve better of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or become greater Benefactors to the World, than by training up their Children in the Principles of Vertue and Goodneſs.—Which is the Reaſon, why in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> and other well order'd Governments, a more eſpecial Care was taken about the training up of Youth.—Without this, Men would grow wild and ſavage, unfit for Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Rebellions, Rapines, Murders, and other mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Impieties, are but the natural Fruits of deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature, uncultivated by Education. But if Youth be wiſely &amp; juſtly managed, how happy will its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence be upon Society, and what Bleſſings will it draw down from Heaven upon Men.—And Oh! happy the Children that have ſuch Parents? And happy the Parents that thus take care of their Children?</p>
            <p>But becauſe Providence brings Children into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Dependencies and Relations in the World, and by various Ways cuts them off from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Care of their Parents; as by the Parents Death, or Diſtance from them, or by their Inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litity or Unwillingneſs to inſtruct them; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incumbent on others, whether Maſters or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004478_0009_100D53B2172FB6F8"/>
who have the Care of them, to provide Inſtruction for their Minds, as well as Food and Cloathing for their Bodies.—<hi>Abraham</hi> as the Head of the Family, has this honourable Teſtimonial from God himſelf; <hi>I know him, that he will command his Children, and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the Way of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 18. Ch. 19. ver.—<hi>Joſhua, Moſes's</hi> Servant and Succeſſor ſaid, <hi>As for me, and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh 24 Ch. 15. ver. The general Precepts of loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our Selves, &amp; of doing to others as we would they ſhould do unto us, makes it neceſſary for all thoſe who have the Care of Children, to train them up in the Way they ſhould go.—And let this be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive towards promoting the Diſcharge of this Duty of Inſtruction, that the neglect of it will not only involve thoſe concerned, in the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, Shame, and Sorrow of Children's Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, but in a great Meaſure in the Guilt of them. For certain it is, that Parents muſt be one Day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for all their Neglects of their Children, in Matter of Inſtruction, Example, and Reſtraint from Evil.—And let me intreat all Maſters of Families to be eſpecially careful in the Particular of ſetting good Example; for there is ſmall probability of Succeſs, where there is a conſtant Contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Inſtructor's Precepts and his Practice. The Force of a Preſident (as <hi>Experience</hi> convinces us) is vaſtly more prevalent, than that of Precept. And even Children will be more apt to follow a bad Example, than the beſt Inſtructions: Vain therefore will your Cautions againſt thoſe Things be, which you practice your ſelves; vain will your Puniſhments be for the commiſſion of them; when all your Arguments may be baffled with this ſingle Queſtion, <hi>Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thyſelf? How then will it make your Ears tingle,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004478_0010_100D53927415BD80"/>
when God ſhall ariſe terribly to Judgment, and ſay to you, Behold! the Children which I have given you; they were Ignorant, and you inſtructed them not; they made themſelves Vile, and you reſtrained them not. Why did you not teach them at Home, and bring them to Church, to the publick Ordinances, and Worſhip of God, and train them up to the Exerciſe of Piety and Devotion? But you did not only neglect to give them good Inſtruction, but you gave them bad Example: And lo! they have followed you to Hell, to be an addition to your Torment there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would not ſuch a Charge as this make every Joint of you to tremble, would it not cut your Hearts, would it not ſtrike you with Horror, to be thus reproached? I am not able to make ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Repreſentation of this Matter, as it deſerves, but I would awaken Parents to a Senſe of their Duty, and terrify them out of this groſs &amp; ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neglect, which too many are guilty of.</p>
            <p>Let Parents then carefully adminiſter, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren patiently and gladly receive Inſtruction, their future Intereſt depends upon it. And what is the Life of the Body compared with the Life of the Soul, or the Pleaſures of Time compared with eternal Torments? And let me prevail on all, (who are not yet arrived to Years of maturity) to conſider, that no Objections or Prejudices againſt a compliance, can be of equal Weight with the eternal Life or Death of your Souls. When Satan or Sinners, or your own Hearts would cauſe you to refuſe Chriſt, and neglect Salvation; have this Anſwer to all their Pleas in readineſs; My Life or Death, my eternal Happineſs or Miſery depend upon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or neglecting Chriſt; If I have not Chriſt, I can't have Life; If I have no Grace, I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004478_0011_100D53B4F8E82D20"/>
Since then you have precious and immortal Souls to be ſaved? Since you have Helps and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which many others want? Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be good and happy with a few, than to be wicked and miſerable with a Multitude? Shall all the Care, Coſt and Kindneſs of your Friends be loſt, and your Souls undone for ever? Can all the Pleaſures of Sin make amends for the Sorrows it will bring in the End; when you will be forced to mourn at the laſt, and to ſay, <hi>How have we hated Inſtruction, and our Hearts deſpiſed Reproof, and have not obeyed the Voice of our Teachers, nor inclined our Ears to them that inſtructed us?</hi> But before it comes to this, may the Lord incline your Ears that you may hear, and your Souls may live! <hi>Take faſt hold of Inſtruction, let her not go, keep her, for ſhe is thy Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Time will not permit me to proſecute this important Subject any further; I muſt break off the Thread of my Diſcourſe, by intreating you to turn your Eyes to a miſerable poor Creature, under the deepeſt Diſtreſs and Agony of Soul, from the conſciouſneſs of a miſpent Life, and the certainty of her very near approaching Execution; reduced to this deplorable Condition, chiefly from a want of thoſe Opportunities of Inſtruction, you ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully enjoy: being heretofore inſtructed neither in the Doctrines of Faith, nor ſeaſon'd with the Principles of pure Religion. This was the Scource of all her Misfortunes; an utter Inſenſibility or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Ways of living uſefully in this World, or happily in another. May her untimely End in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence you all to lay faſt hold on Inſtruction; may her Example and Sufferings anſwer the Intention of the Law, and deter all viciouſly and wickedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Perſons among you from incurring the like Condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:004478_0012_100D5394C938B3D8"/>
She is to die for concealing the Death of her Baſtard Child, ſuppoſed to be murdered by her; and if ſo, the moſt unnatural Murder! But this Part of the Charge ſhe denies, yet acknowleges her Sentence to be juſt, in as much as ſhe neglected the neceſſary Means of it's Preſervation.—Murder is a horrid Crime, and therefore puniſh'd by the Laws of moſt Nations with Death, becauſe the Common-Wealth is deprived of an innocent Member, by one that is apparently pernicious.—But why ſhould I at preſent upbraid or inſult this poor Malefactor! She is convinced I truſt of the heinouſneſs of her Sins, and may her Preparation and Repentance avail her in the Day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>My Buſineſs is to addreſs my dull Hearers, to rouſe them up to a Conſideration of their own Ways, and (altho' their Conſciences may acquit them of the Sin of Murder) to exhort them to inquire if there are not Sins of as damning a Nature, that they may be involved in.—What think you of Adultery, Fornication, Extortion? Theſe triumph with great Security, are left unmortified and unſubdued, in faſt poſſeſſion of your Hearts, and in full ſway there.—What think you of Malice, Envy, Slander, Detraction, Backbiting, Lying? Theſe, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, are Sins of the Fleſh, and tho' not puniſhed with a Gallows here, are reſerved for God's eternal Judgment. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>they which do ſuch Things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> It is dreadful to behold a poor miſerable Sinner, in perfect Health, taking her Leave of the World, and all the Vanities of it: The uncommonneſs of the Sight ſtrikes us with Horror, and ſhocks our very Nature. But upon Reflection, how is her Caſe more deſperate than that of a forlorn wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinner upon a Death-Bed? Nay the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004478_0013_100D53B692DE0460"/>
is manifeſtly on her Side; for ſhe has had ſome Time, and <hi>we truſt</hi> Power, to make her Peace; the Death-Bed Penitent, neither Time, Power, nor Diſpoſition: for to make a ſincere Penitent, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Conſideration, Strivings, and Conteſts with our ſelves, are required: And how unable and unfit is a Man for theſe Things, when he lies lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing on a Death Bed.—Were we not ſtupid and infatuated with the deceitful <hi>Charms</hi> of Sin, we ſhould ſee our Danger, and whilſt we have Strength of Body and Mind, Time, Opportunity, and Means of Grace, ſhould ſecure our everlaſting Happineſs: We ſhould wipe out our Sins by timely Repentance. Then cannot the evil Day come upon us unawares, whenever it comes.—When after any Miſcarriage, we have reconciled our ſelves to God, we lie down in ſafety; and are in Security, tho' that very Night our Soul ſhould be required of us.—Since then upon this ſhort, this uncertain Life, depends our eternal Fortune in the next World, how infinitely doth it concern us to trifle no longer.—Methinks every Spectacle of Mortality, the ſound of every Paſſing-Bell ſhould alarm us.</p>
            <p>But to return to the ſorrowful Object before us.—Behold her then overwhelmed with Shame and Confuſion of Face, lamenting her Ignorance, and bewailing her innumerable Commiſſions of Sin, and Omiſſions of Duty; which Way ſoever ſhe caſts her Eyes, ſhe is preſented with nothing but Horror. If ſhe looks inwards, there ſhe finds a Soul all over foul and leprous, oppreſſed with intollerable Loads of Guilt, and fill'd with the remembrance of a thouſand Inſtances of Folly, and the uglieſt Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude—If ſhe looks upwards, ſhe ſees an angry offended God, whoſe Laws ſhe has affronted, whoſe Threatnings ſhe has deſpiſed, whoſe <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhe has
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004478_0014_100D5397B732D818"/>
done deſpite to; whether ſhall ſhe turn her, what's to be done in this deplorable State. With thee, O God! there is Mercy.</p>
            <p>Run over then in thy Thoughts thy whole paſt Life, recollecting the many Mercies and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that God has vouchſafed thee, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Goodneſs with Praiſe and Thankſgiving. Then reflect on the great Miſcarriages of thy Life; once more weep over thy old Sins, and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them with the uttermoſt Abhorrence and godly Sorrow that thou canſt poſſibly affect thy Soul withal, to make up all thy former Defects. Then inceſſantly pray to God, that He would be with thee, and ſupport thee, that he would increaſe and ſtrengthen all thy Chriſtian Graces, thy Faith, and Patience, and Hope, and Truſt in Him, and that He would fill thee with all Joy and Peace in believing thro' the Power of the Holy Ghoſt.—Utterly renounce thine own Righteouſneſs, and place all thy Hopes in the Mercy of GOD, thro' the Merits and Mediation of our Redeemer. Truſt to the Merits of his Paſſion only for thy Salvation; for in Him only is thy Help found. Therefore by <hi>Faith look up unto Jeſus, the great Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sins of the World</hi>—Then adore the divine Goodneſs, that has with ſuch infinite Mercy to us, given Him to be the Propitiation for our Sins; and earneſtly beg from the bottom of thy Heart God's Pardon for all thy Sins from thy Youth up, until now, (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that for which thou art ſhortly to ſuffer) in his Name, and for his Sake; humbly beſeeching the God of all Grace and Goodneſs, that He who is in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, would for Chriſt's ſake, be reconciled to thee, and receive thee to his Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004478_0015_100D53B92B0F48F0"/>
Here is comfort for the ſincere Penitent, (tho' miſerable Sinner,) by the Stripes of Jeſus he is healed, the Benefit of his Blood does not only reach the Righteous, and the Innocent; thoſe that through a good Education, and a virtuous Diſpoſition have, in a great Meaſure, eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, and have all their Lives long given up themſelves to the Service of Jeſus Chriſt; I ſay, it is not to theſe only, that the Mercies of the Goſpel are extended; (tho' of all others theſe are the moſt happy People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but the Gate is open, even to the prodigal Children; thoſe that have waſted all their Father's Subſtance in Lewdneſs and riotous Living; even theſe the Father is ready to receive with open Arms, if they can have but the Heart to return to him. Many Inſtances and Examples do the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament afford of thoſe that have found Mercy from God, after their falling into ſinful and grievous Crimes; as <hi>David,</hi> after his commiſſion of Murder and Adultery; <hi>Solomon,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Courſe of Debauchery and Idolatry; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi> after a long Life of horrid Impieties.—And ſure the Gates of Repentance are as open in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as the <hi>Old,</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as under the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not take upon me to ſay, which were the greateſt Sins that ever were committed by Mankind; but I will Inſtance in two, that muſt needs be acknowledged to have been very great, which yet have obtain'd Pardon: and they are the Sin of our firſt Parents, and the Sin of the <hi>Jews</hi> in crucifying our Saviour.—In the latter of theſe Inſtances, beſides the greatneſs of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, againſt whom they ſinned, (putting to Death the Lord of Life and Glory) there was deſign'd
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004478_0016_100D5399DBAFBCF0"/>
Malice, Perjury, Subornation, Contumely, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, Contradiction to the plaineſt Evidence of Miracles of all Kinds, and to the Conviction of their own Conſciences: And notwithſtanding St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the ſame Men to Repentance.—And our bleſſed Saviour himſelf apologizes for their Ignorance, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do:</hi> And <hi>the Scriptures bear them witneſs, that if they had known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> This Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is all the Extenuation the horror of their Crime was capable of.—And ſome Extenuation it always is, tho' in proportion leſs, as the Means of Knowledge are greater.—I would not here be underſtood to inſinuate the Priſoner's Ignorance of the capitalneſs and wickedneſs of the Crime ſhe is convicted of; I only apply it to ſome of the Actions of her paſt Life, for which ſhe muſt account at the great Tribunal, as well as for this.</p>
            <p>Further, altho' I can by no Means think the Caſe of the Labourers coming into the Vineyard at the eleventh Hour, nor that of the <hi>Penitent Thief</hi> upon the Croſs to be exactly parallel with the Caſe of this condemn'd Malefactor; yet ſome Reſemblance may be diſcovered; and theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may afford ſome Encouragement to her, whoſe Misfortune it has been to live a long Time in Ignorance and Sin.—In the Thief upon the Croſs we have an Inſtance of a poor Wretch almoſt expiring; certain Death upon him, dying under publick Puniſhment for a very heinous Crime: And yet at the End of a Life, led pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably after the Rate that theirs generally are, whoſe Wickedneſs at length brings them to an untimely End: This Creature is ſoftned at once,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004478_0017_100D53BAD1AE13C8"/>
received into Favour, and promiſed a tranſlation from a <hi>Gibbet</hi> into <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>—This certainly is a Monument of Mercy, a ſtanding Comfort to all in the ſame Circumſtances who truly repent, tho' at their laſt Hour.—For even they who have lain long in the Snares of the Devil, and thro' the Courſe of a whole Life, been taken Captive by him at his Will, ſhall like this reclaimed <hi>Thief,</hi> be reſcued, accepted, rewarded; provided they like him return to God, and improve their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſmall remainder of Time to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>And this we truſt is pretty near the Caſe of our poor condemned Siſter; the Scales have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from her Eyes, and Streams of Tears guſh'd out, the bitter, but wholſome Tears of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:—The Sincerity of which, tho' none but God that ſees the Heart can certainly tell, yet Man alſo may, and ought to believe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Judgment of Charity, but of moral Practice, from all evident Signs of it, which are to be given by one in her Condition.—And tho' to forſake Sins then, when we can no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, ſeems to be rather the Effect of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Neceſſity, than of Choice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſo acceptable, or Praiſe-worthy; yet we find Almighty GOD often uſes the one to bring about the other; and improves a forced abſtinence from Sin, into a ſettled loathing and deteſtation of it.—So that I think we may charitably conclude, that her Condemnation, thro' the Grace of God has proved an effectual Means of a true, tho' late Repentance: And that if ſhe has done all that poſſibly ſhe could in that little Time that has been allow'd her; even this her Work ſhall not
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004478_0018_100D539BACF48F68"/>
be loſt; ſhe ſhall be much happier than ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
            <p>Grant we beſeech thee therefore, O Heavenly Father, that ſhe may End her Life in thy Fear and Favour, and that ſhe may receive her Death, which is ſo very near at Hand, not as a <hi>Curſe,</hi> but as a <hi>Deliverance.</hi>—</p>
            <p>And I intreat you all here preſent to join with me in commending her Soul into the Hands of Almighty GOD, as into the Hands of a faithful Creator, and moſt merciful Saviour, humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching Him, that it may be precious in his Sight.</p>
            <p>Lord, waſh her Soul in thy Blood, that it may be preſented without Spot unto thee. And let her die in thy Favour, and reſt in Peace, and riſe again in Glory.—Strengthen her O God! in her Agonies; as her Strength fails, let her Pains wear off. But when her Strength fails, let not her Faith fail; even in Death, let her Truſt in thee. And the nearer ſhe is drawing to thee, the more do thou manifeſt thy Mercy.—Lord Jeſus have Mercy upon her! Thou Lamb of God that tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt away the Sins of the World, be merciful to this poor Sinner; perfect her Repentance, and accept it; blot out all her Miſ Deeds, as thou engageſt to do to all who ſincerely repent of the ſame. Deliver her O Lord, from fear of Death, and from all violent Diſorders of a troubled Fancy, or painful Deluſions of her Ghoſtly Enemy. Let not him now be able to diſturb or terrify her, or any way to prevail againſt her, but guard thou thy Servant.—Give thy Holy Angels charge to ſtand about her, to guard and receive her poor
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004478_0019_100D53BE44EC9308"/>
Soul at her Departure, and to conduct and carry it to the bleſſed Receptacles of Reſt and Peace.—And teach us, Good Lord, who are to ſurvive, ſo to number our Days, that we may ſeriouſly apply our Hearts to that holy and heavenly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom whilſt we live here, which may in the End bring us to Life everlaſting.
