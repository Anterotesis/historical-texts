            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ENGAGED, profeſſionally, for a number of years in the direction of theatres, an intimate acquaintance with dramatic authors, early as well as modern, was an unavoidable conſequence: the plays of Lillo, preeminently claim attention; the pure ethics, the ſtriking example, the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſympathy, inculcated and excited in them, together with the ſublime and nervous ſimplicity of his language, and pathos of his characters, rank him high as a dramatiſt: an elegant <hi>French Critic</hi> quotes ſome ſcenes of Lillo's <hi>George Barnwell,</hi> as "a ſtandard of dramatic writing." To the mutations of manners, in part, and to the improved ſtate of the Engliſh ſtage, are aſcribable, that extreme ſenſibility, and refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of taſte, which condemn the plays of this author to the cloſet: to purge the paſſions by ſcenes of terror and agony, is no longer held as an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential of the Tragic Muſe! The Play of "<hi>Fatal Curioſity</hi>" has been frequently exhibited under the direction of that excellent critic, the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:039110_0004_10139D2B9E67B4E8"/>
late Mr. Colman; but the ſombre tints of the ſubject, the undivided intereſt of the incidents, chaining the mind to the heart-rending cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe, (after repeated efforts, on the part of the public, to reliſh the bold, but terrific colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lillo) returned it to the ſhelf; ſealed up from future repreſentations, by faintings, groans, and every other poſſible expreſſion of agony, in the audience.</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with its merit, and ſedulouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing every reſearch for the public amuſement, I took the Play to pieces, and interwove with it an epiſodical plot; with a view, by dividing the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, without weakening the intereſt of the original, to relieve the incidents; and the courſe of events opening a probable medium for chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cataſtrophe, I adopted, it:—In the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance it has anſwered my moſt ſanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>
            <p>If the admirers of Lillo, in his majeſtic ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, will forgive the freedom I have uſed; if the public can reap one additiona gratification at the theatre from my labours, my object is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely attained. I write not for applauſe; my
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:039110_0005_10139D2D229996F8"/>
end is not fame: Loſt, alas! is that talent, for which I was covetous of praiſe—mute is the voice, which, from the rapturous applauſe of theatres, caught not the eſtimation of its own value, half ſo much, as from the reflected expreſſion of my gratitude.—Peace, gentle Shade! yet, ſweetly embalmed in the memory of an enlightened public.</p>
