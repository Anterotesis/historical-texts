            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The following SERMON was delivered at the Fryers Meeting in Briſtol, on Friday, the <hi>22d</hi> Day of May, <hi>1767.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I HAVE frequently thought, and the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been confirmed from my own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and experience, that a great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent point would be gained, highly conducive to the advantage of mankind, did they generally, tho' from no ſurer guide than tradition, ſubſcribe with heart and mind, to that certain truth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in holy writ;
<q>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lviii. 11.</note> Verily, there is a reward for the righteous: Verily he is a God, that judgeth in the Earth;"</q>
            </p>
            <p>As ſuch a perſuaſion, from whatever ground it ariſes, naturally tends to influence the conduct, to avoid evil, and to purſue that which is good; and with regard to many, it hath proved a ſtep to their nearer acquaintance with GOD, who is the only ſure guide to true happineſs.</p>
            <p>INDEED I ſcarce think there can be many, if there be any, who are hardy enough to deny the exiſtence of the ſupreme. Being; but believe, on the contrary, that many, through the divine favour, enlightened to ſee their duty, and aſſiſted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it; do, in conſequence of theſe favours, contemplate, with ſatisfaction inexpreſſible, theſe attributes of the moſt high GOD, here mentioned by the Pſalmiſt: And could I be induced to think,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010899_0003_0F851BDFFA84CDF0"/>
that any part of mankind had ſwerved from their duty, for want of a firm conviction of thoſe his attributes, as relative to his creatures; and of the certainty, that there is really a GOD who judgeth the earth: I ſay, could I believe their minds were deſtitute of this animating and enlivening proſpect of his power, omniſcience, and goodneſs, in his ſuperintendant care, and preſent judging the earth, I ſhould deem ſuch but a very little removed, if any, from the ſtate of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> upon whoſe altars the holy apoſtle diſcovered an inſcription,
<q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 23.</note> "To the unknown God."</q>
Indeed a language that was ſpoken formerly, hath been too much adopted by ſucceeding generations; numbers of whom have been like thoſe men of Jeruſalem, who ſaid, <note n="†" place="bottom">Zeh. i. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</hi> Many (ſeduced by the grand deceiver and his agents) have endeavoured to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange and withdraw themſelves from the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the whole earth: They have hence grown dark in their imaginations, and in like manner thus reaſoned with themſelves, <q>He will do us no good, why therefore ſhould we ſeek him? He will do us no harm, why ſhould we fear him?</q> This we may juſtly look upon as the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſeduction of mind! as it miſleads to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtance (without timely recovery) from that ſtate of obedience, in which we are only capable of happineſs, through the favourable notice of our father who is in heaven.</p>
            <p>BUT we may juſtly conclude, that ſuch impiety paſt not the attention of an
all-ſeeing GOD, in as much as he replied,
<q>I will puniſh thoſe men of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010899_0003_0F851BDFFA84CDF0"/>
Jeruſalem, who have ſaid, The Lord doth us no good, why ſhould we ſeek him? He will not do us any harm, why ſhould we fear him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE certainty of his ſuperintendency, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be the happineſs of all the wiſe and good in all ages; and it is theſe, and only theſe, that diſcern wherein true happineſs conſiſts. Hence hath it become, and ſtill remains, an eſtabliſhed glorious truth, accompanied with, and confirmed by, the voice of all generations.</p>
            <p>UNDER this head in particular, a Petition or Prayer that was put up to him who hath created the earth, and aſſigned a reward to the righteous, by <hi>Agur,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jaketh,</hi> hath appeared to my mind, as neceſſary at this day to be adopted by every individual, who is deſirous of living to the beſt, wiſeſt, and happieſt purpoſe of life; without which they had better never have lived: And I cannot but recommend it moſt particularly to <hi>You,</hi> the riſing generation, whoſe minds I truſt are at times ſuſceptible of proper impreſſions, who are not become ſlaves to the vanity and luſts of the world: And indeed it ſeems like the language of one that is entring upon the ſtage of life: <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxx. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I die! Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me; leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? Or leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſubſtance of this memorable requiſition hath appeared to my mind, during the courſe of a long ſeries of obſervations of men, and times, with
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010899_0004_0F851BE0AF4BC1F0"/>
regard to its import in point of religion, virtue, the love and peace of GOD; as including indeed, all that is good and neceſſary for our ſafe conduct and ſupport through this life, to that completion of happineſs, propoſed as the final reward of the righteous.</p>
            <p>BUT how will ſome be able to prefer a petition to a power in whom, alas! they have no truſt? Who would gladly be poſſeſſed of, and are much better pleaſed with, ſharing a crown of wicked proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this world, than with the proſpect of a crown of pure and perfect felicity, in a ſtate of endleſs futurity.</p>
            <p>O THAT parents would timely and vigilantly exert themſelves to raiſe early impreſſions in the tender minds of their children, in order to fix deeply the chriſtian doctrine, with all its glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences; firmly perſuading and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, that they are under the immediate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that Being, who is ever unſpeakably good and gracious; and informing them, that he is cloathed with every awful, reverential attribute; as being perfectly wiſe, powerful and good, yet ſtrictly juſt; that he is the maker of us all; and that he delights to be called upon by us, with the tender and endearing appellation of, "Our father, who art in heaven."</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, under the deep and reverent ſenſe of the certainty of his continual preſence and providence, let us be ever careful, ever earneſtly deſirous to conſtitute a part of his children and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in this our probationary ſtate; that as we, by our rank in the creation, belong to the order of ſpirits, we may aſſuredly hope to join the cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010899_0004_0F851BE0AF4BC1F0"/>
and ſeraphim, in the habitations of glory and peace, by our now becoming members of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant church; and may, when our warfare ſhall be accompliſhed, unite with the chorus of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant hoſts, in the language and tribute of grateful adoration and praiſe.</p>
            <p>AND indeed without this bleſſed hope, we are of all creatures the moſt
miſerable! being daily ſurrounded with lamentation and woe! combating with ſecret or obvious diſtreſſes! and encountring, from the cradle to the grave, a perpetual ſucceſſion and variety of afflictions! we might therefore tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, if our hopes were only fixed upon the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory and fleeting pleaſures of this life, we ſhould be, of all the animal creation, the moſt miſerable! But we are aſſured, that nothing leſs than GOD himſelf, is the infinite and endleſs reward of all that diligently and conſtantly ſolicit him to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing purpoſe.—<hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die; remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me, leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? Or loſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHICH is as if the Prophet had ſaid,
<q>Thou art my father, the author of my being; I made nothing myſelf, but am wholly and entirely the offspring of thy power, and workmanſhip of thy hands: Thou knoweſt therefore what is beſt and fitteſt for me; and what can I require elſe from the hands of thee, O my GOD! than thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation out of the dangers of thoſe oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes in life; thy guidance in the middle path of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010899_0005_0F851BE18C44A000"/>
ſafety and innocence, and the enjoyment of thy approbation and favour in my walking therein.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HIS mind was doubtleſs deeply impreſſed with the awfulneſs and eſſential ſubject of his petition; and <hi>the removing far from him vanity and lies,</hi> ſeems to conſtitute a very conſiderable part of it. But too many of us, deviating from this one moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant point, are daily inclined to wander in the broad path of vanity and folly, and prone to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake it for the path of peace; till oftentimes the ſtroke of adverſity, of pain of body, or affliction of mind, convinceth <hi>in part,</hi> and, if unreformed, that of <hi>Death</hi> may <hi>fully</hi> convince us, when too late! of this moſt fatal miſtake.</p>
            <p>THE Prophet ſaw into the propriety of that frame of mind, which utters the language dictated by divine wiſdom: <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. iii. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own underſtanding:</hi> In as much as his gracious ſuperintendency, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful notice of his creatures, is ſuch as even <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. xlv. 22.</note> 
               <hi>taketh in the ends of the earth;</hi> and daily affordeth us the cleareſt manifeſtation of his goodneſs here, as it hath evidently pointed out to us that glorious path which leads to ſafety and eternal peace. But <hi>vanity and lies</hi> have too frequently eſtranged the mind, drawn it off from heavenly objects and heavenly cares, and fixed its attention upon things wholly unworthy the notice of an immortal ſpirit. Under the ſeducing influence of <hi>vanity and lies,</hi> men have been frequently led to purſue many things agreeable to their own wiſhes and imagined intereſts, without the leaſt regard paid to juſtice and equity.</p>

            <p>WERE the lives of men deſigned to be wholly alienated from a ſtate of juſtice and virtue, and entirely inſtructed and fixed in the maxims and manners of this world, ſingly to be taught to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as the chief end of their exiſtence, there would then be ſome excuſe for uſing every ſpecies of art in joining <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. v. 8.</note>

of thee!"</hi> was formerly pronounced to one of this kind by the great judge of all men. Conſider then, it may be thy caſe; and art thou prepared againſt thy dying hour, to render him ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as will then ſupport thee, and juſtify thee in thy claim to the inheritance of his everlaſting kingdom, by thy having faithfully ſought it, and attended to the conditions thereof, preferably to all the deareſt objects of this uncertain, and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtate of exiſtence?</p>
            <p>I AM fully of opinion, many who run after the world with open mouth, and that mouth ſcarce ever cloſed, till death cloſes it; could they be induced to yield ſome of their precious moments to timely and ſerious reflection; would endeavour to withdraw themſelves from tranſitory things, at leaſt before their laſt moments of life; and, in ſome meaſure, prepare (after this manner) to meet their GOD.</p>
            <p>THEY would now and then retire, for a ſhort ſpace at leaſt, from the world, before they entirely left it; frequently ſit down, and ſeriouſly turn their view towards another world, another ſtate of being, into which they can never hope to carry wealth, or honours; toward that approaching dread tribunal of righteouſneſs, where theſe will gain no favour.</p>
            <p>WHEN we take a ſurvey of the world, and look back through the generations that are paſt, we ſee that the love of vanity, wealth and grandeur, hath proved, from time to time, the <hi>ruin</hi> even of the faireſt <hi>empires</hi> and <hi>monarchies,</hi> which have been ever erected on the face of the earth: <hi>One refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> after another, and <hi>one ſtate</hi> after another,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010899_0008_0F851BE3670BBE28"/>
have been deſtroyed, from the <hi>pride and diſſipation</hi> inherent in the minds of <hi>governors</hi> and <hi>teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW ought this conſideration to humble the hearts, and redouble the vigilance of ſuch as are placed in <hi>exalted ſtations!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HOPE and truſt our love, as a people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, hath not been confined peculiarly to ourſelves; but extended, as it ought to be, to all our fellow-creatures; to relieve poverty and diſtreſs, according to our abilities; to prevent and reclaim from the infinite danger and harms of impiety, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage every kind of real virtue.</p>
            <p>THOUGH ſome families may have turned aſide into the ſtate of the world, and become engroſſed with the love of its pleaſures and enjoyments; yet many others, I hope, and believe, have denied themſelves; have <hi>laid hold of the good word of life;</hi> and under its influence, purſued <hi>the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Though ſome have declined, and even refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the ſubjection due to their maker, as if they had aſked with inſolence,
<q>Who is this LORD, that he ſhould reign over our hearts?</q>
and had added,
<q>We know no power equal to that of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wealth, and honours;</q>
—yet others have not departed from the obligations of fear and love; but have made proper reflections, paid juſt reſpect to the great author of their being; and manifeſted it by a ſteady watchfulneſs in conduct, which I moſt earneſtly deſire, may become the happy caſe of every one of my fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>THE preſent ſolemn occaſion is an important leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of inſtruction to us all! The departure of the diſembodied ſoul from this world to another;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010899_0009_0F851BE42A9AFB80"/>
which methinks ſhould entirely prevent our ſetting too great a value upon all temporal poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſometimes been preſent in a dying hour; I have been preſent at a ſcene of humbling diſtreſs; I have ſeen in ſome, the cloſing period of a regular life of virtue; yet ſuch a life, as on account of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward poverty, had been deſpiſed and over looked —a whole life ſpent, in which its happieſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would have paſt for miſerable, in the minds of thouſands: Yet when they have finiſhed their courſe, they have experienced triumphant joy, in the bleſſed hope and aſſurance of eternal life! through the merits of their <hi>dear Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE alſo beheld, on the other hand, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of ſplendour exhibit a mournful ſcene of diſtreſs, far different from the former! Then, when the ſolemn approach of death hath begun to appear, attended with all its tremblings and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſions of an after ſtate! when the ſoul, agonizing in its pains, hath viewed things in a far different light to what it had before done, when even the riches, in which it had long truſted, fell ſhort of giving the leaſt ſatisfaction: No hope of future happineſs afforded to the poſſeſſor! but, on the contrary, a gloomy proſpect of deſpair; of an eternal ſtate of miſery! of this have I been made a ſorrowful witneſs, that ſome have gone out of the world, <note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ. ii. 12.</note> 
               <hi>without God; without hope;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one comfortable reflection from the ſacred ranſom of a <hi>dying Saviour!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN vain have they ardently wiſhed, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring hour, that they might have been permitted to lengthen out their alotment of life a little
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010899_0009_0F851BE42A9AFB80"/>
longer; that they might have but a ſhort ſpace of added time afforded them, for the important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of repentance, and amendment of life; for <hi>feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked,</hi> and <hi>viſiting the ſick;</hi> virtues, to which they had no pretence, in any of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to attain, however neceſſary, for their ſtanding approved at the juſt judgment, to which they were approaching.</p>
            <p>MAY we all therefore learn inſtruction, from examples like theſe; and derive ſuch advantage from this preſent ſolemnity; ſeeking and embracing <hi>the good word of life;</hi> and ever ſtedfaſtly adhering to it, ſo long as we continue in mutability.</p>
            <p>MAY we never withdraw ourſelves from watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention, to the guidance of divine providence; never indulge ourſelves in arrogance, or truſt too much to the rectitude of our own hearts; but <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. v. 17.</note>

<q>Two things have I required of thee, O Lord! deny me them not before I die.</q>
As I am fully ſatisfied it is not, and will not be ſufficient for me, though I ſhould ſtand ever ſo eminently high, on the account of riches, or honours, in the eſteem or applauſe of men;
<q>Remove therefore far from me vanity and lies; giving me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me, <hi>I pray thee,</hi> with food convenient for me, leſt I

               <hi>O that the ſalvation of Iſrael would come out of Sion, then ſhould Jacob rejoice, and Iſrael ſhould be right glad.</hi> This hath been the ſacred language of individuals that have at times been toſt in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, diſtreſſed in vanity, wickedneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment; who, notwithſtanding, have been at laſt happily fixed within the habitation of <hi>the holy city,</hi> or <hi>garden incloſed,</hi> through a ſteady perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſtrong reſiſtance, though in the night ſeaſon; like Jacob, who as a prince, <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxxii. 28.</note>

            <p>THIS hath been the language of minds, in the day of temptation; and when the battle hath been hot, they have known a ſecret hiding place, where the enemy could not prevail.

            <p>INDEED it muſt be confeſt, and I am thoroughly aſſured, that all parents are not thus negligent: I cannot but remember the ineſtimable father I had in early life; and, above all things, his almoſt <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled care and tenderneſs over his infant offspring.</hi> I well remember the <hi>very</hi> powerful and moving eloquence of deſcending tears! when he collected his numerous family of little ones about him, and in the time of our extream tenderneſs, and very early years, how often he hath wept over us, when he hath been recommending us to the throne of grace! though I cannot repeat the immediate language he uttered upon theſe occaſions, which were ſo extreamly intereſting to us all!</p>

that thou may ever continue to guide and direct us! that ſuch a ſenſe of thy unmerited mercies may be to us, as often heretofore it hath been, an enlivening comfort, and a ſtrong ſupport in the day of trouble: And we beſeech thee, O bleſſed Father! to remember all in the like ſituation: Send forth <hi>thy light and thy truth</hi> even amongſt thoſe who have never known, or have long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee. We pray thee, draw them into thy holy houſe; plant them in thine incloſed, for ever beautiful and moſt excellent garden! their hearts becoming hereby powerfully inclined to attend, with a fixed and unlimited ſubmiſſion, to the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſcipline of thine omnipreſent, and unerring wiſdom!</p>
            <p>IF thou ſee any caſt upon the bed of languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do thou be pleaſed, we humbly pray thee, to afford them the viſitation of thy love: Let thy divine conſolation be their continual attendant, whereby they may be indued with perfect reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thy bleſſed will!</p>

               <hi>ſo fight the good fight of faith,</hi> as to lay hold on eternal life! which thou art now, in this the day of thy mercy, freely offering unto all!</p>
