            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>I HAVE frequently thought, and the ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been confirmed from my own ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and experience, that a great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent point would be gained, highly conducive to the advantage of mankind, did they generally, tho' from no ≈øurer guide than tradition, ≈øub≈øcribe with heart and mind, to that certain truth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in holy writ;
<q>"<note n="*" place="bottom">P≈øalm lviii. 11.</note> Verily, there is a reward for the righteous: Verily he is a God, that judgeth in the Earth;"</q>
            </p>
            <p>As ≈øuch a per≈øua≈øion, from whatever ground it ari≈øes, naturally tends to influence the conduct, to avoid evil, and to pur≈øue that which is good; and with regard to many, it hath proved a ≈øtep to their nearer acquaintance with GOD, who is the only ≈øure guide to true happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>INDEED I ≈øcarce think there can be many, if there be any, who are hardy enough to deny the exi≈øtence of the ≈øupreme. Being; but believe, on the contrary, that many, through the divine favour, enlightened to ≈øee their duty, and a≈ø≈øi≈øted to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it; do, in con≈øequence of the≈øe favours, contemplate, with ≈øatisfaction inexpre≈ø≈øible, the≈øe attributes of the mo≈øt high GOD, here mentioned by the P≈øalmi≈øt: And could I be induced to think,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010899_0003_0F851BDFFA84CDF0"/>
that any part of mankind had ≈øwerved from their duty, for want of a firm conviction of tho≈øe his attributes, as relative to his creatures; and of the certainty, that there is really a GOD who judgeth the earth: I ≈øay, could I believe their minds were de≈øtitute of this animating and enlivening pro≈øpect of his power, omni≈øcience, and goodne≈øs, in his ≈øuperintendant care, and pre≈øent judging the earth, I ≈øhould deem ≈øuch but a very little removed, if any, from the ≈øtate of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> upon who≈øe altars the holy apo≈øtle di≈øcovered an in≈øcription,
<q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 23.</note> "To the unknown God."</q>
Indeed a language that was ≈øpoken formerly, hath been too much adopted by ≈øucceeding generations; numbers of whom have been like tho≈øe men of Jeru≈øalem, who ≈øaid, <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Zeh. i. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</hi> Many (≈øeduced by the grand deceiver and his agents) have endeavoured to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrange and withdraw them≈øelves from the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the whole earth: They have hence grown dark in their imaginations, and in like manner thus rea≈øoned with them≈øelves, <q>He will do us no good, why therefore ≈øhould we ≈øeek him? He will do us no harm, why ≈øhould we fear him?</q> This we may ju≈øtly look upon as the mo≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ≈øeduction of mind! as it mi≈øleads to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt di≈øtance (without timely recovery) from that ≈øtate of obedience, in which we are only capable of happine≈øs, through the favourable notice of our father who is in heaven.</p>
            <p>BUT we may ju≈øtly conclude, that ≈øuch impiety pa≈øt not the attention of an
all-≈øeeing GOD, in as much as he replied,
<q>I will puni≈øh tho≈øe men of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010899_0003_0F851BDFFA84CDF0"/>
Jeru≈øalem, who have ≈øaid, The Lord doth us no good, why ≈øhould we ≈øeek him? He will not do us any harm, why ≈øhould we fear him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE certainty of his ≈øuperintendency, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be the happine≈øs of all the wi≈øe and good in all ages; and it is the≈øe, and only the≈øe, that di≈øcern wherein true happine≈øs con≈øi≈øts. Hence hath it become, and ≈øtill remains, an e≈øtabli≈øhed glorious truth, accompanied with, and confirmed by, the voice of all generations.</p>
            <p>UNDER this head in particular, a Petition or Prayer that was put up to him who hath created the earth, and a≈ø≈øigned a reward to the righteous, by <hi>Agur,</hi> the ≈øon of <hi>Jaketh,</hi> hath appeared to my mind, as nece≈ø≈øary at this day to be adopted by every individual, who is de≈øirous of living to the be≈øt, wi≈øe≈øt, and happie≈øt purpo≈øe of life; without which they had better never have lived: And I cannot but recommend it mo≈øt particularly to <hi>You,</hi> the ri≈øing generation, who≈øe minds I tru≈øt are at times ≈øu≈øceptible of proper impre≈ø≈øions, who are not become ≈ølaves to the vanity and lu≈øts of the world: And indeed it ≈øeems like the language of one that is entring upon the ≈øtage of life: <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxx. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I die! Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me; le≈øt I be full and deny thee, and ≈øay, Who is the Lord? Or le≈øt I be poor, and ≈øteal, and take the name of my God in vain!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ≈øub≈øtance of this memorable requi≈øition hath appeared to my mind, during the cour≈øe of a long ≈øeries of ob≈øervations of men, and times, with
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010899_0004_0F851BE0AF4BC1F0"/>
regard to its import in point of religion, virtue, the love and peace of GOD; as including indeed, all that is good and nece≈ø≈øary for our ≈øafe conduct and ≈øupport through this life, to that completion of happine≈øs, propo≈øed as the final reward of the righteous.</p>
            <p>BUT how will ≈øome be able to prefer a petition to a power in whom, alas! they have no tru≈øt? Who would gladly be po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of, and are much better plea≈øed with, ≈øharing a crown of wicked pro≈øperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this world, than with the pro≈øpect of a crown of pure and perfect felicity, in a ≈øtate of endle≈øs futurity.</p>
            <p>O THAT parents would timely and vigilantly exert them≈øelves to rai≈øe early impre≈ø≈øions in the tender minds of their children, in order to fix deeply the chri≈øtian doctrine, with all its glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous con≈øequences; firmly per≈øuading and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, that they are under the immediate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that Being, who is ever un≈øpeakably good and gracious; and informing them, that he is cloathed with every awful, reverential attribute; as being perfectly wi≈øe, powerful and good, yet ≈øtrictly ju≈øt; that he is the maker of us all; and that he delights to be called upon by us, with the tender and endearing appellation of, "Our father, who art in heaven."</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, under the deep and reverent ≈øen≈øe of the certainty of his continual pre≈øence and providence, let us be ever careful, ever earne≈øtly de≈øirous to con≈øtitute a part of his children and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in this our probationary ≈øtate; that as we, by our rank in the creation, belong to the order of ≈øpirits, we may a≈ø≈øuredly hope to join the cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010899_0004_0F851BE0AF4BC1F0"/>
and ≈øeraphim, in the habitations of glory and peace, by our now becoming members of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant church; and may, when our warfare ≈øhall be accompli≈øhed, unite with the chorus of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant ho≈øts, in the language and tribute of grateful adoration and prai≈øe.</p>
            <p>AND indeed without this ble≈ø≈øed hope, we are of all creatures the mo≈øt
mi≈øerable! being daily ≈øurrounded with lamentation and woe! combating with ≈øecret or obvious di≈øtre≈ø≈øes! and encountring, from the cradle to the grave, a perpetual ≈øucce≈ø≈øion and variety of afflictions! we might therefore tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øay, if our hopes were only fixed upon the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitory and fleeting plea≈øures of this life, we ≈øhould be, of all the animal creation, the mo≈øt mi≈øerable! But we are a≈ø≈øured, that nothing le≈øs than GOD him≈øelf, is the infinite and endle≈øs reward of all that diligently and con≈øtantly ≈øolicit him to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing purpo≈øe.‚Äî<hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die; remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me, le≈øt I be full, and deny thee, and ≈øay, who is the Lord? Or lo≈øt I be poor, and ≈øteal, and take the name of my God in vain!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHICH is as if the Prophet had ≈øaid,
<q>Thou art my father, the author of my being; I made nothing my≈øelf, but am wholly and entirely the offspring of thy power, and workman≈øhip of thy hands: Thou knowe≈øt therefore what is be≈øt and fitte≈øt for me; and what can I require el≈øe from the hands of thee, O my GOD! than thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation out of the dangers of tho≈øe oppo≈øite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes in life; thy guidance in the middle path of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010899_0005_0F851BE18C44A000"/>
≈øafety and innocence, and the enjoyment of thy approbation and favour in my walking therein.</q>

            <p>I AM fully of opinion, many who run after the world with open mouth, and that mouth ≈øcarce ever clo≈øed, till death clo≈øes it; could they be induced to yield ≈øome of their precious moments to timely and ≈øerious reflection; would endeavour to withdraw them≈øelves from tran≈øitory things, at lea≈øt before their la≈øt moments of life; and, in ≈øome mea≈øure, prepare (after this manner) to meet their GOD.</p>

            <p>THOUGH ≈øome families may have turned a≈øide into the ≈øtate of the world, and become engro≈ø≈øed with the love of its plea≈øures and enjoyments; yet many others, I hope, and believe, have denied them≈øelves; have <hi>laid hold of the good word of life;</hi> and under its influence, pur≈øued <hi>the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Though ≈øome have declined, and even refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, the ≈øubjection due to their maker, as if they had a≈øked with in≈øolence,
