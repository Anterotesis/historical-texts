            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN the Author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Tract firſt took up his pen on the subject, he had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of going into it ſo fully: but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewn the outline of his plan to a very judicious Friend, and receiver his approbation of it, he was induced to conſider the matter in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive point of view.</p>
            <p>Conſcious that what he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed is dicatated by no other motive, than an earneſt desire to promote the public welfare; he is not deterred, by the fear of incurring the impuitation
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:017091_0004_0F9FC2DEC460E538"/>
of vanity, from offering his ſentiments to the world, on a ſubject of ſuch importance: He conceives it to be the duty of every citizen, to uſe his <hi>beſt endeavours</hi> to advance the proſperity of his country.</p>
            <p>Many valuable inſtitutions have been planned by private perſons; and there can be no reaſon why their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſhould be diſregarded, if they ſugeſt any uſeful obſervations.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c</head>
            <p>IN the early ages of the world, when little communication ſubſiſted between different countries; when the wants of men were confines to their <hi>neceſſities</hi>, and thoſe neceſſities eaſI;y ſupplied with their own hands, by paſturage and the chace, barter readily anſwered all the purpoſes of money; and this is ſtill the caſe amongſt barbarous and uncivilized nations.</p>
            <p>But when mankind became more poliſhed, the <hi>conveniencies</hi> of life, and at length it's luxuries, were ſought for; and theſe artificial wants the inhabitants of various climes</p>
            <p>Barter became now inconvenience, as the commodities, offered on each ſide for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, did not often ſuit the wants of both the parties.</p>
            <p>This occaſioned the neceſſity of making uſe of ſome ſubſtances,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>"Money is an univerſal medium, or common ſtandard, by a compariſon with which the value of all merchandize may be aſcertained; or it is a <hi>ſign</hi> which repreſents the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective values of all commodities."</p>

univerſal ſcarcity, and certain inherent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of purity, poſſeſſed the greateſt intrinſic value, to <hi>repreſent the real riches</hi> of every country.</p>
            <p>Hence gold and ſilver were fixed on, as an univerſal medium of commerce: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one of theſe metals is much more precious than the other, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their comparative values was aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and that difference made the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard proportion between the two.</p>
            <p>The nature of trade is ſuch, that, in it, money made of theſe ſubſtances is not eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated at a higher rate than it's <hi>intrinſic</hi> value, which is founded in the rate or value according to which it is uſed to paſs; ſo that, in the courſe of trade, <hi>money</hi> can have no higher value than a maſs of the ſame metal and quantity would have, if given in barter for any kind of goods: but yet, in different places, on certain preſſing occaſions, the <hi>extrinſical</hi> value of money may be raiſed higher, at the diſcretion of the ſupreme power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>real</hi> riches<note n="*" place="bottom">"Silver and gold, which only <hi>repreſent</hi> more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial riches, are of a fluctuating nature. It is not eaſy, it ſeems even impoſſible, to trace their various motions, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine when they are in greateſt plenty upon the whole: The moſt ſubſtantial riches are more viſible."—Character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtics of the preſent political ſtate of Great-Britain.</note> of a country conſiſt in

it's trade, it's produce, and the labour of it's inhabitants; gold and ſilver being no otherwiſe riches, than by <hi>repreſenting</hi> them; except as articles of merchandize: for if a fertile country, abounding with all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries<note n="*" place="bottom">"The moſt <hi>ſubſtantial riches</hi> conſiſt in the abundance of thoſe things which are neceſſary for the ſupport and comfort of life."—Characteristics, &amp;c.</note> of life and induſtrious inhabitants, ſhould, at any one point of time, loſe all it's caſh, it would be comparatively very little poorer; although totally deprived of that which is generally thought to conſtitute wealth, and which bears a very ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the cattle, grain, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the country.</p>
            <p>It may be laid down, therefore, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible poſition, that<note n="†" place="bottom">"We may conclude with certainty, that the wealth of any country is increaſed, when the number of the people has increaſed; when the fields and gardens are better culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and produce better kinds, and a greater quantity of fruits; when the country breeds more numerous ſtores, and better kinds, of cattle, when the houſes are more magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and more richly furniſhed; when the people are better cloather, and their tables are more elegant; when their ware-houſed are filled with a more valuable quantity of goods; when the prices of their lands, and moſt other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, are raiſed; when their manufacturers are increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when their commerce is more widely extended; and there is greater induſtry, than was known in former times. If all theſe ſymptoms, or ſuch of them as are moſt material, concur, the nation muſt certainly ne increaſing in riches. In ſuch circumſtances, the ſtate of the <hi>coin</hi> is but of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A Nation, which, during any particular period, has loſt a million of its ſilver and gold, but <hi>improved its lands</hi>, and acquired valuable commodities to the extent of ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, muſt be in a better condition at the end of that period, than it was <hi>at the</hi> beginning of it." Characteristics, &amp;c.</note> that country is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017091_0008_0F9FC2E425A924D0"/>
the richest, which has the largeſt extent of improveable land, contains the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of;aborious inhabitants, and where the moſt commodities are produced for foreign markets and their own conſumption. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and induſtry are the <hi>principal means</hi> of acquiring riches; and a fruitfull ſoil is an inexhauſtible mine of wealth to thoſe who will aſſiduouſly cultivate it.</p>
            <p>Here the obſervation will occurm, that North-America enjoys, in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, thoſe <hi>real riches</hi>, which, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and unfettered foreign trade, will ever yield to her a proportionable quantity of <hi>gold and ſilver</hi>: And as the <hi>means</hi> of procuring theſe will, from the nature and peculiar advantages of this country, greatly and rapidly increaſe here, the <hi>actual acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of them will increaſe in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017091_0009_0F9FC2E4B72E9640"/>
The additional ſupplies of <hi>money</hi>, obtained from time to time, and which <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents</hi> the induſtry and labour by which it was procured, will operate, in a acompound ratio, in promoting continued acceſſions of it to the inhabitants: and thus induſtry and money would mutually produce each other, to a <note n="*" place="bottom">"There <hi>may be</hi> too much money in a nation. /and there is certainly too much, if it renders the great body of the people idle, and enables them to purchaſe what they want from foreigners, without any labour or induſtry of their own. This was the caſe in Spain, teo or three hundred years ago; and did great harm to that country. But it will ſcarce be poſſible to procure ſo much money by trade alone." Characteristics, &amp;c.</note> certain limit.</p>
            <p>But, as the prices of the commodities of any country, taken <hi>all together</hi>, muſt be determined by the quantity of money in it; at the ſame time, (though different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may vary the prices of <hi>particular</hi> articles) if that ſtock of commodities be increaſed by the <hi>induſtry</hi> of it's inhabitants, a larger quantity of <hi>money</hi> will be requiſite to repreſent the increaſed value of this real wealth. The <hi>products</hi> of that induſtry of the people would, without doubt, add to the riches of the country, by procuring, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for them, ſuch commodities as might be wanted for their oen conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017091_0010_0F9FC2E576490C88"/>
But as the demand for theſe might, at firſt, nearly equal, if not totally, the amount of their exports, little or no gold and ſilver could be imported.</p>
            <p>In order, therefore, that ſuch <hi>extra</hi> quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of commodities may be produced for exportation, as to procure, in return, the neceſſary ſupplies, together with the <hi>balance</hi> in gold or ſilver, the induſtry of the people muſt be <hi>quickened</hi>.</p>
            <p>To effect this, an increaſed quantity of money, of <hi>ſome kind</hi>, is neceſſary: for, as the labour and induſtry of a people conſtitute an eſſentail part of the <hi>real</hi> wealth of a country, the <hi>ſign</hi> of that wealth ought to bear a certain proportion to it.</p>
            <p>But, as the acquiſition of the money, <hi>properly</hi> ſo termed, required to <hi>accelerate</hi> the induſtry of the people, ſo as to promote the introduction of gold and ſilver into a country, muſt, neceſſarily, be ſubſequent to the <hi>means</hi> of obtaining it, the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſubſtituting ſomething in the <hi>ſtead</hi>

                  <p>"When a ſpirit of induſtry is one raiſed, it may require a larger circulation of ſpecie to ſupport it, than the gold or ſilver in the country can ſupply: in this caſe there is an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity</hi> for paper credit."

Perhaps the principle, that aſcertains the extent of theſe limits, is, that no further ſums ſhould be borrowed by a government, than they would be able, without difficulty, to redeem, in a certain ſpace of time: or, in other words, that no larger a portion of the national wealth ſhould be <hi>anticipated</hi>, than it might be reaſonably expected the people could have it in their power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, againſt a certain day. It may, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be ſafely affirmed that paper-credit, under this reſtraction, muſt prove a great advantage to a country.</p>
            <p>The paper bills of credit emitted by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, in purſuance of their reſolution of the 18th of March, 1780, ſtand upon that foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preciſely. They are conſidered as the anticipated product of the taxes of ſix years,

                  <g ref="char:startq">“</g>I hope what I have wrote on this head will ſerve to gratify curioſity, the only point I had in view; for the ſubject does not appear to me of much importance to the public in general, whoſe principal concern is, that the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>intereſt</hi> of the money bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of them is <hi>regular</hi>, and at the <g ref="char:endq">”</g>ſame time well ſecured.</q>

Paper-credit has hitherto maintainmed it's ground.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid it is evident, that paper-credit is eſſentially neceſſary in North-America, as well to anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of commerce as thoſe of government; and that no country is better furniſhed with the means of ſupporting it.

Characteristics, &amp;c.</note> with ſpecie. Diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and deſigning men will, without doubt, endeavour to depreciate it; and, when already done, to prevent it's appreciation: but their arts will prove ineffectual, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaſures be taken ro prevent and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract them. Before the preſent war, paper was emitted in ſeveral parts of this conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nent, which, owing to the caution of the Legiſlatures, paſſed equal to gold and ſilver, nothwithſtanding the diſtant periods fixed for it's redemption.

And circumſpection muſt be obſerved by our public councils, as may tent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the people that confidence in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, which has been impaired leſs by it's own miſconduct, than by the artifices of it's enemies.</p>
            <p>Independently of the advantages to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it is the intereſt of the people to ſupport the credit of a paper-currency: it's depreciation is a grievous and unequal tax; affecting every man through whoſe hands the money paſſes, but falling the heavieſt upon the meritorious and thoſe leaſt able to bear it. Indeed it is much to be lamented, that the people ſhould have ſo greatly devi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ated from their true intereſts, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as it has occaſioned much public and private miſchief. But there is ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity in mankind to conſult their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate convenience, although to the prejudice of their ultimate good.</p>
            <p>The depreciation of the paper-currency was, doubtleſs, firſt cauſed by an erroneous policy in Congreſs; but the evil might have been remedied, long before this time, had it not been for the co-operation of other cauſes, the machinations of the diſaffected, and a miſtaken notion, adopted by a great part of

The well-affected, that depreciation ſerved to promote their intereſts. This gave riſe to a ſpirit of ſpeculation, by which every man endeavoured to advance his own fortune, at the expence of the community: and the odious and unmeaning diſtinctions of <note n="*" place="bottom">"It is a moſt certain fact, though not ſufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, that the landed gentleman is more deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the national effects of an advantageous or a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous commerce, than the merchant himſelf.

            <p>Having premiſed thus much, concerning the nature, uſe and advantage, of paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, the next conſideration is, what means are the moſt proper to be uſed, for it's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.

to be at liberty to reimburſe himſelf, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he might have occaſion for the capital, transfer-books to be opened at the bank, once a week, for transferring and accepting (or, in other words, for buying and ſelling) ſtock.</p>

            <p>As the general council of the bank would meet annually, and the comptrollers every ſix months, to examine into the ſtate of it's funds and the diſpoſition thereof, and to ſettle and adjuſt the accounts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, it would be neceſſary to <note n="*" place="bottom">"The bank of Amſterdam is ſhut up twice a year, in January or February, and in July or Auguſt, and continues ſhut eight, ten, or fifteen days; during which time the books of accompt are adjuſted.

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:017091_0030_0F9FC300A99629F8"/>Let a <hi>mint</hi> be eſtabliſhed, under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Congreſs, where all bullion and plate depoſited at the bank, that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come forfeited thereto, ſhould be <hi>coined</hi>, agreeable to the ſterling ſtandard; and after making the neceſſary deduction, for defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expence of the coinage, (which ſhould be fixed) and for too great alloy, the reſidue to be paid into the bank.</p>
            <p>The charges of all <hi>other</hi> bullion and plate, coined at the mint, to be borne by the bank; ſo that every perſon bringing bullion or plate to be coined, ſhall receive an equal weight in coin, deducting only for baſe alloy. For in proportion as the circulating medium of ſpecie is increaſed, will the demand for it, at the bank, be leſſened; and, conſequently, the company will be enabled to employ a greater part of their capital, for their joint emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is evident, that as much <hi>leſs</hi> than five <hi>per cent</hi>, as the bank pays for coinage, <hi>ſo</hi> much will they be gainers thereby, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of other advantages.</p>
            <p>Here ariſes an obſervation worth our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; which is, that melting down the current ſpecie of the country, for plate, is extremely injurious, by diminiſhing the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating medium. A certain quantity of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017091_0031_0F9FC301470EA400"/>
gold and ſilver are neceſſary for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but, when wrought into plate, they ceaſe to be a medium of commerce, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a dead, unprofitable maſs of wealth, in the hands of the poſſeſſor. Hence, in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, the melting down any current ſilver money is an offence againſt the laws; and the ſpecies, <hi>coined in England</hi>, are eſteemed as contraband goods, and not to be export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>td.—<hi>Foreign</hi> coin being conſidered only as having flowed into the kingdom by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate tide of commerce, which, by it's ebb, might carry out the ſame, to reſtore the balance of trade, (a kind of fluctuation not at all uncommon, in an extenſive traffic) it is not ſubject to the ſame regulations: for ſhould an unfavourable balance carry off the whole of it, their own coin remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind would, probably, be adequate to the purpoſes of their domeſtic trade, and the ſupport of their paper-credit;—whereas the greateſt part of what is wrought up, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the kingdom; and, though it does not increaſe the circulating ſpecie, adds wealth to the proprietors, and affords taxes to government.</p>
            <p>It is not intended to examine into the policy of the duties upon <hi>plate</hi>, which are
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017091_0032_0F9FC3028B6C8F80"/>
payable in England: the object of them is, no doubt, the prohibition of it, in ſome degree; ſo as to induce people to carry their gold and ſilver to the mint. The plan here propoſed is calculated to obviate, in a great meaſure, the <note n="*" place="bottom">"The great quantities of plate that are ſaid to be in France, in the Churches and private houſes, cannot be of any advantage in trade. What neither circulates, nor is a <hi>fund of credit</hi>, can have no influence in commerce. The French would carry on a much greater trade, if all this plate were circulating. The Britiſh, too, could carry on a much greater trade, if every man poſſeſſed of plate would either employ it in trade, or lend it to ſuch as would: in this reſpect the Engliſh and Dutch, who encourage ſervices of China and other earthen ware, inſtead of ſervices of plate, act more in the true ſpirit of trade than the Genoeſe." Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics, &amp;c.</note> diſadvantages ariſing from large quantities of plate; by enabling every perſon, poſſeſſed of uncoined gold or ſilver, to make uſe of it, <hi>indirectly</hi>, as a circulating medium.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be made a fundamental article in the conſtitution of the bank, that it ſhould not trade, nor ſuffer any perſon in truſt for it to trade, with any of the effects of the corporation, in the buying or ſelling any forts of merchandize; except in the manner before mentioned, and in buying or ſelling bullion, gold or ſilver.</p>
            <p>The bank ſhould likewiſe be prohibited
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017091_0033_0F9FC302D4D18378"/>
from advancing any monies to government, for a longer term than one year; and on no other ſecurity than the ſupplies to be raiſed within the year, previouſly mortgaged to the company.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper here to obſerve, that, as the United States of America form <hi>one grand, intire Republic</hi>, compoſed of a number of ſmall ones, confederated for their common ſafety and advantage, and diſtinct only for their greater conveniency, with reſpect to legiſlation and internal police, the ſupreme ſovereign authority of the whole ought, moſt undoubtedly, to be lodged in Congreſs; and they ſhuld poſſeſs ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and privileges, not incompatible with the happineſs of a free people, as uſually appertain to ſovereignty, in order to enable them to conduct and direct the common concerns of the United States, upon uniform principles, ſo as to afford equal advantages to each, and give energy to the whole.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground, the propriety of veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Congreſs the ſole and excluſive right of emitting paper bills of credit, and coining money, for the uſe of the republic, they repreſent is evident: and unleſs this be done, it will be extremely difficult, if not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017091_0034_0F9FC30381F8A768"/>
for any man or body of men, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and manage the finances of this country.</p>
            <p>But if Congreſs has the right of emitting paper upon credit, that body ſhould, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, have in their own hands the means of ſupporting that credit. They ought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to have the privilege, as part of their prerogative, to regulate the commerce of the United States, by the impoſition of all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon imports; to lay a general land-tax, and to have the direction of the poſt-office.</p>
            <p>The two firſt of theſe ſources of revenue are common to all the ſtates; and are of ſuch a nature, that, if the duties and taxes ariſing from them are laid generally, <hi>ad valorem</hi>, they will be productive in the ſeveral ſtates, in proportion to their reſpective funds of wealth, and will operate in ſuch a manner as to preſerve a juſt <hi>equilibrium</hi>, between the intereſts of all.</p>
            <p>The poſt-office department is, in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, connected with every ſtate, and extends through all.</p>
            <p>It appears moſt proper, therefore, that the revenues accruing from this, and from the two firſt mentioned objects of taxation, ſhould be ſubject to the appropriation of Congreſs: by which means, this important
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017091_0035_0F9FC3044BC59C60"/>
Aſſembly would not be left with the mere ſhadow of ſovereign authority, without the right of controuling any ſtate, of exacting obedience to their ordinances, and deſtitute of the means of executing their reſolves.</p>
            <p>The authority of Congreſs, at preſent, is very inadequate to the performance of their duties; and this indicates the neceſſity of their calling a Continental Convention, for the expreſs purpoſe of aſcertaining, defining, enlarging and limiting, the duties and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It has been the endeavour of the Writer, in forming the foregoing plan, to make it coincide, as far as poſſible, with the meaſures already adopted by Congreſs. The propoſal for erecting a national bank is dictated by a conviction of the <hi>neceſſity</hi> there is to eſtabliſh ſome medium of paper-credit, that ſhall be unconfined to any particular ſtate. By the ſcheme here propoſed, the bank is to be under the patronage of the United States, and, by it's conſtitution, it would certainly be the intereſt of government, as well as of individuals, to protect and ſupport it. On this account, all the revenues laſt mentioned, as belonging to the Confederated Republic, ſhould be payable into the bank: as the <hi>exchequer</hi> or national treaſury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:017091_0036_0F9FC3058E63B358"/>Violent prejudices have been conceived againſt banks, not only by the ignorant, but by ſome ingenious and learned men. They will, however, appear upon examination to be, for the moſt part, ill founded. The moſt material objection, that has been raiſed againſt banks, is, that ſo great a <hi>run</hi> may be made upon them, that they may not be able to anſwer their notes: but there is little danger of this happening, if the proper cautions be uſed:—beſides, that this will be leſs likely to be the caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> America, than any where elſe, from the vaſt extent of the country, and the great diſtances to which a very conſiderable part of theſe notes will be diſperſed.</p>
            <p>The numerous and important advantages that would reſult to this country, from an inſtitution of this kind, muſt be obvious to every one. Exclusive of thoſe already taken notice of, the bank-notes, always commanding ſpecie, would circulate freely through all the United States: and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants could make their remittances, from one ſtate to another, with great ſafety and convenience, by ſuch a medium. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would derive ſimilar benefits from ſo general a currency; as theſe notes, from
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017091_0037_0F9FC305B4908EE8"/>
their extenſive circulation, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well calculated for paying armies, compoſed of troops from different ſtates, and ſtationary in none.</p>
            <p>National banks have been eſtabliſhed in many parts of Europe; and the advantages accruing from them to <note n="*" place="bottom">"We ſee that nations have proſpered by ſetting up banks. This is true of Holland, of Genoa, and of other places; and it will be found to be true both of England and of Scotland." Characteriſtics, &amp;c.</note> trade ſeem, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, to have pointed out the neceſſity of them, in great commercial countries.</p>
            <p>England erected her bank in the reign of King William the Third, whilſt engaged in a moſt expenſive war; and when it was not expedient to draw from the people ſuch annual ſums, in taxes, as were requiſite to defray the expenditures of the year:—it therefore became neceſſary, in order to enable them to proſecute the war with vigour and effect, to <hi>anticipate</hi> the revenues of their ſucceſſors, by <hi>borrowing</hi> ſuch ſums as were wanted to anſwer the current exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies; only providing for the payment of the intereſt, and leaving poſterity to diſcharge the principal.</p>
            <p>The bad policy of Britain has been in multiplying their paper, almoſt without any
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017091_0038_0F9FC30779E768F8"/>
limitation; thereby creating an amazing quantity of <hi>imaginary</hi> wealth, unſupported by a neceſſary proportion of real; the nation having long ſince, abandoned the hope of being ever able to pay off their debt.</p>
            <p>To conclude—From a thorough inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this ſubject, it will appear, that ſimilar cauſes to thoſe, which, in the reign of William the Third, occaſioned the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of erecting the bank .of England, now exiſt in this country. That bank, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it's impaired foundation, has ſtood a long time; and, hitherto, added ſtrength to the kingdom: but the plan here exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the eſtabliſhment of an American Bank, is formed on ſuch principles, as muſt place it on a ſecure and permanent baſis.</p>
