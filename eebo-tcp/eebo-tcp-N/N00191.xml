            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT having been presented and recommended unto this Court by the Commissioners of the united Colonies at their late Session at <hi>Hartford</hi> in <hi>September</hi> last, that the said Colonies might agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to prostrate themselves joyntly before God for the obteining of the Lords gratious expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion of himself unto, and continuance with us, as in the following Particulars by them is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That we may be suitably affected with, and humbled under all the many tokens of his great anger kindled against us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he will freely pardon all our manifold provocations, be reconciled to us, and heal our Land.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That as he was present with the blessed Generation of his pretious ones, the Leaders of his people into, and in this Wilderness, and did hear them when in their distresses they cried unto him: So he will still please to dwell in the middest of us, and not forsake us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he will not take away his holy Gospel, and if it be his good will, yet to continue our liberties Civil and Ecclesiastical to us, and to our Children after us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That a Spirit of Conversion may be poured out upon our Children, that they may give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Seed after them to be the Lords, willingly subjecting themselves to all his holy Rules and Government in his house.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That in our now low Estate (in very many respects obvious to all serious Spirits, whose eyes are open) his tender mercies may speedily prevent us.</p>
            <p>This Court having a sense of the necessity of that duty of Humiliation and that they may joyn with the Neighbour Churches of the several Colonies to pour forth strong and unanimous cries unto God for the obteining of his Grace and Favour, accordingly trusting in his mercy, that in the things which we are agreed to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </gap> according to his will, he will gratiously hear, and be propitious to his Servants; Do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly appoint <hi>Thursday,</hi> the one and twentieth day of <hi>November</hi> next, being the day agreed upon to be solemnly kept as a day of Fasting and Prayer in all the Churches and Congregations throughout this Jurisdiction, strictly Inhibiting all servile labour by any of the Inhabitants of the Colony on that day.</p>
