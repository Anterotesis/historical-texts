            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Two are better than One, becauſe they have a good Reward for their Labour. For if they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow: But woe be to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if Two lie together, then they have Heat; but how can one be warm alone? And if One prevail againſt him, Two ſhall withſtand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</p>

            <p>AMong the many Reaſons aſſignable for the ſad Decay of <hi>True Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> perhaps the neglecting to <hi>aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ourſelves together,</hi> in <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> may not be one of the leaſt. That I may therefore do my Endeavour towards promoting ſo excellent a Means of Piety,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004648_0003_100D86711E67DBF8"/>
I have ſelected a Paſſage of Scripture drawn from the Experience of the wiſeſt of Men, which being a little enlarged on and illuſtrated, will fully anſwer my preſent Deſign; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew, in the beſt Manner I can, the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Society</hi> in general, and of <hi>Religious Society</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> &amp;c,</p>
            <p>From which Words I ſhall take Occaſion to prove,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Truth of the Wiſe Man's Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz. Two are better than One,</hi> and that in Reference to <hi>Society</hi> in general, and <hi>Religious Society</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To aſſign ſome Reaſons why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> eſpecially as to the laſt Particular. 1. Becauſe Men can raiſe up one another when they chance to ſlip: <hi>For if they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</hi> 2. Becauſe they can impart Heat to each other: <hi>Again, if Two lie together, then they have Heat; but how can One be warm alone?</hi> 3. Becauſe they can ſecure each other from thoſe that do oppoſe them: <hi>And if One prevail againſt him, Two ſhall withſtand him; and a threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</hi> From hence,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall take Occaſion to ſhew the Duty incumbent on every Member of a <hi>Religious Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> I ſhall draw an Inference or two from what ſhall have been ſaid; and then conclude with a Word or two of Exhortation from the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004648_0003_100D86711E67DBF8"/>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, I am to prove the Truth of the Wiſe Man's Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> and that in Reference to <hi>Society</hi> in general, and <hi>Religious Societies</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>And how can this be done better than by ſhewing that it is abſolutely neceſſary for the Welfare both of the Bodies and Souls of Men? Indeed, if we look upon Man as he came out of the Hands of his Maker, we imagine him to be <hi>perfect, entire, lacking nothing.</hi> But GOD, whoſe <hi>Thoughts are not as our Thoughts,</hi> ſaw ſomething ſtill wanting to make <hi>Adam</hi> happy. And what was that? Why, an Help meet for him. For thus ſpeaketh the Scripture: <hi>And the</hi> LORD GOD <hi>ſaid, It is not good that the Man ſhould be alone, I will make an Help meet for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve, GOD ſaid, <hi>It is not good,</hi> thereby implying that the Creation would have been imperfect, <hi>in ſome ſort,</hi> unleſs an <hi>Help</hi> was found out <hi>meet for Adam.</hi> And if this was the Caſe of Man before the Fall; if an <hi>Help</hi> was <hi>meet</hi> for him in a State of Perfection ſurely ſince the Fall, when we come naked and helpleſs out of our Mother's Womb, when our Wants increaſe with our Years, and we can ſcarcely ſubſiſt a Day without the mutual Aſſiſtance of each other, well may we ſay, <hi>It is not good for Man to be alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Society then, we ſee, is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in reſpect to our <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>perſonal</hi> Wants. If we carry our View farther, and conſider Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as divided into different Cities, Countries, and Nations, the Neceſſity of it will appear yet
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004648_0004_100DB68A764860A8"/>
more evident. For how can Communities be kept up, or Commerce carried on, without <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety?</hi> Certainly not at all, ſince Providence ſeems wiſely to have aſſigned a particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to almoſt each particular Country, on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as it were, to oblige us to be ſocial; and hath ſo admirably mingled the Parts of the whole Body of Mankind together, <hi>that the Eye cannot ſay to the Hand, I have no Need of thee, nor again, the Hand to the Foot, I have no Need of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many other Inſtances might be given of the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Society,</hi> in Reference to our <hi>bodily, perſonal,</hi> and <hi>national</hi> Wants. But what are all theſe when <hi>weighed in the Ballance of the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary,</hi> in Compariſon of the infinite greater Need of it, with reſpect to the <hi>Soul?</hi> It was chiefly in regard to this better Part, no doubt, that GOD ſaid, <hi>It is not good for the Man to be alone.</hi> For, let us ſuppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> to be as happy as may be, placed as the Lord of the Creation in the <hi>Paradiſe of</hi> GOD, and ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Hours in adoring and praiſing the bleſſed Author of his Being; yet as his Soul was the very Copy of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> whoſe peculiar Property it is to be communicative, <hi>without the Divine All-ſufficiency,</hi> he could not be compleatly happy, becauſe he was alone and incommunicative, nor even content in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> for want of a <hi>Partner</hi> in his Joys, GOD knew this, and therefore ſaid, <hi>It is not good that the Man ſhould be alone, I will make a Help meet for him.</hi> And tho' this proved a fatal Means of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004648_0004_100DB68A764860A8"/>
his falling; yet that was not owing to any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſequence of <hi>Society</hi>; but partly to that curſed Apoſtate, who <hi>craftily lies in wait to deceive</hi>; partly to <hi>Adam</hi>'s own Folly, in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſing to be miſerable with one he loved, than truſt in GOD to raiſe him up another Spouſe.</p>
            <p>If we reflect indeed on that familiar Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe our firſt Parents could carry on with Heaven, in a State of Innocence, we ſhall be apt to think he had as little Need of <hi>Society,</hi> as to his <hi>Soul,</hi> as before we ſuppoſed him to have, in reſpect to his Body. But yet, as GOD and the Holy Angels were ſo far above him on the one Hand, and the Beaſts ſo far beneath him on the other, there was nothing like having one to to converſe with, who was <hi>Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of his Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man, then, could not be fully happy, we ſee even in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> without a Companion of his own Species, much leſs now he is driven out. For, let us view him a little in his natural Eſtate now, ſince the Fall, as <hi>having his Underſtanding darkened, his Mind alienated from the Life of</hi> GOD; as no more able to ſee his Way wherein he ſhould go, than a blind Man to deſcribe the Sun: That notwithſtanding this, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Sight e'er he can ſee GOD: And that if he never ſees him, he never can be happy. Let us view him, I ſay, in this Light (or rather this Darkneſs) and deny the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Society</hi> if we can. A Divine Revelation we find is abſolutely neceſſary, we being by Nature as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004648_0005_100DB68C041228F8"/>
to do our Duty. And how ſhall we learn except one teach us? But was GOD to do this himſelf, how ſhould we, with <hi>Moſes,</hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly quake and fear? Nor would the Miniſtry of Angels in this Affair be without too much Terror. It is neceſſary, therefore (at leaſt GOD's Dealing with us hath ſhewed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be ſo) that we be <hi>drawn with the Cords of a Man.</hi> And that a Divine Revelation being granted, we ſhould uſe one another's Aſſiſtance, under GOD, to inſtruct each other in the Knowledge, and to exhort one another to the Practice of thoſe Things which belong to our everlaſting Peace. This is undoubtedly the great End of Society intended by GOD ſince the Fall, and a ſtrong Argument it is, why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> and why we ſhould <hi>not forſake the aſſembling our ſelves together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther, let us conſider ourſelves as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> as having this natural Veil, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, taken off from our Eyes by the Aſſiſtance of GOD's Holy Spirit, and ſo enabled to ſee what he requires of us. Let us ſuppoſe ourſelves in ſome degree to have <hi>taſted the good Word of Life,</hi>and to have felt the Powers of the World to come, influencing and moulding our Souls into a religious Frame: To be fully and heartily convinced that we are <hi>Soldiers</hi> liſted under the <hi>Banner of</hi> CHRIST, and have proclaimed open War at our <hi>Baptiſm, againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil</hi>; and have, perhaps, frequently renewed our Obligations ſo to do, by partaking of the <hi>Lord's Supper:</hi> That we are ſurrounded
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004648_0005_100D68C041228F8"/>
with Millions of Foes without, and infeſted with Legions of Enemies within: That we are commanded to ſhine as Lights in the World, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That we are travelling to a long Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and need all imaginable Helps to ſhew us, and encourage us in our Way thither. Let us, I ſay, reflect on all this, and then how ſhall each of us cry out, Brethren, what a neceſſary Thing it is to meet together in <hi>Religiuos Societies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were fully ſenſible of this, and therefore we find them continually keeping up Communion with each other: For what ſays the Scripture? <hi>They continued ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the Doctrine and Fellowſhip,</hi> Acts ii. 42. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were no ſooner diſmiſſed by the Great Council, than they haſte away to their Companions. <hi>And being ſet at Liberty,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>they came to their own, and told them all theſe Things which the High Prieſt had ſaid unto them,</hi> Acts iv. 23. <hi>Paul,</hi> as ſoon as converted, <hi>tarried three Days with the Diſciples that were at</hi> Damaſcus, Acts ix. 19. And <hi>Peter</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when releaſed from Priſon, immediately goes to the Houſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> where there were <hi>great Multitudes aſſembled, praying,</hi> Acts xii. 12. And it is reported of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in After-Ages, that they uſed to aſſemble together before Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to ſing a Pſalm to CHRIST as GOD. So precious was the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> in thoſe Days.</p>
            <p>If it be asked, what Advantage we ſhall reap from ſuch a Procedure now? I anſwer, much
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004648_0006_100DB68F6A1C4DD0"/>
every Way. <hi>Two are better than One, becauſe they have a good Reward for their Labour: For if they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow; but woe be to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if Two lye together, then the have Heat; but how can One be warm alone? And if One prevail againſt him, Two ſhall withſtand him; and a Three-fold Cord is not quickly broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which directly leads me to my Second general Head, under which I was to aſſign ſome Reaſons why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Religions Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. As Man in his preſent Condition cannot always ſtand upright, but by Reaſon of the Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Nature cannot but fall; one eminent Reaſon why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> or, in other Words, one great Advantage of <hi>Religious Society</hi> is, <hi>That when they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And an excellent Reaſon this, indeed! For alas! When we reflect how prone we are to be drawn into Error in our Judgments, and into Vice in our Practice; and how unable, at leaſt how very unwilling, to eſpy or correct our own Miſcarriages; when we conſider how apt the World is to flatter us in our Faults, and how few there are ſo kind as to tell us the Truth; what an ineſtimable Privilege muſt it be to have a Set of true, judicious, hearty Friends about us, continually watching over our ſoul, to inform us where we have fallen, and warn us that we fall not again for the future. Surely it is ſuch a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004648_0006_100DB68F6A1C4DD0"/>
Privilege that (to uſe the Words of an <hi>eminent Chriſtian</hi>) we ſhall never know the Value of, till we come to Glory.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; for ſuppoſing that we could always ſtand upright, yet whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on the Difficulties of Religion in general, and his own Propenſity to Lukewarmneſs and Indifference in particular, will find that he muſt be <hi>zealous</hi> as well as <hi>ſteady,</hi> if ever he expects to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Here then, the Wiſe Man points out to us another excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Reaſon why <hi>Two are better than One. Again,</hi> ſays he, <hi>If Two lie together, then they have Heat, but how can One be warm alone?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which was the next Thing to be conſidered under the Second general Head, <hi>viz.</hi> to aſſign a ſecond Reaſon why <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> becauſe they can impart <hi>Heat</hi> to each other.</p>
            <p>It is an Obſervation no leſs true than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, That kindled Coals, if placed aſunder, ſoon go out, but if heaped together, quicken and enliven each other and afford a laſting Heat. The ſame will hold good, in the Caſe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. If <hi>Chriſtians</hi> kindled by the Grace of GOD unite, they will quicken and enliven each other; but if they ſeparate and keep aſunder, no marvel if they ſoon grow cool or tepid. If <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> meet together in CHRIST's Name, <hi>they will have Heat; but how can One be warm alone?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve, <hi>How can One be warm alone?</hi> The Wiſe Man's expreſſing himſelf by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, implies an Impoſſibility, at leaſt a very
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004648_0007_100DB69326D36C30"/>
great Difficulty, to be warm in Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Company, where it may be had. Behold here, then, another excellent Benefit flowing from <hi>Religious Society</hi>; it will keep us <hi>zealous,</hi> as well as <hi>ſteady,</hi> in the Ways of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>But to illuſtrate this a little farther by a Compariſon or two. Let us look upon ourſelves (as was above hinted) as <hi>Soldiers</hi> liſted under CHRIST's <hi>Banner</hi>; as going out with <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to meet One that cometh againſt us with twenty thouſand:</hi> as Perſons that are to <hi>wreſtle not only with Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, againſt Powers, and ſpiritual Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in high Places.</hi> And then tell me, all ye that fear GOD, if it be not an invaluable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to have a Company of <hi>Fellow Soldiers</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about us, animating and exhorting each other to ſtand our ground, to keep our Ranks, and manfully to follow the <hi>Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> though it be through a Sea of Blood?</p>
            <p>Laſtlv, Let us conſider ourſelves in another View before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> as Perſons travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to a long <hi>Eternity</hi>; reſcued by the <hi>freeGrace of GOD,</hi> in ſome Meaſure, from our natural <hi>Egyptian Bondage,</hi> and marching under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our <hi>ſpiritual Joſhua,</hi> thro' the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World,</hi> to the Land of our <hi>Heavenly Canaan.</hi> Let us farther reflect how apt we are to ſtartle at every Difficulty; to cry, <hi>There are Lions! There are Lions in the Way! There are the Sons of Anak</hi> to be grappled with, e'er we can poſſeſs the <hi>Promiſed Land:</hi> How prone we are, with <hi>Lot's Wife,</hi> to look wiſhfully back on
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004648_0007_100DB69326D36C30"/>
our <hi>ſpiritual Sodom,</hi> or with the fooliſh <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to long again for the <hi>Fleſh-Pots</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to return to our former natural State of Bondage and Slavery. Conſider this my Brethren, and ſee what a bleſſed Privilege it will be to have a Set of <hi>Iſraelites indeed</hi> about us, always reminding us of the Folly of any ſuch cowardly Deſign, and of the intolerable Miſery we ſhall run into, if we fall in the leaſt ſhort of the <hi>Promiſed Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More might be ſaid on this Particular, did not the Limits of a Diſcourſe of this Nature, oblige me to haſten.</p>
            <p>3. To give a Third Reaſon, mentioned by the Wiſe Man in the Text, why <hi>Two are better than One</hi>; namely, becauſe they can ſecure each other from Enemies without. <hi>And if One prevail againſt him, yet Two ſhall withſtand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto we have conſidered the Avantages of <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> as a great Preſervative againſt falling (at leaſt dangerouſly falling) into Sin and Lukewarmneſs, and that too from our own Corruptions. But what ſays the Wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach? My Son, when thou goeſt to ſerve the Lord, prepare thy Soul for Temptation</hi>: And that not only from inward, but outward Foes; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from theſe two grand Adverſaries, the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi>: For no ſooner will thine Eye be bent Heavenward, but the former will be immediately diverting it another Way, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thee thou needeſt not be <hi>ſingular</hi> in order to be <hi>religious</hi>; that one may be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going ſo much out of the <hi>Common Road.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will the Devil be wanting in his artful
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004648_0008_100DB694B4D957B8"/>
Inſinuations, or <hi>impious</hi> Suggeſtions, to divert or terrify thee from preſſing forwards, <hi>that thou mayſt lay hold on the Crown of Life</hi>: And if he cannot prevail this Way, he will try another; and in order to make his Temptation the more undiſcerned, but withal more ſucceſsful, he will employ, perhaps, ſome of thy neareſt Relatives, or moſt powerful Friends (as he ſet <hi>Peter</hi> on our <hi>bleſſed Maſter</hi>) who will always be bidding thee <hi>ſpair thyſelf</hi>; telling thee thou needeſt not take ſo much Pains; that it is not ſo difficult a Matter to get to Heaven as ſome People would make of it, nor the Way ſo narrow as others imagine it to be.</p>
            <p>But ſee here the Advantage of Religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; for ſuppoſing thou findeſt thyſelf thus ſurrounded on every Side, unable to withſtand ſuch <hi>horrid</hi> (though ſeemingly <hi>friendly</hi>) Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <hi>haſte</hi> away to thy Companions, and they will teach thee a truer and better Leſſon; they will tell thee, that thou muſt be <hi>ſingular</hi> if thou wilt be <hi>religious</hi>; and that it is as impoſſible for a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as for a City ſet upon a Hill, to be hid: That if thou wilt be an <hi>almoſt Chriſtian</hi> (and as good be none at all) thou mayſt live in the ſame idle indifferent Manner as thou ſeeſt moſt other People do: But if thou wilt be not only <hi>almoſt</hi> but <hi>altogether a Chriſtian,</hi> they will inform thee thou muſt go a great deal farther: That thou muſt not only <hi>faintly ſeek,</hi> but <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate</hi>: That there is but <hi>One</hi> Way now to Heaven as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> through the narrow Paſſage of a <hi>ſound Converſion</hi>: And that in order to bring about
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004648_0008_100DB694B4D957B8"/>
this mighty Work, thou muſt undergo a conſtant, but neceſſary Diſcipline of Faſting, Watching, and Prayer. And that therefore, the only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why theſe Friends give thee ſuch Advice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not willing to take ſo much Pains themſelves; or, as our Saviour told <hi>Peter</hi> on a like Occaſion, becauſe they <hi>ſavour not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then, is another excellent Bleſſing ariſing from <hi>Religious Society,</hi> that Friends can hereby ſecure each other from thoſe that oppoſe them. The <hi>Devil</hi> is fully ſenſible of this, and therefore he has always done his utmoſt to ſuppreſs, and put a Stop to the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> This was his grand Artifice at the firſt planting of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; to perſecute the Profeſſors of it, in order to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them. Which, though GOD, as he always will, over-ruled for the better; yet it ſhews what an Enmity he has againſt <hi>Chriſtians aſſembling themſelves together.</hi> Nor has he yet left off his old ſtratagem; it being his uſual Way to entice us <hi>by our ſelves,</hi> in order to tempt us; where, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of one another's Helps, he hopes to lead us <hi>captive at his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, on the contrary, knowing his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is ſtrengthened by <hi>Society,</hi> he would firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us to neglect the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> and then bid us <hi>ſtand in the Way of Sinners,</hi> hoping thereby to put us into <hi>the Seat of the Scornful. Judas</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> are melancholly Inſtances of this. The former had no ſooner left his Company at Supper, but he went out &amp; betrayed his Maſter: And the diſmal Downfal of the latter, when he would venture himſelf amongſt a Company of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004648_0009_100D864193DC4638"/>
Enemies, plainly ſhews us what the Devil will endeavour to do, when he gets us by ourſelves. Had <hi>Peter</hi> kept his own Company, he might have kept his Integrity; but a <hi>ſingle Cord,</hi> alas, how quickly was it broken? Our bleſſed Saviour knew this full well, and therefore it is very obſervable, that he always ſent out his Diſciples <hi>Two by Two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, after ſo many Advantages to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from <hi>Religious Society,</hi> may we not very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry out with the Wiſe Man in my Text, <hi>Woe be to him that is alone; for when he falleth, he hath not another to lift him up:</hi> When he is <hi>cold,</hi> he hath not a Friend to <hi>warm</hi> him; when he is <hi>aſſaulted,</hi> he hath not a <hi>Second</hi> to help him to withſtand his Enemy.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I now come to my <hi>Third general Head,</hi> under which was to be ſhewn the ſeveral Duties incumbent on every Member of a <hi>Religious Society,</hi> as ſuch, which are three.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Mutual Reproof:</item>
               <item>2. Mutual Exhortation:</item>
               <item>3. Mutual aſſisting and defending each other.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Mutual Reproof. Two are better than One: for when they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</p>
            <p>Now, Reproof may be taken either in a more extenſive Senſe, and then it ſignifies our raiſing a Brother by the gentleſt Means, when he falls into Sin and Error; or in a more reſtrained Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, as reaching no farther then thoſe, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Miſcarriages, which unavoidably happen in the moſt holy Men living.</p>
            <p>The Wiſe Man in the Text, ſuppoſes all of us ſubject to both: <hi>For when they fall</hi> (ſays he, thereby implying that each of us may fall) <hi>the One will lift up his Fellow.</hi> From whence we
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004648_0009_100D864193DC4638"/>
may infer, that <hi>when any Brother is overtaken with a Fault, he that is ſpiritual</hi> (that is, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and knows the Corruption and Weakneſs of Human Nature) <hi>ought to reſtore ſuch a one in the Spirit of Meekneſs.</hi> And why he ſhould do ſo, the Apoſtle ſubjoins a Reaſon <hi>conſidering thyſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted; i.e.</hi> conſidering thy own Frailty, leſt thou alſo fall by the like Temptation.</p>
            <p>We are all frail unſtable Creatures; and it is merely owing to the <hi>Free Grace and good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD,</hi> that we <hi>run not into the ſame Exceſs of Riot</hi> with other Men. Every offending Brother, therefore, claims our <hi>Pity</hi> rather than our <hi>Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and each Member ſhould ſtrive who ſhould be moſt forward, as well as moſt gentle, in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to his former State.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing a Perſon not to be <hi>overtaken,</hi> but to fall <hi>wilfully</hi> into a Crime; yet who art thou that denieſt Forgiveneſs to thy offending Brother? <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Take ye, Brethren, the holy Apoſtles as eminent Examples for you to learn by, how you ought to behave in this Matter. Conſider how quickly they joined the Right Hand of Fellowſhip with <hi>Peter,</hi> who had ſo wilfully denied his Maſter: For we find <hi>John</hi> and him together but two Days after, <hi>Joh.</hi> xx. 2. And <hi>v.</hi> 19. we find him aſſembled with the reſt. So ſoon did they forgive, ſo ſoon aſſociate with their ſinful, yet relenting Brother,—<hi>Let us go &amp; do likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is another kind of Reproof incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on every Member of <hi>Religious Society;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>a gentle Rebuke for ſome Miſcarriage or other, which, though not actually ſinful, yet may become the Occaſion of Sin.</hi> This indeed ſeems more eaſy, but
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004648_0010_100DB699ABDFDF60"/>
perhaps will be found a more difficult Point than the former: For when a Perſon has really ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he cannot but own his Brethrens Reproof to be juſt; whereas, when it was only for ſome little Miſconduct, the Pride that is in our Natures, will ſcarce ſuffer us to brook it. But however ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful this Pill may be to our Brother, yet if we have any Concern for his Welfare, it muſt be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by ſome friendly Hand or other. By all Means then let it be applied; only, like a ſkilful Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, <hi>gild</hi> over the ungrateful Medicine, &amp; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour if poſſible, to <hi>deceive</hi> thy Brother into Health and Soundneſs. <hi>Let all Bitterneſs, &amp; Wrath, and Malice, &amp; Evil-ſpeaking, be put away</hi> from it. Let the Patient know his Recovery is the only Thing aimed at, that thou delighteſt not <hi>cauſeleſly to grieve thy Brother</hi>; &amp; then thou canſt not want Succeſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Mutual Exhortation</hi> is the ſecond Duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the Words of the Text. — <hi>Again, If Two lie together, then they have Heat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve here again, the Wiſe Man ſuppoſes it as impoſſible for Religious Perſons to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; not to be the Warmer for each other's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as for two Perſons to lie in the ſame Bed, and yet freeze with Cold. But now, how is it poſſible to communicate Heat to each other, without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>ſtirring up the Gift of GOD</hi> which is in us, by brotherly Exhortation? Let every Member then of a <hi>Religious Society</hi> write that zealous Apoſtle's Advice on the Tables of his Heart; <hi>See that ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, &amp; provoke one another to Love, &amp; to good Works; and ſo much the more as you ſee the Day of the LORD approaching.</hi> Believe me, Brethren, we have need of Exhortation to rouze up our ſleepy Souls, to ſet
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004648_0010_100DB699ABDFDF60"/>
us upon our Watch againſt the Temptations of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Devil</hi>; to excite us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ourſelves, to take up our Croſſes, &amp; follow our bleſſed Maſter, &amp; the glorious Company of Saints &amp; Martyrs, <hi>who thro' Faith, have fought the good Fight, &amp; are gone before us to inherit the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> A third Part, therefore, of the Time wherein a <hi>Religious Society</hi> meets, ſeems neceſſary to beſpent in this important Duty: For what avails it to have our Underſtandings enlightned by pious Reading unleſs our Wills are at the ſame Time inclined, and inflamed by mutual Exhortation, to put it in Practice? Add to this, that this is the beſt Way both to receive &amp; impart Light, &amp; the only Means to preſerve &amp; increaſe that Warmth &amp; Heat which each Perſon firſt brought with him; GOD ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, as all other ſpiritual Gifts, that <hi>to him that hath, i.e.</hi> improve &amp; communicates what he has <hi>ſhall be given; but from him that hath not, i.e.</hi> does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Heat he hath, <hi>ſhall be taken away even that which he ſeemed to have.</hi> So needful, ſo eſſentially neceſſary is Exhortation to the Good of <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly and laſtly, The Text points out another Duty incumbent on every Member of a <hi>Religious Society, viz.</hi> To <hi>defend each other</hi> from thoſe that do oppoſe them. <hi>And if One prevail againſt him, yet Two ſhall withſtand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Wiſe Man takes it for granted, that <hi>Offences will come,</hi> nay, &amp; that they <hi>may prevail</hi> too. And this is no more than our <hi>bleſſed Maſter</hi> has long ſince told us. Not indeed, that there is any Thing in <hi>Chriſtianity itſelf</hi> that has the leaſt Tendency to give riſe to, or promote ſuch Offences: No, on the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004648_0011_100DB69CA77B3168"/>
contratry, it breathes nothing but Unity &amp; Love.</p>
            <p>But ſo it is, that ever ſince the fatal Sentence pronounced by GOD, after our firſt Parents Fall, <hi>viz. I will put Enmity between thy Seed &amp; her Seed; He that is born after the Fleſh,</hi> i. e. the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate unconverted Sinner, has in all Ages <hi>perſecuted him that is born after the Spirit:</hi> And ſo it always will be. Accordingly we find an early Proof given of this in the Inſtance of <hi>Cain</hi> &amp; <hi>Abel</hi>; &amp; of <hi>Iſmael</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſaac</hi>; of <hi>Jacob</hi> &amp; <hi>Eſau</hi> afterwards. And indeed, the whole <hi>Bible</hi> contains little elſe but an Hiſtory of the great &amp; continued Oppoſition between the Children of this World &amp; the Children of GOD. The firſt Chriſtians were remarkable Examples of this; though thoſe troubleſome Times, bleſſ;ed be GOD, are now over, yet the Apoſtle has laid it down as a general Rule, &amp; all that are ſincere can expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally prove the Truth of it, That <hi>they that will live godly in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, <hi>muſt</hi> (to the End of the World, in ſome Degree or other) <hi>ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> That therefore this may not make us deſert our bleſſed Maſter's Cauſe, every Member ſhould unite their Forces, in order to ſtand againſt it. And for the better effecting this, each would do well, from Time to Time, to communicate his Experiences, Grievances, &amp; Temptations, &amp; beg his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons firſt asking GOD's Aſſitance, without which all is nothing) to adminiſter Reproof, Exhortation or Comfort, as his Caſe requires: So that <hi>if One cannot prevail againſt it, yet Two ſhall withſtand it; and a threefold</hi> (much leſs a many-fold) <hi>Cord will not be quickly broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. But it is Time for me to proceed to the <hi>Fourth general Thing</hi> propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To draw an Inference or two from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004648_0011_100DB69CA77B3168"/>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt then, if <hi>Two are better than One,</hi> and the Advantages of <hi>Religious Society</hi> are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo great, then it is the Duty of every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to ſet on Foot, eſtabliſh &amp; promote, as much as in him lies <hi>Societies</hi> of this Nature. And I believe we may venture to affirm, that if ever a Spirit of true Chriſtianity is revived in the World, it muſt be bro't about by ſome ſuch Means as this. Motives, ſurely, cannot be wanting, to ſtir us up to this commendable &amp; neceſſary Undertaking: For granting all hitherto advanced to be of no Force, yet methinks the ſingle Conſideration that great Part of our Happineſs in Heaven will conſiſt in the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi>; or that the Intereſt as well as Piety of thoſe Sectariſts that differ from us, is ſtrengthened &amp; ſupported by nothing more than their frequent Meetings; either of theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, I ſay, one would think, ſhould induce us to do our utmoſt to copy after their good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; ſettle a laſting &amp; pious <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> on Earth. Add to this that we find the Kingdom of Darkneſs eſtabliſhed daily by ſuch like Means; and ſhall not the Kingdom of CHRIST be ſet in Oppoſition againſt it? Shall the Children of <hi>Belial</hi> aſſemble &amp; ſtrengthen each other in Wickedneſs; and ſhall not the Children of GOD unite, and ſtrengthen themſelves in Piety? Shall Society <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Societies be countenanced for Midnight Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and the promoting of <hi>Vice,</hi> and ſcarcely one be found intended for the Propagation of <hi>Virtue?</hi>— Be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens at this!</p>
            <p n="2">2. But this leads me to a ſecond Inference; namely, to warn Perſons of the great Danger thoſe are in, who either by their Subſcriptions,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004648_0012_100DB69FD6DFD1D8"/>
Preſence or Approbation, promote <hi>Societies</hi> of a quite oppoſite Nature to Religion.</p>
            <p>And here I would not be underſtood to mean only thoſe publick Meetings which are deſigned manifeſtly for nothing elſe but Revellings and Banquetings, for Chambering &amp; Wantonneſs, and at which a modeſt <hi>Heathen</hi> would bluſh to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but alſo thoſe ſeemingly <hi>innocent</hi> Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Meetings which the <hi>politer</hi> Part of the World are ſo very fond of, &amp; ſpend ſo much Time in: But which notwithſtanding, keep as many Perſons out of a Senſe of <hi>true Religion,</hi> as Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Debauchery or any other Crime whatever. Indeed, whilſt we are in this World, we muſt have proper Relaxations, to fit us both for the Buſineſs of our Profeſſion, &amp; Religion. But then, for Perſons who call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>  that have ſolemnly vowed at their Baptiſm, <hi>to renounce the Vanities of this ſinful World</hi>; that are commanded in Scripture <hi>to abſtain from all Appearance of Evil, and to have their Converſation in Heaven.</hi> For ſuch Perſons as theſe to ſupport Meetings, that (to ſay no worſe of them) are vain &amp; trifling, &amp; have a natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to draw off our Minds from GOD, is abſurd, ridiculous, &amp; ſinful. Surely <hi>Two are</hi> not <hi>better than One</hi> in this Caſe: No; it is to be wiſhed there was not <hi>One</hi> to be found concerned in it. The ſooner we forſake the <hi>aſſembling ourſelves together</hi> in ſuch a Manner, the better; and no matter how quickly the Cord that holds ſuch <hi>Societies</hi> (was it a Thouſand-fold) is broken.</p>
            <p>But <hi>you, Brethren, have not ſo learned</hi> CHRIST: But, on the contrary, like true Diſciples of your LORD &amp; Maſter, have by the Bleſſing of GOD

            </p>
            <p>What remains for me to do, but, as was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in the laſt Place, to cloſe up what has been ſaid, in a Word or two, by Way of Exhortation from the whole, &amp; to beſeech you, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to go on in the Way you have begun; and by a conſtant conſcientious Attandance on your reſpective <hi>Societies,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance Vice, encourage Virtue, and <hi>build each other up in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only permit me to <hi>ſtir up your pure Minds, by Way of Remembrance,</hi> and to exhort you, <hi>if there be any Conſolation in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>any Fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> again and again to conſider, that as all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in general, ſo all Members of <hi>Religious Societies</hi> in particular, are in an eſpecial Manner, as Houſes built upon an Hill; &amp; that therefore it highly concerns you to <hi>walk circumſpectly</hi> towards thoſe that are without, and to <hi>take heed to your ſelves, that your Converſation,</hi> in common Life, <hi>be as becometh</hi> ſuch an open &amp; peculiar Profeſſion <hi>of the Goſpel of</hi> CHRIST: Knowing that the Eyes of all Men are upon you, narrowly to inſpect every Circumſtance of your Behaviour; &amp; that every notorious wilful Miſcarriage of any ſingle Member, will, in ſome Meaſure, redound to the Scandal and Diſhonour of your whole Fraternity.</p>

at the laſt Day, LORD, have we not aſſembled ourſelves together <hi>in thy Name,</hi>&amp; enlivened each other, by <hi>ſinging Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs?</hi> For verily, I ſay unto you notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, our bleſſed LORD will bid you <hi>depart, from him</hi>; nay, that you ſhall <hi>receive a greater Damnation,</hi> if, in the midſt of theſe great Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, you are found to be <hi>Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But GOD forbid that any ſuch Evil ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal you; that there ſhould be ever a <hi>Judas,</hi> ever a Traitor amongſt ſuch diſtinguiſhed Followers of our <hi>Common Maſter.</hi> No, on the contrary, the Excellency of your Rules, the Regularity of your Meetings, and more eſpecially your pious Zeal in aſſembling in ſuch a publick and ſolemn Manner ſo frequently in the Year, perſuade me to think, that you are willing, not barely to <hi>ſeem,</hi> but to <hi>be</hi> in <hi>Reality, Chriſtians</hi>; &amp; hope to be found at the <hi>Laſt Day,</hi> what you would be eſteemed <hi>now, viz.</hi> holy, ſincere Diſciples of a Crucified Redeemer.</p>
