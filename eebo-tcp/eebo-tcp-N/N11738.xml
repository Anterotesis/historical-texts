            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And Jacob ſaid, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Iſaac, the Lord which ſaidſt unto me, Return unto thy country and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant; for with my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands. Deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Eſau, for I fear him, leſt he will come and ſmite me, and the mother with the children. And thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely do thee good, and make thy ſeed as the ſand of the ſea which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>

            <p>FROM the time of God's entering into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Abraham, it became neceſſary that the father of each family ſhould, at the cloſe of life, convene his children to inform them in what line the bleſſing of Abraham was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, as he the father had been inſtructed by God. The promiſed ſeed being explicitly declared to be in Iſaac, there was no occaſion for Abraham's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this; but when Iſaac was advanced in age and in the decline of life, he thought proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his bleſſing upon his ſons, and proceeded without having received any ſpecial direction from heaven. Iſaac being partial towards Eſau, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014831_0004_0F978A16ACA9F1D8"/>
becauſe he provided him with Veniſon, called him unto him. Rebeckah, Iſaac's wife, perceiving that he was about to promiſe the bleſſing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham not to the perſon for whom it was deſigned, reſolved if poſſible to prevent it; ſhe accordingly concerts a ſcheme for Jacob's obtaining the bleſſing: The artifice we find related in Gen. xxvii. Eſau upon this <hi>hated Jacob and ſaid in his heart, the days of mourning for his father were at hand, then would he ſlay his brother Jacob</hi>; which led Rebeckah to apply herſelf to Iſaac, ſhew the unhappineſs of Eſau's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, and the pleaſure they might promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Jacob if he would diſpoſe of himſelf better; her governing deſign was to get Jacob out of the way of Eſau. Iſaac <hi>called Jacob, bleſſed him, and ſent him away to Padan Aram, unto Laban</hi> the <hi>brother of Rebeckah,</hi> directing him to <hi>take a wife of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>; Jacob <hi>went out from Beerſheba</hi> agreeable to his father's direction, <hi>went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the Eaſt,</hi> and arrived at the houſe of Laban, where he married his daughters Rachel and Leah. After twenty years he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by God to <hi>return unto the land of his fathers and to his kindred,</hi> and he with his ſons and wives retired ſecretly. Laban following, overtook him, and when, after ſome conference, Laban departed, Jacob recollecting the diſpleaſure of Eſau his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ſent meſſengers to him that he might find grace in his ſight.</hi> The meſſengers upon their return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the fears of Jacob, and alarmed him greatly by telling him that Eſau <hi>was coming to meet him,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with four hundred men: Miſapprehending the deſign of Eſau, he contrived the moſt likely means of defence and ſafety; and, as in the text, applied to God for ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The text is a prayer, containing</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014831_0005_0F978A177778CA58"/>1. An invocation of God, in theſe words, <hi>O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Iſaac, the Lord which ſaidſt unto me, Return unto thy country and unto thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee.</hi> That the Lord was the God of Abraham appears from his promiſes to him, and from the interpoſition of his providence in his behalf; thus God promiſes that <hi>he will make of him a great nation, will bleſs him and make his name great, and he ſhall be a bleſſing; he will bleſs them that bleſs him, and curſe them that curſe him</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xii.2, 3.</note> of the ſame tenor are all his expreſſions of regard unto him. In the courſe of providence he was his <hi>ſhield and exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>; he influenced Melchizedeck King of Salem, to <hi>bleſs him</hi>; when the cities of the plain were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed he remembered Abraham, and warned Lot his brother to flee; he interpoſed once and again with regard to a deception reſpecting his wife, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing Abimeleck to offer him a ſettlement in his land, and was at all times at his right hand.</p>
            <p>That the Lord was the God of Iſaac likewiſe appears from his promiſing to <hi>be with him and bleſs him, to perform the oath which he ſware unto Abraham his father, and to multiply his ſeed.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xxvi.3, 24.</note> By the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of divine Providence <hi>his</hi> life was preſerved when to appearance in imminent danger; and <hi>he</hi> proſpered and flouriſhed. And,</p>
            <p>From what we have already ſeen of Jacob, it is evident that the Lord was his God.</p>
            <p>There was then a propriety in Jacob's addreſſing the ſupreme Being in theſe characters, and warming his heart with a recollection of God's favourable regards to his family. There is in the prayer of the text</p>
            <p n="2">2. An acknowledgment of unworthineſs of paſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014831_0006_0F978A1834F1F480"/>
favours. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant; for with my ſtaff I paſsed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The mercy of God towards Jacob in having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a method of evading the immediate reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eſau, his preſence with him to Haran, a kind reception by Laban, ſucceeding in his deſign, and his proſperity upon the whole while with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, with the repeated promiſes of God and his truth and faithfulneſs in the performance of them, of theſe <hi>mercies</hi> of God and of <hi>all the truth ſhewed unto</hi> him, Jacob very humbly acknowledges himſelf <hi>not worthy.</hi> And particularly of one expreſſion of God's goodneſs he deems himſelf unworthy; when he <hi>went out from Beerſheba,</hi> he went as a traveller, having no more than neceſſary proviſion, and the <hi>ſtaff</hi> in his hand, but when he returns he has <hi>people with him, and flocks, and herds, and camels,</hi> which for defence and ſafety he is able to <hi>divide into two bands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was fit and proper that Jacob ſhould by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizing the mercies and truth of God, impreſs his mind with a ſenſe of his dependance upon him, eſpecially when about to aſk any favour at his hand.</p>
            <p>The text contains</p>
            <p n="3">3. A petition. <hi>Deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Eſau, for I fear him, leſt he will come and ſmite me, and the other with the children.</hi> There is nothing particular here to be remarked, except that Jacob's apprehenſions of danger were great, and he expected nothing leſs than total ruin and deſtruction. This ſame expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>ſmite the mother with the children,</hi> is uſed by a prophet in comparing the deſtruction of Samaria with a deſolation made at Betharbel, where <hi>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was daſhed in pieces, upon her children,</hi> all the

            </p>
            <p>There is in the text</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly. Encouragement of an anſwer taken from God's own promiſe, in theſe words, <hi>and thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely do thee good, and make thy ſeed as the ſand of the ſea which cannot be numbered for multitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jacob knowing the promiſes that God made to his fathers Abraham and Iſaac, and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his faithfulneſs to <hi>them,</hi> recollecting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated promiſes and the truth of God to <hi>himſelf,</hi> has a ſtrong faith; he confides in the veracity of God, and is encouraged to hope for ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>In this part of his prayer, he refers to a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able relief afforded him ſome years before; altho' he was the heir of a powerful family, we have ſeen that he was obliged to take his leave of his aged parents, and depart from his father's houſe, for fear of an angry brother; the night following, as it is repreſented, his undertaking this journey to Haran, that beneficent Being who ſurrounds the bed and path of every individual, aſſured him of his kind protection; a ſublime repreſentation filled the mind of Jacob! a repreſentation of a ladder extending from earth to heaven, with angels deſcending and aſcending upon it, and emblematical of a particular Providence! <hi>Behold, the Lord ſtood above this ladder and ſaid, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Iſaac; the land whereon thou lieſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed. And behold, I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goeſt, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have ſpoken to thee of.</hi>

            <p>The words thus opened offer theſe obſervations,
<list>
                  <item>1. That although our beginning be but ſmall, our latter end may increaſe.</item>
                  <item>2. That the proſperity of any ſociety or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity depends upon public virtue, while diſtreſs and trouble will be connected with vice.</item>
                  <item>3. That prayer is a proper exerciſe in a day of trouble. And,</item>
                  <item>4. That our ſtate may be ſo mixed as to afford us reaſon for mourning, as well as rejoicing.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt obſervation, That although our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning be but ſmall, our latter end may increaſe, is true, whether applied to individuals or ſocieties.</p>
            <p>It is verified in Abraham, in Iſaac, and in Jacob, which has been already curſorily mentioned; and daily obſervation will furniſh many inſtances of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons riſing from poverty to affluence, and from obſcurity to eminence and diſtinction.</p>
            <p>Societies have, no leſs than individuals, roſe from ſmall beginnings to large increaſe; for the truth of which, we need have recourſe to no other people but our own: Our fathers but few in number, yet how have we increaſed! their territories but ſmall, yet how are they enlarged! poor, yet how rich now! trifling then, yet how important now to the parent ſtate! though our beginning was but ſmall

in all reſpects, yet what ſtrides! what advances! and how great the acceſſion! The truth of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is thus obvious at the firſt ſight.</p>
            <p>But as a probability is not immediately connected with the poſſibility of our ſtill continuing to increaſe, I ſhall immediately proceed to the ſecond obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſhew the ground of that probability, which is righteouſneſs or public virtue.</p>
            <p>That proſperity is intimately connected with public virtue, is a matter of which we ought to be well aſcertained; and ſo on the contrary that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will follow vice.</p>
            <p>It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the ſupreme Being ſhould call men to account AS members of ſociety, and diſpenſe rewards and puniſhments as his juſtice ſhould direct: and THAT in this world, becauſe we are not held <hi>by ſocieties and bodies of men</hi> to anſwer for our conduct in another world. God diſpoſes and inclines us to form ſocial and civil connections, and has given us laws and commands to govern ourſelves by in thoſe connections; and upon a regard to thoſe laws and commands, or public virtue, does the happineſs and proſperity of any people depend. Thus we find that when <hi>the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah</hi> was <hi>great,</hi> when <hi>their ſin was very grievous,</hi> the Lord went <hi>down to ſee whether</hi> the inhabitants <hi>had done altogether according to the cry which had come unto him,</hi> and upon enquiry find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wickedneſs had become univerſal, that they were unanimous in iniquity, and were <hi>ſinners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly before</hi> him, he <hi>rained upon them brimſtone and fire out of heaven,</hi> and <hi>overthrew the cities and all their inhabitants and that which grew upon the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, Babylon that glory of kingdoms and praiſe of the whole earth, <hi>ſhall be,</hi> ſays the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

Iſaiah, <hi>as when God overthrew Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi>; and this for their iniquity, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſin.</p>
            <p>Moſes promiſed the people of Iſrael that if they would <hi>diligently hearken to the voice of God, obſerve and do all his commandments,</hi> they ſhould be ſafe and eaſy; their families ſhould be bleſſed with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; ſucceſs ſhould attend them in all their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; they ſhould have honour among their neighbours, and be victorious over their enemies. But on the contrary, if they would not keep God's commandments, his diſpleaſure would overtake them; they ſhould be viſited with ſickneſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; they ſhould be ſo infatuated in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels as not to diſcern their true intereſt, nor effect any thing for the public good; and their name ſhould be for <hi>an aſtoniſhment.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But a queſtion may here ariſe, viz. Whether this connection between vice and miſery, virtue and happineſs is not in conſequence of that political co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and Iſrael, and ſo <hi>peculiar</hi> to that people? and whether it be juſt to argue from thence, that the proſperity of a people or ſociety depends upon their obeying the commandments of God, while adverſity will be the conſequence of their diſobedience? In anſwer to which it may be ſaid, that it is the will of God, who always conſults the good of his creatures, that we ſhould incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ourſelves into larger ſocieties than thoſe which every family of itſelf forms; our general ſecurity and happineſs could not otherwiſe have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, nor could we have been furniſhed with the conveniences of life. It is highly juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that God ſhould take cognizance of, and call men to account in this their capacity as ſocieties;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014831_0011_0F978A1C924C4BB0"/>
diſtributing upon the whole body rewards or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and aſſigning them to adverſity or proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, according to the nature of their united con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Seeing the bonds of ſociety are diſſolved by death, after which perſonal characters only will be examined, this buſineſs (as has already been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) will be tranſacted in this world. There is a greater neceſſity of ſuch a diſtribution taking place <hi>here,</hi> than there is of that with reſpect to perſonal characters; for although God often ſuffers wicked men to paſs unpuniſhed here, they cannot eſcape his notice on the day of general judgment; but communities and ſocieties, as ſuch, can never be puniſhed or rewarded, except in this world.</p>
            <p>According to the common method of providence, the ſtate of a people is good or bad according to the general nature of their actions; if they are careful to pleaſe God, good and virtuous, juſt and merciful, they flouriſh and are happy; but on the other hand, if profanity and impiety gain footing among them, a cloud ſits upon their affairs, and calamity, ruin and deſtruction ſoon follow. Such obſervations have found entertainment in the minds of men in all ages; the decay of the Roman ſtate was attributed
<q>not to chance, fortune or ſome unhidden cauſes, but to the general looſeneſs and corruption of manners.</q>
And it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by Scipio,
<q>that it is impoſſible for any ſtate to be happy though their walls were firm, if their manners were decayed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That God <hi>does</hi> charge guilt upon nations as well as particular perſons or individuals, is implied in theſe paſſages of ſcripture; when Abner had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to David, David ſaid, <hi>I and my kingdom are guiltleſs before the Lord,</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam. iii.28.</note> &amp;c. and when upon Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's

            <p>Virtue promotes the honour of a people abroad, and will engage the confidence of diſtant nations and higher powers; it prevents private animoſities and civil diſcord at home, it exhilerates the ſpirits and inſpires with courage and magnanimity; it is a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and defence againſt the greateſt dangers; and wherever we find it is generally countenanced and encouraged, <hi>there</hi> we find the good of the whole is promoted; there the peaceable enjoyment of the comforts of life is allowed, and the true end of civil exiſtence is anſwered. On the contrary, vice renders a people deſpicable in the eyes of the world; depreſſes the ſpirits, and introduces confuſion at home; and expoſes to the greateſt evils. When the former takes place in a ſociety, people or nation, that nation, people or ſociety will flouriſh; <hi>righteouſneſs exalteth a nation,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xiv.34.</note> ſays the wiſe man. But when the latter, <hi>it is a reproach,</hi> and calls for divine judgments.</p>
            <p>The judgments either feared or felt in ſuch a caſe, can be averted only by reformation.</p>
            <p>Which leads to the</p>

               <q>There is a natural propenſity in the mind of man,</q>
ſays a modern writer,
<q>to fly to ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Being for ſuccour and relief in a time of trouble, danger and diſtreſs; an inward principle that leads the mind to hope for relief from that inviſible Being from whom we believe we have received any extraordinary good.</q>

more ſenſible of our weakneſs in ſorrow, than in joy; and nature and reaſon point us to an arm ſuperior to our own, to obtain relief and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from trouble and difficulty. Prayer is ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſires of ſuch deliverance before him, who can alone afford relief. If we feel the rod of God, are properly attentive to his hand, we ſhall in this way caſt our burthen upon him; and our waiting eyes will be directed to him, for that ſalvation we ſtand in need of. This is the way appointed and inſtituted by the Diſpoſer of all events, the <hi>only</hi> way in which he has given us encouragement to hope for ſucceſs; if we apply for deliverance as a favour, he ſtands ready to confer it as ſuch, giving us that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, <hi>Aſk and ye ſhall receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Trouble and affliction ſpring not from the ground, but from that God who is the ſupreme origin of all things; He is the Governor of the univerſe, and Superintendant of our public as well as our private affairs.</p>
            <p>Sacred hiſtory affords a variety of inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſuſpenſion or removal of evil has been the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of His providence; there was an inſtance, in the caſe of Ninevah; and he <hi>ſuffered no man</hi> to do harm to Iſrael <hi>when but few in number and paſſing from one nation to another, yea he reproved Kings for their ſakes.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſ. cv.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Profane hiſtory is likewiſe pregnant with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of providence of the like kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is there evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Are the public affairs of a people diſtreſſed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed, and God hath not ſuffered it?

able to convert trouble into joy, bring light out of darkneſs and good out of evil? Has he not repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly promiſed to individuals, that if they would walk before him, he would be their God? Has He not promiſed the ſame to nations? And does he not manifeſt, in the courſe of His providence, that when a people are holy, they are a happy people? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yes!</p>
            <p>Nothing more is neceſſary to ſhew the truth of the remark, that prayer (attended with reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is proper in a day of trouble.</p>

            <p>Had experience never led us to the truth of this, the preſent ſtate of Jacob would convince us of it; his conſideration of a vaſt acceſſion in train and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, although his beginning had been but ſmall, muſt excite ſentiments of gratitude; and at the ſame time the apprehenſion of danger from his brother muſt depreſs his ſpirits. Oftentimes, we find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a ſituation, eſpecially when in any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

            <p>In our preſent ſituation we are attended with <hi>ſome</hi> circumſtances which call us to mourn, and with <hi>others</hi> which may lead us to rejoice.</p>
            <p>It is inconvenient for the Parliament of Great-Britain, at ſuch a remove from us, to regulate our internal policy; and it is impoſſible that they ſhould do it with propriety, equity and juſtice: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which they have attempted it without our conſent, in effect commanding our life and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

waſting ſickneſs in many of our towns, have been additional reaſons for mourning; peculiar to us, and which are to be conſidered ſeparately from the more general calamity.</p>
            <p>I have now curſorily run over thoſe circumſtances which call for mourning; let us change the view, and recollect the reaſons we have for rejoicing.</p>
            <p>We of this land, have been the peculiar care of Providence from our earlieſt periods; the tender mercies of God have been conſtantly over us; thro' the benignity of Providence, we have greatly flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; in general, the ſeaſons have been fruitful, and we have been bleſſed with abundant proviſion.</p>
            <p>At this preſent time the truth of that obſervation muſt ſtrike us with force, viz. that
<q>in the midſt of affliction, we are ſurrounded with mercies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt and principal mercy to be regarded is this, that whereas many are involved in darkneſs, others debarred a free uſe of the ſacred ſcriptures, and popery is making its ſtrides into the Northern parts of this continent,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Quebec Bill, in the letter and ſpirit of it.</note> we are ſurrounded with the light of the goſpel, yet allowed acceſs to the ſacred ſcriptures, and favoured with worſhipping God as our conſciences dictate to us.</p>

            <p>It is likewiſe a peculiar ſmile of Providence, that ſickneſs has not prevailed more univerſally in the army; and that ſo few, compared with the vaſt numbers in the camp, have been unfit for duty.</p>

               <hi>that</hi> deſign of intimidating, and frightening us into a compliance with their meaſures; their loading our innocence and virtue with reproach, their hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile array, and unprecedented ſeverity, has ſerved to inſpire us with an undaunted fortitude. What, but the ſame kind hand, as it directed thoſe that took the alarm on April 19: What, but the hand of Providence preſerved the ſchool of the prophets from their ravage, who would have deprived us of many advantages for moral or religious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note n="*" place="bottom">General Gage, as governor of this province, iſſued his precepts for convening a general aſſembly at Boſton, deſigning to enforce a compliance with Lord's North's deſigning motion; they were to be kept as priſoners in garriſon, till under the mouth of cannon and at the point of the bayonet they ſhould be reduced to a mean and ſervile ſubmiſſion. To facilitate this matter, he was to ſend out a party to take poſſeſſion of a magazine at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; preſuming that this might be done without oppoſition, the ſaid party upon their return from Concord were to lay waſte till they ſhould arrive at Cambridge common; there, after deſtroying the colleges and other buildings, they were to throw up an entrenchment upon the ſaid common, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was to be increaſed from the garriſon, and the next morning a part of the artillery to be removed and planted in the entrenchment aforeſaid. This aſtoniſhing manoeuvre, it was ſuppoſed, would ſo effectually intimidate the conſtituents, that the general aſſembly by the compliance deſigned would literally <hi>repreſent</hi> their conſtituents." The author is not at liberty to publiſh the channel through which he received the foregoing; but begs leave to aſſure the reader, that it comes ſo direct that he cannot heſitate in giving credit to it. He recollects one circumſtance, which renders it highly probable; Lord Percy (on April 19.) ſuſpicious his progreſs to Concord might be retarded, by the plank of the bridge at Cambridge being taken away, brought out from Boſton ſeveral loads of plank, with a number of carpenters; not finding occaſion to uſe them, he carried them on his way to Concord, perhaps about a mile and an half from the bridge: About an hour after the plank were returned. If he had intended to repoſe that river at night, he muſt have reſerved the plank; if he deſigned to ſtop in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, the plank muſt be an encumbrance. This conduct, in returning the plank, may be accounted for upon ſuppoſition of the foregoing plan of operation.</note>

from a vain confidence, it becomes us to take a grateful notice of the ſucceſs that has already attended our arms. Viewed in connection with the final reſult of the preſent controverſy, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the precarious ſtate which ever attends the din of war; it is difficult to determine what attention this ſucceſs demands; but detached from the final reſult and viewed ſeparately, muſt we not ſay our arms have been wielded by a hand that is more than human? It is well known that in order for una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable deſtruction upon our frontiers and back ſettlements, vigorous efforts have been uſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable pains taken to excite the ſavage ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the wilderneſs and rouſe the natives with their former allies, to arms againſt us; yet Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has miraculouſly defeated the black deſign, by influencing the natives in general to ſupport the united colonies, and put it out of the power of thoſe allies to diſtreſs us: Remarkable ſucceſs has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Weſtern detachment of the continental army; Providence has manifeſtly owned and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, in permitting them to take into poſſeſſion two fortreſſes, one of which was doubtleſs the ſtrongeſt they will meet with.<note n="*" place="bottom">Fort Chamblee ſurrendered to the forces of the United Colonies, October 18.

We are to look upon this as a ſmile of Providence, that the inconſiderate among us have been under ſuch reſtraints, when left to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of luſt uncontrouled by civil authority; amidſt all our ſtruggles, commotions and perplexities, each one has looked upon his neighbour's perſon and intereſt ſacred, as when defended by wholeſome laws uninterrupted in their courſe; abuſes of the former, and invaſions of the latter, have been leſs frequent in the preſent diſſipated ſtate of our affairs, than in any given term of time before; no threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

quarrels, or animoſitions have ſubſiſted; but harmony and internal peace have ever reigned, and one ſoul has inſpired the body politic.</p>
            <p>It now remains that we reflect upon our paſt lives, and by that means determine whether we have not rendered ourſelves leſs than the leaſt of theſe mercies, and deſerved greater evils than we have yet felt.</p>
            <p>Our ſins which are the remote occaſion of an obſtruction in that harmony which has ſubſiſted between the parent ſtate and us, are great; and God may be juſtly provoked to puniſh us in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the meaſure of our iniquities: Let us then this day lay our hands upon our mouths, and our mouths in the duſt, humbly acknowledging our ſins and iniquities. I doubt not but God has many faithful and choſen ſervants among us; but a general view of the wickedneſs and corruption that ſpreads far and wide, muſt tenderly affect every ſerious mind. An acquaintance with the many examples of divine juſtice in the puniſhment, and ſometimes in the entire deſtruction of kingdoms, nations and ſocieties, and a compariſon of their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with our own, muſt excite fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions in us; eſpecially as we ſee the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God manifeſted in the calamity we now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under.</p>
            <p>Had this part of the world leſs knowledge and leſs light, there might have been ſome excuſe, and perhaps God might have winked at times of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but of this we cannot make a plea. The goſpel, in which the goodneſs of God is diſplayed through a Redeemer, in which the holy Spirit is offered to all that diligently ſeek it, and in which motives are ſet before us to engage our attention, and guard us againſt ſin, this goſpel has reached our ears. But, how has it been abuſed and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected!

Is it precious to our ſouls, ſweeter than honey, or the drops that diſtill from the comb? do we make it the theme of our converſation by day, and the ſubject of our meditation by night? alas! where are the perſons that have a ſuperlative eſteem for the oracles of truth?</p>
