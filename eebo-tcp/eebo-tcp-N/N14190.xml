            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My dear young Friends, fellow Members of the ſame Meeting,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not that ſuitable advice has not been adminiſtered to every ſtate and condition, that induces me to make this addreſs; but as the connection between us may occaſion this to be read, while advices more worthy may eſcape notice, I truſt it will ſufficiently juſtify me in thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to impart ſome things, wherein I apprehend your preſent and future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is much concerned.</p>
            <p>I would, however, firſt premiſe, that all will allow the moſt important concern to us, in this life, is to endeavour after ſuch a ſtate of mind, that we may be enabled ſo to live and conduct ourſelves in this world,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017968_0005_0FA409892AFB20C8"/>as that all our actions may tend to render us fit companions for men here, and for purified and bleſſed ſpirits hereafter: our exiſtence will elſe be of no value, no other purſuit being worthy our attention. The ſolemn period, that will reduce every ſtate, condition, and thing, to one level, is certain to us all; proſperity and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, riches and poverty, health and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, however differently eſtimated now, will then, in fact, admit of no choice or difference, or afford any comfort, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as ſuch proper uſes have been made of them as may have promoted this great end: for if we were poſſeſſed in the higheſt degree of this world's good, or what is moſt ſought after, viz. health, power, affluence, and pleaſure, and had not a better hope, we ſhould be moſt miſerable; that which we feared to loſe, and knew we muſt loſe, would take away the true enjoyment of every bleſſing aſſorded by Divine Providence. On the contrary, did we but experience our minds redeemed from tranſitory things, and ſixed on the better hope, we ſhould, as was teſtified of the meek, enjoy even the earth in a right and true manner; receiving with thankful hearts the mercies of the Almighty, uſing this world as not abuſing it, and not be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017968_0006_0FA4098A33EA6BA8"/>afraid, whenever it ſhould pleaſe him to call us hence, freely to reſign up all. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid this, I ſhall now proceed, and hope to be enabled to convince you, that the profeſſion of your education, becoming that of your judgment and practice, will, through divine aſſiſtance, bring you into this happy ſituation, which both your greateſt intereſt and moſt incumbent duty demand you earneſtly to ſeek after. I need hardly aſk you the queſtion, "Your fathers, where are they, and the prophets, do they live for ever?" Zech. i. 5. You will readily anſwer, They are gone. What then? are the words they taught, and the ſtatutes they were commanded by the Almighty, buried with them? I hope not. By whom then ſhould the knowledge of them be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved? Surely by ſuch as are left behind. And I pray that we, who are the natural branches, may not (through our diſregard thereto) loſe our birthright for a mere meſs of pottage; (a poor temporary gratification) but, like the ſons of Jonadab, keep all their precepts: that the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, may not want a man of their poſterity to ſtand before him for ever.</p>
            <p>You need not be told, that they were very ſingular and different from others in their dreſs and addreſs; and, however
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017968_0007_0FA40A10A4C285C0"/>light ſome may now eſteem theſe things, they ſuffered greatly for the ſame, both in body and goods, and their ſufferings have opened to us a door of great liberty, but we do not, I fear, ſufficiently prize it: if we did, there would be no running back again into bondage. If the Hebrew who might have been free and would not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have his ear bored through with an awl, and be fixed in ſlavery for ever, ſuch backſliders certainly do. There is ſuch a dignity in the truth, and ſuch a nobility in appearing like friends agreeable to our known principles, that it keeps even tranſgreſſors in awe, and libertines at a diſtance. A deviation opens a door to every hurtful thing, and introduces an acquaintance that oftentimes leads to ruin in this world, and, which is much worſe, (though far be it from me to limit the mercies of the Almighty) unfits us, I fear, for happineſs in the world to come. My beloved young friends, do not plead for this or that, as ſeeing no harm in it: ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly conſidered, it may be indifferent, but, as it is connected, of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. A cocked-up hat, faſhionable cloaths, or uſing the plural number inſtead of the ſingular, may be called by you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things; you may ſay that ſpeech
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017968_0008_0FA40A11B61467F8"/>is to convey ideas, and what religion can there be in having a hat a little lower or higher? And in the ſame manner plead for every other liberty; but indeed theſe are very far from being indifferent things to us. Theſe ſingularities, as you may call them, are like the locks of Sampſon's hair, wherein if we ſuffer ourſelves by any Delilah to be deceived, and depart from the plainneſs and ſimplicity of our profeſſion, we ſhall loſe our ſtrength, and become weak as other men: who, ſeeing us in their ſtate, will ſoon entice us into thoſe things I have hinted at. I do not, however, by this mean to be underſtood, that we are to lay ſuch a ſtreſs on an external appearance, as in any-wiſe to neglect what is internal. Make the inſide clean, and the outſide will be clean alſo. Our predeceſſors in the truth, we know, from well-grounded ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, laid aſide greatly the exteriors men had added to religion, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us an inward purity of heart and ſoul. If therefore, we become dead to the power of truth, having neither form nor power, we are ſo far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding other profeſſions, that, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, we fall greatly ſhort. I pray it may not be ſo with us; but, as our fathers before us walked in the truth, that we
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017968_0009_0FA40A126DC44348"/>may likewiſe ſo walk; and have to ſay to them that ſucceed us, follow us as we have followed them, who followed the Lord Jeſus in truth and righteouſneſs. May you alſo be examples to the youth in other meetings; that they, beholding your circumſpection, and the fear of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on your minds, may be encouraged to tread in the ſame path. Never be aſhamed of being religious. I have thought nothing ever advanced the character of David more, than that zealous joyful ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abaſement which appeared in his dancing before the ark: and though, by the ſpirit of the world, ſuch may be deſpiſed, as act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too mean a part for the dignity of human pride, yet by the upright-hearted they will be had in honour, and their ſouls ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and know a growing in that which is truly good; when leanneſs and barrenneſs ſhall attend the ſcoffers, who at length ſhall be made to confeſs, Wiſd. v. 4, 5. "We fools accounted their life madneſs, and their end to be without honour. How are they numbered amongſt the children of God, and their lot is amongſt the ſaints? What hath pride profited us, or what good hath riches and vaunting brought us? All theſe things are paſſed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017968_0010_0FA40A1332A28E10"/>away like as a ſhadow, and as a poſt that haſteth by, and we are now conſumed in our own wickedneſs. But the righteous live for evermore, even they whom we had ſometimes in deriſion, and a proverb of reproach: their reward is with the Lord, and the care of the Moſt High is over them." Thus by acting in character, agreeable to your profeſſion, you will gain all things; and out of it, loſe all. For what advantage can the whole world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, or any thing therein, when the time comes, which is moſt ſure, that we ſhall have but one deſire, even to die the death of the righteous, and our latter end to be like unto theirs, ſo emphatically ſet forth in the foregoing paſſages.</p>
            <p>I would now ſet before you ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantages you enjoy ſuperior to many of your brethren; and preſs that proper uſe to be made of them which may further this great purpoſe of life—To finiſh well. Our meeting has been favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a living, acceptable miniſtry: many watering ſeaſons we have had, here a little and there a little. Theſe bleſſings are not to be lightly eſteemed; nor are we ſo to depend on them, as to neglect in any wiſe our attention to that great Miniſter, to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017968_0011_0FA40A13E71D2E00"/>whom both thoſe that edify and thoſe that are edified are ſervants. If we do, we ſhall ſuffer great loſs; and as, on a certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the Almighty ſaid to Moſes, "They are thy people, not mine," may it not be applicable to us? A lamentable exchange or difference, to become the children of men, from being children taught by the Moſt High, and in his truth eſtabliſhed. The end of all true miniſtry is to direct to this; and the ſoftening ſhowers of the goſpel are to water the heritage, that the good ground being opened thereby, the true ſeed may take root and grow up, bringing forth an increaſe proportionate to the talent received: in ſome thirty, ſome ſixty, and ſome an hundred-fold. The frequent opportunities afforded us to meet together, are alſo great advantages; I do intreat you, by no means neglect them. It is great encouragement to ſee a meeting well and timely filled. I remember to have heard a friend once ſay in teſtimony, "That ſuch as were indifferent about coming to meetings, were moſt indifferent when there." This is a truth to which I believe our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will readily aſſent. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in an eſpecial manner guard againſt this indifference; and though we may have attended many meetings, and ſeem to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017968_0012_0FA40A14DA309AE8"/>be nevertheleſs in a diſtreſſed ſtate, and hardly to know what good is, yet if we miſs but one, that one might have been to us as the appearance of Jeſus was to the diſciples when they were very low in their minds. He then ſtood in the midſt of them, and ſaid, "Peace be unto you;" he ſhewed them his hands and his, ſide, and they were glad; he alſo breathed on them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, from this memorable meeting one diſciple was abſent, and the report from others could not make him believe; and though our Lord, in condeſcenſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him another opportunity, when he could only cry out, "My Lord, and my God!" yet are we not to preſume upon that, but cry earneſtly to be endued with ability to perform the preſent duty in the preſent time.</p>
            <p>Be exceeding choice of your company; for true it is, that evil communications corrupt good manners. Be as careful what books you read; and avoid thoſe in the leaſt tending to libertiniſm and deiſm, as you would an infectious diſtemper. Man, by all his earthly wiſdom, cannot find out God; finite cannot comprehend infinite. In his unregenerate ſtate, man
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017968_0013_0FA40A17E6EF71B8"/>may puzzle and perplex himſelf with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters too high for him. Meddle not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but ever bear in remembrance, "The man that walketh uprightly, walketh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely;" and that to ſuch as "walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, there is no condemnation." This is enough for us to believe and practiſe; let us leave the reſt to the all wiſe Diſpoſer of all things, and ſay with David, "He that planted the ear, ſhall he not hear? He that formed the eye, ſhall he not ſee? And he that teacheth men knowledge, ſhall he not know?"</p>
            <p>After requeſting your frequent peruſal of the holy ſcriptures, I would in a particular manner recommend to your reading the ſeveral volumes, intituled, Piety Promoted. What can more excite to piety, than to view men in their expiring moments joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully leaving this world, from a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a life ſpent in the fear of God? a time in which no dazzling object can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or any worldly enjoyment flatter. William Penn's Riſe and Progreſs, wrote by way of preface to George Fox's jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Dr. Rutty's Liberty of the Fleſh and Spirit diſtinguiſhed, and John Fry's Serious and Affectionate Addreſs, I would alſo wiſh
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017968_0014_0FA40A194C4B00D0"/>you all often to read, and ſeriouſly to conſider. The many journals left by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy deceaſed friends will afford both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and profit; the experiences of great and good men being by the wiſe always had in eſteem. I am not inſenſible, whilſt I thus recommend the examples of others, that great hurt hath been occaſioned by the falling away of ſome men, from whom better things might have been expected, and that by their fall many have been wounded. I confeſs this is a lamentable circumſtance; but ſhould thouſands fall on the right, and ten thouſands on the left-hand, truth is truth; and may the failures of others tend to make us more circumſpect and careful of ourſelves, and quicken our endeavours, to the utmoſt of the ability afforded us, to be ſtedfaſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord: ever bearing in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that the beſt of men are no longer ſafe than whilſt on their guard; that the higher the attainment, the greater the fall; and that if the light that was once in us becomes darkneſs, that darkneſs is great indeed! And as, in the outward, when a man becomes blind, after having once ſeen, the loſs of ſight is more ſeverely felt by him than by a perſon born blind; ſo
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017968_0015_0FA40A1A7798E130"/>when thoſe who have once ſpiritually ſeen afterwards fall into blindneſs, it is no marvel that the ſtate of ſuch ſhould be worſe than that of thoſe who have not been ſo enlightened. I have ſeen ſo much hurt ſuſtained by ſome who have begun right, by not keeping to the ſimplicity and innocency they once knew and began in, that I cannot but greatly deſire our preſervation and perſeverance: and that with Joſhua we may reſolve, That, let others do what they will, we will to the utmoſt of our power follow on to know and ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>It is a ſhort time we have to be here, even the youngeſt: it will ſoon paſs over, and flee as a ſhadow, or as a poſt that haſteth by. How many ſtrong perſons do we ſee unexpectedly called away? Have we not had in our own meeting very recent inſtances? By the records of our burials, I find in one month buried four young men, aged 28, 20, 18, and 17 years, and two in the 37th year. Were we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to conſider our latter end, it might tend greatly to make us wiſe, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs every inordinate deſire. As I have dwelt pretty largely on this ſubject in the beginning of this addreſs, I ſhall not add
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017968_0016_0FA40A1AB663B8A8"/>much; my end in reſuming it being rather to ſet before us the uncertainty when, than the certainty of our diſſolution: being ſenſible of our aptneſs to put ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations afar off, eſpecially in the young, the healthy, and the ſtrong. But although the aged muſt die, the young may, and we ſee they do. How greatly, how eſſentially then doth it behove us to walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, not as fools, but like wiſe men, redeeming our time. It was nobly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by one of old, who ſaid, "All the days of my appointed time I will wait, until my change come." May you all be like minded: it will tend, I believe, to make your life comfortable, and your latter end peace.</p>
            <p>As to your demeanour in your outward affairs, nothing can ſo perfectly direct you therein, as keeping to the truth; nor can any thing elſe enable you to bear diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, which will unavoidably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Some points, however, it may not be amiſs to mention. Treat all, with whom you have to do, with meekneſs and calmneſs: a ſoft anſwer turns away anger, and a wrong is ſooner redreſſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged through a mild conduct than repreach. Imitate not thoſe in an higher
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017968_0017_0FA40A1B75CEBFF0"/>ſphere of life. Endeavour to live rather below than above your ſituations. I have often ſeen exceeding hurt to individuals in this particular, who might have been very comfortable, had they confined their way of life to their ſituation in it; but, by looking and aiming at an higher, have, to ſupport it, gone into hazardous undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, brought very great inconveniency on themſelves; and then have been ready to complain, and think their lot hard. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing I would obſerve to thoſe in ſmall circumſtances, who may be in trades and buſineſs, that they do not truſt their affairs in the hands of ſuch as are likewiſe but of ſmall circumſtances. Men of greater may run hazards not juſtifiable in them: if they have leſs buſineſs on account of their caution, it is to be preferred, rather than to riſque the little they have, where there may be a danger.</p>
            <p>And ſuch of you as may earn your bread with the ſweat of your brow, repine not at it. Remember, that godlineſs with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is great gain. Providence, in the all-wiſe diſpoſal of things, has more equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtowed his gifts than men perceive. The poor are exempt from many watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, toils, and fatigues, which the rich
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017968_0018_0FA40A1C34D9E458"/>experience; their food is pleaſant, and their reſt ſweet. The poſſeſſion of the truth will make all conditions happy; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it all is confuſion. The poor in this world, poſſeſſing theſe greater riches, will not repine for want of the leſſer: their bread will be ſure, and their water never fail, and they ſhall not even want outward bread. It will be a bleſſing to have to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to ſuch; and although at times their difficulties may appear great, ſuch will remember what the apoſtle ſaith, "That the time is ſhort, that they that weep be as though they wept not; and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy as though they poſſeſſed not:" and further, what he wrote to Timothy. "We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing food and raiment, let us be therewith content." Thus is verified what the ſame apoſtle wrote to his ſame beloved Timothy, "Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, (through contentment) and of that which is to come" (by its effects.)</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enlarge; a few ſhort hints may be better remembered than longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; nor have I any deſire to appear
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017968_0019_0FA40A1D304EB300"/>in this public manner: for could I have conveyed theſe advices as from an anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous writer, it would have ſuited my own inclination better; but I could not ſee how that might be done, ſo as to anſwer the end propoſed. Finally, therefore, let me recommend to you, my dear young friends, in the words of the apoſtle, "that ye be kindly-affectioned one to another in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, in honour preferring one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and the God of love and peace be with you all. Amen.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>LET me requeſt your attention to the following lines. The ſubject nearly concerns you.—Deſpiſe not the counſel of One who has often looked upon you with tender regard, and been ſecretly engaged on your account, that the many gracious viſitations of Divine love and mercy to you might be affectionately received, and duly prized by you. If you ſincerely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them in humble reſignation, and faithful obedience, the power of Truth will preſerve you, and the freſh ſprings of life increaſe, and eſtabliſh you in the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017968_0028_0FA40A26ACCC7D98"/>ſaving knowledge of God; but if you chuſe the ways of the world, and walk after the ſight of your eyes, and the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of your hearts, rejecting the gentle drawings and inward reproofs of his Holy Spirit, you not only forſake your own mercies for lying vanities, but alſo put a high indignity and affront upon the Sovereign Majeſty, the great Judge of the quick and dead, who is every where a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Obſerver of our conduct, and too jealous of his honour to ſuffer, without diſpleaſure, the froward will of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to have the preference in any, to his juſt and holy will; and who will not force thoſe into felicity who refuſe his gracious offers.</p>
            <p>Unleſs you take up your daily croſs to ſelfiſh indulgencies and carnal gratifications, you cannot be the diſciples of Chriſt, nor inherit thoſe enjoyments which are of a divine and permanent nature. <q>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if "ye through the Spirit do mortify the "deeds of the body, ye ſhall live. For "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons, or children, of God.</q> Rom. viii. To follow the Lamb, whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he leads, is the only way to true and laſting happineſs, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017968_0029_0FA40A2782F3EF88"/>deceitful flatteries of a degenerate world, and the deluſive perſuaſions of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The ſubtil enemy of your peace begins with fair ſhews and plauſible temptations, in things which, to inexperienced minds, appear of ſmall concern. He knows, ſhould he at once attempt you with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt iniquities and obvious impieties, it would ſhock your tenderneſs, and defeat his deſtructive intentions. He therefore ſeeks firſt to enſnare you, by ſecretly opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the complacency of your natural tempers, and your averſion to give diſguſt, by putting forward and heightening your natural deſires, rather to pleaſe than profit yourſelves and others, in your deportment and converſe; and alſo to betray you into an ill-grounded ſhame of godly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pious walking, and a breach of the due adherence to thoſe diſtinguiſhing peculiarities which the Truth has led its faithful followers into, and placed as an exterior hedge of preſervation about them. Theſe the blind world calls affected ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, and clowniſh abſurdities, and ſtyles the diſregard and diſuſe of them an innocent freedom, and prudent demeanor. Thus the inſiduous adverſary leads firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017968_0030_0FA40A283AD4B6F8"/>partial compliances, and proceeds by making every ſucceeding ſtep towards a captivating conformity, appear trivial, and of no conſequence. By this means he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes the weak and unwary gradually to aſſimilate with the world, in language, in dreſs, in behaviour, in the ſuperfluity and folly of its modes and faſhions, in its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt aſſociations, and poiſonous diverſions, the natural tendency of all which is to entangle, darken, and debaſe the mind, and by alienating it from the light and life of Chriſt, to render it ſo unguarded as to make way for the introduction of unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble connections, unhappy marriages, and, in brief, every kind of corruption and miſery.</p>
            <p>Be intreated therefore to beware, in time, of every approach towards a falſe liberty in the ſmalleſt matters, leſt they prove introductions to greater. Guard ſtrictly againſt every thing that would lead you to ſlight the tender touches and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of Divine Grace. Withdraw from alluring objects. To tamper at all with temptations, is to loſe ground. It is vain to imagine you can go what length you pleaſe, and no further; that you may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely temporize to a certain degree, or
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017968_0031_0FA40A28E72B2D08"/>to juſt ſuch a pleaſing point of compliance as you are now tempted to, in behaviour, dreſs, and language, in order to appear genteel, candid, well bred, intelligent, polite, and to eſcape the diſagreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of falſe ſhame, and the reflections of being ſtupid, muliſh, and Quaker-like. This leads into liberty, but it is the liberty of the fleſh, which is in reality the bondage of corruption.</p>
            <p>Content not yourſelves with a birth in the Society; but ſeek to ſecure a birthright in the Truth; without which the firſt will not avail you in the ſight of God. Let the Spirit of Truth govern your inclinations; for whatever inclination you give your affection to, or paſſionately eſpouſe, will prove your maſter. Indulge not an eager curioſity; it led Dinah to diſhonour, and became the ruin of a city. Be cautious of your company; for that will affect both your manners and character, and eventual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your future ſtate. Humor not the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind in dreſſing your mortal, change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, uncertain bodies, beyond what truth warrants, and decency requires; for more is not decoration, but diſguiſe, which in the ultimate runs into deformity, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters offence to him who reſiſteth the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017968_0032_0FA40A2A485A1B78"/>proud, but increaſeth grace to the humble. Flatter not the vanity of thoſe who look for a plural addreſs to themſelves, whilſt they treat their Maker in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; as if Infinite Omnipotence was leſs, or leſs worthy, than the poor creature, whoſe very breath and being is not one moment at his own diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>I would beſeech you, who are conſcious that you have already been turned aſide or ſtumbled at the croſs, proceed no further, but fly to the great Redeemer, who ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully condeſcended from the heights of immortal Glory, took a painful humanity upon him, and bled for us, that he might bring us to celeſtial enjoyments, and for that end trod the moſt thorny paths, and left us the faireſt example of humility, meekneſs, reſignation, purity, and the moſt perfect plainneſs in every reſpect. Slight not the pattern he ſet, but follow it, for his bleſſed ſake, and the ſecurity of your own happineſs; ſhun all the gilded baits, the fair ſeeming careſſes of a deluſive world, in ſmall matters as well as great, for they are all one in nature, tho' different in degree. Beware of the little foxes; they crop the tender buddings of the vine of life. Studiouſly avoid all friendſhips, flatteries,
