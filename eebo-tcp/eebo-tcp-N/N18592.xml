            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SKETCHES ON ROTATIONS OF CROPS.</head>
            <p>UPON visiting a farmer, lately, I found he had been designing a System of Farming, according to principles which tend to preserve the richness of the soil, and even improve it; which give more of income, and admit of a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of steady pleasant employment, with less of the perplexing and disagreeable extremes of great hurry in work at some times, and but little call for it at others. He asked for my assistance: but as this was in the moment of leaving him, his request could not then be complied with. I, however, intended to write to him concerning Rotations of Crops; and now address to him, and to other improving farmers, the following sketches.</p>

               <head>OF THE ENGLISH OLD SYSTEM OF CROPS.</head>
               <p>UNTIL about the middle of the present cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury one of the best common courses of farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in England consisted of a fallow, which, however, left the soil exposed to the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sun during the hottest season, without any shading crop: on this wheat was sowed; peas or beans followed the wheat crop; then barley (or oats or both) in rotation, on one moiety of the farm, during ten or twenty years: the other moiety being at the same time in common pasture grasses. When a change was to be made, the moiety in grass was ploughed and prepared; and then thrown into the rotation of crops as above; and that which had been in crops, was sown with mixed grass seeds (not clover) to lay as before ten or twenty years. The whole arable or ploughable part of the farm was thus divided into moieties, or nearly so, exclusive of the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead and standing meadow. So that a farm of 300 acres (besides homestead and meadow) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of 150 acres in grass, lay or old field, and 150 in crops. Their fields bearing crops were seldom equal in quantity: but it is here convenient to consider them so:

               <p>HERE the crops are the same as the preceeding—but the course is different. In that the clover is annual; in this it continues two years, and is inferior to the former. Clover only <hi>one</hi> year on the ground, is the most recent course. When it is continued two or more years, it lets in weeds and some binding of the ground, to a degree which occasioned the saying, that the ground becomes "clover sick."
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024129_0008_0FC3B1E79AED5368"/>
But <hi>yearly</hi> renewing the clover, in the rotation of crops, neither admits of weeds or a binding of the ground. The clover in this case, being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently thick and well sowed, effectually shades and mellows the soil, without having time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it to decline.</p>

                  <p>THE greatest quantity of grain produced in a <hi>rotation</hi> is not alone a proof of its being the best system. A large quantity of good meadow will yield much hay. It is a sin against good husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry to sell off the hay of a farm. Numbers of cattle well fed and well littered, give the manure requisite for invigorating the soil: but numbers
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024129_0018_0FC3B1FF95B59630"/>
of cattle cannot be kept in good condition, <hi>through the year,</hi> unless clover or grass as well as hay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. The summer food and that of the winter are to bear a due proportion to each other. No IX. may be a better system than No. VIII. for a farm having a great quantity of standing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meadow. It has near a third more of clover for summer food; will keep more cattle, and at the same time is more favourable to the soil.</p>
                  <p>IT is reasonable to expect that the better cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses No. VI. VII. VIII. and IX. will yield, by the acre, more of every article of produce than the inferior course No. V. But they are here stated alike. Of the several sorts of white beans I have only cultivated the white dwarf or bush bean in my fields, in rows 18 inches apart. They considerably shaded the ground, but not so fully as I wished. I therefore intended to have tried white beans that would run and <hi>shelter</hi> the ground entirely, after being horsehoed with a shim<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Shims</hi> (or <hi>Skims</hi>) are in various forms as may please the farmer. In general it is a hoe drawn by a horse. The blade of the one I used was 12 inches wide, and was welded to a coulter on each side of it. Two slilts are fastened to the coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with screws and nuts, which are shifted to different holes for setting the shim to go deaper or shallower in the ground. It is not used in half ploughed ground: but this having been previously well ploughed and harrowed, the shim runs 3 or 4 inches deep, and crumbles the earth into such minute parts that, as it proceeds, the earth seems to pour over the blade of the shim like water. A coarse rake, or small harrow, of 4 or 5 teeth, hangs to the tail of the shim and is drawn after it. The two coulters or side standards seemed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the growing vines, when they were advanced to a considerable size. But I never saw any real damage from it. A single standard of wood or iron would be clear of even full grown vines. I did not always hill or ridge up potatoes and beans, nor even maiz. But it is well to edge up some mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quantity of earth to plants cultivated in rows with the horsehoe or the shim. The intention whereof is to smother infant weeds, which have but just broke out close to the crop, and beyond the reach of the shim. Hills and ridges are not otherwise so advantageous as is commonly thought: and there are advantages in keeping the ground of summer crops nearly level. A slip of iron is made to shift off and on each side of the blade of the shim, for edging up light ridges of earth. The shim is an excellent instrument against young weeds; but is insufficient where grass and weeds have obtained strength. When the ground is in good condition, it rids off a vast deal of work, very satisfactorily.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024129_0019_0FC3B20097A7FFF0"/>
as long as that instrument could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to pass between the rows to advantage. Parting with my farm prevented this experiment. It is said that white beans are generally in great demand in Madeira and the southern countries of Europe. I have seen letters from Barcelona, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the price of "white beans" higher than of wheat. Other sorts of American beans as well as several sorts of American peas, I have cultivated;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024129_0020_0FC3B2021EACE3D8"/>
and the crops of all sorts were rather precarious; peas generally more so than beans. Until some other plant shall be introduced that will answer the purposes better than beans, for a fallow crop, the farmer ought to think nothing of 6 or 8 shs. a bushel for them to be applied to produce a <hi>shading,</hi> ameliorating article of fallow, although not a seed should ever be gained from them: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the system being so very important! But a worthy person assured me, she used to cultivate country peas or beans (I am not certain which) till the pods were well filled and the fruit partly ripe, and then she pulled up or cut and cured the haulm or vines, with the pods on, and these were stacked or stored and given to milch cows in the course of the winter; and they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, she added, to other food for increasing the quantity of milk and butter, and for improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their quality. It is not uncommon for the active, spirited class of farmers in England, to sow the seeds of various plants, merely for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their soil; such as vetches, tares,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Vetches</hi> and <hi>Tares</hi> are different names for the same pulse. The varieties are great. Generally, they are divided into winter and summer vetches. Consult Mr. <hi>Anderson'</hi>s Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He speaks of sorts that are perpetual. I would prefer a vetch hardy enough to bear our winters the best, and that withal is of quick and luxuriant growth and ripens early, whether it be of the perennial kind or not. If we had such a plant, we might then fully practise the "round and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete" mode mentioned in page 22 of these sketches. I have tried one sort of winter vetch (the seed from England). The seeds were sowed in two successive autumns. The ground was rather of the sort called "waterholding," and only about half of the plants stood through the winters.</note> peas,

buckwheat, &amp;c.—These, whilst growing, <hi>shade</hi> the fallow, and when ploughed in, they ferment and open the soil. Such also are the effects from <hi>clover;</hi> which having wheat sown on <hi>one</hi> plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, is followed with extraordinary crops. I cannot defer here mentioning, from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and judicious Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> a very excellent course of shade and green dressing on the same ground, preparative to a corn crop; by which seeds for producing three crops were sown on the same ground, between autumn and autumn, with only three ploughings, thus: Winter <hi>tares</hi> were sowed in September with one ploughing: they were reaped early in the next summer: then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>buckwheat</hi> was sowed on one ploughing and harrowing: the buckwheat was ploughed in<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Buckwheat</hi> is to be ploughed in before it seeds, lest a new growth becomes a weed to the crop of corn. The Partridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea, Aquamaque or Magothy-bay bean, has wonders imputed to it as an ameliorater of the light sandy lands in the penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula of Virginia. In size and other particulars the plant may be considered as being a Lilliputian locust tree. For, altho' it is an annual, yet its stem is a hard locust-like wood; and its leaves, flowers, pods and seeds greatly resemble those of that tree. The woody hardness of the plant is in appearance against its being a choice ameliorater, as it is not likely to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and as it were melt away in the ground, so soon as buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheat and other juicy soft substances. No plant, however, can exceed the <hi>shade</hi> it gave on a piece of ground in my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. A Lilliputian might have been there lost in darkness.

in September; and wheat was sowed on this, on one ploughing; the crop whereof was great. <q>Thus, as the spring advances and the sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes powerful enough to exhale the humidity and with it the nutritious particles of the land, the crop (which was from a fall sowing) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and screens it from the action of his beams. Whatever weeds are in the soil, vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with the young tares, and are either strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by their luxuriance, or cut off with them before they can seed. This crop is cleared from the land so early that the soil would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main exposed to the sun through the most burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the summer for three months; and if so left exposed, the three ploughings would do mischief, except in killing some weeds.

               <p>THIS is an important article in the improved system of crops: but its bearing some price or costing some labour to obtain it, renders it a bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to common husbandmen, whose habits have diverted them from the large use of it. It is indeed absolutely necessary, that it should be a common crop in rotation with other articles of crop.

would be lessened. If 4lbs. of clean clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seed, when sown with such a box as is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed below, clothe the ground as well with plants as 10 or 12lbs. sown in the common broad-cast way, of which I have had a little experience, then a bushel of seed will sow 15 acres; which is a cost of only 5 shillings an acre. Thirty loads of dung per acre (<hi>unbought</hi>) would cost the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer four times as much for loading, carrying and dispersing them on the field; and, if bought, many times more. He can manure, or ameliorate 100 acres with clover more certainly than he can 20 from his dungheap; and moreover in the time that his clover is sheltering the soil, perspiring its excrementitious effluvia on the ground, dropping its putrid leaves, and mellowing the ground with its tap roots, it gives full food to the stock of cattle, keeps them in heart, and increases the dunghill. Nor is the amelioration by clover very inferior to that by dung, as this is commonly managed. In some respects it is preferable. With dung, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable seeds of weeds are carried out and sown on the fields: not so of clover, when <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

THE farmer, to whom these sketches are more immediately addressed, gave me a pleasing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of some improvements in the method of gathering and cleaning clover seed. But my memory has not retained enough of it to enable me to describe them particularly. In general, the clover heads are rippled off by a simple ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, moved by a horse, so as to gather and throw into a carriage the seed of 5 acres in a day. The heads are carried to an oil-mill, (having two stones rolled in the manner of tanners bark stones) which separates from the haulm, full five bushels a day.</p>
               <p>TWO fields, 50 acres each, being in clover, one or a part of one may be kept up for giving seed in August, after cutting and feeding off the early growth. In 10 days the seed may be gathered at a small expence; and in 10 more 50 bushels may be separated from the haulm, and cleaned with a san, or with sieves. Whatever may be the medium produce, I count on only one bushel of seed from an acre. Of this seed 7 to 10 or more bushels may be sown on the two fifty acre fields in wheat and barley; say 10 bushels sown; other 10 bushels may be kept, lest there should happen to be a failure of seed in the next crop.</p>

A BOX for sowing clover seed on wheat <hi>beds</hi> (rather than ridges) seven feet wide, including the water or opening furrow, was made of light half inch plank, for the sides, bottom and divisions. It was seven feet long, five or six inches wide, that the seed, laying thin, may easily shift about and not press heavily on the outlet holes. It was three inches deep, and was divided into seven parts, each division or receptacle having two holes bored through the bottom, half an inch in diameter, and placed diagonally; the holes were then singed with a hot iron rod to smooth them; square pieces of strong writing-paper were pasted over the holes, on the inside of the box; these had, each of them, a hole burnt through with coarse knitting needles: it is tried then, with seed shook gently through the holes as you walk on a floor or carpet; and the holes are enlarged by the same hot knitting needles, as far as there may be occasion for dropping a due quantity of seed. It was used for sowing other small, round seeds, (as turnip and mustard seeds,) the old papers being taken of, and new ones pasted on, and then holes burnt suitable to the seeds. At about a third of the distance from each end of the box, were fastened strong leather straps; by which the box was held, and a little agitated in carrying it before the seedsman, in a direction crossing the beds or
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024129_0027_0FC3B20C8AE84838"/>
ridges, whilst the seedsman walked along the beds.</p>
               <p>THE only comparative experiment, made by me, of clover seed sown with the hand box above described, against broadcast sowing, was thus: In the moment when a seedsman, long used to sow clover seed, was sowing seed in the chaff at the rate of 12 lbs. of clean seed, according to his estimation, I sowed clean seed on several lands or ridges with the box. After sowing about 200 yards in length, the seed put into the box did not appear reduced in quantity, and I feared it was sown too thin. But the growth of clover from the box sowing, proved to be thicker and much more equally distant, plant from plant, than that from the broadcast, and the plants were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently close. These operations left the seeds on the top earth, of the same field of wheat, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any means used to cover them. The time of sowing was about the middle of March, whilst there were yet light frosts. It was a season in which I had often sowed clover seed in the chaff, and left it uncovered, without ever experiencing any loss. When clean clover seeds are sown on a clean ground and harrowed in, numbers are smothered under small lumps of earth, as well as under large ones—not so of seed left on the ground uncovered, <hi>during the frosts,</hi> in March rather than earlier. It therefore seems proper
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024129_0028_0FC3B20E197C71D0"/>
that much more than 4 lbs. an acre should be sowed, when the seed is to be <hi>covered.</hi>

               <p>LET not the novelty or labor of sowing beans in field husbandry, be made a difficulty to the application of them in a system of crops. They may be dropped by hand. But a simple and cheap machine may be made for dropping them in clusters as quick as a horse drawing it can walk. Two wheels, made of an inch plank doubled, turn an axis, of about 5 inches diameter, having notches on one line round it, from each of which 3 or 4 beans are discharged at the same time into a furrow opened by a ploughshare or wooden coulter, the ground having been first well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red—a stave or a little rake, at the tail of the drill, covering the furrow at the same time. If the wheels are two feet in diameter, they will have a circumference of 75 inches, which divided by 10½ inches give 7 for the number of notches round the axis, for dropping the seeds at 10½ inches a-part in the rows.—I drilled beans with such an instrument.</p>

               <p>THE crop stood well and yielded satisfactorily.

In some cases the rolling may be dispensed with, and would be better omitted; as on heavy ground in a moist state of it.

ONE of my neighbours intending to sow wheat on clover, ploughed up the clover a week or two before seeding time, and then gave it a second ploughing, a-cross, and sowed wheat on it; but whether this was ploughed in or harrowed in, I know not. Vast numbers of roots of the clover were left standing erect above ground, all over the field, and had a disagreeable appearance. Here was some unnecessary labour, a useless and even an injurious ploughing, whereby the manure from those substantial roots and a part of the green herbage, so turned out by the second ploughing, was lost to the crop.</p>

               <p>SUBMITTING these facts to the consideration of farmers, I have only to recommend, that they endeavour to have their clover grow sufficiently thick on the ground, and that it be suffered to remain only one summer, exclusive of the year when the preceding crop of grain was reaped, and upon which grain-field the clover seed was sown.</p>

               <head>OF FARM-YARD MANURE.</head>
               <p>To conduct the business of a farm to full ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, we must excercise our reasoning facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and build up principles which systemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally embrace such a regular course of particulars as will best follow and depend on each other for obtaining the one whole of the design of farming. It is not immediate product alone that we aim at: for, whilst we wish to obtain repeated full crops, our reason assures us it is indispensably necessary to that end, that the soil be preserved in full vigor. The mind then is employed, principally, on the objects of preservation and improvement of the productive powers of the earth. Observations on the state of common farming fix the opinion, that in general no unconnected, random pursuits tend to ensure a succession of advantageous hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry for any length of time.</p>
               <p>WELL chosen rotations of crops together with due culture, are believed to be so favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ground, as to need but little addition of manure, in comparison of what the common random crops absolutely demand. Still the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of manures is held to be an essential branch of farming, a great link of the chain, in every instance. If very rich soils require, comparatively, but a moderate quantity, in a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024129_0033_0FC3B21589C2B7E0"/>
rotation, where ameliorating crops are prevalent, yet middling and poor soils want all that can be obtained; and, under the <hi>old courses,</hi> all soils eagerly demand <hi>more manure than can be procured.</hi> These exhausting courses, we see, are continually impoverishing our farms. Too many farmers, therefore, incline to move to fresh lands; where they would precisely act the same murderous part over again.</p>
               <p>THE two principal links in good farming, are proper <hi>Rotations of Crops,</hi> which are treated of above; and <hi>Manures,</hi> of which it is wished the occasion would admit of more than the few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations that follow.</p>
               <p>"IN the American practice, <hi>bay and fodder are stacked in the fields;</hi> and the cattle are <hi>fed round the stacks and fodder houses:</hi> the disadvantages whereof are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>wasteful</hi> use of the provender;</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE <hi>dung</hi> lying <hi>as it dropped</hi> without <hi>straw,</hi> or other vegetable substance brought to it, the manure is little in quantity; and</p>
               <p n="3">3. THAT little <hi>not lying in heaps,</hi> is reduced abundantly by <hi>exhalation</hi> and <hi>rain;</hi> leaving scarce any thing to the soil.</p>
               <p>IN the English and Flemish practice (feebly observed by a few of our husbandmen) cattle are carefully <hi>housed,</hi> or otherwise confined to a fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024129_0034_0FC3B21703B63DB8"/>
(straw yard) in which are <hi>shelters</hi> against cold rains, during the whole winter, and as far through the spring as food will last: the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of which are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A fair expenditure of the provender, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waste:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Less exhaustion</hi> of the juices; because of the dung lying together in <hi>large heaps:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The dung being mixed with the <hi>straw,</hi> and other vegetable substances brought to the beasts as <hi>litter,</hi> the whole is trod together, and forms a large quantity of very valuable manure.</p>
               <p>IT may be no exaggeration to affirm, that the <hi>difference</hi> in the quantities of manure obtained from an equal stock of cattle by these several methods, may be as three to one. If six acres may be annually manured by the inferior method, then may eighteen by the superior. Now on a supposition that <hi>manured land is kept in heart five years</hi> without repeating, in the one case but thirty acres will always remain in good order; in the other ninety acres: A very important difference! Indeed it is all the difference between an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman's poverty and his riches."<note n="*" place="bottom">THE above quoted passage is from a friend, who wished me to accompany the TREATISE ON ROTATIONS OF CROPS, with one on FARM-YARD MANURE. The piece is a little altered; and I had inserted "ten for one" instead of three to one. On shewing him the alterations, he humorously said—<q>I object to nothing but your multiplication of 10 for 1, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of my 3 to 1; not, but that it is absolutely true: but then people contract their eyes (the mind's eye) just in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the light that enters:—10 to 1, might alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether shut them up,—perhaps they blink even at my 3 to 1.</q> Both of us are, however, well assured, that 10 to 1 does not exceed the proportion that has been experienced.</note>

Do cattle, when foddered round hay-stacks and fodder-houses or ricks, give twelve large loads of manure (forty heaped bushels) each? do they yield <hi>one</hi> such load? It is an established fact that, in the course of a winter, cattle do yield full twelve such loads; and if soiled or fed well, during the summer, with green cut grass or clover, they may be expected to yield more and richer manure; provided that in both cases they are <hi>kept up,</hi> on a <hi>full quantity of litter.</hi> Here, by the way, it may be noted that a lot of grass only sufficient to keep one beast in <hi>pasturing,</hi> has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced five or six in <hi>soiling:</hi> and what is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense importance to the state of the ground and of future crops, the ground being <hi>untrod,</hi> is left <hi>light</hi> and <hi>mellow.</hi> Another favourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance attends this method: the beasts are kept in <hi>shade,</hi> and considerably protected from flies, especially if the house be kept dark during the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024129_0036_0FC3B225195784B0"/>
heat of the day, with only air-holes near the ground and above their heads. But it will be said, the ground round the stacks receives the dung dropt, as a dressing to so much of the field. Alas! we know this extends to a very small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and even then the effects are in no part considerable. The place where, is some eminences the rains and winds of half the year wash away or evaporate from the frozen ground most of the rich substance of the winter's <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> dung so dropt about; and the ground is, when unfrozen, during all that time, trod down and poached, to a degree that nearly destroys the benefit remaining from the dung dropt. A fodder house (a hollow rick, made of maiz tops in the way of thatch) was set up in a field, as is usual; it was fenced in: at the south front of it the maiz was husked, and the husks were sheltered in the fodder-house; they were fed out in the course of the winter to cattle in front of the rick; in April, the rick or fodderhouse, being then empty, was pulled down, and the covering given to the cattle. The soil thus <hi>sheltered</hi> by the fodderhouse for six months (October to April) shewed marks of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, greatly superior to the ground on which the cattle <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> soddered during the same time: Grass, weeds and crops, during the four or five following years, shewed this in their great growth:
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024129_0037_0FC3B2260AEA8E40"/>
where the fodderhouse, 300 feet in length and 20 in breadth, stood and sheltered the ground, the richness of the soil was strongly marked, when but a faint superiority, over the common field, appeared where the cattle were fed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Litter</hi> is an essential, without which farm-yard manure is of no account; and unless it be in <hi>full proportion</hi> to the number of cattle, it is not thought highly of—but is as a half done thing. Good farmers in England deem <hi>full</hi> littering of such importance, that after reaping with sickles and inning their wheat, they chop the <hi>stubble</hi> with sithes, and stack it for litter, for their live stock. Besides the straw and stubble for litter, they apply to the same use, fern and such other vegetable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as they can procure; and they buy straw from common farmers who are not in the practice. In all countries, most farmers are careless of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement: they look not beyond their old habits.</p>
               <p>THE like materials may be so applied in America—straw, stubble, maiz stalks, fern, weeds before they seed, flags, wild oats, sea grass, leaves of trees, &amp;c. Our farmers say, "there is no manure in corn-stalks;"<note n="*" place="bottom">MAIZ stalks.</note> and they leave them standing in their fields. I have been used to draw them into my fold-yard, in the fall and during the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024129_0038_0FC3B22797C1F860"/>
winter; where they were laid thick, as litter to grown cattle, and were soon trod into a sponge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like state; in which condition they catch and <hi>retain</hi> the dung and <hi>urine</hi> of the cattle, so as to give a great quantity of manure, uncommonly rich.</p>
               <p>IN November, all the cattle are to be <hi>confined</hi> from wandering about the fields. The fold yard is then well littered; and as often as the litter is trod into the dung or is soaking wet, more litter is added; so that the beasts may always lay <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>dry.</hi> They are thus confined and littered till there is a full bite of grass in May. All the cattle that can, are to be under shelter from cold rains during that time. It is an indispensable measure that all horses and young cattle be so sheltered. Litter is to be given them as above.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>IN many situations, says Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> the dependance of a farm for manure, is on the straw yard. If in that case the farmer does not properly <hi>proportion</hi> his arable crops which <hi>feed</hi> cattle, to those which <hi>litter</hi> the yard; and both these to the quantity of his <hi>grass</hi> fields, the farm will be long before it gets well manured.</q>

               <p>THE beans, following clover, are drilled on <hi>one</hi> deep ploughing in June. The barley is sown in October, on <hi>one</hi> ploughing, the ground having been left clean and mellow after inning the beans. The wheat is sown in September on <hi>one</hi> plowing of the clover. What a saving of work! Three crops on only <hi>one</hi> ploughing for each, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at leisure! The beans are ploughed for in <hi>June;</hi> the wheat in <hi>September;</hi> the barley in <hi>October,</hi> or if preferred, in March. One of the crops is horsehoed or shimmed, without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the ploughings or other work in seeding the wheat or barley. The clover, which is to be ploughed up for beans, may be pastured,

               <p>ONE of the fields annually manured with 20 loads (40 heaped bushels each) of farm-yard dung, will take 400 loads: which may be more efficacious, to this rich soil, than 30 loads an acre to common land.

The straw of 40 acres of wheat and barley, will fall far short of this. The deficiency is to be otherwise sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.

               <p>IT is advantageous to a farm, and of some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate income, to have on it as numerous a stock of cattle as can be kept <hi>well,</hi> and no more than can be <hi>so</hi> kept: It is better to have too few than too many: Yet, in parts of America, farmers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly disproportion their cattle to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender—they will have numbers of hidebound creatures, of which more die from the mere want of food and shelter, than are sold or eaten: So that less meat and less manure are derived from a great number so poorly kept, than other farmers have from a due proportion in a smaller number well kept. Besides, does not the man feel shame in the cruelty of <hi>starving</hi> and keeping in a state of want and misery, a fellow-creature committed to his care?

largely with straw) are 2½ feet wide at top, and slope to the bottom which is of brick; 3 feet long; 8 or 9 inches deep: The bottom of brick is on the ground: No rack: Every stall is 6 feet wide, for two cows; 8 for 2 bulls: In each cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the stalls is a smooth post with a ring larger than the post, for sliding easily up and down: A chain, not a foot long, connects with the ring, and also with a chain collar round the beast's neck, which locks with a T: The cattle can but just reach their food next to the division between the two beasts. Three feet for each cow, is better than more room: In this they lay down: More space would admit of their dirtying each the other: Their standing is 6 feet; and behind is a step 5 or 6 inches down to where the dung falls. The house is cleaned once a day; and the cattle are driven twice to water. He has 45 in one place, so tied up; and they are fed and taken care of by one man and one boy.</p>
               <p>Cows in milk are not to want water. In this climate, they ought to be watered three times a day. Their water ought to be near; as driving cows any distance, is very injurious to their milk. In page 39, 200lbs of butter are allowed to each cow on this fine farm. In England, dairy cows are allowed to give from 200 to 400lbs.</p>

WHILST the present little work is at press, I have again visited this farm. The tenant, after inning his wheat crop, has <hi>mowed</hi> and <hi>secured</hi> the <hi>stubble:</hi> the motives whereof were to preserve his young clover, which was sown on the wheat last spring, from being smothered by the rank stubble, and to use the stubble as <hi>litter</hi> to his beasts; of which he has thirty that by November may weigh 800lbs. each.<note n="*" place="bottom">THESE were bought poor, last spring. He keeps of cows no more than for family milk and butter; and raises no cattle.</note> This is the first instance that I have known of <hi>stubble</hi> being cut in America, with any view to <hi>littering</hi> cattle! He thinks that had it not been for a stroke of rust, he should have reaped 35 bushels of wheat an acre: as it is, he expects near 30 bushels. This farmer has here given an important lesson, for those who are disposed to second their judgment with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined exertion!<note n="†" place="bottom">SOME wheat and young clover where raked up with the stubble; and the whole is sheltered under sheds, where it makes a pleasing appearance. The quantity drawn in was 10 heaped waggon loads, well bound down, from 6 acres. Such loads ought to contain 1300 each, but allowing them to be 1000, they give 10,000; or per acre near 1700lbs. of <hi>stubble.</hi> The straw and the chaff of this stout wheat may be at the rate of 90lbs. for every bushel of wheat; and these multiplied by 30 give 2700lbs, of straw and chaff an acre; to which and the <hi>stubble</hi> saved 1700, the whole is 4400lbs. an acre. The above design for this farm, supposes 40 acres in wheat and barley: were they all in wheat there would be 176,000lbs. of straw, chaff and stubble: but, 20 of the acres being in barley, let us deduct 46,000, and say 130,000lbs. at 1300 for a load: we then have 100 loads of straw, chaff and <hi>stubble;</hi> and are only 30 loads short of a <hi>full</hi> littering, for giving 12 loads of dung each beast. The 30 loads of litter wanted, are to be maiz stalks, &amp;c. The quantity of straw and stubble to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in crops, can only be estimated, at great uncertainty, because of the various growth that crops take in different years. The stubble in the present case was high and close, on uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly good land. In the Museum Rusticum, and in the Octavo Vol. of Select Papers from it, are accurate accounts of a crop of wheat, and of the proportions of straw and chaff to the wheat.</note>
