            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I SHALL not make any apology for what is here offered to the public, the importance of the ſubjects being ſufficient to juſtify the inveſtigation thereof. On reading the forementioned pamphlet, I obſerved, that whatever reaſons the author had met with (which divers worthy members of our religious ſociety have with chriſtian ingenuity given thereon) they have fell ſhort of convincing his underſtanding of the rectitude of our ſentiments in the reſpects treated on; which is no indication of want of ability, but want of opportunity; for it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they ſhould adapt anſwers to every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that in future might be made; or that they ſhould do the work of their day and ours alſo. An idea like this, entertained in an unbelieving heart, has in many ages greatly retarded the reformation, which as yet has made but little progreſs, for the world ſtill lies in wickedneſs. I am not inſenſible of the difficulty attendant on combating with popular opinions, flowing from the influence of education, and ſupported by the cuſtom of many ages: it is imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:022648_0003_0FB9C0AA8EAE2208"/>whether thoſe cuſtoms be well or ill founded, with reſpect to their detention of the mind, they equally militate againſt things offered not coincident therewith; many of my readers being of this claſs, it would be irrational to ſuppoſe, that ſuch will be wholly diveſted of prejudices, ſo as to be impartial in the examination of the ſubjects hereafter treated on: when the ſentiments of the reader ſtand oppoſed to the matters propoſed, except he can ſuſpend them during the conſideration, he will be under an utter incapacity of weighing things in the balance of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is the unbiaſſed only that can judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.</p>
            <p>As heaven is higher than the earth, ſo in like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion are the things pertaining to ſalvation ſuperior to temporal conſiderations; of which number I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the following matters to be. As to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which Francis Herr endeavours to prove to be the everlaſting Word of God, I have endeavoured to diſcriminate between them and the everlaſting Word; but if any will have them called the Word, they ought for diſtinction to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them the written Word, for they are not everlaſting. As to water Baptiſm, which F. H. endeavours to prove to be an ordinance of Chriſt, commanded and enjoined by him to be perpetuated and practiſed on all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I have endeavoured to demonſtrate it to be John's diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>As to the heavenly Baptiſm which Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, I believe it neceſſary to be experienced by every ſon and daughter of Adam, ere they can enter the kingdom of heaven. How important then muſt it be, to be rightly underſtood! Is it not high time, that men ſhould entertain a jealouſy reſpecting cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Baptiſm, inaſmuch as it has proved no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt ſin, and fruitleſs of ſalvation? To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine preciſely whether our Lord commanded water or
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:022648_0004_0FB9C0AC93ED5950"/>the Spirit for this purpoſe, is what I have principally aimed at, and ſhall leave the reader to judge of my ſucceſs. As to the order of time referred to, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſactions mentioned in Scriptures, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on its chronology. In treating on the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able kingdom of Chriſt, I have not attempted it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively, except in two or three inſtances near the concluſion, but have endeavoured to illuſtrate the way and manner, by which I believe his kingdom will be advanced in the earth, which I think is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſcripture teſtimony, and the ſpreading of primitive Chriſtianity. In all which my deſign has been more to clear the truth from miſapprehenſions, and long practiſed uneſſential ordinances, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult in a victory over my opponent; therefore I have omitted taking notice of ſeveral plain contradictions in his pamphlet.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I. <hi>Reſpecting the Scriptures.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the firſt place, reſpecting the Scriptures, our writings at large fully exhibit our ſenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of them to the world; we eſteem them an hiſtorical relation, in which is included an unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled train of memorable events (viz.) the majeſty, power, and greatneſs of the Almighty, in the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the univerſe; his laws, commandments, teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies, mercies, and judgments, diſpenſed to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, intermixed with the moral actions and ſayings of men of various deſcriptions, for the ſpace of above 4000 years.</p>
               <p>The world abounds with hiſtories of an inferior kind, ſo that few are at a loſs to know, that a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is only a deſcription or declaration of a thing, and not the thing itſelf. Therefore the Scriptures are not the everlaſting Word; for John ſaith, "In the beginning was the Word;" <note n="*" place="bottom">John i. 1, 2, 3.</note> but the Scriptures
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022648_0006_0FB9C0B192C918E8"/>were not in the beginning: "And the Word was with God:" but the bible was not with him. "And the Word was God:" but it would be very impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſay, that the Scriptures were God. "The ſame was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." But the bible never made any thing, viſible nor inviſible. "And the Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us." <note n="*" place="bottom">John i. verſe 14.</note> &amp;c. but the Scriptures never became fleſh. I humbly think the Apoſtle here furniſhes every unprejudiced reader with materials, that with indubitable clearneſs diſcriminate between the everlaſting Word and thoſe ſacred repoſitories. The commandments were given for a guide to frail man; and the law, as Paul ſaith, "was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions." <note n="†" place="bottom">Galatians iii. 19.</note> And Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the earlieſt writer that we know of, lived about 2500 years after the beginning alluded to by the Apoſtle, therefore the books under notice are not that Word, becauſe the moſt antient of them were not in the beginning; but this Word was the ſame which Moſes directed the attention of Iſrael to, when he ſaid, "the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayeſt do it." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Deut. xxx. 14.</note> This inſpeaking Word not only ſtrove with the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites and the Antediluvians, but alſo with all the offspring of Adam, being nigh unto them in their hearts, &amp;c. both before and ſince the Scriptures were wrote. Paul ſaith, "The manifeſtation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given to every man to profit withal." <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Cor. xx. 7.</note> That this could not be the Scriptures, is abundantly evident, becauſe from the beginning to this day, the greater part of mankind have not had the benefit of them. David ſays, "Thy Word is very pure,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022648_0007_0FB9C0B510D78DD0"/>therefore thy ſervant loveth it." <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm cxix. 140.</note> This could not be ſaid of any of the books then extant, becauſe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hinted, there are many relations of matters and ſayings included, that are moral in their nature, and ſome of them ſpeeches of impious men and women, and conſequently remote from purity; ſuch as the ſpeech of Lamech to his two wives, of Joſeph's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs to her huſband, of Korah in his rebellion againſt Moſes, alſo of Goliath, Saul, the Witch of Endor, Shimei, &amp;c. This Word, which was without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end of days, the Scriptures ſpeak large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of; but I do not underſtand any of the ſacred writers in the ſenſe our author does, neither can I find, that they deſigned to have them conſidered as the Word to which they impute ſuch wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but through them to direct men to the Word for guidance and inſtruction. Obſerve our Lord's reproof to the Jews (viz.) "Ye have not his Word abiding in you; for whom he hath ſent, him ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtify of me, and ye will not come unto me that ye might have life." <note n="†" place="bottom">John v. 38.</note> Perhaps no people in the world were more ſtudious in the Scriptures than they were, which is evident from their expectations thro' them to obtain eternal life; yet our Lord plainly told them, that they had not his Word abiding in them, which is a ſufficient proof, that he did not call the Old Teſtament the Word. The Apoſtle Paul tells us, that "The Sword of the Spirit, is the Word of God." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. vi. 17.</note> Alſo, "The Word is quick and powerful, &amp;c. ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022648_0008_0FB9C0BB8AFE83A0"/>is there any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do." <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. iv. 12, 13.</note> Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that any enlightened man can be ſo ignorant, as to ſuppoſe that the Old and New Teſtament is here meant, or that they have ſuch power and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of knowing, dividing aſunder and diſcerning; ſurely no—for the ſame Apoſtle ſaid, "Our ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is of God, who alſo hath made us able miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the New Teſtament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth life." <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. iii. 5, 6, 7.</note> "But if the miniſtration of death writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and engraven in ſtones was glorious," &amp;c. Here the Apoſtle, by repreſenting the commandments writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the finger of God, as the miniſtration of death, plainly proves, that it was the letter of the Scriptures which he meant that killeth; thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting a caution to the believers, that they might not place their truſt and dependance on any written preſcriptions, but on the Word or Spirit which only giveth life. It was through a bare adherance unto, and unwarrantable expectations from the Scriptures, that rendered the Jews lifeleſs and deſtitute of the Word, or a right knowledge of them; and many ſince them have erred on that ground. They doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thought as our author and many others do, that the Scriptures were the Word, as their high expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations evince; for nothing below that all-creating power could adminiſter life, therefore they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſenſible, in a ſtate where woful diſappointment inevitably awaited them.</p>
               <p>Since by the Word all things were created and are ſuſtained, viſible and inviſible; and that it was that Rock and Foundation that followed and conducted Iſrael in their movements in the wilderneſs, which
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022648_0009_0FB9C0C026816FE8"/>the Apoſtle ſays was Chriſt then it was the Word in the beginning that ſpake, and ſaid, let it be ſo, and it was ſo. The words ſpoken were the words of the Word, and not the Word itſelf, as ſome of the moſt remarkable paſſages in Scripture evince, where the Almighty vocally uttered the commandments and ſtatutes, &amp;c. to Iſrael: he called them the words, but not the Word (viz.) "Theſe are the words which thou ſhalt ſpeak unto the Children of Iſrael." <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xix. 6, 7.</note> "All theſe words which the Lord commanded him." "And God ſpake all theſe words, ſaying, I am the Lord thy God," <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xx. 1, 2.</note> &amp;c. "And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, write thou theſe words; for after the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of theſe words," &amp;c. "And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. xxxiv. 27, 28.</note> "Theſe are the words which the Lord hath commanded," <note n="§" place="bottom">Exod. xxxv. 1.</note> &amp;c. "And theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart," <note n="‖" place="bottom">Deut. vi. 6.</note> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Francis Herr thinks he has proved ſomething in the following quotations (viz.) "And this is the Word of the Lord." "Hear ye the Word of the Lord." "The Word of the Lord came alſo unto me." "The Word of the Lord came unto me," &amp;c. with divers more to the ſame import; to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the words of Chriſt, who is the Word, "For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you." <note n="¶" place="bottom">Matt. x. 20.</note> From which it is plain, that the Prophets and Servants of the Moſt High were not miſtaken, when they informed thoſe to whom they were ſent, that they had the Word of the Lord; for his Spirit was upon them, and his power, which is the Word, was with them. They were only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, choſen and prepared vehicles, through which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022648_0010_0FB9C0C256C04B88"/>the Word ſpake: it would be equally true to ſay, it was not them that ſpake, but the Word that ſpake through them, for the Spirit of Chriſt ſpake through the Prophets under the law, for "The Prophets have enquired," &amp;c. "Searching what or what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them did ſignify, when it teſtified beforehand the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, and the glory that ſhould follow." <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 10, 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Behold in what point of view Peter and John con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Word, "Being born again, not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever." "But the Word of the Lord endureth for ever, and this is the Word which by the goſpel is preached unto you." <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 23, 25.</note> Which Word is Chriſt—for as St. Paul ſaith, "We preach not ourſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord," <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv. 5.</note> &amp;c. Again: "I have written unto you young men, becauſe ye are ſtrong, and the Word of God abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you," <note n="§" place="bottom">1 John xi. 14.</note> &amp;c. From all which it is abundantly evident, that the Saints when ſpeaking of the Word, did not mean any written preſcriptions, however a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, but the power, ſenſible preſence, and Spirit of God, which they often expreſſed under various ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, which impreſs our minds with ideas of wonderful efficacy, incomprehenſible power, imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate purity, and eternal exiſtence, and not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable by mortals, therefore not any thing reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ink and paper, things deſtitute of power, and incapable of motion.</p>
               <p>This is a clear point, that all that has ever been uttered or written for man's inſtruction, from the foundation of the world; or that ever will be to the lateſt period of time, are included under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of records, teſtimonies, or declarations of God's Spirit; and that all viſible and material
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022648_0011_0FB9C0C680D7CE18"/>things muſt terminate. "For the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up." <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Peter iii. 10.</note> This will doubtleſs be verified, literally as well as myſtically, but the Word will ſtand and abide for ever.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations, however oppoſite to popular ideas, are I think well founded upon, and plainly deducible from Scripture, free from any ſubtilty or unwarrantable philoſophy; and in my ſenſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writers have ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed the words uttered from that All-powerful Word from whence they proceeded; and it is equally neceſſary for us to continue proper diſtinctions, otherwiſe we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found cauſes with their effects, and finally land in perplexity: and wherein are the Scriptures depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, by the term of Holy writ? Holy is an high epithet; it is imputed to the Great Firſt Cauſe, and therefore cannot degrade the effects; and we think it unſafe for us, who thus underſtand the Word, to give that denomination to the Scriptures, leſt we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fall into the condemnation of the Phariſaical Jews, of whom Paul teſtifies, "That the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael could not ſteadfaſtly look to the end of that which is aboliſhed—but their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the ſame vail untaken away, in the reading of the Old Teſtament; which vail is done away in Chriſt." <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. iii. 13, 14.</note>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Concerning</hi> BAPTISM.</head>
               <p>CONCERNING Water Baptiſm, Francis Herr calls it a reception into the church and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſaints, and that it ought not to be called a Chriſtian Baptiſm, if it is knowingly adminiſtered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the unconverted. Again he ſays, it being then ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, it requires alſo ſpiritual and regenerated men, whoſe hearts were changed, &amp;c. "See! Theſe has St. John baptized, and all ſuch has Jeſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to baptize." If he means, that the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of water is ſpiritual, I muſt diſſent from him therein, believing that ſpiritual and regenerated men have already experienced an efficacious and truly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Baptiſm, which changes the heart, and needs not the operation of any element; a reliance on which may ſubject to the ſame condemnation into which the Galatians fell, who "began in the Spirit, and thought to be made perfect in the fleſh." <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 3.</note> And if John the Baptiſt only baptized "ſuch as were changed by the word of truth," &amp;c. then did he find a plentiful harveſt of converted men. For Matthew ſays, "Then went out to him Jeruſalem and all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and all the regions round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan." <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. iii. 5.</note> Mark ſays— "And there went out unto him all the land of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and they of Jeruſalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark i. 5.</note> Very comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive expreſſions theſe. Even the Publicans and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were not refuſed by him: from which I infer, that thoſe whom John baptized were generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, ſuch as needed repentance; and his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022648_0013_0FB9C0C9296C9570"/>was to ſhew them typically, by bathing or plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into, and waſhing their bodies clean in water, how Chriſt would by his Spirit waſh, cleanſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify their hearts and conſciences. And had thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned been converted perſons, they would have known Chriſt (as John did) when he came with his refining and winnowing Baptiſm, and not have rejected him.</p>
               <p>But to come to the point in hand, he further ſays, "Such has Jeſus Chriſt commanded to baptize, when he ſaith, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; go ye therefore and teach all nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt," &amp;c. And again— "Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel unto every creature; he that believeth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned." Hence he would infer, that water is meant in the above commands; to which I anſwer, that God is a God of order; that Chriſt is not the author of confuſion: if water had there been meant, would it not have been expreſſed? With what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion were the rites of the law enjoined; and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the goſpel, which is far more excellent, cannot be leſs complete. The conteſts and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that have been about this ſimple point, for many generations, have been almoſt endleſs. If therefore water was intended, the command appears to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without the expreſſion thereof; and can we admit, that ſuch an omiſſion eſcaped him who is omniſcient? The end and deſign of Chriſt's coming, was to lead men from exterior to interior things.— The new covenant, or goſpel diſpenſation, is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, in which without him we can do nothing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his glory. It is the ſubſtance of all that was prefigured under the law, which I conceive ſtood in force until he had paſſed through it, and fulfilled
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022648_0014_0FB9C0CA92D68280"/>the righteouſneſs thereof. When on the croſs, "Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus knowing that all things were accompliſhed, ſaid I thirſt.—And when Jeſus therefore had received the vinegar, he ſaid, it is finiſhed." <note n="*" place="bottom">John xix. 28, 30.</note> This I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be the end of the typical diſpenſation, which was accompliſhed and finiſhed in him; "for Chriſt is the end of the law." <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. x. 4.</note> Yet notwithſtanding it was for a time kept to, and taught by the Apoſtles, it being reaſonable to conclude, that their continuance in theſe things was permitted, more through conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion to the attachments and frailty of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in general, than from ſenſible obligation; long fixed and deep rooted cuſtoms and prejudices not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readily ſeparated from. For the ſame reaſons do I apprehend John's Baptiſm was practiſed at the firſt under the goſpel for a time, by ſome who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſaw the invalidity thereof, and continued by others ſuperſtitiouſly. The Apoſtles having been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by John, ſaw ſuch evident teſtimonies of the divine preſence attending his miſſion, that they in an unexperienced ſtate, not ſeeing clearly the deſign and exit thereof, probably thought it to have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er efficacy than they afterwards found, as appears from the ſenſe of Peter and Paul, when in a more experienced period of their apoſtleſhip (viz.) "The like figure whereunto Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us;" (mark, he profeſſes being ſaved by Baptiſm) "not the putting away the filth of the fleſh," (which is the utmoſt effect of water) "but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt." <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Peter iii. 21.</note> He who experienceth this reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpiritually accompliſhed in himſelf, knows well what ſaving Baptiſm is. Chriſt told Peter and his brethren, when bodily preſent, that when he the Spirit of Truth is come, he would guide them into
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022648_0015_0FB9C0D09BDA18B0"/>all truth, which is a gradual work. They at that time thought their Maſter's intention was to reſtore a temporal kingdom unto Iſrael; <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts i. 6.</note> he did not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, but left their judgment to be rectified in that, and many other things (which they could not then bear) by their promiſed guide. Peter in his ſpiritual infancy practiſed water Baptiſm, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickly after his Lord's aſcenſion, received a commiſſion and power to preach the goſpel, and to work miracles, by which great numbers were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Chriſtian faith. Converſion and Spiritual Baptiſm are the ſame thing; for both imply a change from a ſtate of nature into a ſtate of grace; and that power by which he preached the goſpel mixing with, or being received in true faith by the hearers, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them with the Spirit and wrought their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but many who heard and believed were not ſo baptized, for want of faith. The above is verified in the inſtance of Cornelius. "While he yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word." <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts x. 44.</note> The Apoſtles who had hitherto thought ſalvation was confined to the Jews, were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed becauſe the Spirit was conferred on the Gentiles alſo. This appears to be the eighth year from that miraculous effuſion of the Spirit mentioned Acts 2d. It ſeems on this occaſion, as though ſome had began to doubt of water Baptiſm, or elſe why did Peter ſay, "Can any man forbid that water," &amp;c. Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years after this is the date of his epiſtle, in which he expreſſed himſelf concerning Baptiſm; by which time we cannot doubt, but that his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judgment was fully rectiſied, in that and all other things relative to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle Paul, through whoſe efficacious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry multitudes of the Gentiles embraced the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022648_0016_0FB9C0D538B77478"/>in the 24th year of his apoſtleſhip, ſays, "I thank God, that I baptized none of you but Criſpus and Gaius, leſt any ſhould ſay, that I had baptized in mine own name." This by the context is doubtleſs generally underſtood of water Baptiſm. He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, ſaying, "And I baptized alſo the houſehold of Stephanas; beſides I know not whether I baptized any other: for Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the goſpel. The Apoſtle could not be ignorant of the command, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them," &amp;c. Had he underſtood water there to be meant, he muſt have been very deficient in the execution of his miniſterial function, and alſo very preſumptuous, to thank God that he had done his work ſo negligently. It is highly probable, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imagine the Apoſtle confined what he wrote hereon to the Corinthians; but the contrary is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, for Stephanas was an inhabitant of Achaia, and not of Corinth (now called Morea. <note n="*" place="bottom">It is the ſouthernmoſt part of Greece, being a peninſula al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cut off from the main by water, and lies neareſt to Achaia, they being joined by a narrow iſthmus of conſiderable length.</note>) If he had been a Coriuthian, Paul's recommendation of him would have been unneceſſary; from whence I argue, that thoſe enumerated were not only all the Corinthians that he had baptized with water, but all that he had ſo baptized any where; but that the Spirit's Baptiſm had been through the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel power conferred on many by him, is evident: for Luke who wrote the Acts, and was Paul's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, ſays poſitively (when ſpeaking of Paul's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) "And many of the Corinthians hearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and were baptized." <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xviii. 8.</note> And here F. Herr's query, reſpecting the twelve Epheſians (on whom the Baptiſm of the Spirit was conferred by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022648_0017_0FB9C0D696851F18"/>on of Paul's hands) whether he baptized them with water or no, may be anſwered; the text ſays they were baptized, but is ſilent reſpecting water. This being three years earlier than his epiſtle to the Corinthians, determines the point ſo far in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that we may venture to ſay he did not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them with water. Is it any greater miracle or leſs poſſible to confer the Spirit's Baptiſm, than to heal the ſick, reſtore the lame, caſt out devils, and raiſe the dead? ſurely no; with men they are all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but with God all things are poſſible. And there are many inſtances in Scripture, where men not only performed wonders, and things impoſſible as men, through his power, but alſo where thoſe things are imputed to men as their acts. And Paul profeſſes a power to confer gifts of the Spirit, ſaying, "I long to ſee you, that I may impart unto you ſome ſpiritual gift." <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. i. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now that water Baptiſm was John's Baptiſm, is by all granted; and that he was the only officer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely commiſſioned to adminiſter it, is all that can be proved. That the Spirit's Baptiſm is Chriſt's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is equally true. But if water Baptiſm was alſo intended to be perpetuated as an ordinance of Chriſt, his entire ſilence reſpecting any command thereon, muſt be very extraordinary. What did John mean when he ſaid, "I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to unlooſe; he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire: whoſe fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor," <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke iii. 16.17.</note> &amp;c. What elſe does his deſcription of the purifying effects of Chriſt's Baptiſm argue, but that in like manner as I waſh, bathe, and purify your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in water, ſo ſhall he who cometh waſh, cleanſe,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022648_0018_0FB9C0D9769C6478"/>and purify your hearts and conſciences, in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual laver? And what elſe did John mean, when he ſaid, he muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe, if it was not in the adminiſtration of their different baptiſmal offices? In what other point of view can we underſtand it? ſince to increaſe implies a gradual ſpreading or prevailing, and to decreaſe a gradual diminution; and whatever continues to decreaſe will terminate. Again: that water is not Chriſt's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is clear to me on this head (viz.) as he came to fulfil, and alſo to abrogate and rend the vail of figurative performances (though originally of equal authority with water Baptim) in order to make way for an higher diſpenſation; the ſubſtance of all that was typified by the ordinances under the law, "which made nothing perfect;" it would therefore be irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to ſuppoſe, that he who came after the power of an endleſs life, who by "the bringing in of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hope," <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. vii. 19, 16.</note> ſhould again devolve into ſhadowy and exterior things. For Paul ſaith, "Wherefore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye ſubject to ordinances (touch not, taſte not, handle not; which are all to periſh with the uſing) after the commandments and doctrines of men?" <note n="†" place="bottom">Cell. ii. 20, 21, and 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>F. Herr calls on us to anſwer him from Holy Writ, where our Lord has given his diſciples, &amp;c. power, or commanded them to baptize men with the Holy Ghoſt; to which I anſwer, when he ſaid, "All pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is given unto me in heaven and in earth." By this he aſſured them, that his power was all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and ſhould not be lacking: and "Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things what.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022648_0019_0FB9C0DCC8506718"/>ſoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world," is a poſitive command, with an aſſurance that his preſence ſhould not fail them. Likewiſe, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature; he that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not," &amp;c. Theſe two texts our author links together, and ſo do I, <note n="*" place="bottom">It is evident, that theſe two texts were ſpoken at one time: Matthew ſays, "Behold he goeth before you into Galilee, there ſhall ye ſee him." <note n="†" place="bottom">Matthew xxxviii 7, 6.</note>—Then the eleven diſciples went away into Galilee, &amp;c. Mark ſays, "Tell his diſciples and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee, there ſhall ye ſee him." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark xvi. 17.</note> And the two Evangeliſts only mention one interview with the eleven in conſequence of this direction; the firſt ſays, ſome doubted; the latter, that he upbraided them with unbelief; and it cannot be ſuppoſed, that they doubted or diſbelieved in his reſurrection, after they had ſeen him.</note> ſuppoſing them both to have been written at one time. He ſays, this injunction the Apoſtles received, as the commandment of their Lord and Maſter, in which ſenſe I alſo accept it, having no doubt but that the Baptiſm of the Spirit was hereby commanded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined; for only to have enjoined plunging, dipping, and purifying their bodies in water, is a work that ſinful men could perform without ſupernatural aid, and needed not ſuch aſſurance given of the never failing preſence of Almighty Power. And to me it ſeems demonſtrable, that Water was no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended than expreſſed, which I think may thus be proved: Our Lord poſitively ſays, "He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved." Here is no proviſo; he did not ſay, may be, but ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; from whence I argue, the Baptiſm which our Lord commanded, is abſolutely a ſaving Baptiſm; and that if water was meant, the conſequence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022648_0020_0FB9C0DED1FE0C70"/>evitably the ſame; it muſt follow, that all who have believed, and been baptized therewith, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are ſaved, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus not excepted, for he believed and was baptized. Are there any among the ſons of Adam ſo replete with credulity as to believe, that water, however or by whomſoever adminiſtered, is poſſeſſed of ſuch ſoul redeeming efficacy? ſurely no; for it is a deplorable truth, that thouſands, yea tens of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, who have believed and been baptized in the manner deſcribed, have lived, and do live in all the gratifications of ſenſuality; and many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in the poſſibility of their being delivered from them in this life, therefore far from a ſtate of ſalvation. If he that believeth, and is baptized (as our Lord commanded) ſhall be ſaved, then it was the Spirit's Baptiſm which he commanded his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to adminiſter, and not water.</p>
               <p>Another touchſtone he has given for an infallible rule (viz.) Trees are known by their fruits; "By their fruits ye ſhall know them;" <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. vii. 20.</note> which is applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to men or things. He that is baptized with the Spirit, bringeth forth the fruits of the Spirit, which are "love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance; againſt ſuch there is no law." <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. v. 22, 23.</note> The fruits or works of the fleſh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the three preceding verſes, are, "Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, fornication, uncleanneſs, laſciviouſneſs, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, hereſies, envyings, murders, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, revellings, and ſuch like, of which I tell you, that they who do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ver. 19, 20, 21.</note> If therefore the fruits of many who have been baptized with water, be ſuch as the fleſh bringeth forth, then are they not in a ſtate of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022648_0021_0FB9C0F5513F96A0"/>ſalvation. Again: if many who have believed, and been baptized with water, be not in a ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then is the Baptiſm wherewith they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized not the Baptiſm which Chriſt commanded.</p>
               <p>If the firſt be true, that the Baptiſm which Chriſt commanded be abſolutely a ſaving Baptiſm, then is the laſt alſo true, that Water Baptiſm is not the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which he commanded and enjoined, becauſe it abſolutely is not a ſaving Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>A Baptiſm therefore, that cannot ſave or redeem men from their ſins, puts them in no better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than they would be in if there was no Baptiſm at all, ſince it neither makes men more holy nor leſs wicked: it is refuted by its own conſequences; and like circumciſion or uncircumciſion, it availeth nothing. And as to the capacity of Chriſt's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in the adminiſtration of Spiritual Baptiſm, he told his Apoſtles, that John truly baptized them with water, but they ſhould be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, not many days hence; (here he repreſents John as the diſpenſer of water, and aſſumes no part of his miſſion to himſelf) which promiſe was fulſilled in the days of Pentecoſt, when they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt. From which it appears, that to be filled with the Holy Spirit, or to have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and to be baptized therewith, are the ſame things. Wherefore I argue, that the Apoſtles did confer the Holy Ghoſt, <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts viii. 17.</note> by the laying on of their hands; which when Simon Magus ſaw, he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them money, thinking to make gain thereby: alſo the twelve on whom Paul laid his hands here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore mentioned. Marvel not at theſe things, for Chriſt's Spirit is the Chriſtian's ſtrength, which Paul experienced when he ſaid, "I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me," <note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. iv. 13.</note> and as
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022648_0022_0FB9C0E71ED4BB10"/>before hinted, declared this ſufficiency to be of God, who had made them able Miniſters of the Spirit, and not of the letter; therefore he that miniſtereth the Spirit, conferreth the Spirit; and he that conferreth the Spirit, baptizeth with the Spirit. Chriſt ſaid, "Without me ye can do nothing," but through him they could do all things. Without him it was, and is equally impoſſible for them, or any now, to preach the goſpel ("which is the power of God unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion" <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. i. 16.</note>) to the edification of the church and God's glory; therefore whoever attempts to officiate as a Goſpel Miniſter, without being ſenſibly called of God, and on every ſuch occaſion renewedly qualiſied and put forth by the aid of his power, experiencing his Spirit to give utterance as the Apoſtles did, cannot profit the people; for he who dependeth on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only for doctrine, and not on the Spirit, is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the letter, and not of the Spirit: ſuch were they who taught for doctrine the precepts of men; and he that hath "not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his;" <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 9.</note> and he who abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, cannot be his Miniſter, however eloquent or coherent his doctrines may be: therefore, whatever ſuch do in that line, it being without him, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and worſe than nothing.</p>
               <p>The above may be conſidered as a digreſſion, but as it tends to elucidate the ſubject under notice, I have inſerted it; apprehending that I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, in a good degree, to demonſtrate that Chriſt has not only commanded, but alſo given power to his Diſciples and Apoſtles to adminiſter the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit; and I may add, not unto them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who heard him utter the command, but to all that ſhould go forth in his name to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>F. Herr tells us of Water Baptiſm being a proof or ſeal of regeneration. This is transferring it from
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022648_0023_0FB9C0E8995F8778"/>being a type of good things to come, to be an enſign or evidence that they are come; but as it leaves no viſible nor diſtinguiſhable mark or impreſſion on the body, nor makes any material change, ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce different fruits; and the idea being without foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in reaſon, or precept from Holy Writ, it may be rejected as being merely imaginary in its effects, and deſtitute of any real conſequence; therefore, with other legal rites, it may now be deemed but a uſeleſs ordinance. The beſt ſeal or proof of having been regenerated, are the fruits of the Spirit heretofore mentioned, which are unto holineſs, and the end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. And if any want a diſtinguiſhable badge of being Members of Chriſt's Church, Love is the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion which he propoſed for that end, ſaying, "By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to another." <note n="*" place="bottom">John xiii. 35.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We are charged by F. Herr with inſinuating, that Water Baptiſm was derived from the law, and he calls on us to prove where it began. In the firſt place it will be right to define what is Water Baptiſm; is it not to dip, plunge, bathe, or waſh, ſo as to cleanſe the body? or as Peter hath it, to put away the filth of the fleſh? This I take to be what properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes Water Baptiſm, when performed on a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous account; any words or ceremony uttered during the operation, does not make it more or leſs ſo. We do not find that John the Baptiſt had any fixed ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, except it was to preach the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; therefore, if to waſh, cleanſe, and purify the body, be what properly conſtitutes Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in the original ſenſe of the word, then was Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſm often on religious accounts practiſed by the Iſraelites under the law. <note n="†" place="bottom">Levit. xv. from verſe 5th to 27th—and Num. xix. from 8th to 21ſt.</note> But we do not ſay that
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022648_0024_0FB9C0EA2DC2A150"/>John derived his commiſſion from the law, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from heaven: yet if John's Baptiſm had not had a near affinity with the waſhings and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations common among the Jews (which in fact were Baptiſms) it is highly probable it would not have found ſuch univerſal reception amongſt that people, who were very tenacious of the cuſtoms delivered by Moſes. This was abundantly verified; for when Chriſt came, who had greater teſtimony than John, his doctrine ſo contradicted their prejudices, that they almoſt univerſally rejected and diſowned him.</p>
               <p>The following are quotations from the works of Iſaac Pennington, a worthy member of our ſociety, who lived in the laſt century, and had experienced both elementary and Spiritual Baptiſm. He ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">IId Vol. Page 417.</note> "It is ſaid, go teach baptizing, but it is not ſaid baptizing with water, but in the name, or rather (as the Greek is) into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>"Now to baptize with water is one thing, and to baptize into the name is another; as they who experience the Spiritual Baptiſm know it to be: for the word of faith turns men from Satan to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of life; and then as they receive the power, and are made partakers of the power, they are baptized into the power and virtue of life; and ſo they are buried (ſo far as they come into Chriſt) by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Spirit, into this Heavenly Baptiſm, into death unto ſin, and by the ſame power are made alive unto righteouſneſs; and ſo the name of the Lord, the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, comes over them, and they riſe up in it unto life and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſo are dead unto ſin, and alive unto God. Now any outward circumciſing or waſhing, can be but a figure of this; but the inward circumciſing and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022648_0025_0FB9C0F3E8DAC550"/>waſhing is the thing itſelf. For Chriſt ſent not his able Miniſters of the New Teſtament to miniſter the letter, or to miniſter the figures of things, but to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Spirit (elſe how were they able Miniſters of the Spirit?) to miniſter the ſubſtance; not to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a circumciſion or Baptiſm which might be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and paſs away, as outward and elementary, but to miniſter the circumciſion and Baptiſm which cannot be ſhaken, which is the circumciſion and Baptiſm of the goſpel; the circumciſion and Baptiſm of the kingdom, which is never to be ſhaken and paſs away as elementary, but to ſtand and abide for ever.— Read, Heb. xii. 26, 27, 28, and conſider how all elementary and outward things, which could be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, were to be ſhaken and paſs away, that thoſe things which were of an higher nature, even of the nature of the kingdom, might remain and be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in their ſtead."</p>
               <p>He ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 421.</note> "The Greek word is not <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>CONCERNING the peaceable kingdom of the Meſſiah, we are inſtructed by many prophecies in Scripture, reſpecting its ſpreading and prevalence; and that in proceſs of time, the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever. <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xi. 15.</note> Iſaiah ſays, "And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days (that is, the goſpel days) that the mountain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the hills, and all nations ſhall flow unto it; and many people ſhall go and ſay, come ye, and let us go up to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion ſhall go forth the law, &amp;c. and he ſhall judge among the nations, and rebuke many people; and they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks; nation ſhall not lift up the ſword againſt nation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they learn war any more." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſaiah ii. 2, 3, 4.

Hoſea ſays, "And in that day will I make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow, and the ſword, and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down ſafely." <note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſea ii. 18.</note>

               <p>Zechariah ſays, "And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horſe from Jeruſalem, and the battle bow ſhall be cut off; and he ſhall ſpeak peace unto the Heathen, and his dominion ſhall be from ſea even to ſea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth." <note n="†" place="bottom">Zechariah ix. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The 60th chapter of Iſaiah ſeems all to the like import; and the Prophet perſonating the Almighty, ſaith, "I the Lord will haſten it in his time."</p>
               <p>Theſe recited predictions may ſuffice to evince— that a time of more univerſal happineſs than hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been, awaits mankind; but in what manner ſhall ſo great a revolution be brought to paſs? Do we look for it to be an inſtantaneous work, while we remain idle ſpectators thereof? What is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, and wherein doth it conſiſt? What ſaith the Scripture thereon? "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. xiv. 17.</note> "My kingdom (ſaid our bleſſed Lord) is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight," <note n="§" place="bottom">John xviii. 36.</note> &amp;c. And further, "Repent, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is at hand." <note n="|" place="bottom">Matt. iv. 17.</note> "Be ye ſure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you." <note n="¶" place="bottom">Luke x. 11—xi 29.</note> "No doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you." And when he was demanded of the Phariſees, when the kingdom of God ſhould come, he anſwered them
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022648_0028_0FB9C0F93309F2D0"/>and ſaid, "The kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation; for behold, the kingdom of God is within you." <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xvii. 20, 21.</note> If therefore his kingdom be not of this world, and yet within or in the heart, then it muſt be in the hearts of thoſe who are led and governed by his Spirit. "For no whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt and of God." "For becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience." <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. v. 5, 6.</note> From whence it is evident, that a great change muſt be effected, before the kingdoms of this world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the kingdom of Chriſt; for behold on the right hand and on the left, in city and country, how theſe fruits of the fleſh, together with wrath, ſtrife, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, drunkenneſs, revellings, and ſuch like abound. The world yet lies in wickedneſs; and in that ſtate ſtands excluded. It is only as men become his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and followers in the regeneration, that they can become ſubjects of his heavenly kingdom: And the terms of diſcipleſhip are plain—"He that taketh not his croſs, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. x. 38.</note> Again: "If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs daily, and follow me."—And "Whoſoever doth not bear his croſs, and come after me, he cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple." <note n="§" place="bottom">Luke xix. 29—xiv. 27.</note> Theſe firſt rudiments of Chriſtianity are ſtrongly inculcated, as being indiſpenſably neceſſary to conſtitute a diſciple and ſubject of his peaceable kingdom. Yet no compulſive means are uſed, only the power of love; if we expect to be compelled by any other power, our hope will be in vain. All his invitations are perfectly conſiſtent with free agency: "If any man will come after me let him," &amp;c. all
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022648_0029_0FB9C0FB5520BCB8"/>that will come may come. The will is free; good and evil are ſet before us in unreſerved terms, without diſtinction or reſpect of perſons, either for their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wiſdom, eloquence, or preferments. They are by nature all (placed on a level) children of wrath. "For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek, for the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him." <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. x. 12.</note> With him "there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumciſion nor uncircumciſion, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Chriſt is all, and in all." <note n="†" place="bottom">Coloſ. iii. 11.</note> Therefore, ſince God is no reſpecter of perſons, it neceſſarily follows, that all who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay hold on the terms of ſalvation, through perſeverance, will be ſaved. It was by a ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance therewith, that the goſpel and kingdom of Chriſt made glorious advances in the Apoſtle's days; and doubtleſs by the ſame appointed means will be effected the fulfilling of the prophecies heretofore recited; for the completion whereof, it ſeems that ſome of the primitive Chriſtians were looking:— againſt which the Apoſtle Paul forewarned them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "We beſeech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as from us, as that the day of Chriſt is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day ſhall not come, except there come a falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdition: Who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped; ſo that he as God ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time: for the myſtery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth

"They have forſaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns, that can hold no water." <note n="†" place="bottom">Jerem. ii. 13.</note> They could no longer draw water from thence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſupply the want of thoſe ſanctified veſſels, through whom the church had been refreſhed and edified, they hewed out other ſources; they ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted literature, vain philoſophy, and the traditions of men, in lieu of thoſe heavenly endowments.— Chriſt called, qualified, and ſent forth his own mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and on obſerving the work to be great, and the labourers but few, he directed them to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him who is Lord of the harveſt, that he might ſend forth more labourers, without delegating any part of the power reſpecting their call and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to any man or body of men; he did not direct that they ſhould be equipped with languages, and other rudiments of this world, but in common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſuch as were deſtitute of thoſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being leſs replete with ſelf-ſufficiency, and having no other ſource to depend on, could confide entirely on him for every neceſſary ſupply; knowing that "every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning." <note n="‡" place="bottom">James i. 17.</note> Paul, who appeared the moſt learned of the Apoſtles, declared, that his "preaching was not with enticing words of man's wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Sprit, and of power:" he adds, "that your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God; howbeit, we ſpeak
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022648_0032_0FB9C102D53F8F58"/>wiſdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wiſdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to nought; but we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of this world knew." <note n="*" place="bottom">Cor. ii. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> The knowledge of which myſteries, wiſdom, and things of God, he further aſſerts, cannot be acquired, but by the revelation of the Spirit of God. But how op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite have the purſuits of the profeſſed followers of Chriſt been, ſince the Apoſtles days, to acquire the requiſite qualifications for the miniſtry! Man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deviſeth ſhining and formidable accountrements, to effect God's purpoſes, not having faith to depend on the aid of his Spirit, and the armoury thereof; they have had recourſe to means adapted to the ideas of the wiſe, the learned, and the princes of this world; reverſe to the Apoſtle's deſcription as recited, not conſidering, that "the world by wiſdom knows not God." <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 21.</note> The Apoſtle clearly invalidates all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man acquirements in things pertaining to ſalvation and godlineſs, ſaying, where is the wiſe? where is the ſcribe? where is the diſputer of this world? hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world?— And the means by which God chuſeth to effect his purpoſes, are often weak and contemptible in the eyes of men, that the boaſter may be excluded; for he will not give his glory unto men. At the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ram's horns, the walls of Jericho were thrown down; with the jaw-bone of an aſs, Sampſon ſlew a thouſand men; with a ſling and ſmooth ſtones Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid killed the Philiſtine giant; and through unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, deſtitute of ſcholaſtic acquirements, did the Saviour of man deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nought the underſtanding of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022648_0033_0FB9C1052440D688"/>confounding both Jews and Greeks, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ſpiritual ſyſtem, in oppoſition to the powers, policy, and ſpirit of this world. He called into his ſervice, "not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble, but God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe; and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty, and baſe things of the world, and things which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, hath God choſen; yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence." <note n="*" place="bottom">Cor. i. 26, 27, 28, 29.</note> By means of this ſort great purpoſes were effected, and the world as it were turned upſide down: light invaded the regions of darkneſs, and the kingdom of Chriſt made great advances in the earth, through the aid of his Spirit; but by departing therefrom, they loſt this efficacious power—not all at once, but gradually. For we have reaſon to believe, that many pious men, during ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral centuries after the Apoſtles' days, beheld with regret, and with all their might oppoſed the torrent of corruptions which invaded the churches, but were overborne by corrupt men, who had crept in under ſpecious pretences, and often condemned the truth, and eſtabliſhed error by a majority of voices. Here the learned, the wiſe, and great men of this world, gained the ſuperiority over the ſimple-hearted, who often had to wreſtle with principalities, and with powers, and with the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, and with ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places, loving not their lives unto death, were grievouſly perſecuted, and many ſealed their teſtimony with their blood. So in proceſs of time, great obſcurity prevailed, inſomuch that little more than the ſhell of Chriſtianity was left, and that clouded with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022648_0034_0FB9C10691E9AD98"/>and Heatheniſh innovations, ſo as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the original. It was in theſe dark ages, that preaching for hire was introduced, which in proceſs of time became a lucrative trade to live by, and carnal weapons came in uſe among Chriſtians, which had been wholly renounced in purer ages preceding. It was in the gloomy aeras of apoſtacy, that Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, became the primary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men inducted into the miniſterial office, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none could otherwiſe be admitted. This was circumſcribing the Holy One of Iſrael, excluding him in whom the ſovereign right centered, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late like, placing or writing thoſe Oriental languages over his head. Thus having quenched the Spirit, and ſwerved from the foundation whereon Chriſt builded his church, which is the revelation of the divine will, againſt which the gates of hell could not prevail, it is no wonder that darkneſs covered the earth, and groſs darkneſs the people.</p>
               <p>Having briefly traced the ſteps of degeneracy, and the means by which Antichriſt, the God of this world, through the medium of men whoſe ſtations rendered them conſpicuous, and who ſought more to eſtabliſh their own conſequence, than the government and goſpel of Chriſt, ſubverted the faith; I ſhall now leave this part of the ſubject, and endeavour, as I may be abilitated, to point out by what means we may expect the goſpel in its primitive, ſoul-ſaving efficacy, to ſpread and prevail, to the fulfilling of thoſe propheſies reſpecting its univerſality.</p>
               <p>If therefore the kingdom of heaven be within, as Chriſt declared, then it is in the heart that we muſt wait for its appearance; it is recommended to us in Scripture under various appellations, as the word nigh in the heart, the new covenant, the law written in the heart, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter, a light ſhining in a dark place, the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022648_0035_0FB9C10E065CFB88"/>grace of God, the anointing, &amp;c. which operates in the heart where it is received, as the "leaven which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, till the whole was leavened." <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xiii. 33.</note> It ſanctifieth body, ſoul, and ſpirit. It is "like the refiners fire, and like a fullers ſoap, and ſhall purify the ſons of Levi, and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteouſneſs." <note n="†" place="bottom">Mal. iii. 2, 3.</note> This only is the preparation of heart, by which Chriſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies miniſters for the promulgation of his goſpel and kingdom; and this renovation of heart is not only neceſſary for thoſe whom he ſends forth to preach the glad tidings of the goſpel, but equally ſo to all the offspring of Adam; for we have all ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God: and as Chriſt came to reſtore and redeem man out of the fall, up into the image or ſimilitude of God, we cannot doubt his power fully to execute his glorious deſign, if we through an evil heart of unbelief refuſe not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him in his ſpiritual appearance, who ſaid, "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I ſtand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. iii. 20.</note> Here is the communion of ſaints; here is a partaking of the Lord's Supper eſſentially experienced, and here his office is "to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for iniquities, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs." <note n="§" place="bottom">Dan. ix. 24.</note> His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the heart may at the firſt be ſmall, even as a grain of muſtard-ſeed. Many have denied him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance in his ſpiritual or ſecond coming, becauſe it was not with irreſiſtible power, and wonderful reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, but in a lowly, humble appearance, and in ſecret reproves evil thoughts, evil deeds, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022648_0036_0FB9C110551297A0"/>works of darkneſs. But unto as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him (the Apoſtle ſaid) he gave power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſons of God: and all this is poſſible to every rational creature; for Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for the ſins of the whole world; and he who will not believe in the poſſibility of being ranſomed, and ſet free from ſin in this life, is an unbeliever, and is not benefited by his coming. To ſuch he ſaid, if ye die in your ſins, where I go ye cannot come:— theſe oppoſe and retard the advancement of his peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able kingdom: the daily croſs, that great ſtumbling ſtone, and rock of offence, ſtands in the way, and as a flaming ſword guardeth the entrance into the kingdom; ſo that the unconverted, the unſanctified, nor any unholy or unclean thing can ever enter; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently can never be his ſubjects: for "except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven: whoſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelf as this little child, the ſame is greateſt in the kingdom of heaven." <note n="*" place="bottom">Matthew xviii. 3, 4.</note> This is mortifying work, thus to be humbled, and to have all our acquirements and conſequence laid in the duſt, and to be reduced into the ſimplicity, innocence, and ſimilitude of a little child; a ſtate abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be experienced by every man and woman. It is the new birth, which Nicodemus marvelled at, though a maſter in Iſrael. Are there not many who are learned and wiſe, and as maſters among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to whom this doctrine is equally ſtrange? It is a being created anew in Chriſt Jeſus. And theſe that are born of the Spirit, are children of the kingdom; and as they perſevere in the heavenly race, they will experience a growth from the ſtate of a child to that of a young man, and to a ſtrong man, and an elder in Chriſt. And theſe being redeemed from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022648_0037_0FB9C111D7421618"/>ruptions of nature, and from the maxims, friendſhip, and ſpirit of the world, and being crucified to the world, and the world unto them, having put off the old man with his deeds, their affections are ſet on things above; counting all things as droſs, and as dung, that they may win Chriſt. Being guided and governed by his Spirit, which breathes peace on earth, and good will to men, they cannot lift up a ſword, nor any carnal weapon againſt any man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well perſuaded, that the nature and deſign of the goſpel ſpirit is to ſave mens' lives, and not to deſtroy them: the ground of wars and fighting, which ſtands in the natural and fallen eſtate, being taken away, they can love their enemies, and thoſe who deſpitefully uſe and perſecute them: they feel great compaſſion and love to flow towards them; and their prayers often mentally, and ſometimes vocally aſcend to the God of the Spirits of all fleſh, that he may haſten his ſacred purpoſes, and cauſe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light of the goſpel more eminently to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, and to break forth on the right hand, and on the left, that the mountain of the Lord's houſe may be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, that all nations may flow unto it, that they may beat their ſwords into plow ſhares, and learn war no more.</p>
               <p>And every man and woman, who through grace comes to experience this glorious tranſlation out of darkneſs into the light of the Lord, enjoys internally the privileges which the goſpel and government of the Prince of Peace promiſeth; for "eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </note> But outwardly theſe are often abridged in their privileges, and perſecuted by the men of this world, becauſe the life of a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022648_0038_0FB9C113B43595D8"/>of Chriſt is reverſe to the ſpirit thereof: "for he that is born after the fleſh, perſecuteth him that is born after the Spirit." Tribulations are attendant on the goſpel; and he "that will live godly in this world muſt ſuffer perſecution." This has been the lot and portion of the followers of Chriſt through many generations, and will doubtleſs, in a greater or leſſer degree, continue to be ſo, until by a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral effuſion of goſpel light, that prophecy be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled (viz.) "He will deſtroy in this mountain, the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all nations, and he will ſwallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the rebuke of his people ſhall he take away from off all the earth." <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxv. 7, 8.</note> What is this mountain which the Prophet frequently mentions, but the profeſſion of the truth ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally experienced, and not literally held in an impure conſcience, which ſhall riſe above the mountains and hills of empty and lifeleſs profeſſion? What is this covering caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all nations, but the prejudices, the unbelief and darkneſs, that is over the hearts of the people, ſo that they grope as at noon day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the truth? What is the rebuke of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the rod of perſecution which hath ſtained the hiſtory of many generations?—And what is the death that ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory, but dead and unſubſtantial forms, and a profeſſion of the truth held in unrighteouſneſs? that brings not to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the only true God, and of Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, whom to know is life eternal. This is not a literal knowledge only, but a knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the heart, the eſſence and ſubſtance of all religion. Thoſe who attain this knowledge are Jews
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022648_0039_0FB9C11650E276C8"/>in ſpirit; they are of the circumciſion, who worſhip God in Spirit. By theſe, through the aid of his omnipotence, will the coming of the day of Chriſt be accelerated, when the knowledge of the Lord ſhall cover the earth, as the waters cover the ſea. But as the declenſion from primitive goſpel righteouſneſs was gradual, ſo may we expect the return thereof the be, and ſo hath it been for ſeveral centuries; there has been a breaking forth of light in pious men, who according to the degrees of it manifeſted to them, were faithful and valiant in oppoſing the ſuperſtition and idolatry of the Romiſh Church, for which they endured a great fight of afflictions, and many finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their courſe in the flames; and in the generations ſucceeding, down to the preſent time, light has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and riſen higher and higher, inſomuch that the ſpirit of perſecution in ſeveral nations is held in abhorrence; and as this divine principle of light and grace is admitted to operate, it will diſſeminate and ſpread into the dark corners of the earth, and by its efficacy penetrate through the covering, and rend the vail of prejudices and unbelief, whereby the hidden things of darkneſs will be manifeſted, and that buſy, active part in man, which has had the pre-eminence ſince the Apoſtle's days in preaching, praying, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a round of exteriors, will be ſeen to be the firſt nature, exerciſed in a fruitleſs toil.</p>
               <p>We have reaſon to believe, that in the coming and ſpreading of this peaceable government, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy will be as plentifully verified, as in the firſt ages of the goſpel (viz. "And it ſhall come to paſs afterwards, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and your old men ſhall dream dreams, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions; and alſo upon the ſervants, and upon the handmaids in thoſe days, will
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022648_0040_0FB9C11BA0E57E58"/>I pour out my Spirit." <note n="*" place="bottom">Joel ii. 28, 29.</note> Doubtleſs many of theſe will have to run to and fro, and knowledge will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, until his righteouſneſs go forth as brightneſs, and his ſalvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Lord's hand be not ſhortened, nor his ear heavy; if there be no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning in him; and if it be iniquity that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates between the people and their God, and ſin that hides his face from them, then in repenting and returning unto him, with full purpoſe of heart, he will return unto them; for "the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will he with hold from them that walk uprightly." <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxxiv. 11.</note> If ſo, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his church and people, as they adhere to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking word, will be repleniſhed with all neceſſary gifts for edification, for building one another up in the faith, for the promulgation of righteouſneſs and peace, for the propagation of the goſpel among the Heathens, in order that the bow, and the ſword, and the battle may be broke out of the earth, and the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, that he may reign for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>In treating on this ſubject, I have not hitherto taken any notice of my opponent; what he has wrote thereon appearing to militate but little againſt us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in two caſes. In ſpeaking of the peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt's kingdom, wherein he ſeems to approve our conduct and ſentiments reſpecting war, he queries of us where war is more ſtrictly forbid than going to law—charging us with making uſe of the law as much as any other people, wherein I am ſatisfied he is miſtaken, as our religious ſociety, from its firſt riſe, has manifeſted a great concern to diſcourage contentious and litigious diſpoſitions, and as
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022648_0041_0FB9C11D166FCE10"/>much as poſſible to avoid going to law, eſpecially with our own members, with whom they are not allowed that liberty, except in extraordinary caſes; and in order thereto, any who have differences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting intereſts or property, are directed by our diſcipline to proceed in an orderly, chriſtian-like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; firſt by going, or writing if at a diſtance, one to the other, in a friendly way; and if they fail of ſucceſs, then to take one or two ſuitable and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Friends, when the injured is in like manner to make his claim, and thoſe acompanying are to give their utmoſt aſſiſtance, to have the matter juſtly and ſpeedily ended: if living at too great a diſtance, they are otherwiſe to proceed by writing; but if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appears too difficult for them, they are to adviſe the parties to chooſe referees, and engage themſelves to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide their determination. But if either of the ſaid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties refuſe ſuch advice or endeavours, they are to be complained of to the monthly meeting; of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint he or ſhe is to be notified, and requeſted to attend; and the parties are there at liberty, or rather adviſed to nominate as before, and the meeting may add one or more, if the occaſion appears to require it; but if the parties refuſe to attend, and to nominate, then the meeting is to appoint a ſufficient number of Friends to hear and determine the ſame, as ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as the nature of the caſe will admit. But if either of the parties refuſe to attend the arbitrators, and ſubmit the caſe, or to abide by the judgment or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Friends ſo choſen or appointed, ſuch are to be dealt with as diſorderly perſons, that regard not peace, and that ſlight the order and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the brethren; and after due admonition, if he or ſhe perſiſts therein, ſuch are to be diſowned and teſtified againſt by the meeting. But if any find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves aggrieved by ſuch determination, they have a right to a re-hearing, except where bonds are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022648_0042_0FB9C11EF084F988"/>into; and if ſuch ſtill are diſſatisfied, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the privilege of an appeal to a ſuperior meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But where there are caſes ſo circumſtanced, that the fore mentioned orderly proceeding cannot be complied with, without a manifeſt damage to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor or claimant, that monthly meeting, upon due enquiry finding them to be truly ſo, are to allow ſuch to have the matter tried at law, with this cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the parties on both ſides do behave towards each other in brotherly love; and in aſſerting their apprehended right, that it be done with decency and moderation, without anger or animoſity, leſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they occaſion the truth to be evil ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>And as it is our duty to ſeek peace with all men, and to avoid giving juſt offence to any, our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are adviſed to avoid going to law with others not of our perſuaſion, angrily or in a paſſion, or without due conſideration, and having firſt in a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way ſhewn his opponent the juſtneſs of his cauſe, and having offered to put the matter to a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reference, ſo that no juſt occaſion be given to ſuch to go to law with them; but to ſhew a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and readineſs to ſettle it peaceably between themſelves, or to ſubmit to a reference; whereby it will appear, that the intention of our diſcipline is to diſcourage and prevent law-ſuits as much as poſſible, which our religious ſociety as a body endeavours to maintain inviolate: but as our members are diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in various parts, ſome of them remote from the care of their brethren, we cannot account for their conduct individually; but when it comes to our knowledge, that they act repugnant to the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſociety, we labour to reclaim them; and after due forbearance, if they prove refractory, we ſeparate them from us, as perſons unworthy of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:022648_0043_0FB9C1204C0A7D30"/>
He further obſerves, reſpecting the addreſſes we preſent to Kings and Princes, ſaying, that he can ſee no other motive in it, than that they are meant to flatter, and to obtain applauſe and honour before the world—which I think is an uncharitable reflection. To find them expreſſed in decent and becoming lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is no error: the deſign of them in general is, to manifeſt our good will, loyalty, and peaceable demeanour as ſubjects; to expreſs public acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of cur gratitude to them, for the quiet enjoyment of our religious and civil liberties; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſcribing the honour unto God, who had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their hearts to moderation, and to aſſure them, that while we adhere to our principles, they have nothing to fear from us; in the doing of which, we hold up a teſtimony for the peaceable kingdom and government of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now having in this eſſay (though not minutely particular taken notice of the moſt material parts of F. Herr's publication, eſpecially wherein he objects to our principles and practice, in which I apprehend the reſt is generally included, except where he ſpeaks of Noah becoming a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, in a manner that to me is myſterious and unintelligible. I ſhould not have ſuppoſed it improbable, if he had repreſented him really, rather than figuritively ſo; and that it conſiſts abundantly more with the long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a gracious and merciful God, previous to the building of the ark, to command Noah to preach repentance to the depraved Antideluvians, and to forewarn them of the impending judgment, except they repented of their wickedneſs, than to cauſe the flood of waters to deſtroy them without ſuch warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in which caſe he would really be a Preacher of Righteouſneſs. And as Chronologers place the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given him to build the ark 100 years before the flood came, it furniſhes ſuſlleient ground to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022648_0044_0FB9C127B7A4A8D0"/>that Noah was employed much of that time in ſome benevolent work of that nature, which entitled him to the denomination of a Preacher of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And now reader, having according to ability re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, endeavoured to pomote thy inſtruction, edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and advancement heaven-ward: if nevertheleſs human frailty ſhould be preſented to thy view, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that to the author, to whom belongs bluſhing and confuſion of face; but if any thing herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſhould, through the divine bleſſing, tend to enlighten and excite in thee a hunger and a thirſt after righteouſneſs, aſcribe that unto God only wiſe, who is the fountain of all goodneſs, and ſource of every bleſſing, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, to whom belongs all glory, honour, and praiſe, now and for ever more.</p>
