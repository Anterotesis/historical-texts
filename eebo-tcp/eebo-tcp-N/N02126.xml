            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM not willing to add the Guilt of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,</hi> to the many Crimes you are pleas'd to charge me with; and therefore thus publickly manifest my grateful Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>good Service</hi> you have done the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Cause, by the <hi>Postscript</hi> to your <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Modest Proof,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER were your Views, in that truly admirable Performance; it would be Stupidity not to apprehend, and Forgetfulness not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, the Obligations we are thereby laid under, I shall therefore briefly take Notice of some of the special Favours, you have vouchsafed us in that <hi>Dissertation;</hi> and depend upon your usual
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002526_0003_0FDB5FA18A565108"/>
Candour, for Pardon of my necessary Defects in that Attempt.</p>
            <p>'TWOULD have been inexcusable Insensibility, to have overlookt the rare Imbellishments of your Stile, and the fine Flowers of <hi>Billingsgate</hi>-Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, which make up the Substance of that <hi>Discourse.</hi> I had tho't to have presented you with a Nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay of these Flowers; but upon a Review could find no room for Choice: (<hi>Impotent Malice, Venom, Disordered Brain, Petulance and Ignorance,</hi> an <hi>Empty Skull, Falshood, Profane Ribaldry, Sawcy, Puny Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> &amp;c. being the common Epithets, you are pleas'd to favour me with) And you'll excuse me the Trouble of transcribing the <hi>whole Discourse,</hi> since you can't be at a loss where to find it; nor can your value for, and esteem of it, suffer it to be long out of your Hands—I shall therefore only take notice of the particular <hi>Advantages</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to <hi>our Cause,</hi> from this Treatment. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THIS gives us a just Idea of the Spirit of our Adversaries;</hi> and will give every Body full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, how far they are from being Followers of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and how far from that Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Moderation which the Gospel requires, who so charitably damn by the lump, our <hi>Ministry, Ordinances,</hi> and precious <hi>Souls.</hi>—Can it ever enter into the Minds of any serious and well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Persons, that the only way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> is to commit their Souls, to the Direction of such <hi>wrathful</hi> and <hi>furious</hi> Guides?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THIS is a plain Indication of the badness of that Cause,</hi> which must be thus defended with <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Staves.</hi> And (to use your own Words) <hi>This offers it self an Evidence, that the Book</hi> you impugn, is <hi>not so contemptible, as you would represent it.</hi> For
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002526_0004_0FDB5FA2D8FCE578"/>
what Cause of these tragical Outcries, if you were not wounded with the Arguments? Why do you flounce at this rate, if not taken in the Toils?—Truly Sir, your substituting Anger for Argument, has rendred your <hi>Discourse</hi> a very <hi>harmless</hi> Piece.—And now I proceed, to offer you my Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legements, for your <hi>Remarks</hi> upon my <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>First, IT's very kindly done, plainly to inform us, to <hi>what Party</hi> you herd your self: And (to use a Phrase of your own) <hi>distinguish your Squadron by its proper Ensign.</hi> There can be nothing more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed by Words, than that it was the HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHURCH-Party and no others, whom I styled an <hi>Upstart Sect.</hi> You tell us, that 'tis the <hi>best and brightest Part</hi> of the Catholic Church, to whom I gave that Character: The <hi>Consequence</hi> therefore <hi>makes it self,</hi> that we have a TORY to deal with. And thence (by the way) we may give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Admiration at your manner of Address, so peculiar to your own Party.</p>
            <p>BUT you'll pardon my Diffidence, if I cannot yet believe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> so far degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the HIGH-CHURCH-Party, (a Faction not heard of till Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud's</hi> time, and no more a Part of the establish'd Church, than a <hi>Wen,</hi> or such like Excrescence, is part of a Man) are ten times so numerous, as all the other <hi>Sects</hi> in the Nation.</p>
            <p>YOU'll be pleased to wait a little, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns due to your abounding <hi>Charity,</hi> in denying all that want Ministers <hi>Episcopally ordain'd,</hi> to be any part of the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> for so your Words must be understood, if made consistent with the rest of your <hi>Discourse:</hi> Being yet to meet with <hi>more
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002526_0005_0FDB5FAA3416A3F8"/>
flights</hi> of the same kind, I hope to account with you for all together.</p>
            <p>BUT I'll not delay to offer you my Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legements, for the succeeding Paragraph, that<q>The <hi>Government</hi> will doubtless <hi>resent</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing that seditious Position, That the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Resistence,</hi> whereon is founded its own Security, are <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi> Principles, and ought to be exploded.</q> Is it a seditious Position, to call the Doctrines of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Resistence,</hi> (as propos'd in the <hi>Modest Proof,</hi> without any Limitation) <hi>Jacobite</hi> Principles? Be pleas'd Sir, to read the <hi>Trial</hi> of your late Brother Dr. <hi>Sacheveril,</hi> and you'll find by the Suffrage of the <hi>Supreme Judicature</hi> of the Nation, that the direct contrary Doctrine is Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> did actually make Resistance; and that the present most happy Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment is founded on the just Resistance then made to <hi>King James.</hi>—Is the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> founded on <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Resistance?</hi> Is it not a Fact notoriously true, and obvious to all the World, that all the <hi>Rebellions</hi> and <hi>Seditions</hi> that have been rais'd, during the happy Reign of our present most Excellent <hi>Sovereign</hi> King GEORGE, have had their rise from <hi>that Doctrine,</hi> as unlimitedly propos'd in the <hi>Modest Proof,</hi> and in this choice <hi>Discourse</hi> of yours! Be pleas'd Sir, to inform me in your next, (for you can doubtless tell) what is the unhappy <hi>Choak-Pear,</hi> that sticks in the Consciences of our <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and prevents their Swearing to the present <hi>Government,</hi> if this be not the Obstacle!</p>
            <p>Thus having in some measure discharg'd the Debt, due for your <hi>Remarks</hi> on my <hi>Preface,</hi> I'll now
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002526_0006_0FDB5FAE1C4390B0"/>
proceed to take notice of the peculiar Favours receiv'd from your <hi>Animadversions</hi> on the Book it self.—And</p>
            <p>THE first thing that bespeaks my Gratitude, is your necessary <hi>Evasion</hi> of that plain Demonstration offer'd in my <hi>Defence,</hi> that the little <hi>History</hi> with which the <hi>Modest Proof</hi> begins, is not only <hi>false in Fact,</hi> but egregiously <hi>Self-inconsistent. First,</hi> I have proved, that it was a gross Mistake to say, that <hi>there was little or no Noise made for above</hi> 1400 <hi>Years, about this Point of Church-Government.</hi> I have brought in <hi>Jerom</hi> plainly asserting the Identity of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters:</hi> I have produced the Confession of a Number of our Adversaries themselves, that St. <hi>Ambrose, Augustin, Sedulius, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius,</hi> and <hi>Theophilact,</hi> were all of 'em of the same Mind. I have observ'd that the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and <hi>Wicklef</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> with his Followers, were persecuted for this very Doctrine, <hi>before that Period.</hi> I have shewn you, that there was a great Noise made about <hi>Prelacy</hi> long before that Time; that <hi>prelatic</hi> Power and Superiority, when it did obtain, had been the dreadful Source of tumultuary Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars, and bloody Massacres in the ancient Church; whence <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> wish'd there had been no <hi>Prelacy,</hi> nor <hi>Prerogative of Place</hi> in the Church of Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have prov'd that Author guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of manifest Contradiction, in saying, that <hi>there was little or no Noise made about the Point of Church-Government, for</hi> 1400 <hi>Years;</hi> And yet <hi>that it was at length invaded and suppress'd by the Roman Papacy.</hi> I'm sure, there is no Proposition in <hi>Euclid</hi> more demonstrable, than that he is pleading for the <hi>Roman Hierarchy,</hi> according as it was establish'd in that <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> before the Year 1400;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002526_0007_0FDB5FAF9901BBC0"/>
when <hi>there was no Noise made about this Point of Church-Government;</hi> or else that according to him, there was no <hi>Roman Papacy</hi> before that Time, since the Government he propugns, <hi>was invaded and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd by the Roman Papacy,</hi> when it did arise. You might have had your Choice of these Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which (once more to use your own Phrase) do necessarily <hi>make themselves.</hi> But what have you said in Answer to all this? Might we not have reasonably expected (if I might yet use your own Dialect) some <hi>lisps</hi> upon this Head? But your Caution and Prudence are very praise-worthy, in chusing rather a safe Retreat under a mean Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, than to rush upon the Pikes of such glaring Evidence; and thereby rather to justify the Cause you pretend to oppose, (for which I thank you) than to expose your self in so dangerous a Field.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps you'll think your self neglected, if these Evasions (how mean soever) are not taken Notice of. And truly Sir, I have such an innate abhorrence to Ingratitude, that I cannot overlook these Favours.</p>
            <p>YOU tell me, that <hi>in your Reply to the Remarker, you have given the Sense of those venerable Persons on the Case, whose Voices I have had the Assurance to sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit.</hi> I have carefully read what you there offer, and can't find the least hint from any one of those <hi>Fathers,</hi> or from all of 'em together, that there is by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> a Disparity between <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters;</hi> but plain Suggestions to the contrary might be remarked, even from your own Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

            <p>BUT you have further obliged us by your usual Candour, in saying that <q>the Reason why the Dissenters are so fond of <hi>Aerius,</hi> seems to be, that he being branded for an <hi>Arian,</hi> as well as <hi>Schismatic,</hi> they are willing to pay a Deference to his Opinions in Doctrine, as well as in Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</q>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002526_0010_0FDB5FB86509A8B0"/>YOU first inform us, that <q>it will not follow, that there are no real <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Northern Kingdoms, tho' <hi>Bugenhage</hi> was improv'd as an Instrument of the Reformation in <hi>Denmark,</hi> where we are assur'd there are two <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> and thirteen <hi>Bishops.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. THAT <hi>Presbyters</hi> have Authority to Ordain <hi>Bishops.</hi> And thus you have, with one friendly Stroke, knocks out the Brains of your darling <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy;</hi> that it's hopeful we are to hear no more of the Necessity of <hi>Episcopal Ordination.</hi>

            <p>YOU subjoin, that <q>it's contrary to known Fact, and the truth of History, that there were no <hi>Superintendents</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where <hi>Knox</hi> was improv'd as a like Instrument.</q>—To which I make the same Reply. Was <hi>Knox</hi> a <hi>Bishop!</hi> How then came he by Authority to Ordain <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents?</hi> The Consequence again makes it self, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> may Ordain <hi>Bishops,</hi> tho' they have no Power to propagate their own Kind and Order. But since you're pleas'd to mention the <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as an Argument to prove, that the Reformation there was first establish'd upon a <hi>Prelatic</hi> Foundation; give me leave to consider the Case a little.</p>

            <p>THAT the continued Subjection of these <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendants,</hi> to the <hi>Presbyterian Assembly</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> makes 'em appear but very Whiggish <hi>Bishops.</hi>—You have not added one Word more against what was offer'd in my <hi>Defence,</hi> on this Point; and have therefore very fairly given up the Cause: For which I renew my Thanks; and hope the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen

of your Party, will not be so profligate of their Reputation for the future, as to Publish to the World such a ridiculous Story, that the greatest and most considerable Part of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> founded the Reformation upon <hi>Prelacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now I'm come to pay you my Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legements, for your <hi>Remarks</hi> upon what I offer'd on the FIRST HEAD.</p>
            <p>I hope the severe Correction you have given the <hi>Remarker,</hi> has not so maim'd and disabled him, but that he may yet defend his own Cause, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Second;</hi> I shall therefore only take Notice of what you say to <hi>me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not enquire, why you were so angry at my citing a Passage from Mr. <hi>Sage,</hi> the Cause is manifest: That Passage utterly destroys all your fine Scheme, taken from the Imparity of the <hi>Twelve</hi> and <hi>Seventy:</hi> And <hi>Losers we know must have liberty to speak</hi>—Nor need I enquire, why you did not attempt an <hi>Answer</hi> to Mr. <hi>Sage</hi>'s Arguments, whereby he irrefragably proves, that the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Commission did not constitute 'em <hi>standing Officers</hi> in the Christian Church. The Reason of this is also obvious. These Arguments were too hot for your Fingers. And, <hi>Nemo tenetur ad impossibilia.</hi> However, I must still thank you for giving up that Cause.</p>
            <p>AND now I'll consider your <hi>Queries,</hi> and hope I shall consistently Answer 'em, without being <hi>far remov'd from, and preaching another Gospel than that of Christ.</hi>—Yor first <hi>Query</hi> is, <q>Might not Believers in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Lamb of God, come to take away the Sins of the World, especially when baptized in that Faith, be accounted Members of the <hi>Gospel Church?</hi>
               </q> I must take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002526_0013_0FDB5FBE974CDBE8"/>
to Answer this Question in the Negative. And when you have heard and answer'd my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I'll submit to what Censure you're pleas'd to impose.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEN it's a plain Case, they could not be Members of the <hi>Gospel-Church,</hi> before there <hi>was such a Church.</hi> Members they were indeed of <hi>Christ's</hi> Mystical Body, and so Members of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church;</hi> but so likewise were even the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ante-diluvian <hi>Patriarchs.</hi>—And this also may serve for Answer to your Second <hi>Query.</hi> For, tho' <hi>our Saviour's Ministry was so succesful, as to gain many Converts to this Article,</hi> That he was <hi>the Lamb of God, come to take away the Sins of the World;</hi> yet not to this, That he he had <hi>actually</hi> abrogated the <hi>Jewish Oeconomy,</hi> and establish'd the <hi>Christian Church</hi> upon its Ruines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT there was no <hi>Gospel-Church</hi> at this Time is manifest from this, that our blessed <hi>Lord</hi> himself was actually a Member of the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> under the Laws and Government of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Dispensation. And accordingly we find him submitting, not only to the <hi>Government,</hi> but to all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> pertaining to that <hi>Pedagogy;</hi> as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and the Passover, the Jewish Sabbath, with all their other Festivals, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And I hope you won't pretend, that both these Dispensations did <hi>de jure</hi> subsist together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'TIS clear as Light, that the <hi>Christian Church</hi> was founded upon <hi>Christ's Death.</hi> In that all the <hi>Jewish Sacrifices,</hi> and other bloody Rites, were Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of his Death. And until the Substance (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002526_0014_0FDB5FC27011B1D0"/>
typified) was come, the <hi>Shadows</hi> could not be <hi>done away.</hi> (See <hi>Heb.</hi> IX. and X. <hi>per totum.</hi>) And equally certain it is, that this glorious Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must have been founded on <hi>Christ's Resurrection,</hi> since it's the grand Article of the glad Tidings reveal'd in the Gospel, that as <hi>Christ was delivered for our Offences,</hi> so <hi>he was raised again for our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Rom.</hi> IV. 25. To which I may add, the Apostle himself assures us, that the <hi>New Testament</hi> could not exist, and consequently not the New <hi>Dispensation</hi> therein reveal'd, before the Death of the <hi>Testator, Heb.</hi> IX. 16, 17. <hi>For where a Testament is, there must of necessity be the Death of the Testator. For a Testament is of force after Men are Dead, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is of no strength at all, whilst the Testator liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Whence it yet appears with a Meridian Lustre, that as there was no <hi>Christian Church,</hi> when the <hi>Seventy</hi> received their Commission, they could not be <hi>Officers</hi> in that <hi>Church,</hi> nor have any Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.—And so I'll pass to your Third <hi>Query,</hi> which is,</p>
            <p>
               <q>WERE not those, who in so many Words are said <hi>Luke</hi> IX. 6. <hi>to have went thro' the Towns preaching the Gospel,</hi> Ministers of the Gospel?</q> I Answer, They were <hi>Preachers</hi> of the Gospel, and so were <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> with all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and other Orthodox <hi>Ministers,</hi> in the <hi>Jewish Church.</hi> But if by <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> you intend <hi>Officers in the Christian Church,</hi> (as they must be understood in this Controversy) I must yet Answer in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi> for the Reasons above alledg'd. Nor will your meer Opposition afford contrary Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>IF it be demanded, what was the <hi>End</hi> of the special Mission and Commission of the <hi>Twelve</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002526_0015_0FDB5FC3D3C21330"/>
               <hi>Seventy,</hi> Luke IX. and X? I Answer in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of your own <hi>Brokesby</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Histor. of the Govern. of the Prim. Church.</hi>
               </note>, <q>They were sent as <hi>Forerunners</hi> before the Face of <hi>Christ,</hi> to the Places whither he would come, to prepare the People to entertain him.</q> I add, They were to preach the glad Tidings, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was already come, to take away the Sins of the World, that he would quickly bring in a <hi>new</hi> and better <hi>Dispensation.</hi> And to confirm their Doctrine, by undoubted Miracles.—Thus Sir, you see how much we are oblig'd to you, for offering nothing but these trifling <hi>Queries,</hi> to prove the <hi>Seventy</hi> to be Officers in the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> and thereby leaving your tottering Fabric, without any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, having not so much as one Prop, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
            <p>BUT it's time to offer you my Thanks, for your learned Pains to prove, what never any Body question'd; that <hi>'twas the Deacon's Office, to serve the Table of the Lord, as well as of the Poor.</hi> But, good Sir, what follows from hence? Are they therefore <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Baptizers;</hi> because they are to serve both these Tables? Aye, but <hi>Ignatius</hi> tells us, that <hi>they are not Deacons of Meat and Drink; but Ministers of the Church of God.</hi> I shall not now give you the Trouble of those ungainsayable Evidences, you have been so often told of, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> knew nothing of these <hi>Epistles.</hi> But only take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness humbly to enquire, whether the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not constitute them <hi>Deacons of Meat and Drink?</hi> Be pleas'd to read <hi>Acts</hi> VI. 1. and see if the first Occasion of instituting this Order, was not <hi>a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002526_0016_0FDB5FC553FFD7B0"/>
their Widows were neglected in the daily Ministration.</hi> Did these Widows want no <hi>Meat and Drink?</hi> Be pleased also to read <hi>v.</hi> 2d. where 'tis propos'd as their whole Business to <hi>serve Tables:</hi> And tell me in your next, whether Tables are not to be furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Meat and Drink?</hi> But if you prefer this supposititious <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the Twelve <hi>Apostles,</hi> will you not (if I may be allow'd a Phrase of your own) <hi>believe your dear self,</hi> who tell us, <hi>That the Deacons were to serve those Tables where the Eucharist was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated?</hi> And are not the Elements in the <hi>Eucharist, Meat and Drink?</hi>—Who now can be so ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, as to deny your Conclusion from this invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Argument, that <hi>Deacons were ordain'd for the superiour Offices of Preaching and Baptizing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it may be you'd salve the Reputation of your spurious <hi>Ignatius,</hi> by supposing his Meaning to be, that <hi>they are not</hi> ONLY <hi>Deacons of Meat and Drink; but Ministers of the Church of God.</hi> Be it so. Your Champion nevertheless militates against the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Institution, which makes it their <hi>whole</hi> and ONLY Business, to <hi>serve Tables;</hi> as I have shewn in my <hi>Defence,</hi> unto which you have not vouchsafed any Answer.—You have indeed given us a notable Specimen of your Learning, by criticizing upon the Word <hi>Evangelist,</hi> which you tell us, <hi>is the Greek of the English Gospeller;</hi> and that <hi>to say that the Deacons preached as Evangelists, is a plain Tautology, and no more than they preached as Preachers.</hi>—How greatly have you obliged your <hi>Reader,</hi> by this useful piece of Instruction! When for the future he shall hear the four <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists</hi> mention'd, he will thereby understand four <hi>Preachers.</hi> When he reads <hi>Eph.</hi> IV. 11. he'll under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that <hi>Christ</hi> has given for the Work of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002526_0017_0FDB5FC6D2D7DE28"/>
               <hi>Ministry,</hi> not only <hi>some Apostles, some Prophets, some Pastors and Teachers;</hi> but some <hi>Preachers</hi> also.—By the same way of Reasoning from the <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> Construction of Words, I can prove to you, that your <hi>Foot-Boy,</hi> when <hi>sent</hi> on an Errand, is an <hi>Apostle;</hi> that an <hi>Overseer</hi> of the <hi>Negroes</hi> in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> is a <hi>Bishop;</hi> that your <hi>Servant,</hi> when he brings you <hi>good Tidings,</hi> is a <hi>Minister of the Gospel.</hi> And a great many more such pretty Consequences might be thought of, by a Gentleman of your profound Learning, so well acquainted with the <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Greek</hi> Words. But the worst on't is, I must after all, take liberty to inform you, that the Word <hi>Evangelist,</hi> or <hi>Gospeller,</hi> as you English it, and <hi>Preacher,</hi> are not Terms <hi>synonymous:</hi> For <hi>Preaching</hi> is not the only Means to <hi>Gospellize</hi> the World. Private <hi>Instruction,</hi> the Ordination of <hi>Ministers,</hi> Administration of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> writing of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,</hi> &amp;c. are useful, and have been improv'd to this Purpose. And thus your fine Criticism is quite lost.—And now it's time you should be paid the Acknowlegements due, for leaving your <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>baptizing Deacon</hi> to shift for himself, without one Word in his Favour; save that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Saying</hi> of your counterfeit <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and this learned <hi>Descant</hi> of yours upon the Word <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH I have thus particularly consider'd these weighty Arguments, I'll for the Reader's sake, take the liberty of a short Digression, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to read the <hi>Sober Remarks</hi> upon this Head, 2d. <hi>Edit.</hi> from p. 18. forward; and my <hi>Defence,</hi> p 13, 34, 35. where he'll find this Matter set in a true Light, and strongest Evidence offer'd, that <hi>Philip</hi> preached as an <hi>Evangelist;</hi> and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Unto all which, this Gentleman did not find himself capable to make any Reply.—But I return to our Author.</p>
            <p>AND now Sir, that dreadful Posture in which you appear, arm'd Cap-a-pe, with <hi>Hercules</hi> Club in your Hand, threatning my poor <hi>empty Skull,</hi> might have fill'd me with such Surprize, that I could have meditated nothing but <hi>Flight,</hi> were it not for your merciful Disposition, (for which I thank you) which has by a new Piece of Military Skill, provided me a <hi>Shield</hi> for a Head-Piece; and directed all your terrifying Blows, against the <hi>empty Air.</hi>—You begin your Attack with this <hi>Syllogism.</hi>

               <hi>BUT all the Ministers of the Gospel, have the same Commission.</hi>—And all you pretend in Answer, (besides this notable <hi>petitio principii</hi> before cited) is, That <q>there were several Things contain'd in the <hi>Commission,</hi> and several Offices warranted by it.—That <hi>Deacons</hi> by virtue thereof did <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Baptize,</hi> but not consecrate the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> nor meddle with the Powers of Absolution and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which <hi>Presbyters</hi> did; but not <hi>Ordain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not vested with the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Powers of Ordination and Jurisdiction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WAS it ever heard of before, that <hi>Commissions</hi> might be thus crumbled into <hi>Parts?</hi> And that Men authorized by a <hi>Commission,</hi> might exercise but a <hi>Part</hi> of the Authority thereby confer'd upon 'em? Suppose his <hi>Majesty</hi> should honour you with the same <hi>Commission,</hi> which he gives to the <hi>Governours</hi> of the Plantations, (a Dignity well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming so GREAT a Man) would you take it kindly, to be deny'd the Exercise of a <hi>Governour's</hi> Powers, and to be acknowleg'd only in the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Peace?</hi>—Truly Sir, <hi>this fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spectre</hi> (as you call it) will still haunt you, and all your Party, till you can find some better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to lay it.</p>
            <p>BUT it's high Time to return you my Thanks for so quietly giving up the Argument for <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> from the <hi>Jewish Priesthood;</hi> and not venturing to advance one Syllable, in the Defence of so ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated a Plea. And you have more especially merited Thanks, for bringing this Controversy to so happy an Issue, by telling us, that <hi>the very Thing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002526_0020_0FDB5FCE89E1FFB0"/>
you contend for,</hi> is a <hi>Bishop</hi> of a <hi>Congregation, Ruling Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> (For these were the Offices mention'd from Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> with which you seem so well satisfied) And if these will satisfy, we may mutually Seal general Releases, from all Strife and Debate in this Controversy, from the Day of the Date of these Presents.</p>
            <p>AS for your <hi>Reasoning</hi> with the <hi>Remarker,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you pretend to have fully reply'd to what is offer'd by me under the <hi>Third Head,</hi> I have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perus'd it, and must profess I can find no Strength at all in it. I have consulted you upon the several <hi>Texts,</hi> made use of in my Defence, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. &amp;c. and can't perceive you have said any thing to take off the Force of the Remarker's or my Reasonings upon them. They therefore yet stand good against you, both in the <hi>Remarks</hi> and my <hi>Defence.</hi> You have left 'em safe in our Hands, for which I thank you.—I have further to acknowlege your Favour, in <hi>one peculiar Stroke,</hi> wholly new, which is all you have offer'd in answer to me; wherein you charge me with <q>Denying St. <hi>Paul</hi> the honour of being an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle:</hi> for (say you) before his Conversion he had not seen our Lord; and the <hi>Defender</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly says, None could be admitted into the <hi>Apostolate,</hi> but such as had seen <hi>Jesus</hi> before his Death.</q>—Wonderful that you should pitch on this single Passage in all my Discourse under the 3d. Head, to make your Exceptions against: and surely you were not very happy in the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you offer. For it is plain from the Text cited by me, (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 21, 22.) that none could be admitted to succeed <hi>Judas,</hi> in the Apostolate, but
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002526_0021_0FDB5FCFD380FB20"/>
such an one as had seen <hi>Jesus</hi> before his Death, as well as after his Resurrection. And that This was one stated Qualification of an <hi>Apostle,</hi> seems evident, not only from that Text, but also from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 8. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of himself as an <hi>Abortive,</hi> and hardly meet to be number'd among the <hi>Apostles.</hi> His Words are, <hi>Last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due Time.</hi> By which it appears He had that necessary Qualification for the Apostolic Office, <hi>A Sight of Jesus Christ:</hi> tho' this Vision of Christ, and his Mission then to be an <hi>Apostle,</hi> were LATE and MIRACULOUS. Wherefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> being so <hi>late,</hi> and in such an <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner, added to the <hi>Twelve,</hi> He lookt upon himself <hi>as one born out of due time.</hi>—And now judge you whether we are not much oblig'd to you, that you've offer'd nothing but one lean and pitiful Exception against all my Discourse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Temporeity</hi> of the Apostolate.</p>
            <p>THUS, Sir, I'm prepar'd to offer you my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegements, for your so favourably handling the <hi>Fourth Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR first Attempt is, to prove from <hi>Scripture,</hi> Reason, and Authorities, that <hi>James</hi> was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> But you have been so kind as not to offer one Word from <hi>Scripture,</hi> but what I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore largely consider'd in my <hi>Defence;</hi> to which I refer you, for a full and particular Answer.—You have indeed brought St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> for Vouchers, that <hi>James</hi> was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And have also quoted <hi>Euseb.</hi> Lib. 7. Cap. 14. to the same Purpose; but I must tell you, that I have carefully perused the Place refer'd to, and can't find there one Word of that Nature: tho' he does indeed tell us Lib. 2. Cap. 1. That <hi>James is</hi> SAID
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002526_0022_0FDB5FD439625690"/>
               <hi>to be the first, that occupied the Bishops See at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> But upon the whole, I have these Things to propose to your Consideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT your own <hi>Dodwell,</hi>

               </note> who pretends to much earlier and better Authority, assures us, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> did not obtain, before the Year 106. or thereabouts. And who is to be credited in this Case?</p>
            <p n="2">2. YOU have not made it appear, that these <hi>Fathers</hi> meant ought by <hi>James's Episcopacy,</hi> but his tarrying some considerable Time at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to well establish and build up the Faith in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Place; and to satisfy the Difficulties of those who came from all Parts of the World, to consult that <hi>Church.</hi>—I'm sure it can't be very good Sense, in them or any body else, to talk of an <hi>Apostle'</hi>s being a <hi>Diocesan Bishop;</hi> or in other Words, of his being sent to propagate the Gospel thro' the World, and yet confin'd to a particular City.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>Authors</hi> you quote, are much <hi>too late</hi> to determine this Matter. They living in an Age wherein there was so much Uncertainty, Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and childish Debate, about <hi>Apostolic</hi> Practices and Traditions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. NONE acquainted with <hi>Antiquity</hi> can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, how little the Authority of these <hi>Fathers</hi> is to be depended upon, in any <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Point.

            <p>I prov'd to you (in my <hi>Defence</hi>) from <hi>Timothy'</hi>s Peregrinations, recorded in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that if he was a fixed <hi>Bishop</hi> at any Place, he was a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of <hi>Non-residency:</hi> And that this Bishop of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> had the whole World for his <hi>Diocess.</hi> To which you Answer, <q>Will it follow, that because <hi>Timothy</hi> had been with <hi>Paul</hi> in several Places, that he was not afterwards settled at <hi>Ephesus?</hi>
               </q> The meaning of your Question is plainly this: Whether the <hi>Apostle</hi> did constitute <hi>Timothy</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> after he took his last leave of that Church, committing the Care of that Flock, to the Oversight of other <hi>Bishops,</hi> Acts XX. 25, 28. and after he had written his <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to the <hi>Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to the <hi>Hebrews?</hi> For by all these, I have prov'd him an itinerant Minister. To which I Answer, What should hinder, but <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy'</hi>s Ordination to that <hi>Diocess,</hi> might be the last Work the <hi>Apostle</hi> perform'd in the World? Or who can tell, but this Charge was a Legacy left him by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> in his last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament?</hi> Certain it is, he was an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and as such tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd from Nation to Nation, as long as we have
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002526_0025_0FDB5FDA172A7F08"/>
any Account of Things from the <hi>Apostle,</hi> in his <hi>Epistles</hi> to the Churches. But we must believe (we may take your Word for't) that he was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, afterwards <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS for what follows upon this <hi>Head,</hi> be pleas'd in your next to explain it, and make it intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>WE might have reasonably expected from your former Promise, a few Words at least, in favour of the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Crete;</hi> but you are not pleas'd to vouchsafe one Word of Proof upon that Point; nor a Syllable in Answer to the Objections against the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> of <hi>Titus.</hi> And therefore how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his <hi>Grace</hi> might merit your Neglect, <hi>you</hi> have certainly merited <hi>my</hi> Thanks, (which I freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer) for giving up that Cause.</p>
            <p>AND now I must enter the Lists with the <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic Angels,</hi> if you can either for Love or Money, engage 'em on your Side. But from what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, I need be in no great Terror, from the Expectation of this Conflict. For what I offer'd in my <hi>Defence,</hi> does yet remain <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and will ever do so, (notwithstanding what you have said, or can say) that these <hi>Angels</hi> must be taken in a collective Sense, as including not only the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> but even the whole <hi>Churches</hi> themselves.—You tell me, that <hi>the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Number is used ten times to one of the Plural.</hi> Be that so. There are nevertheless plural Expressions enough to make it evident, that these <hi>Epistles</hi> could not be directed, only to particular Persons.—You justly take Notice, that <hi>in Scripture-Language
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002526_0026_0FDB5FDC9C369478"/>
an Anallagy</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Enallage,</hi> it should be; tho' the learned Corrector of the Press, bids us read it <hi>Analogy.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>of Numbers is observable.</hi> But is it agreeable to Scripture-Language, to say to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Person, <hi>The Devil shall cast some of</hi> YOU <hi>into Prison, that</hi> YE <hi>may be tried,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> II. 10? Or that, <hi>My faithful Martyr was slain among</hi> YOU, as in <hi>v.</hi> 13? Is it agreeable to Scripture-Language, to call a <hi>Bishop</hi> a <hi>Church,</hi> and to conclude an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to a single <hi>Bishop,</hi> with this <hi>Epiphonema, He that hath an Ear to hear let him hear, what the Spirit saith unto the</hi> CHURCHES? Be pleas'd Sir, in your next, to give us Examples of this kind.—It's sufficient Answer to your Quotations, that there are as many <hi>Divines,</hi> no less Considerable than those mention'd by you, that are clearly and fully on our Side. But since all Appeals to <hi>Human Authority</hi> on either Side, serve only for Ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not for Evidence, I shall save my self the Labour, and you the Trouble of any Collections of that kind.—Besides it does not appear by your Quotations, that any of the mention'd <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> esteem'd these <hi>Angels</hi> to be <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> or had any other Notion of this Word <hi>Angel,</hi> than that it primarily imply'd, either the <hi>Moderator</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Pastor</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and by him the whole <hi>Church.</hi> And thus two of 'em, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> do expresly declare themselves, in the very Places by you quoted.</p>
            <p>BUT after all were it plain to a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as the direct contrary is) that these <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> were single Persons; is there the least hint in all the <hi>Epistles,</hi> that these single Persons had the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002526_0027_0FDB5FDE26039CF8"/>
sole Power of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> or were in any thing superior to other <hi>Presbyters?</hi> Nay is there any thing said to them, that might not have been with greatest Propriety spoken, even to meer <hi>Presbyters,</hi> of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> kind? Do not you your self allow, even to <hi>these,</hi> Authority to bear Testimony against false Doctrines; and to censure the Publishers of 'em? which is the highest Act of Authority you can with any Justice pretend to found upon these Epistles! Where then shall we find <hi>my Lord the Bishop?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I've considered (and thank you for) your successless Arguments, to engage these <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> to be <hi>Guardians</hi> to the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Cause.</p>
            <p>I'm next to acknowlege your Kindness, in so judiciously explaining the Word <hi>Co-ordinate;</hi> the meaning of which, you tell me, I was before ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of. But alas Sir, I must confess my self so dull a Scholar, as not to be susceptible of your learned Instruction. For I cannot for my Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, why two Persons authorized by the same <hi>Commission,</hi> and vested with all the same Powers, are not Co-ordinate; or why Ministers of the same Order, have not the same Office, and the same Power. But it's true my Dulness is none of your Fault, you have acted your Part faithfully.</p>
            <p>YOU next make some Pretences, to Answer the Arguments I offer'd against <hi>Prelacy;</hi> but you prudently take Time to consider of it; and find it the safest way, to defer your Answer, until <hi>latter Lammas</hi> next.—You say indeed, that <hi>I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002526_0028_0FDB5FDFA030B130"/>
it to be just arguing from a Community of Names, to a Co-ordination of Powers:</hi> But I affirm, that there is not one Word of that Nature in my <hi>Defence;</hi> and you did not want for <hi>Assurance,</hi> in publishing such a Story to the World.—My Argument was propos'd in these very Words.</p>
            <p>IF <hi>the Scriptures ascribe not only a Community of Names, but also of OFFICE and Order, to Bishops and Presbyters; they are necessarily Co-ordinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT the Scriptures do ascribe a Community both of Names and OFFICE, to Bishop and Presbyter</hi>—And it is not very difficult to account for your Conduct, in dividing this Argument, the whole was too heavy for you; And why should you take up such a Weight, as would break your Back? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, had you considered the whole Argument, you had lost the Advantage, of favouring the <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AS for the other five Arguments, you have implicitly acknowleged their Force, (for which I renew my Thanks) in not adventuring upon a Word of Answer.</p>
            <p>AND now I'll remember my Promise, of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you my Acknowlegements for your abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Charity,</hi> in mercifully <hi>Damning</hi> all the <hi>Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> World, but your <hi>own Party.</hi> You tell us. p. 55. that <q>they who have no proper <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> never were, nor are they now, any
