            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE, &amp;.</head>
            <p>I, EBENEZER FLETCHER, liſted into the Continental Army, in Capt. Carr's Company, in Colonel Nathan Hale's Regiment, as a fifer, and joined the Army at Ticonderoga under the command of General Saint Clair, in the Spring of 1777, at which place I was ſtationed till the retreat of the Army which was the 6th of July following.</p>
            <p>Early on the morning of the ſame day, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders came to ſtrike our tents and ſwing our packs. It was generally conjectured that we were going to battle; but orders came immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to march. We marched ſome diſtance before light. By ſunriſe the enemy had land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their boats, and purſued us ſo cloſely as to fire on our rear. A large body of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy followed us all day but kept ſo far behind as not to be wholly diſcovered. Their aim was to attack us ſuddenly the next morning, as they did.</p>
            <p>Having juſt recovered from the meaſles, and not being able to march with the main body, I fell in the rear. The morning after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, orders came very early for the troops to refreſh and be ready for marching. Some were eating, ſome were cooking, and all in a
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033740_0004_0FF8C13D6BD701D8"/>
very unfit poſture for battle. Juſt as the ſun roſe, there was a cry <hi>"the enemy are upon us."</hi>—Looking round, I ſaw the enemy in line of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Orders came to lay down our packs and be ready for action. The fire inſtantly began. We were but few in number compared to the enemy. At the commencement of the battle, many of our party retreated back into the woods. Capt. Carr came up and ſays, "My lads, advance, we ſhall beat them yet." A few of us followed him in view of the enemy. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery man was trying to ſecure himſelf behind girdled trees, which were ſtanding on the place of action. I made ſhelter for myſelf and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my piece. Having loaded again and taken aim, my piece miſſed fire. I brought the ſame a ſecond time to my face; but before I had time to diſcharge it, I received a muſket ball in the ſmall of my back and fell with my gun cocked. My uncle Daniel Foſter ſtanding but little diſtance from me, I make out to crawl to him and ſpoke to him. He and another man lifted me and carried me back ſome diſtance and laid me down behind a large tree, where was another man crying out moſt bitterly with a grievous wound. By this time I had bled ſo freely, I was very weak and faint. I obſerved the enemy were likely to gain the ground. Our men began to retreat and the enemy to advance. Having no friend to afford me any relief, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one taking care of himſelf, all things looked very ſhocking to me; to remain where I was and fall into the hands of the enemy, eſpecially in the condition I was in, expecting to receive
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033740_0005_0FF8F6305F6677A8"/>
no mercy. It came into my mind to conceal myſelf from them if poſſible. I made uſe of my hands and knees, as well as I could, and crawled about two rods among ſome ſmall bruſh and got under a log. Here I lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the enemy, who came inſtantly to the place I lay wounded at. What became of my diſtreſſed partner I know not. The enemy purſued our men in great haſte. Some of them came over the log where I lay. Some came ſo near I could almoſt touch them. I was not diſcovered by the enemy till the battle was over. When they were picking up the dead and wounded among the bruſh and logs, I heard them coming towards me. I began to be much terrified, leaſt I ſhould be found. I flattered myſelf that our men would come back after the battle was over and take me off; but to my great ſurpriſe, two of the enemy came ſo nigh, I heard one of them ſay, "Here is one of the rebels." I lay flat on my face acroſs my hands, rolled in my blood. I dared not ſtir, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid they meant me by ſaying, "Here is one of the rebels." They ſoon came to me and pulled off my ſhoes, ſuppoſing me to be dead. I looked up and ſpoke, telling them I was their priſoner, and begged to be uſed well. "Damn you, ſays one, you deſerve to be uſed well don't you? What's ſuch a young rebel as you fighting for?" One of theſe men was an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who appeared to be a pretty ſort of a man. He ſpoke to the ſoldier, who had taken my ſhoes, and ſays, "Give back the ſhoes and help the man into camp." My ſhoes were given
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033740_0006_0FF8C140EF385D18"/>
back by the ſoldier according to order. The ſoldier then raiſed me on to my feet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Britiſh camp. Here I found a number of my brother ſoldiers in the ſame ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of myſelf. I was laid on the ground and remained in this poſture till the afternoon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my wound was dreſſed. Two Doctors came to my aſſiſtance. They raiſed me up and examined my back. One of them ſays, "My lad, you ſtood a narrow chance; had the ball gone in or out half its bigneſs, you muſt have been killed inſtantly." I aſked him if he thought there was any proſpect of my getting well again. He anſwered, "There is ſome proſpect." I concluded by his reply, he conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered my caſe hazardous. The Doctors appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be very kind and faithful. They pulled ſeveral pieces of my clothes from my wound, which were forced in by the ball I received.</p>
            <p>Some of the enemy were very kind; while others were very ſpiteful and malicious. One of them came and took my ſilver ſhoe buckles and left me an old pair of braſs ones, and ſaid, <hi>exchange was no robbery;</hi> but I thought it robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at a high rate. Another came and took off my neck handkerchief. An old negro came and took my fife, which I conſidered as the greateſt inſult I had received while with the enemy. The Indians often came and abuſed us with their language; calling us Yankees and rebels; but they were not allowed to injure us. I was ſtripped of every thing valuable about me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033740_0007_0FF8F634C83DB208"/>
The enemy ſoon marched back to Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga, and left only a few to take care of the wounded. I was treated as well as I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Doctor Haze was the head Doctor, and he took true care that the priſoners were well treated. Doctor Blockſom, an under ſurgeon, appeared to be very kind indeed: he was the one, who had the care of me: he never gave me any inſulting or abuſive language: he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would ſay, "Well, my lad, think you'll be willing to liſt in the King's ſervice, if you ſhould get well? My anſwer was always <hi>no.</hi> The officers would flatter me to liſt in their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; telling me they were very ſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the country, ſince they had got our ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſt. I told them I ſhould not liſt.</p>
            <p>But among all the troubles I met with, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived particular favors from two of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. This conduct appeared to me very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; why or wherefore it ſhould be, I knew not; but he, who hath the hearts of all men in his hands, gave me favor in their ſight. They would often viſit me, and aſk me if I wanted any thing to eat or drink. If I did, I had it. The firſt time one of theſe friends came to me, was ſoon after I was brought to camp. As I lay on the ground, he aſked me if I did not want a bed to lie on I told him I did: he goes and gets a large hemlock bark, and finding many old coats and overalls, taken from the dead and wounded, and putting them in the bark, made me a bed, and laid me into it. He built a ſhelter over me with barks, to keep the rain from me, which was a great kindneſs as it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033740_0008_0FF8F6375BAFD078"/>
rained exceedingly hard the next night. He went to a ſpring and brought me water as often as I wanted, which was very often, being very dry; my loſs of blood occaſioning much thirſt. He aſked me, alſo, if I wanted to eat. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered yes; for having eat very little that day, I was very faint and hungry. He told me, he did not know as it was in his power to procure any thing for me, but would go and try. After an abſence of conſiderable time (certainly the time ſeemed long) he returned with a piece of boiled pork and broiled liver, telling me this was all the food he could get. I thanked him and told him it was very good.</p>
            <p>The next day he came and told me he had orders to march and muſt therefore leave me; was very ſorry he could ſtay no longer with me; but hoped ſomebody would take good care of me; taking me by the hand he wiſhed me well and left me.</p>
            <p>The loſs of ſo good a friend grieved me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely; but I ſoon heard that my other friend was ordered to ſtay behind to help take care of the wounded. My ſpirits, which before were very much depreſſed, when I heard of this, were much exhilarated; and once more I felt tolerably happy. The difference in mankind never ſtruck me more ſenſibly than while a priſoner. Some would do every thing in their power to make me comfortable and cheerful; while others abuſed me with the vileſt of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; telling me that the priſoners would all be hanged; that they would drive all the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rebels into the ſea, and that their next win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033740_0009_0FF8F63CA5EF0B58"/>
quarters would be in Boſton. They cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wintered in Boſton; but to their great diſappointment and chagrin, as priſoners of war.</p>
            <p>But to return. My wound being now a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better, I began to think of making my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from the enemy. Two of my fellow priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners agreed to accompany me; one of them being well acquainted with the way to Otter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creek. This plan, however, failed; for, before we had an opportunity for making our eſcape, Doctor Haze called upon my companions to be ready to march for Ticonderoga; telling them that the next morning they muſt leave this place. Thus I found, that as ſoon as the priſoners were able to ride, they were ordered to Ticondero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga. Being thus diſappointed I begged of the Doctor to let me go with them. Says he, "You are very dangerouſly wounded, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for you to ride ſo far yet; but as ſoon as you are able you ſhall go." Being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated I again reſolved to run away, even if I went alone, and it was not long before I had an opportunity. As all the priſoners were ſent off except us, who were badly wounded, they thought it unneceſſary to guard us very cloſely. I ſoon was able to go to the ſpring, which was at a little diſtance from camp. Thither I often went for water for myſelf and the Heſſians, who, by the way, appeared to be pleaſed with me, for I often waited upon them; brought them water, made their beds. &amp;c. and I found I fared the better for it. I often walked out into the woods where we had the battle; went to the tree where I was ſhot down; obſerved
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033740_0010_0FF8F63E57E90090"/>
the trees that were very much marked with the balls. One day as I was looking around, I found a few leaves of a bible; theſe I carried into the camp and diverted myſelf by reading them; for I felt much more contented when I had ſomething to read. My friend, whom I have before mentioned, one day brought me a very good book, which he told me to keep as a preſent from him. This I heartily thanked him for, and whenever I was tired by walking, would lay down and read.</p>
            <p>On the 22d of July, a number of men came down from Ticonderoga, with horſes and litters ſufficient to carry off the remainder of the wounded. Doctor Haze came to us and told us, that tomorrow we ſhould all be carried where we ſhould have better care taken of us. Says he, "I will ſend the orderly ſergeant, who will ſee that your bloody clothes are well waſhed." This, he thought, would be very agreeable news to us. I pretended to be very much pleaſed, though I was determined never to go. I told the perſon, who lay next to me, that I intended to run away; deſired him to make them believe I had taken the north road, if they inclined to purſue me, for I ſhould take the ſouth. Says he, "I will do all in my power to aſſiſt you, and wiſh it was poſſible for me to go with you."</p>
            <p>I made it my buſineſs that day to procure proviſion ſufficient for my journey. I had ſpared a little bread from my daily allowance, and although dry and mouldy, yet it was the beſt to he had. I had left, a large jack-knife the enemy had not robbed me of; I ſold this
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033740_0011_0FF8F643020760F0"/>
for a pint of wine, thinking it would do me more good on my march than the knife, as I found afterwards it did. The wine I put in a bottle and carefully ſtowed it in my pocket. I was hard put to it to get my ſhirt waſhed and dried before evening. However, agreeing with ſome to make their beds if they would dry my ſhirt, it was ready to put on by dark. I then went to my tent, took of my coat and jacket, and put on my clean ſhirt over my dirty one, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled my pockets with the little proviſion I had ſaved, I began my march homeward ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; reflecting what I ſhould do for ſo material part of my cloathing. It came into my mind that one Jonathan Lambart a day or two before had died of his wounds and left a good pair of ſhoes. Suppoſing my right to them equal to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other perſon, I took them and put them on, hereby reverſing the old proverd, <hi>He that waits for dead men's ſhoes will go barefoot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being dark I went out undiſcovered and ſteered into the woods. After going a little way, I turned into the road and made a halt. Now was the trying ſcene! The night being very dark, every thing before me appeared gloomy and diſcouraging; my wound was far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing healed; my ſtrength much reduced by the loſs of blood, pain, and poor living: thus ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to travel alone, I knew not where, having no knowledge of the way, I thought it would be highly preſumptuous. How far I ſhould have to travel before I could reach any inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, I could not tell: Indians, I ſuppoſed, were lurking about, and probably I might be
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033740_0012_0FF8C148DA89A3E0"/>
beſet by them and murdered or carried back; and if I avoid them, perhaps perriſh in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Reflecting upon theſe things, my reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution began to flag, and I thought it moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to return and take my fate. I turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and went back a few rods, when the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words ſtruck me as if whiſpered in my ear: <hi>Put not your hand to the plough and look back.</hi> I immediately turned about again, fully reſolved to purſue my journey through the woods; but before morning, had I been poſſeſſed of millions of gold, I would freely have given the whole to have been once more with the enemy. The road in which I had to travel, was one newly opened, leading from Hubbartſton to Otter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creek. The night being dark and the road ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crooked, I found it very difficult to keep it; often running againſt trees and rocks, before I knew I was out of it; and then it was with much trouble that I found it again, which ſometimes I was obliged to do upon my hands and knees and often up to my knees in mire.</p>
            <p>About 12 o'clock I heard ſomething coming towards me, what it could be I knew not, I, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, halted and looked back; it was ſo dark, I was at a loſs to determine what it was; but thought it looked like a dog. That a dog ſhould be ſo far from inhabitants, I thought very ſtrange. I at once concluded that he belonged to the Indians, and that they were not far off. I how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ventured to ſpeak to him, and he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately came to me; I ſtroked him and gave him a piece of my mouldy bread, which he eat and ſoon appeared to be fond of me. At firſt I
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033740_0013_0FF8F64845F7E888"/>
was afraid he would betray me to the Indians; but ſoon found him of much ſervice to me; for, after he came to me, I had not gone far, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I heard the noiſe of ſome wild beaſt. What it was, I dould not tell. I had juſt ſet down to reſt me, with my back againſt a tree, my wound being very painful. As the beaſt came towards me, my dog appeared very much frightened; lay cloſe down by me and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as if he expected to be torn in pieces. I now began to be much terrified; I however ſet very ſtill, knowing it would do no good to run. He came within two rods of me, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. I was unable to determine what it was, but ſuppoſed it was a wolf. I ſoon found I was not miſtaken. After looking at me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, he turned about and went off; but before long returned with a large reinforcement. In his abſence I exerted myſelf to the utmoſt to get forward, fearing he would be after me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. After travelling about half an hour, I was alarmed with a moſt horrid howling, which I ſuppoſed to be near the tree which I reſted by. Judge what my feelings were, when I found theſe beaſts of prey were purſuing me, and expecting every minute to be devoured by them. But in the midſt of this trouble, to my infinite joy, I diſcovered fires but a little way before me, which, from ſeveral circumſtances, I was ſure were not built by Indians; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at once concluded they were the fires of ſome ſcouting party of Americans, and I made great haſte to get to them, leſt I ſhould be be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken by the wolves, which were now but a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033740_0014_0FF8F64BB1EB4C00"/>
little behind. I approached ſo near the fires as to hear men talk, when I immediately diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered them to be enemies. Thus diſappointed, I knew not what courſe to take: If I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the woods, I ſhould be devoured by wild beaſts; for having eat of the bodies which were left on the field of battle, they continued lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for more. If I gave myſelf up to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I ſhould certainly be carried back to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga, and from there to Canada, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably fare none the better for attempting to run away. Which way to eſcape I knew not; I turned a little out of the path and lay down on the ground to hear what was ſaid by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, expecting every minute they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover me; the darkneſs of the night, however, prevented. Theſe howling beaſts approached as near the fires as they dared, when they halted and continued their horrid yell for ſome time, being afraid to come ſo nigh as I was. After the howling had ceaſed, I began to think of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting round the enemy's camp; being pretty certain, that as yet, I was not diſcovered. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from the ground and took a courſe, which I thought would carry me round the enemy. After travelling a little way, I came to the foot of a high mountain; to go round it I thought would carry me too much out of my courſe; I reſolved therefore to aſcend it; with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty I arrived at the top, then took a tack to the right; travelling that courſe ſometime, I found I was bewildered and loſt, and which way to go to find the road again I knew not, having neither moon nor ſtars to direct me; ſo I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033740_0015_0FF8F64F36E2DB88"/>
about in this wilderneſs till almoſt day, when I became ſo fatigued and worried, that I was obliged to lay down again: Judge what a perſons feelings muſt be in ſuch a ſituation.</p>
            <p>I now repented of my ever leaving the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Here I was loſt in the woods with but a very little proviſion, my wounds extremely painful, and, to ſum all, little or no proſpect of ever ſeeing human beings again. Thus I lay and reflected, my dog walking round me like a faithful ſentinel, till at length I fell aſleep; but was ſoon alarmed with the noiſe of cannon, which I concluded by the direction muſt be at Ticonderoga. Never was ſound more grateful to my ears than this cannon. I thought I might poſſibly live to reach the place, and though an enemy's camp, I would have given any thing to be with them again.</p>
            <p>Soon after the morning gun was ſired, I heard the drums beat in the camp which I had viſited in the night; this noiſe was ſtill more grateful, for I was now ſure they were not at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. With much difficulty I got on to my legs again, with a determination to go to their camp. I found however I could ſcarcely ſtand, for having laid down when I was very ſweaty, I had taken cold, and was ſo ſtiff and ſore, could hardly move. I now had recourſe to my little bottle of wine, which relieved me very much, and then began to march towards the drums, which ſtill continued beating.</p>
            <p>After travelling a little way, I heard a cock crow, which appeared to be near the drums. I thought it of little conſequence which object to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033740_0016_0FF8F651A8496A60"/>
purſue, both being nearly in the ſame direction. But the noiſe of the drums pretty ſoon ceaſed, and I ſtared for the other object, which ſoon brought me into open land and in ſight of a houſe. I got to the door juſt as the man aroſe from his bed, who met me. After the uſual compliments, I aſked him how far it was to the Britiſh encampment? He anſwered about fifty rods. "Do you want to go to them?" ſays he. I never was more at a ſtand what reply to make. As none of the enemy were about the houſe, I thought if I could perſuade this man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend me, I poſſibly might ſtill avoid them; but if he ſhould prove to be a tory, and know from whence I came, he would certainly betray me. I ſtood perhaps a minute without ſaying a word. He ſeeing my confuſion ſpoke again to me; "Come, ſays he, come into the houſe." I went in and ſat down. I will tell you, ſays I, what I want, if you will promiſe not to hurt me. He replied, "I will not injure you, if you do no injury to us." This anſwer did not ſatiſfy me, for as yet I could not tell whether he would be a friend or foe. I ſat and viewed him for ſome minutes, and at-laſt reſolved to tell him from whence I came and where I wiſhed to go, let the event be what it would. I was a ſoldier, ſaid I, in the continental army, was dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded and taken priſoner, had made my eſcape from the enemy, and, after much fatigue and peril, had got through the woods, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, to this houſe by the crowing of a cock. He ſmiled and ſaid, "You have been rightly directed, for had you gone to either of my
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033740_0017_0FF8F655B06A0718"/>
neighbors, you undoubtedly would have been carried to the enemy again; you have now found a friend who will if poſſible protect you. It is true they have forced me to take the oath of allegiance to the king; but I ſincerely hope the Americans will finally prevail, for I believe their cauſe to be juſt and equitable; ſhould they know of my harboring rebels, as they call us, I certainly ſhould ſuffer for it. Any thing I can do for you without expoſing my own life, I will do." I thanked him for his kindneſs, and deſired him not to expoſe himſelf on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>After giving me ſomething to eat and drink, he concealed me in a chamber, where, he ſaid I might ſtay till the dew was off, and then muſt go out into ſome ſecret place in the buſhes, there to continue till night; this he ſaid was neceſſary as the enemy were often plundering about his his houſe, and if I continued in it, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be diſcovered, which would ruin him. A little boy was ſet as a ſentinel at the door, who was to give notice if any of the enemy came near. I had not been in the houſe half an hour, before a number of them came in, but with no other deſign than to buy ſome rum and milk, and to borrow a pot for cooking.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were gone, the woman came into the chamber to dreſs my wound. She waſhed it with rum, applied dreſſings, and bound it up as well as ſhe could. She ſhowed every mark of kindneſs to me; but her huſband, whoſe name was Moulton, in a day or two after I got to his houſe, was preſſed by the enemy to bring
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033740_0018_0FF8F65AE5E06170"/>
ſtores from Skeenſborough with his team, and I never ſaw the good old man any more. His wife was in much trouble, leaſt the enemy ſhould find me in the houſe and be ſo enraged as to kill all the family. She permitted her little boy to guide me to the buſhes, where I might ſecrete myſelf; ſhe gave me a blanket to lie on. The boy went with me to my lurking place, that I might be eaſily ſound, ſo as to receive refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When night came on, I was called by the boy to the houſe again, and took my old ſtand in the chamber; the woman fearing I ſhould receive injury by lodging out of doors. She informed me that a man would lodge there that night, who was a tory, and brother-in-law to her huſband; one who had actually taken arms againſt his country. I told her, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended danger from tarrying in the houſe; ſhe ſaid there would not be any; I then lay ſnug in my ſtraw.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time the tory came for ſome drink; the indiſcreet woman told him ſhe had an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican in her chamber, who had been taken priſoner by the Britiſh and had eſcaped. He aſked her what kind of a man I was: She told him I was a young fellow and wanted much to get home, and begged that I might not be taken back to the enemy or betrayed. His anſwer was very rough, and I began to think I was gone for it. I expected to be forced back; but the woman interceding ſo hard for me, softened the ferocity of my tory enemy. Knowing I was diſcovered, I crawled from my hiding place and began a converſation with the man. He
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033740_0019_0FF8F65F0E6A7DA0"/>
aſked me if I belonged to the rebel ſervice? I told him I belonged to the continental ſervice. "What is that, ſays he, but the rebel ſervice." He addreſſed me in very inſolent language, and ſaid he was very ſorry to have me leave the king's troops in the manner I had done, and he would have me to know I was in his hands. I was patient and mild in my ſituation, telling him I was at his diſpoſal. My good miſtreſs often put in a word on my behalf.</p>
            <p>After ſome time ſpent in this way, the man aſked me if he ſhould chance to be taken, and in my power as I was in his, whether I would let him eſcape? I told him I ſhould. "Then, ſays he, if you will promiſe this, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you; alſo, that if you are retaken before you reach home, you will not inform, that you have ſeen me, or been at my brothers." I gave him my promiſe. His advice to me was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ſet out, for if I ſhould ſtay long I might be picked up by ſome body or other; "And, ſays he, I adviſe you to travel in the night and hide in the day, for many volunteers are reconnoitring up and down the country." I concluded to travel; but my feeling landlady thought it beſt to ſtay a few days longer. My friend tory ſaid it was beſt for me to travel as ſoon as poſſible. "If you are determined to go to night, ſaid the woman. I will dreſs your wound and give you food for your journey." I told her I would go as ſoon as poſſible. ſhe then dreſſed my wound far the laſt time, and filled my pockets with good proviſion. After thanking her for her kindneſs, it being all the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033740_0020_0FF8C14F97F09DC8"/>
compenſation I could make, and I believe all that ſhe deſired, I left her.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed on my journey, I muſt juſt tell you, that my dog, who had accompan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied me through many dangers, I was obliged to drive from me; when in the chamber he would commonly lay at the foot of the ſtairs. Mrs. Moulton often told me, ſhe was afraid he would betray me, for as the enemy were often in, ſhould they ſee the dog, might ſuſpect that ſomebody was in the chamber. I told her, with much regret, to drive him away; ſhe with her little boy tried all in their power to get rid of him, but in vain; the dog would ſtay about the houſe; at length ſhe called me to drive him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; I came down, and after much difficulty effected it.</p>
            <p>But to return. After being told the courſe I muſt take, I began my journey in the night, which was dark and cloudy, through the woods. I had not travelled more than two hours, before I got loſt. I concluded I had miſſed the road, and having reached the end of the one I was then in, I began to think of going back. My wound began to be very painful, and I was ſo fore, I could ſcarcely go. While I was ſeeking for the road again, there came up a thunder ſhower, and rained extremely faſt. I crawled into an old forſaken novel, which was near, and lay till the ſhower was over; then went back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half a mile and found the road once more. The road being newly opened through the woods was very bad, and it was with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty I could get along, often tumbling over
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033740_0021_0FF8F66477AC51C0"/>
roots and ſtones, and ſometimes up to my knees in mire. I once fell and was obliged to lay ſeveral minutes, before I could recover myſelf.</p>
            <p>About twelve o'clock at night, as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this wilderneſs, I was ſurpriſed by two large wild animals, which lay cloſe by the road, and ſtarted up as ſoon as they ſaw me, run a ſew rods and turned about towards me; wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they were bears or wolves, I could not tell; I was however exceedingly terrified, and would have given any thing for my dog again. One of them followed me for a long time; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would come cloſe to me, and at others, kept at a conſiderable diſtance. At laſt, he got diſcouraged and left me, and certainly I did not regret his abſence.</p>
            <p>At day light, I came into open land, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a houſe belonging to Col. Meads. I was not a little rejoiced to ſee his houſe, as I knew he would be a friend to me; but my joy was of ſhort continuance, for as ſoon as I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the door, I ſaw marks of the enemy; every thing belonging to the houſe being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off or deſtroyed. I thought it not prudent to go into the houſe left ſome of the enemy might be within; ſo I paſſed on as faſt as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it now began to grow light, and what to do with myſelf I could not tell. My friends had adviſed me to lay concealed in the day time and travel in the night.</p>
            <p>When I viewed the depredations the enemy had made on the inhabitants, and finding many of them fled; not knowing how far I muſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to find friends, and my wound being very
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033740_0022_0FF8C15382C99B98"/>
trouble ſome, I reflected long, whether to tarrg and be made priſoner, or puſh forward through a dreary wilderneſs; death ſeemed to threaten me on all ſides; however, I collected reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient to make to the eaſt; I conceived myſelf expoſed by my uniform and bloody clothes; to prevent a diſcovery by any who ſhould be an enemy, I took off my ſhirt and put it over my coat, by which my uniform was covered; in this line I marched: it being the orders of the Britiſh for all tories, who came to join them, to appear in this dreſs; I conſidered myſelf protected. I travelled till the middle of the day, before I ſaw any perſon; I then met a man driving cattle, as I ſuppoſed to the enemy. He examined me cloſely, and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if I was furniſhed with a paſs? I gave him plauſible anſwers to all his queſtions, and ſo far ſatisfied him as to proceed unmoleſted. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, if he knew one Joſhua Prieſt; he told me he did, and very readily directed me to the place where he lived. Leaving this man, I had not travelled far, before I met a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more, armed; being within about fifty rods of them, I thought to hide myſelf; but found I could not: I then made towards them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent fear. Coming up to them, I expected a ſtrict examination; but they only aſked me how far it was to ſuch a town: I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them as well as I could, and puſhed on my way.</p>
            <p>Being within a mile and a half of ſaid Prieſt's, I ſaw two men making towards me: They came to a ſence and ſtopped I heard them ſay, "Let's
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033740_0023_0FF8F4C4E0FAF288"/>
examine this fellow, and know what his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is." One of them aſked me where I was going: I told him to Joſhua Prieſt's: He aſked me my buſineſs there: I anſwered him, upon no bad errand: He ſays, "You are a ſpy:" I told him I was no ſpy; I did not like the fellow looks, therefore dropped the converſation with him, believing he was one of the enemy. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to converſe with any one, till I had arrived at Prieſt's, unleſs compelled to. Being almoſt overcome with fatigue, I wiſhed for reſt; however, theſe men ſeemed determined to ſtop me or do me ſome miſchief, for when I walked on, they followed me upon the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and in great rage told me, I ſhould go no farther, until I had made known to them who and what I was; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they had aſked me a civil queſtion, and they required a civil anſwer. I told them if they would go to Prieſt's, I would tell them all the truth, and ſatisfy them entirely, repeating to them I was no ſpy. They ſay they did not mean to leave me till they were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me. I then, in ſhort, told them what had beſel in the whole, and added, that I was well acquainted with Prieſt, and intended to tarry with him ſome time.</p>
            <p>We all arrived at Prieſt's, who at firſt did not recollect me. After ſome pauſe, he told me he was ſurprized to ſee me, as my father had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him I was ſlain at Hubbardſton. I told him, I was yet alive; but had received a bad wound. His family ſoon dreſſed my wound and made me comfortable. I then in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and hearing of my tory followers, told
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033740_0024_0FF8F66DA68B37D0"/>
Prieſt the ſtory of my captivity and eſcape, alſo repeated the inſolent language uſed by the tories towards our people. When priſoners with the enemy; finding Prieſt my friend, I ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſevere things againſt the tories, and fixed my countenance ſternly on thoſe fellows, who had pretended to lord it over me and ſtop me on my way. They bore all without ſaying a word; but looked as <hi>ſurly as bulls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſoon found theſe tory gentry had premed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated carrying me back, and were ſeeking help to proſecute their deſign. My friend Prieſt loaded his gun, and ſaid he would give them a griſt, if they dared come after me; but failing of getting any perſons to join them, I was not moleſted.</p>
            <p>I could often hear of my tory follower's threatnings againſt me, to take me back, ſaying, I ſhould be able to ſight again, and do injury to the enemy. I feated theſe tories would do hurt; but my fears were quieted by finding the neighbors were my friends, and would afford me their protection. Put I will write no more of tory plans.</p>
            <p>After being at Prieſt's about ten days, there came, one morning, a number of perſons to ſee me, and appeared very friendly and much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, leſt I ſhould be taken by the enemy. They informed me a man had arrived from Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne's army, and ſaid a party of Indians was to be ſent forward to guard the town where I was, and protect the tories and their property; our people coming twice while I was at Prieſt's to take tory property. Theſe people told me
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033740_0025_0FF8F672850E28B0"/>
an honeſt ſtory, and adviſed me to travel imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. Being deſirous to get home, I told my friend Prieſt I would not ſtay any longer. He ſays, "Don't be ſcared, I apprehend no danger from the Indians; tarry yet awhile for your wound is not healed; your are not able to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel through the woods; but do as you think beſt." Theſe men cried out, "Eſcape, eſcape, for your life; the Indians will be upon you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tomorrow night."</p>
            <p>Having reſolved to go on, my friends fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me with proviſion ſufficient for my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Without doubts and fears I went on my way, and, after travelling all day, I arrived at a place called Ludlow. From this town the people all fled and left their habitations: Great was my diſappointment! I ſpent the night in a melancholy manner; having neither fire nor bed to comfort my ſhivering and impaired bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys.</p>
            <p>About day, I ſet out from the dreary houſe, which had ſheltered me in the night. By trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling, I found I had taken cold, and that my wound was very painful. Deſponding, I thought it beſt to go back about ſeven miles to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, rather than to proceed homeward. Juſt before night, I arrived <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the place of the inhabitants, ſeven miles back, who received me kindly, and took ſpecial care of my wound.</p>
            <p>Juſt before ſunſet of the third day after my departure, I came to my old friend Prieſt's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

betray them; their reports afterwards proving all falſe.</p>
            <p>At my old friend, I ſtayed ſix weeks; in the mean time my wound was almoſt healed. I was hoſpitably entertained by him.</p>
            <p>Having heard that one Mr. Atwell, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to New-Marlborough, was in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood with a team to move a family, I agreed with him for a horſe to ride.
