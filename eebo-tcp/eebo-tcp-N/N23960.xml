            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>NO books whatever are more inſtructive and entertaining than books of Travels. They are particularly well adapted to young people. They ſatisfy that eager thirſt after knowledge, which is found very ſtrong in early life, and they intereſt the mind as much as a novel. They make it uſefully inquiſitive, and furniſh it with matter for reflection.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the following ſelection, it is only neceſſary to obſerve, that perhaps there never was brought together, in ſo ſmall a compaſs, in any language, a more copious collection of rational entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than will be met with in theſe vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes.</p>

The deſcription of a country, where, quite cloſe to the ſea, you perceive almoſt nothing but craggy cliffs vetrified by fire, and where the eye loſes itſelf in high and rocky mountains, covered with eternal ſnow, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly produce ſuch emotions, as at firſt ſight might entirely prepoſſeſs the thinking ſpectator. It is true, beauty is pleaſing both to our eyes and our thoughts, but wonderful nature often makes the moſt laſting impreſſions.</p>
                     <p>We caſt anchor not far from the dwelling-place of the celebrated Sturleſon, where we found two tracks of lava, of which the laſt in particular was remarkable, ſince we found there, beſides a large field covered with lava, which muſt have been liquid in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, whole mountains of turf. Chance had directed us exactly to a ſpot, on which we could, better than on any other part of Iceland, conſider the operations of a fire, which had laid waſte a tract of ſixty or ſeventy Engliſh miles. We ſpent ſeveral days here in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining every thing with ſo much the more pleaſure, as we found ourſelves, as it were, in a new world.</p>
                     <p>We had now ſeen almoſt all the effects of a volcano, except the crater from which the fire had proceeded. In order, therefore to examine this likewiſe, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a journey of twelve days; to Mount Hecla itſelf. We travelled about 300 miles over an uninterrupted

                        </gap> of lava, and gained the pleaſure of being the firſt who ever reached the ſummit of this celebrated volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no. The cauſe that no one had been there before, is partly founded in ſuperſtition, and partly in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty of the aſcent, before the laſt eruption of fire. There was not one of our company who did not wiſh to have his clothes a little ſinged, only for the ſake of ſeeing Hecla in a blaze; and we almoſt flattered ourſelves with this hope, for the Biſhop of Skallholt had informed us by letter, in the night between the 5th and 6th of September, the day before our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, that flames had proceeded from it; but now the mountain was more quiet than we wiſhed. We how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever paſſed our time very agreeably before one o'clock in the morning till two in the afternoon, in viſiting the mountain. We were even ſo happy, that the clouds, which covered the greateſt part of it, diſperſed towards the evening, and procured us the moſt extenſive proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect imaginable.</p>
                     <p>The mountain is ſomething above 5000 feet high, and ſeparates at the top into three points, of which that in the middle is the higheſt. The moſt inconſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable part of the mountain conſiſts of lava, the reſt is aſhes, with hard ſolid ſtones thrown from the craters, together with ſome pumice ſtones, of which we found only a ſmall piece, with a little native ſulphur. A
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031692_0010_0FEE0C8A6FDDD860"/>
deſcription of the various kinds of ſtones to be found here, would be too prolix and partly unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt many other craters or openings, four were peculiarly remarkable; the firſt, the lava of which had taken the form of ſtacks of chimneys, half broken down; another from which water had ſtreamed; a third, all the ſtones of which were red as brick; and laſtly, one from which the lava had burſt forth into a ſtream, and was divided at ſome diſtance into three arms.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid before, that we were not ſo happy as to ſee Hecla vomit fire. But there were ſufficient traces of its burning inwardly: for, on the upper half of it, covered over with ſnow four or five inches deep, we frequently obſerved ſpots without any ſnow; and on the higheſt point where Farenheit's thermometer was at 24° in the air, it roſe to 153° when it was ſet down on the ground; and in ſome little holes it was ſo hot, that we could no longer obſerve the heat with a ſmall pocket thermometer. It is not known whether, ſince the year 1693, Hecla has been burning till 1766, when it began to vomit flames on the 1ſt of April, burnt for a long while, and deſtroyed the country many miles round. In December, 1771, ſome flames likewiſe proceeded from it; and the people in the neighbourhood believe it will begin to burn again very ſoon, as they pretend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The ſprings that throw up water in the air deſerve more attention. I have ſeen a great number of them, but will only ſay ſomething of the two moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Near Laugervatan, a ſmall lake of about a mile in circumference, which is two days journey diſtant from Hecla, I ſaw the firſt hot ſpouting ſpring; and I muſt confeſs, that it was one of the moſt beautiful ſights I ever beheld. The morning was uncommonly clear, and the ſun had already began to gild the tops of the neighbouring mountains. It was ſo perfect a calm, that the lake, on which ſwans were ſwimming, was as ſmooth as a looking-glaſs, and round about it aroſe, in eight different places, the ſteam of the hot ſprings, which loſt itſelf high in the air.</p>
                     <p>Water was ſpouting from all theſe ſprings; but one, in particular, continually threw up in the air a column from 18 to 24 feet high, and from 6 to 8 feet diameter. The water was extremely hot. A piece of mutton, and ſome ſalmon trouts, as alſo a ptarmigan, were almoſt boiled to pieces in ſix minutes, and taſted excellently. I wiſh it were in my power to give ſuch a deſcription of this place as it deſerves; but I fear it would always remain inferior in point of expreſſion; ſo much is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at leaſt, that nature never drew from any one a more cheerful ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

The deſcription of the moſt remarkable water ſpout will appear almoſt incredible; but every part of it is perfectly true, for I would not aver any thing but what I have ſeen myſelf. At Gyſer, not far from Skallhalt, one of the Epiſcopal ſees in Icelands a moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary large ſpouting fountain is to be ſeen, with which the celebrated water-works at Marley and St. Cloud, and at Caſſel, and Herrenhauſen near Hanover, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be compared. One ſees here, within the circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of three Engliſh miles, forty or fifty boiling ſprings together, which, I believe, all proceed from one and the ſame reſervoir. In ſome, the water is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly clear, in others thick and clayey; in ſome, where it paſſes through a fine ochre, it is tinged red as ſcarlet; and in others, where it flows over a paler clay, it is white as milk.</p>
                     <p>The largeſt ſpring which is in the middle particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly engaged our attention the whole day that we ſpent here, from 6 in the morning till 7 at night. The aperture through which the water aroſe, is nineteen feet in diameter; round the top of it is a baſon, which, together with the pipe, has the form of a cauldron. The margin of the baſon is upwards of nine feet highet than the conduit, and its diameter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> feet. Here the water does not ſpout continually, but only by intervals ſeveral times a day; and as I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031692_0014_0FEF283E53156428"/>
by the people in the neighbourhood, in wet weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er higher than at other times.</p>
                     <p>One day that we were there, the water ſpouted ten different times, between the hours of ſix and eleven in the morning, each time to the heighth of eight or ten fathoms. Till then the water had not riſen above the margin of the pipe; but now it began by degrees to fill the upper baſon, and at laſt to run over. The people who were with us, gave us to underſtand, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would ſoon ſpout up much higher than it had done till then, and this appeared very credible to us. To determine its heighth, therefore, with the utmoſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, Dr. Lind, who had accompanied us on this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, in the capacity of an aſtronomer, ſet up his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant.</p>
                     <p>Soon after four o'clock, we obſerved that the earth began to tremble in three different places, as well as the top of a mountain which was about three hundred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms diſtant from the mouth of the ſpring. We alſo frequently heard a ſubterraneous noiſe, like the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a cannon; and immediately after a column of water ſpouted from the opening, which, at a great heighth, divided itſelf into ſeveral rays, and, according to the obſervations made with the quadrant, was 92 feet high. Our great ſurpriſe at this uncommon force of the air and fire was increaſed, when many ſtones, which we had flung into the aperture, were thrown up again with the ſpouting water. It is eaſy to conceive
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031692_0015_0FEF28AD51139CD0"/>
with how much pleaſure we ſpent the day here; and indeed, I am not ſurpriſed, that a people ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſuperſtition as the Icelanders are, imagine this to be the entrance of hell. The idea is very natural to uninformed minds.</p>

                     <p>THE Icelanders are of a good honeſt diſpoſition; but they are, at the ſame time, ſo ſerious and ſullen, that I hardly remember to have ſeen any one of them laugh. They are by no means ſo ſtrong as might be ſuppoſed, and much leſs handſome. Their chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement in their leiſure hours, is to recount to one another the hiſtory of former times; ſo that to this day you do not meet with an Icelander, who is not well acquainted with the hiſtory of his own country. They alſo play at cards.</p>
                     <p>Their houſes are built of lava, thatched with turf, and ſo ſmall, that one can hardly find room to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> in. They have no floors; and their windows, inſtead of glaſs are compoſed of thin membranes of certain ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031692_0016_0FEF28B0C0C39A38"/>
They make no uſe of chimnies, as they never light a fire except to dreſs their victuals, when they only lay the turf on the ground. It may therefore be ſaid, that we ſaw no houſes except ſhops and ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes; and on our journey to Hecla, we were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to take up our lodgings in the churches.</p>
                     <p>Their food principally conſiſts of dried fiſh, ſour butter, which they conſider as a great dainty, milk mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water and whey, and a little meat. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo little bread from the Daniſh company, that there is ſcarcely any peaſant who eats it above three or four months in the year. They likewiſe boil groats of a kind of moſs, which has an agreeable taſte. The principal occupation of the men is fiſhing, which they follow both winter and ſummer. The women take care of the cattle and knit ſtockings. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dreſs and dry the fiſhes brought home by the men, and otherwiſe aſſiſt in preparing this ſtaple commodity of the country.</p>
                     <p>Money is very rare, which is the reaſon that all trade is carried on by fiſh and ells of coarſe unſhorn cloth. One ell is worth two fiſhes, and forty-eight fiſhes are worth a rix-dollar in ſpecie. They were better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with gold at our departure than at our arrival.</p>
                     <p>They are well provided with caſtle, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031692_0017_0FEF28B523ED4400"/>
without horns. They have likewiſe ſheep and very good horſes. Both the laſt are the whole winter in the fields. Of wild animals they have only foxes, and bears, which come every year from Greenland with the floating ice; theſe, however, are killed as ſoon as they appear, partly on account of the reward of ten dollars, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Governor has introduced rein-deer into the iſland; but out of thirteen, ten died on their paſſage, the other three are alive with their young.</p>
                     <p>It is extraordinary that no wood grows ſucceſsfully in Iceland; nay, there is ſcarcely a ſingle tree to be found on the whole iſland, though there are certain proofs of wood having formerly grown there in great abundance. Corn cannot be cultivated here to any advantage, though I have met with cabbages, parſley, turnips, and peaſe, in five or ſix gardens, which are the only ones in the whole iſland.</p>

In the morning and evening they commonly eat curds mixed with new milk, and ſometimes with juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-berries; in ſome parts they alſo have pottage of rock-graſs, dried and made into flour, which is very palatable, or curdled milk, boiled till it becomes of a red colour, or new milk, boiled a long while.</p>
                     <p>At dinner their food conſiſts of dried fiſh, with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſour butter. They alſo ſometimes eat freſh fiſh, and, when poſſible, a little bread and cheeſe with them. It is reported by ſome, that they do not eat any fiſh till it is quite rotten. This report perhaps proceeds from their being fond of it when a little tainted. However, they frequently eat fiſh that is quite freſh.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday, and in harveſt-time, they have broth made of meat, which is often boiled in <hi>ſyra,</hi> or ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whey inſtead of water; and in winter they eat hung or dried meat.</p>
                     <p>Their common beverage is milk, either warm from the cow, or cold, and ſometimes boiled. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe drink butter-milk, with or without water.</p>
                     <p>They ſeldom make uſe of freſh or ſalt butter, but let it grow ſour before they eat it. In this manner it may be kept twenty years, and even longer; and the Icelanders look upon it as more wholeſome and palata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the butter uſed amongſt us. It is reckoned better the older it is; and one pound of it then is as much valued as two pounds of freſh butter.</p>

This is the uſual manner of life in Iceland. In all countries the living of the poor differs eſſentially from that of the rich; and if an Iceland gentleman can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to eat meat, butter, ſhark, and whale, the peaſants are obliged to content themſelves with fiſh, blands, or milk mixed with water, and milk pottage of rock-graſs. Though the Icelanders cannot be ſaid to be in want of neceſſary aliment, yet the country has ſeveral times been viſited by great famines. Theſe, however, have been chiefly owing to the Greenland floating ice, which, when it comes in great quantities, prevents the graſs from growing, and puts an entire ſtop to their fiſhing.</p>

A ſlave brings water in one hand, and a baſon in the other to waſh.

                     <p>THE country of Egypt is in fact ſo low, that were it not for a few little hillocks, formed by the ruins of ancient Alexandria, and the prodigious heighth of Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey's Pillar, the land would not be diſtinguiſhable. The whole coaſt is horizon; and it is with difficulty one perceives, from three leagues off at ſea, ſome palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, which ſeem to grow out of the water. It is not
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031692_0024_0FEF28D2CE011540"/>
to the flatneſs of the country alone, however, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt is indebted for its periodical inundation.</p>
                     <p>The trade winds, from Weſt and North, by puſhing the clouds of Europe on Abyſſinia, blow in the direction of the Nile, in which mechaniſm of nature it muſt be remarked, that the wind, by driving back the waters of the river, becomes the principal cauſe of its ovarflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Having reached its higheſt degree towards the middle of September, the winds then becoming trade-winds from the ſouthward, concur with the natural deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Nile, to accelerate the draining of the water, to the ſame time that they collect the ſuperfluous clouds, now of no further uſe, over Abyſſinia and Ethiopia, and carry them, for the ſame beneficial purpoſe of a periodical inundation, towards the ſources of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, to enrich Meſopotamia, after abundantly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Egypt. At this period, therefore, one ſees a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of clouds paſs the Red Sea, towards the Iſthmus of Suez, ſpread over Syria, and collect on mount Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, whilſt the ſame trade-wind blowing in the gulf of Perſia, compreſſing the waters of the Euphrates, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in Meſopotamia, by the ſame means, the ſame advantages enjoyed by Egypt.</p>
                     <p>This meteorological obſervation, the particulars of which I have carefully attended to, may be verified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year, in a climate where the ſerenity of the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens cannot admit of error.</p>

All the deſcriptions of Egypt hitherto, agree in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the mud, with which the waters of the Nile an loaded during its increaſe, and which are left on the lands they overflow, as a fattener which fertilizes the country.

                        </gap> carries off the clayey part. Its ſpecific lightneſs, join<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to the motion of the waters, keeps its particles ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, whilſt the ſand ſettles, and forms new iſland for the inhabitants after the draining of the waters. The cultivator takes immediate poſſeſſion of them, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſupplying the barrenneſs of the ſand, with which he mixes pigeons dung, then ſows his water-melons and enjoys a plentiful crop, before the ſucceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation deſtroys theſe iſlands to produce others.</p>
                     <p>The whirlpools which occaſion theſe variations, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ariſe from the double effort, of the deſcent of the waters, and the wind which counteracts them; but the Nile, notwithſtanding this agitation, is ſo eaſy to be kept within its bounds, that many fields, ſituated below the ſurface of the water, in its increaſe, are preſerved from ſuffering from the inundation, by means only of a dam of eight or ten inches thickneſs in moiſt grounds.</p>
                     <p>

This method, which coſts the huſbandman but little labour, is made uſe of to preſerve the Delta, when it is threatened by an inundation. This iſland, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces annually three crops, is conſtantly watered by machines built on the Nile, and on the canals which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſect it, but it is very ſeldom in danger of being drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and this rich part of Egypt, which is cloſe to the ſea, would feel the effects of the ſwelling ſtill leſs, did not the trade-winds accumulate the waters of the Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterranean towards the ſouth.</p>
                     <p>It is important to obſerve, that the Delta, higher than the reſt of Egypt, is bordered, towards the ſea, by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of palm-trees, called the foreſt of Beleros, the ground of which is far above the higheſt elevation of the waters, a topographical remark of itſelf, ſufficient to overthrow the formation of the Delta by a ſediment. Land, which is higher than the greateſt inundations, can never owe its origin to them. It can only have occaſioned the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Nile into two branches. But neither this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, nor the exiſtence of the iſland, which ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates them, required ſo much labour; and Mr. Maillet might in this reſpect, have ſpared himſelf the repetition of the ſyſtem of Ephorus, which was not held in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, even by his cotemporaries.</p>
                     <p>The veſtiges of the canals, which watered the eaſtern and weſtern provinces of the Delta, prove that it was formerly the ſeat of the richeſt cultivation in Egypt. It may alſo be preſumed, from the extent of the ruins of Alexandria, the ſtructure of the canal, and the natural equality of the lands, which ſurround lake Mareotis,

                     <p>Egypt, ſo ſituated as to combine the commerce of Europe, Africa, and the Eaſt Indies, was in want of a port, which ſhould at once be ſpacious and eaſy of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.

                     <p>The nature of the rock, which lines the coaſt of Egypt, proves that the iſland, on which the Pharos is built, can only have been formed by the aſhes of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, and that the ſhallow, which ſeparates the two baſons, aroſe from the ruins brought there by the ſea.

                     <p>ONE can ſcarcely believe the influence which men of letters have in the gay and diſſipated city of Paris. Their opinions not only determine the merit of works of taſte and ſcience, but they have conſiderable weight on the manners and ſentiments of people of rank, of the public in general, and conſequently are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect on the meaſures of government.</p>
                     <p>The ſame thing takes place, in ſome degree, in moſt countries of Europe; but if I am not miſtaken, more at Paris than any where elſe; becauſe men of letters are here at once united to each other by the various acad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies, and diffuſed among private ſocieties, by the manners and general taſte of the nation.</p>
                     <p>As the ſentiments and converſation of men of letters influence, to a certain degree, the opinions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the faſhionable world; the manners of theſe laſt have a more obvious effect upon the behaviour, and the converſation of the former, which in general is polite and eaſy; equally purified from the awkward timidity contracted in retirement, and the diſguſting ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance inſpired by univerſity honours, or church dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. At Paris, the pedants of Moliere are to be ſeen on the ſtage only.</p>
                     <p>In this country, at preſent, there are many men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031692_0030_0FEF28EDF63B0A98"/>
by their learning, who at the ſame time are chearful and eaſy in mixed company, unpreſuming in argument, and in every reſpect as well bred, as thoſe who have no other pretenſion.</p>
                     <p>Politeneſs and good manners, indeed may be traced, though in different proportions, through every rank, from the greateſt of the nobility to the loweſt mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic. This forms a more remarkable and diſtinguiſhing feature in the French national character, than the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity, impetuoſity, and fickleneſs, for which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as well as the modern inhabitants of this country have been noted. It is certainly a very ſingular phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon, that politeneſs which, in every other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is confined to people of a certain rank in life, ſhould here pervade every ſituation and profeſſion. The man in power is courteous to his dependant, the proſperous to the unfortunate, the very beggar, who ſolicits charity, does it "en homme comme il ſaut;" and if his requeſt be not granted, he is ſure, at leaſt, that it will be refuſed with an appearance of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not with harſhneſs or inſult.</p>
                     <p>A ſtranger, quite new and unverſed in their language, whoſe accent is, uncouth and ridiculous in the ears of the French, and who can ſcarcely open his mouth, without making a blunder in grammar or idiom, is heard with the moſt ſerious attention, and never laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, even when he utters the oddeſt ſoleciſm or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal expreſſion.</p>

                     <p>The moſt daring deviation from faſhion, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant article of dreſs, cannot make them forget the laws of good-breeding. When a perſon appears at the public walks, in clothes made againſt every law of the mode, upon which the French are ſuppoſed to lay ſuch ſtreſs, they do not ſtare or ſneer at him; they allow him firſt to paſs, as it were unobſerved, and do not till then turn round to indulge the curioſity, which his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common figure may have excited. I have remarked this inſtance of delicacy often in the ſtreets, in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the vulgar, or rather of the common people; for there are really very few of the natives of Paris, who can be called vulgar.</p>

A Turk, or Perſian, contemplates his Emperor with fear and reverence, as a ſuperior being, to whoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it is his duty to ſubmit, as to the laws of nature, and the will of Providence.</p>
                     <p>But a Frenchman, while he knows that his king is of the ſame nature, and liable to all the weakneſſes of other men; while he enumerates his follies, and laughs as he laments them, is nevertheleſs attached to him by a ſentiment of equal reſpect and tenderneſs; a kind of affectionate prejudice, independant of his real charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

The moſt inconſiderable circumſtance, which relates to the monarch, is of importance. Whether he eat much or little at dinner; the coat he wears, the horſe on which he rides, all afford matter of converſation in the various ſocieties at Paris, and are the moſt agreeable ſubjects of epiſtolary correſpondence with their friends in the provinces.</p>
                     <p>If he happens to be a little indiſpoſed, all Paris, all France, is alarmed, as if a real calamity was threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and to ſeem intereſted, or to converſe upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject, till this has been diſcuſſed, would be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a proof of unpardonable indifference.</p>
                     <p>At maſs, it is the king, not the prieſt, who is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of attention. The hoſt is elevated, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's eyes remain fixed upon the face of their beloved monarch.</p>
                     <p>Even the moſt applauded pieces of the theatre, which in Paris create more emotion than the ceremonies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, can with difficulty divide their attention. A ſmile from the king makes them forget the ſorrows of Andromache, and the wrongs of the Cid.</p>
                     <p>All this regard ſeems real, and not affected from any motive of intereſt; at leaſt it muſt be ſo, with reſpect to the bulk of the people, who can have no hopes of ever being known to their princes, far leſs of ever receiving any perſonal favour from them.</p>
                     <p>The philoſophical idea, that kings have been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for public conveniency; that they are accountable
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031692_0034_0FEF2903F9C90B88"/>
to their ſubjects for mal-adminiſtration, or for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acts of injuſtice and oppreſſion, is a doctrine very oppoſite to the general prejudices of this nation. If any of their kings were to behave in ſuch an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and outrageous manner, as to occaſion a revolt, and if the inſurgents actually got the better, I queſtion if they would think of new-modelling the government, and limiting the power of the Crown, as was done in Britain at the Revolution, ſo as to prevent the like abuſes for the future. They never would think of going fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I imagine, than placing another prince of the Bourbon family on the throne, with the ſame power that his predeceſſor had, and then quietly lay down their arms, ſatisfied with his royal word or declaration, to govern with more equity.</p>
                     <p>The French ſeem ſo delighted and dazzled with the luſtre of monarchy, that they cannot bear the thoughts of any qualifying mixture, which might abate its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and render its ardor more benign. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the power of the king, from which their ſervitude proceeds, as if it were their own power. One would hardly believe it; but I am ſure of the fact; they are proud of it; they are proud that there is no check or limitation to his authority.</p>
                     <p>They tell you with exultation, that the king has an army of near two hundred thouſand men in the time of peace. A Frenchman is as vain of the palaces, fine gardens, number of horſes, and all the parapharnalia belonging to the court of the monarch, as an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can be of his own houſe, gardens, and equipage.</p>

When they are told of the diffuſion of wealth in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, the immenſe fortunes made by many individuals, the affluence of thoſe of middle rank, the ſecurity and eaſy ſituation of the common people; inſtead of being mortified by the compariſon, which might naturally occur to their imaginations, they comfort themſelves with the reflection, that the Court of France is more brilliant than the Court of Great Britan, and that the Duke of Orleans and the Prince of Conde have greater revenues than any of the Engliſh nobility.</p>
                     <p>When they hear of the freedom of debate in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the liberties taken in writing or ſpeaking of the conduct of the king, or meaſures of Government, and the forms to be obſerved, before thoſe who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the moſt daring abuſe of either can be brought to puniſhment, they ſeem filled with indignation, and ſay with an air of triumph, that their miniſter would give himſelf no trouble about forms or proofs; that ſuſpicion was ſufficient for him, and without more ado he would ſhut up ſuch impertinent people in the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile for many years; and then raiſing their voices; as if what they ſaid were a proof of the courage or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of the miniſter—"On peut-être il feroit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damner ces drôles là aux galères pour la vie."<note n="*" place="bottom">Or perhaps he would have ſuch fellows condemned to the gallies for life.</note>

                     <head>SECT. VIII. OF THE COMPLIMENTAL PHRASES USED BY THE FRENCH.</head>
                     <p>THE French have often been accuſed of inſincerity, and of being warm in profeſſions, but devoid of real friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Our countrymen in particular are led into this opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, from the manners in general being more obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous here than in England. What Frenchmen conſider as common good manners, many Engliſhmen would call flattery, perhaps fawning.</p>
                     <p>Their language abounds in complimental phraſes, which they diſtribute with wonderful profuſion and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility; but they intend no more by them, than an Engliſhmen means when he ſubſcribes himſelf your moſt obedient humble ſervant, at the concluſion of a letter.</p>
                     <p>A Frenchman not only means nothing beyond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility, by the plentiful ſhower of compliments which he pours on every ſtranger; but alſo, he takes it for granted, that the ſtranger knows that nothing more is meant. Theſe expreſſions are fully underſtood by his countrymen; he imagines all the world are as well informed; and he has not the ſmalleſt intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. But if any man takes theſe expreſſions in a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, and believes that people are in reality inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with friendſhip, or have fallen in love with him at firſt ſight, he will be very much diſappointed; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he expects ſtrong proofs of either.</p>
                     <p>

Yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> has no right to accuſe the French of inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or breach of friendſhip. Friendſhip is entirely out of the queſtion. They never intended to convey any other idea, than that they were willing to receive him on the footing of an acquaintance; and it was the buſineſs of his language-maſter to have informed him of the real import of their expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>If the ſame words, indeed, were literally tranſlated into Engliſh, and uſed by one Engliſhman to another, the perſon to whom they were addreſſed, would have good reaſon to imagine, that the other had a particular regard for him, or meant to deceive him; becauſe the eſtabliſhed modes of civility and politeneſs in England do not require ſuch language.</p>
                     <p>The not making a proper allowance for different modes and uſages, which accident has eſtabliſhed, is one great cauſe of the unfavourable and harſh ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the people of the different countries of the world too often harbour againſt each other.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, perhaps, that this ſuperfluity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, which the French make uſe of, is a proof of the matter in queſtion, that the French have leſs ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than their neighbours. By the ſame rule we muſt conclude, that the common people of every nation, who uſe few complimental phraſes in their diſcourſe, have a greater regard to truth, and ſtronger ſentiments of friendſhip, than thoſe in the middle and higher
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031692_0038_0FEF2915492BA418"/>
ranks. But this is what I imagine it would be difficult to prove.</p>
                     <p>Theſe complimental phraſes, which have crept into all modern languages, may, perhaps, be ſuperfluous: or, if you pleaſe, abſurd. But they are ſo fully eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that people of the greateſt integrity make uſe of them, both in England and in France, with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that a ſmaller proportion will do in the language of the one country than in that of the other. They are, however, indications of friendſhip in neither.</p>
                     <p>Friendſhip is a plant of ſlow growth in every climate. Happy the man who can rear a few, even where he has the moſt ſettled reſidence. Travellers, paſſing through foreign countries, ſeldom take time to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them. If they be preſented with ſome flowers, although of a flimſey texture and quicker growth, they ought to accept of them with thankfulneſs, and not quarrel with the natives for chooſing to retain the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er more valuable plant for their own uſe.</p>
                     <p>Of all travellers, the young Engliſh nobility and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have the leaſt right to find fault with their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment while on their tours abroad; for ſuch of them as ſhow a deſire of forming a connection with the inhabitants, by even a moderate degree of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are received upon eaſier terms than the travellers from any other country; but very conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our countrymen have not the ſmalleſt deſire of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031692_0039_0FEF2916CFE9B718"/>
that nature. They ſeem rather to avoid their ſociety and accept with reluctance every offer of hoſpitality. This happens, partly from a prejudice againſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners of every kind, partly from timidity or natural reſerve, and in a great meaſure from indolence, and an abſolute deteſtation of ceremony and reſtraint. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they hate to be obliged to ſpeak a language, of which they ſeldom acquire a perfect command.</p>
                     <p>They frequently, therefore, form ſocieties or clubs of their own, where all ceremony is diſmiſſed, and the greateſt eaſe and latitude allowed in their behaviour, dreſs, and converſation. There they confirm each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all their prejudice, and with united voices, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and ridicule the cuſtoms and manners of every country but their own.</p>
                     <p>By this conduct, the true purpoſe of travelling is loſt or perverted; and many Engliſh travellers have remained four or five years abroad, and have ſeldom, during all this ſpace, been in any company but that of their own countrymen.</p>
                     <p>To go to France and Italy, and there converſe with none but Engliſh people, and merely that you may have it to ſay, that you have been in thoſe countries, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> certainly abſurd. Nothing can be more ſo, except to adopt with enthuſiaſm, the faſhions, fopperies, taſte, and manners of thoſe countries, and tranſplant them to England, where they never will thrive, and where
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031692_0040_0FEF2922277BB250"/>
they always appear aukward and unnatural. For, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his efforts of imitation, a travelled Engliſhman is as different from a Frenchman or an Italian, as an Engliſh maſtiff is from a monkey or a fox. And if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that ſedate and plain meaning dog ſhould pretend to the gay friſkineſs of the one, or to the ſubtilty of the other, we ſhould certainly value him much leſs than we do.</p>
                     <p>But I do not imagine that this extreme is by any means ſo common as the former. It is much more natural to the Engliſh character to deſpiſe foreigners than to imitate them. A few tawdry examples to the contrary, who return every winter from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, are hardly worth mentioning as exceptions.</p>

                     <p>When I ſpeak of the cheapneſs of a liberal education, I mean for the natives and citizens only; for ſtrangers now find every thing dear at Geneva.

Monteſquieu ſays, that a ſenſe of honour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſame effects in a monarchy, that public ſpirit or patriotiſm does in a republic. It muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, however, that the firſt, according to the modern acceptation of the word, is generally confined to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and gentry; whereas public ſpirit is a more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal principle, and ſpreads through all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>As far as I can judge, a ſpirit of independency and freedom, tempered by ſentiments of decency, and the love of order, influence, in a moſt remarkable manner, the minds of the ſubjects of this happy republic.</p>
                     <p>Before I knew them I had formed an opinion, that the people of this place were fanatical, gloomy mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031692_0044_0FEF2933D65A2718"/>
and unſociable as the Puritans in England, and the Preſbyterians in Scotland were, during the civil wars, and the reigns of Charles II. and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In this however, I find I had conceived a very erroneous notion.</p>
                     <p>There is not, I may venture to aſſert, a city in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, where the minds of the people are leſs under the influence of ſuperſtition or fanatical enthuſiaſm than at Geneva. Servetus, were he now alive, would not run the ſmalleſt riſk of perſecution. The preſent clergy have, I am perſuaded, as little the inclination as the power of moleſting any perſon of ſpeculative o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. Should the Pope himſelf chuſe this city for a retreat, it would be his own fault if he did not live in as much ſecurity as at the Vatican.</p>
                     <p>The clergy of Geneva in general, are men of ſenſe, learning, and moderation, impreſſing upon the minds of their hearers the tenets of Chriſtianity, with all the graces of pulpit eloquence, and illuſtrating the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the doctrine by their conduct in life.</p>
                     <p>The people of every ſtation in this place, attend ſermons and the public worſhip with remarkable punctuality. The Sunday is honoured with the moſt reſpectful decorum during the hours of divine ſervice; but as ſoon as that is over, all the uſual amuſements commence.</p>
                     <p>The public walks are crouded by all degrees of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031692_0045_0FEF29355D49CD80"/>
people in their beſt dreſſes. The different ſocieties, and what they call circles, aſſemble in the houſes and gardens of individuals. They play at cards and at bowls, and have parties upon the lake with muſic.</p>
                     <p>There is one cuſtom univerſal here, and, as far as I know, peculiar to this place. The parents form ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties for their children, at a very early period of their lives. Theſe ſocieties conſiſt of ten, a dozen or more children of the ſame ſex, and nearly of the ſame age and ſituation in life. They aſſemble once a week in the houſes of the different parents, who entertain the company by turns with tea, coffee, biſcuits, and fruit, and then leave the young aſſembly to the freedom of their own converſation.</p>
                     <p>This connection is ſtrictly kept up through life, whatever alterations may take place in the ſituations or circumſtances of the individuals. And although they ſhould afterwards form new or preferable intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, they never entirely abandon this ſociety; but to the lateſt period of their lives continue to paſs a few e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings every year with the companions of their youth and their earlieſt friends.</p>
                     <p>The richer claſs of the citizens have country houſes adjacent to the town, where they paſs one half of the year. Theſe houſes are all very neat, and ſome of them are ſplendid. One piece of magnificence they poſſeſs in greater perfection than the moſt ſuperb villa of the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031692_0046_0FEF293C9298CDA0"/>
greateſt lord in any other part of the world can boaſt; I mean the proſpect which almoſt all of them command. The gardens and vineyards of the republic, the Pais de Naux, Geneva with its lake, innumerable country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeats, caſtles, and little towns around the lake; the vallies of Savoy, and the loftieſt mountains of the Alps, are all within one ſweep of the eye.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe whoſe fortunes or employments do not permit them to paſs the ſummer in the country, make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent parties of pleaſure upon the lake, and dine and ſpend the evening at ſome of the villages in the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, where they amuſe themſelves with muſic and dancing.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they form themſelves into circles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of forty or fifty perſons, and purchaſe or hire a houſe and garden near the town, where they aſſemble every afternoon during the ſummer, drink coffee, lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onade, and other refreſhing liquors, and amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with cards, converſation, and playing at bowls, a game very different from that which goes by the ſame name in England; for here, inſtead of a ſmooth level green, they often chuſe the rougheſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal piece of ground. The player, inſtead of rolling the bowl, throws it in ſuch a manner, that it reſts in the place where it firſt touches the ground; and if that be a fortunate ſituation, the next player pitches his bowl directly on his adverſary's, ſo as to make that

                     <p>I RETURNED to Geneva, a few days ſince, from a journey to the Glaciers of Savoy, the Pais de Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais, and other places among the Alps.</p>
                     <p>The wonderful accounts I had heard of the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers had excited my curioſity a good deal, while the air of ſuperiority aſſumed by ſome who had made this boaſted tour, piquid my pride ſtill more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="unknown:031692_0048_0FEF29480E4EB840"/>
One could hardly mention any thing curious or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, without being told by ſome of thoſe travellers, with an air of cool contempt—"Dear Sir—that is pretty well; but take my word for it, it is nothing to the Glaciers of Savoy."</p>
                     <p>I determined at laſt not to take their word for it, and I found ſome gentlemen of the ſame way of thinking.</p>
                     <p>We left Geneva early in the morning of the 3d of Auguſt, and breakfaſted at Bonneville, a ſmall town in the duchy of Savoy, ſituated at the foot of Mole, and on the banks of the river Arve.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed the night at Sallenche, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of our journey not admitting of chaiſes, they were ſent back to Geneva, with orders to the drivers to go round by the other ſide of the lake, and meet us at the village of Martigny, in the Pais de Vallais.</p>
                     <p>We agreed with a muleteer at Sallenche, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided mules to carry us over the mountains to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigny. It is a good day's journey from Sallenche to Chamouni, not on account of the diſtance, but from the difficulty and perplexity of the road, and the ſteep aſcents and deſcents with which one is teazed alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whole way.</p>
                     <p>Some of the mountains are covered with pine, oak, beech, and walnut-trees. Theſe are interſperſed with apple, plumb, cherry, and other fruit-trees, ſo that we rode a great part of the morning in ſhade.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="unknown:031692_0049_0FEE0C71D24B1EE8"/>
Beſides the refreſhing coolneſs which this occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was moſt agreeable to me on another account. The road was in ſome places ſo exceedingly ſteep, that I never doubted but ſome of us were to fall; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reflected with ſatisfaction, that thoſe trees would probably arreſt our courſe, and hinder us from rolling a great way.</p>
                     <p>But many pathleſs craggy mountains remained to be traverſed, after we had loſt the protection of the trees. We then had nothing but the ſagacity of our mules to truſt to. For my own part, I was very ſoon convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was much ſafer, on all dubious occaſions, to depend on their's than on my own. For as often as I was preſented with a choice of difficulties, and the mule and I were of different opinions, if, becoming more obſtinate than he, I inſiſted on his taking my track, I never failed to repent it, and often was obliged to return to the place where the controverſy had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and follow the path to which he had pointed at firſt.</p>
                     <p>It is entertaining to obſerve the prudence of theſe animals in making their way down ſuch dangerous rocks. They ſometimes put their heads over the edge of the precipice, and examine with anxious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, every poſſible way by which they can deſcend, and at length are ſure to fix on that, which upon the whole is the beſt. Having obſerved this in
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031692_0050_0FEE0D1D1206A3A8"/>
ſeveral inſtances, I laid the bridle on the neck of my mule, and allowed him to take his own way, without preſuming to controul him in the ſmalleſt degree.</p>
                     <p>This is doubtleſs the beſt method, and what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to all my friends in their journey through life, when they have mules for their companions.</p>
                     <p>We began pretty early next morning to aſcend Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanvert, from the top of which there is eaſy acceſs to the Glaciers of that name, and to the valley of ice.</p>
                     <p>Having aſcended Montanvert from Chamouni, on deſcending a little on the other ſide, we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on a plain, whoſe appearance has been aptly compared to that which a ſtormy ſea would have, if it were ſuddenly arreſted, and fixed by a ſtrong froſt. This is called the Valley of Ice. It ſtretches ſeveral leagues behind Montanvert, and is reckoned 2300 feet higher than the valley of Chamouni.</p>
                     <p>From the higheſt part of Montanvert, we had all the following objects under our eye, ſome of which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obſtruct the view of others equally intereſting;—the Valley of Ice, the Needles, Mont Blanc, with the ſnowy mountains below, finely contraſted with Breven, and the green hills on the oppoſite ſide of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouni, and the ſun in full ſplendor ſhowing all of them to the greateſt advantage. The whole forms a ſcene equally ſublime and beautiful, far from my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of deſcription, and worthy of the eloquence of that
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031692_0051_0FEE0D1E9C479020"/>
very ingenious gentleman, who has ſo finely illuſtrated theſe ſubjects, in a particilar treatiſe, and given ſo many examples of both in his parliamentary ſpeeches.</p>
                     <p>The Valley of Ice is ſeveral leagues in length, and not above a quarter of a league in breadth. It divides into branches, which run behind the chain of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains formerly taken notice of. It appears like a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen amphitheatre, and is bounded by mountains, in whoſe clefts columns of cryſtal, as we are informed, are to be found.</p>
                     <p>The hoary majeſty of Mont Blanc—I was in danger of riſing into poetry, when recollecting the ſtory of Icarus, I thought it beſt not to truſt to my own waxen wings. I beg leave rather to borrow the following lines, which will pleaſe better than any flight of mine, and prevent me from a fall.</p>

                     </lg>
                     <p>There are five or ſix different Glaciers, which all terminate upon one ſide of the Valley of Chamouni, within the ſpace of about five leagues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:031692_0052_0FEE0D2028B0DAD8"/>
Theſe are prodigious collections of ſnow and ice, formed in the intervals of hollows between the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that bound the ſide of the Valley, near which Mont Blanc ſtands.</p>
                     <p>The ſnow in thoſe hollows being ſcreened from the influence of the ſun, the heat of ſummer can diſſolve only a certain portion of it. Theſe magazines of ice and ſnow are not formed by what falls directly from the heavens into the intervals. They are ſupplied by the ſnow which falls during winter on the loftieſt parts of Mont Blanc; large beds of ſtrata of which ſlide down imperceptibly by their own gravity, and finding no reſiſtance at theſe intervals, they form long irregular roots around all the adjacent mountains.</p>
                     <p>Five of theſe enter, by five different embouchures, into the valley of Chamouni, and are called Glaciers, on one of which we were. At preſent their ſurface is from a thouſand, or two thouſand feet high above the valley.</p>
                     <p>Their breadth depends on the wideneſs of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val between the mountains in which they are formed. Viewed from the valley, they have, in my opinion, a much finer effect than from their ſummit.</p>
                     <p>The rays of the ſun ſtriking with various force on the different parts, according as they are more or leſs expoſed, occaſion an unequal diſſolution of the ice; and, with the help of a little imagination, give the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031692_0053_0FEE0D2743131430"/>
of columns, arches, and turrets, which are in ſome places tranſparent.</p>
                     <p>A fabric of ice in this taſte, two thouſand feet high, and three times as broad, with the ſun ſhining full upon it, we muſt acknowledge to be a very ſingular piece of architecture.</p>
                     <p>Our company aſcended only the Glacier of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanvert, which is not the higheſt, and were contented with a view of the others from the valley; but more curious travellers will ſurely think it worth their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to examine each of them more particularly.</p>
                     <p>Some people are ſo fond of Glaciers, that not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with their preſent ſize, they inſiſt poſitively, that they muſt neceſſarily grow larger every year, and they argue the matter thus:</p>
                     <p>The preſent exiſtence of the Glaciers, is a ſufficient proof, that there has, at ſome period or other, been a greater quantity of ſnow formed during the winter, than the heat of the ſummer has been able to diſſolve. But this diſproportion muſt neceſſarily increaſe every year, and, by conſequence, the Glaciers muſt augment: becauſe, any given quantity of ſnow and ice remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the courſe of one ſummer, muſt increaſe the cold of the atmoſphere around it in ſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> degree; which being reinforced by the ſnow of the ſucceeding winter, will reſiſt the diſſolving power of the ſun more
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031692_0054_0FEE0D28CE505A38"/>
the ſecond ſummer than the firſt, and ſtill more the third than the ſecond, and ſo on.</p>
                     <p>The concluſion of this reaſoning is, that the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers muſt grow larger by an increaſing ratio every year, till the end of time. For this reaſon, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this theory regret, that they themſelves have been ſent into the world ſo ſoon; becauſe if their birth had been delayed for nine or ten thouſand years, they ſhould have ſeen the Glaciers in much greater glory, Mont Blanc being but a Lilliputian at preſent, in compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iſon of what it will be then.</p>
                     <p>However rational this may appear, objections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ave nevertheleſs been ſuggeſted, which I am ſorry for; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when a theory is tolerably conſiſtent, well fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and goodly to behold, nothing can be more vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious, than to ſee a plodding officious fellow over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole ſtructure at once, by a daſh of his pen, as Harlequin does a houſe with a touch of his ſword, in a pantomine entertainment.</p>
                     <p>Such cavillers ſay, that as the Glaciers augment in ſize, there muſt be a greater extent of ſurface for the ſun-beams to act upon, and, by conſequence, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution will be greater, which muſt effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the continual increaſe contended for.</p>
                     <p>But the other party extricate themſelves from this difficulty by roundly aſſerting, that the additional cold, occaſioned by the ſnow and ice already depoſited, has
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031692_0055_0FEE0D2E03218F38"/>
a much greater influence in retarding their diſſolution, than the increaſed ſurface can have in haſtening it; and, in confirmation of their ſyſtem, they tell you, that the oldeſt inhabitants of Chamouni remember the Glaciers when they were much ſmaller than at preſent; and alſo remember the time, when they could walk from the Valley of Ice, to places behind the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, by paſſages which are now quite choaked up with hills of ſnow, not above fifty years old.</p>
                     <p>Whether the inhabitants of Chamouni aſſert this from a laudable partiality to the Glaciers, which they may now conſider (on account of their drawing ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to viſit the Valley) as their beſt neighbours; or from politeneſs to the ſupporters of the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned opinion; or from real obſervation, I ſhall not preſume to ſay. But I myſelf have heard ſeveral of the old people of Chamouni aſſert the fact.</p>
                     <p>The cavillers, being thus obliged to relinquiſh their former objection, attempt in the next place to ſhow, that the above theory leads to an abſurdity; becauſe, ſay they, if their Glaciers go on increaſing the bulk <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> the globe itſelf would become, in proceſs of time, a mere appendage to Mont Blanc.</p>
                     <p>The advocates for the continual augmentation of the Glaciers reply, that as this inconveniency has not already happened, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>needs no other refutation of the impious doctrine of certain philoſophers, who aſſert
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031692_0056_0FEE0D2F8E55E048"/>
that the world has exiſted from eternity; and as to the globe's becoming an appendage to the mountain, they aſſure us, that the world will be at an end long before that event can happen; ſo that thoſe of the moſt timid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and moſt delicate conſtitutions, may diſmiſs their fears on that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>For my own part, though I wiſh well to the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers, and all the inhabitants of Chamouni, having paſſed ſome days very pleaſantly in their company, I will take no part in this controverſy.</p>

I have had frequent opportunities of converſing with him, and ſtill more with thoſe who have lived in intimacy with him for many years; ſo that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks are founded, either on my own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or on that of the moſt candid and intelligent of his acquaintance.</p>
                     <p>He has enemies and admirers here, as he has every where elſe; and not unfrequently both united in the ſame perſon.</p>

In as far as this implies exceſſive leanneſs, it is juſt; but it muſt be remembered, that this ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, this mere compoſition of ſkin and bone, has a look of more ſpirit and vivacity than is generally produced by fleſh and blood, however blooming and youthful.</p>
                     <p>The moſt piercing eyes I ever beheld are thoſe of Voltaire, now in his eightieth year. His whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is expreſſive of genius, obſervation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>In the morning he has a look of anxiety and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but this gradually wears off, and after dinner he ſeems cheerful. An air of irony, however, never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely forſakes his face, but may always be obſerved lurking in his features, whether he frowns or ſmiles.</p>
                     <p>When the weather is favourable, he takes an airing in his coach, with his niece, or with ſome of his gueſts,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031692_0058_0FEE0D3891139500"/>
of whom there is always a ſufficient number at Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Sometimes he ſaunters in his garden; or if the weather does not permit him to go abroad, he employs his leiſure hours in playing at cheſs with Pere Adam, or in receiving the viſits of ſtrangers, a continual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of whom attend at Ferney, to catch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing him; or in dictating and reading let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for he ſtill retains correſpondents in all the countries of Europe, who inform him of every remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occurrence, and ſend him every new literary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction as ſoon as it appears.</p>
                     <p>By far the greateſt part of his time is ſpent in his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and whether he reads himſelf, or liſtens to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he always has a pen in his hand, to take notes, or make remarks.</p>
                     <p>Compoſition is his principal amuſement. No au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who writes for daily bread, no young poet, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for diſtinction, is more aſſiduous with his pen, or more anxious for freſh fame, than the wealthy and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Seigneur of Ferney.</p>
                     <p>He lives in a very hoſpitable manner, and takes care always to keep a good cook. He has generally two or three viſitors from Paris, who ſtay with him a month or ſix weeks at a time. When they go, their places are ſoon ſupplied; ſo that there is a conſtant rotation of ſociety at Ferney. Theſe, with Voltaire's own family, and his viſitors from Geneva, compoſe a
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031692_0059_0FEE0D3A1C5DCF70"/>
company of twelve or fourteen people, who dine daily at his table, whether he appears or not. For, when engaged in preparing ſome new production for the preſs, indiſpoſed, or in bad ſpirits, he does not dine with the company; but ſatisfies himſelf with ſeeing them for a few minutes, either before or after dinner.</p>
                     <p>All who bring recommendations from his friends, may depend upon being received if he be not really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed. He often preſents himſelf to the ſtrangers, who aſſemble almoſt every afternoon in his anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, although they bring no particular recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. But ſometimes they are obliged to retire, without having their curioſity gratified.</p>
                     <p>As often as this happens, he is ſure of being accuſed of peeviſhneſs; and a thouſand ill-natured ſtories are related, perhaps, invented, out of revenge, becauſe he is not in the humour of being exhibited like a danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bear on a holiday. It is much leſs ſurpriſing that he ſometimes refuſes, than that he ſhould comply ſo often. In him, this compliance muſt proceed ſolely from a deſire to oblige; for Voltaire has been ſo long accuſtomed to admiration, that the ſtare of a few ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers cannot be ſuppoſed to afford him much pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>His niece, Madame Denis, does the honours of the table, and entertains the company, when her uncle is not able, or does not chuſe to appear. She is a well-diſpoſed woman, who behaves with good humour to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031692_0060_0FEE0D3BA84B6630"/>
every body, and with unremitting attention and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to her uncle.</p>
                     <p>The morning is not a proper time to viſit Voltaire. He cannot bear to have his hours of ſtudy interrupted. This alone is ſufficient to put him out of humour; beſides, he is then apt to be querulous, whether he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers by the infirmities of age, or from ſome acccidental cauſe of chagrin. Whatever be the reaſon, he is leſs an optimiſt at that part of the day than at any other. It was in the morning probably that he remarked, "<note n="†" place="bottom">That it was a pity that the Peruvian bark is found in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica and fevers in our climates.</note> (que c'etoit domage que le quinquina ſe trouvoit en Amérique, et la fiévre en nos climats.")</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are invited to ſupper, have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſeeing him in the moſt advantageous point of view. He then exerts himſelf to entertain the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſeems as fond of ſaying, what are called good things, as ever. And when any lively remark, or bon mot, comes from another, he is equally delighted, and pays the fulleſt tribute of applauſe. The ſpirit of mirth gains upon him by indulgence. When ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by his friends, and animated by the preſence of women, he ſeems to enjoy life with all the ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of youth. His genius then ſurmounts the reſtraints of age and infirmity, and flows along in a fine ſtrain of pleaſing, ſpirited obſervation, and delicate irony.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="unknown:031692_0061_0FEE0D41D37C24D8"/>
He has an excellent talent of adapting his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his company. The firſt time the D—of H—waited on him, he turned the diſcourſe on the ancient alliance between the French and Scotch nations. Reciting the circumſtance of one of his Grace's predeceſſors having accompanied Mary Queen of Scots, whoſe heir he at that time was, to the court of France, he ſpoke of the heroic characters of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, the ancient Earls of Douglas, of the great liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary reputation of ſome of his countrymen then living; and mentioned the names of Hume and Robertſon in terms of high approbation.</p>
                     <p>A ſhort time afterwards he was viſited by two Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian noblemen, who are now at Geneva. Voltaire talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them a great deal of their Empreſs, and the flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing ſtate of their country. Formerly, ſaid he, your countrymen were guided by ignorant prieſts, the arts were unknown, and your lands lay waſte; but now the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts flouriſh, and the lands are cultivated. One of the young men replied, that there was ſtill a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of barren land in Ruſſia. At leaſt, ſaid Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, you muſt admit, that of late your country has been "very fertile in laurels."</p>
                     <p>Voltaire has great merit as a dramatic writer; and it is much to be wiſhed, that this extraordinary man had confined his genius to its native home, to the walks which the muſes love, and where he has always been
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031692_0062_0FEE0D4720A41440"/>
received with diſtinguiſhed honour, and that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deviated from theſe, into the thorny paths of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. For, while he attacked the tyrants and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors of mankind, and thoſe who have perverted the benevolent nature of Chriſtianity to the moſt ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and malignant purpoſes, it is for ever to be regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he allowed the ſhafts of his ridicule to glance upon the Chriſtian religion itſelf.</p>
                     <p>By perſevering in this, he has not only ſhocked the pious, but even diſguſted infidels, who accuſe him of borrowing from himſelf, and repeating the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in various publications; and ſeem as tired of the ſtale ſneer againſt the Chriſtian doctrines, as of the dulleſt and moſt tedious ſermons in ſupport of them.</p>

                     <p>I ARRIVED here on the 22d day of July 1776, and find great pleaſure in breathing the air of liberty. Every perſon here has apparently the mein of content
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031692_0063_0FEE0D48AC225700"/>
and ſatisfaction. The cleanlineſs of the houſes, and of the people, is peculiarly ſtriking; and I can trace in all their manners, behaviour and dreſs, ſome ſtrong outlines which diſtinguiſh this happy people from the neighbouring nations. Perhaps it may be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and unreaſonable partiality; but I am more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe their firſt appearance very much reminds me of my own countrymen, and I could almoſt think, for a moment, that I am in England.</p>
                     <p>Schaffhauſen is a neat and tolerably well-built town, ſituated upon the nothern ſhore of the Rhine. It is the capital of the canton of the ſame name, and ows its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to the interruption of the navigation of that river by the cataract at Lauffen. Huts were at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed here for the convenience of unloading the merchandize from the boats; and theſe huts by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, increaſed to a large town. Schaffhauſen was formerly an imperial city, and was governed by a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ariſtocracy. It preſerved liberties, which were attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Dukes of Auſtria, by entering into an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with ſeveral other imperial towns, and with the Swiſs cantons. In 1501, it was admitted a member of the Helvetic confederacy, being the twelfth canton in rank. Of all the cantons it is the leaſt in ſize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only five leagues in length, and three in breadth. Its population is ſuppoſed to amount to 30,000 ſouls; of which the capital contains about 6000.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:031692_0064_0FEE0D4A38EA4060"/>
The whole number of citizens or burgeſſes (in whom the ſupreme power ultimatey reſides) is, I am informed, about ſix hundred. They are divided into twelve tribes; and from theſe are elected eighty-five members, who form the ſovereign council, conſiſting of a great and little council. To theſe two councils combined, the adminiſtration of affairs is committed; the ſenate, or little council of twenty-five, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the executive power; and the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, compriſing the ſenate, finally deciding all appeals and regulating the more important concerns of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>The revenues of the ſtate ariſe partly from the tythes, and other articles of the like nature; but principally from the duties laid upon the merchandiſe which paſſes from Germany; and I am informed, that theſe cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are nearly ſufficient to defray all the public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. Theſe, indeed, are not very conſiderable, as will appear from the ſalary of the burgo-maſter, or chief of the republic, which barely amounts to an hundred and fifty pounds per annum. The reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was introduced here in 1529. The clergy are paid by the ſtate, but their income is literally not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for their maintenance; the beſt living being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about an hundred pounds, and the worſt only forty pounds per annum. The profeſſors of literature alſo, who are taken from the clergy, are paid likewiſe by
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031692_0065_0FEE0D52353A4438"/>
government; and a public ſchool is ſupported at the expence of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Sumptuary laws are in force here, as well as in moſt parts of Swiſſerland; and no dancing is allowed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon particular occaſions. Silk, lace, and ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al other articles of luxury are prohibited. Even the ladies head-dreſſes are regulated. How would ſuch Gothic ordinances be received in England? They would ſerve at leaſt to lower the price of feathers.</p>
                     <p>But what is of ſtill greater importance, all games of hazard are ſtrictly prohibited; and in other games, the party who loſes above fix florins (about nine ſhillings of our money) incurs a conſiderable fine. An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent regulation! And I was informed, that theſe laws are not, like ours of the ſame kind, mere cyphers, but are well obſerved.</p>
                     <p>The principal article of exportation is wine, of which they make a large quantity, the country abounding in vineyards. And as the canton furniſhes but little corn, they procure it from Suabia, in exchange of their wine. In the town there are ſome, but not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, manufactures, of linen, cotton, and ſilk. Their commerce, however, is very flouriſhing.</p>
                     <p>Scaffhauſen, although a frontier town, has no gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; and the fortifications are but ſlight. Nothing can give a better idea of the ſecurity of the Swiſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons; the citizens mount guard by turns; and the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031692_0066_0FEE0D53C794AC80"/>
people of the canton being divided into regular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of militia, which are exerciſed yearly, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready and prepared to take up arms in defence of their country. This canton has ſome troops in the ſervice of France, Sardinia, and Holland; the only foreign ſervices into which the ſubjects of the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant cantons enliſt.</p>
                     <p>Before I take my leave of this city, I muſt not omit mentioning the famous bridge over the Rhine, juſtly admired for the beauty and ſingularity of its architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The river is extremely rapid, and had already deſtroyed ſeveral bridges of ſtone, built upon arches of the ſtrongeſt conſtruction; when a carpenter of Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel, undertook to throw a wooden one, of a ſingle arch, acroſs the river, which is near three thouſand feet wide. The magiſtrates, however, inſiſted, that it ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of two arches, and that he ſhould make uſe, for that purpoſe, of the middle pier of the old bridge, which remained entire. Accordingly, the architect was obliged to obey; but he has contrived it in ſuch a manner, that the bridge is not all ſupported by the middle pier; and it would certainly have been equally ſafe, and conſiderably more beautiful, had it conſiſted ſolely of one arch. But how ſhall I attempt to give an idea of it? I who am totally unſkilled in architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and who have not the leaſt knowledge of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031692_0067_0FEE0D5B1CBF6BB8"/>
I ſhall, however, venture the following deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hope its inaccuracy will be excuſed.</p>
                     <p>It is a wooden bridge, of which the ſides and top are covered, and the road over it is almoſt perfectly level. It is what the Germans call a haengewerk, or hanging bridge, the road not being carried, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, over the top of the arch; but, if I may uſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, is let down into the middle of it, and there ſuſpended. The middle pier is not abſolutely in a right line with the ſide ones that reſt upon the ſhore; as it forms with them a very obtuſe angle, pointing down the ſtream, being eight feet out of the linear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The diſtance of this middle pier from the ſhore that lies towards the town, is one hundred and ſeventy-one feet, and from the other ſide, one hundred and ninety-three: in all three hundred and ſixty four feet; making, in appearance, two arches of a ſuppriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing width, and forming the moſt beautiful perſpective imaginable, when viewed at ſome diſtance. A man of the ſlighteſt weight walking upon it, feels it tremble under him: yet waggons, heavily laden, paſs, over it without danger. And although, in the latter inſtance, the bridge ſeems almoſt to crack with the preſſure, it does not appear to have ſuffered the leaſt damage. It has been compared, and very juſtly, to a tight rope, which trembles when it is ſtruck, but ſtill preſerves its firm and equal tenſion. I went under this bridge,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031692_0068_0FEE0D5CA900AC70"/>
cloſe to the middle pier, in order to examine its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm; and though in no reſpect a mechanic, I could not help being ſtruck with the elegant ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the architecture. I was not capable of determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it reſts upon the middle pier, but moſt judges agree that it does not.</p>
                     <p>When one obſerves the greatneſs of the plan and the boldneſs of the conſtruction, one is aſtoniſhed that the architect was a common carpenter, without the leaſt tincture of literature, totally ignorant of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, and not at all verſed in the theory of mechanics. The name of this extraordinary man was Ulric Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benman, an obſcure drunken fellow of Tuffen, a ſmall village in the canton of Apenzel. Poſſeſſed of uncommon natural abilities, and a ſurpriſing turn for the practical part of mechanics, he raiſed himſelf to great eminence in his profeſſion, and may juſtly be conſidered as one of the moſt ingenious architects of the preſent century. This bridge was finiſhed in leſs than three years, and coſt 90,000 florins, or about 8000l. ſterling.</p>
                     <p>A few days ago, we ſet out on horſeback, in order to ſee the fall of the Rhine at Lauffen, about a league from this place. Our road lay over the hills which form the banks of the Rhine; from whence we had ſome fine views of the town and caſtle of Schaffhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. The environs are pictureſque and agreeable:
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031692_0069_0FEE0D5E332E43B0"/>
the river more beautifully winding through the vale. Upon our arrival at Lauffen, a ſmall village in the canton of Zuric, we diſmounted; and advancing to the edge of the precipice which overhangs the Rhine, we looked down perpendicularly upon the cataract, and ſaw the river tumbling over the ſides of the rock with amazing violence and precipitation. From hence we deſcended till we were ſomewhat below the upper bed of the river, and ſtood cloſe to the fall; ſo that I could almoſt have touched it with my hand. A ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold is erected in the very ſpray of this tremendous cataract, and upon the moſt ſublime point of view:—the ſea of foam tumbling down,—the continual cloud, of ſpray ſcattered around at a great diſtance, and to a conſiderable heighth,—in ſhort, the magnificence of the noble ſcenery far ſurpaſſed my moſt ſanguine expectations, and exceeds all deſcription. Within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred feet, as it appeared to be, of the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, there are two rocks in the middle of the fall, that prevent one from ſeeing its whole breadth from this point. The neareſt of theſe was perforated by the continual action, of the river; and the water forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf through in an oblique direction, with inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible fury, and an hollow ſound. After having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome time comtemplating in ſilent admiration the awful ſublimity of this wonderful landſcape, we deſcended: and below the fall we croſſed the river, which was exceedingly agitated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="unknown:031692_0070_0FEE0D6536C07AC0"/>
Hitherto I had only viewed the car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aract ſideways. But here it opened by degrees, and diſplayed another picture which I enjoyed at my leiſure, as I ſat myſelf down upon the oppoſite bank. The moſt ſtriking ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were on the ſide we came from; a caſtle, erected upon the very edge of the precipice, and projecting over the river; near it, a church and ſome cottages; on the ſide where I was ſitting, a chump of cottages cloſe to the fall; in the back ground, riſing hills, planted with vines, or tufted with hanging woods; a beautiful little hamlet upon the ſummit, ſkirted with trees; the great body of water, that ſeemed, as it were, to ruſh out from the bottom of theſe hills; the two rocks above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, boldly advancing their heads in the midſt of the fall, and in the very point of its ſteepeſt deſcent, their tops covered with ſhrubs, and dividing the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract into three principal branches. The colour of the Rhine is extremely beautiful, being of a clear ſea-green; and I could not but remark the fine effect of the tints, when blended with the white foam in its deſcent. There is a pleaſing view from an iron foundry cloſe to the river, which is dammed up, in order to prevent its carrying away the works and neighbouring cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. By means of this dam, a ſmall proportion of the river, in its fall, enters a trough, turns a mill, and forms a beautiful little ſilver current, gliding down the hare rock, and detached from the main cataract. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031692_0071_0FEE0D66C673C778"/>
the fall, the river widens conſiderably into a more ample baſon. At the fall, the breadth, as well as I could judge by my eye, ſeemed to be about 250 feet. As to its perpendicular height, travellers differ. Thoſe who are given to exaggeration reckon it an hundred feet high. But I ſhould imagine about fifty feet would be nearer the truth. I ſtood for ſome time upon the brink of the cataract; beheld in admiration, and liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened in ſilence; then croſſed the river, re-mounted my horſe, and returned to Schaffhauſen.</p>
                     <p>Some writers have aſſerted that the river precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates itſelf in one ſheet of water; and, as I before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, from a perpendicular heighth of an hundred feet. In former ages this account was probably agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to fact; as it is imagined, that the ſpace between the two banks were once a level rock, and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly higher; that the river has inſenſibly worn away, and undermined thoſe parts, on which it broke along with the utmoſt violence. For, within the memory of ſeveral of the inhabitants of this town, a large rock has given way, that has greatly altered the view In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am convinced that the perpendicular heighth of the fall becomes leſs and leſs every year, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual friction of ſo large and rapid a body of water; and have no doubt but that the two rocks, which now riſe in the midſt of the river, will in time, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and carried away. The river, for ſome way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the fall, even near the bridge, daſhes upon a rocky bottom, and renders the navigation impoſſible for any kind of veſſel. A few weeks ago a countryman of ours tried an experiment with a ſmall boat, which he contrived to have gently puſhed to the edge of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aract. It ſhot down entire to the bottom of the fall, was out of ſight for a few moments, and then roſe up, daſhed into a thouſand ſplinters.</p>

The convent is built upon the edge of the water, and commands from ſome of the apartments a very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proſpect. The library is by far the pleaſanteſt room, though not the moſt frequented. The cells of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031692_0073_0FEE0D706658F0B8"/>
of the monks are ſmall, and yet not inconvenient; but cleanlineſs does not ſeem to conſtitute any part of their moral or religious obſervances. Indeed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry habit of the order is ill calculated for that purpoſe, as they wear no ſhirt or ſtockings, and are clothed in a courſe kind of a brown drugget robe, which trails upon the ground. Strange idea of ſanctity! as if dirt could be acceptable to the Deity. I reflected with particular ſatisfaction, that I was not born a member of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic church; as perhaps the commands of a parent, a ſudden diſappointment, or a momentary fit of enthuſiaſm, might have ſent me to a convent of Capuchins, and have wedded me to dirt and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for life.</p>
                     <p>After dinner we took leave of our hoſts, and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Zuric by water. The lake of Zuric is near ten leagues in length, and one in breadth. The city ſtands upon a gentle eminence on the northern extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the lake; a beautiful ſituation, and advantageous for commerce. For by means of the river Limmat, which iſſues from the lake, and dividing the town, falls into the Aar, there is a communication with the Rhine. And this advantage has not been neglected; as the trade of the town is verey extenſive. The inhabitants are exceedingly induſtrious, and carry on with ſucceſs ſeveral different branches of manufacture; the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal is that of crape. Their chief traffic is with France, Ruſſia, Italy, and Holland.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:031692_0074_0FEE0D71F3313D68"/>
Since the reformation many perſons have flouriſhed here, eminent for their learning in all branches of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature: and there is no town in Swiſſerland, where letters are more encouraged, or where they are culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with greater ſucceſs. I waited this morning upon the celebrated Geſner, author of the Death of Abel, and ſeveral other performances, which for their delicate and elegant ſimplicity are juſtly eſteemed. They abound with thoſe nice touches of exquiſite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, which diſcover a mind warmed with the fineſt ſentiments; and love is repreſented in the chaſteſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring of innocence, virtue, and benevolence. Nor has he confined his ſubjects merely to the tender paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Paternal affection, and filial reverence; grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, humanity; in ſhort, every moral duty is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and inculcated in the moſt pleaſing and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. He has for ſometime renounced poetry in order to take up the pencil; and painting is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his favourite amuſement. A treatiſe which he has publiſhed on landſcape-painting, ſhows the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of his taſte, and the verſatility of his genius; while his compoſitions in both kinds prove the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the two arts; and that the conceptions of the poet and of the painter are congenial. I prefer his drawings in black and white to his paintings; for, although the ideas in both are equally beautiful or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, his colouring is inferior to his deſign. He is
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031692_0075_0FEE0D7550957FA8"/>
preparing an handſome edition of his writings in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in which every part of the work is carried on by himſelf. He prints them at his own private preſs, and is at once both the drawer and engraver of his plates. It is to be lamented that he has renounced poetry; for, while ordinary writers ſpring up in great plenty, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of real genius are rare and uncommon. His drawings are ſeen only by a few, and will ſcarcely be known to poſterity. But his writings are diſperſed abroad, tranſlated into every language, and will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by future ages, as long as there remains any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for true paſtoral ſimplicity, or any taſte for origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal compoſition. He is plain in his manners; open, affable, and obliging in his addreſs; and of ſingular modeſty. He has nothing of the poet in his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, except in his eye, which is full of ſenſe, fire, and expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>We waited alſo on Mr. Lavater, a clergyman of Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, and celebrated phyſiognomiſt, who has publiſhed a famous treatiſe on that fanciful ſubject. He expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf badly in French; but there was an agreeable warmth and vivacity in his countenance and manner, while he converſed upon his favourite ſubject. That particular paſſions have a certain effect upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar features, is evident to the moſt common obſerver; and it may be conceived, that an habitual indulgence of theſe paſſions may poſſibly, in ſome caſes, impreſs
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031692_0076_0FEE0D78AD7AB340"/>
a diſtinguiſhing mark on the countenance. But that a certain caſt of features conſtantly denotes certain paſſions; and that by contemplating the former, we can infallibly diſcover alſo the mental qualities of the owner, is an hypotheſis liable, I ſhould think, to ſo many exceptions, that no general and uniform ſyſtem could be juſtly formed upon it. Nevertheleſs Mr. Lavater, like a true enthuſiaſt, carries his theory much farther. For he not only pretends to diſcover the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and paſſions by the features, by the complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, by the form of the hand, and by the motion of the arms, but he alſo draws ſome inferences of the ſame kind even from one's hand-writing. And indeed his ſyſtem is formed upon ſuch univerſal principles, that he applies the ſame rules to all animated nature, extending them not only to brutes, but even to inſects. That the temper of a horſe may be diſcovered by his countenance, does not ſtrike one as any thing abſurd. But was it ever heard before that any quality could be inferred from the phyſiognomy of a Bee, or of an Ant? While I give my opinion thus freely concerning Mr. Lavater's notions, it will be readily perceived, that I am not one of thoſe, who are initiated into the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his art. Nor do I mean to cenſure indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately the ſyſtem of that celebrated writer. For, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the extravagance of ſome of his tenets, the ſevereſt critics allow, that there is a fund of good ſenſe and a variety of fine obſervations diſperſed
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031692_0077_0FEE0D7E05635178"/>
throughout his treatiſe; and that it is one of thoſe works, which, to be admired, needs only to be read with attention.</p>
                     <p>The clergy of Zuric are in general better paid than in the other Proteſtant cantons; and among that body there are ſome who are very decently provided for; a circumſtance rather uncommon in the Reformed or Preſbyterian churches.</p>
                     <p>Sumptuary laws, as well as thoſe againſt immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are here well obſerved. The former indeed may exiſt, and be carried into execution even among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple much corrupted; for it may be the policy of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment to enforce their obſervance. But the ſevereſt penalties will not be ſufficient to prevent crimes of an immoral tendency, amidſt a general diſſoluteneſs of manners. It is the popular principles that can alone invigorate ſuch laws, and give them their full opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Among the Romans, the laws againſt adultery were ſevere; and yet where was adultery more practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than at Rome? In Zuric it is rigorouſly puniſhed, without any diſtinction of rank, by fine, by expulſion from office, and by impriſonment. But the frequency of this crime is not ſo much reſtrained by the penalty annexed to it, as from the general good morals of the inhabitants. Secret crimes cannot be prevented; but it is an evident proof of public virtue, when open breaches of morality are diſcountenanced. Among their ſumptuary laws, the uſe of a carriage in the town
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031692_0078_0FEE0D7F90BCED68"/>
is prohibited to all ſorts of perſons except ſtrangers. And, it is almoſt inconceivable that, in a place ſo very commercial and wealthy, luxury ſhould ſo little prevail.</p>
                     <p>The bublic granary, on account of its admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, deſerves to be particularly mentioned. Corn is purchaſed by government, and given out to thoſe who chuſe to buy it at the common price; but in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſcarcity it is ſold conſiderably cheaper than it can be bought at the market. The uſe of this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared in the late dearth; when bread, from the dearneſs of corn, was ſold at ten pence the pound, gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment delivered the ſame quantity for four pence.</p>
                     <p>The arſenal is well ſupplied with cannon, arms, and amunition; and contains a reſerve of muſkets for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand men. We ſaw there, and admired, ſome of the two-handed ſwords and weighty armour of the old Swiſs warriors; as alſo the bow and arrow, with which William Tell is ſaid to have ſhot the apple off the head of his ſon.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XIV. EXPEDITION ACROSS THE VALLEY OF ICE, IN THE GLACIER OF MONTANVERT. A. D. 1776.</head>
                     <p>ON the 23d of Auguſt we went to ſee "<note n="*" place="bottom">Walls of Ice.</note> Les Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>railles de Glace," ſo called from their reſemblance to walls. They conſiſt of large ranges of ice, of prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thickneſs and ſolidity, riſing abruptly from their baſe, and parallel to each other. Some of theſe rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es appeard to us about an hundred and fifty feet high; but, if we may believe our guides, they are four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred feet above their real baſe. Near them were py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids and cones of ice of all forms and ſizes, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to a very conſiderable height, in the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and fantaſtic ſhapes imaginable. From this Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier, which we croſſed without much difficulty, we had a fine view of the value of Chamouni.</p>
                     <p>On the 24th, we propoſed ſallying forth very early, in order to go to the Valley of Ice, in the Glacier of Montanvert, and to penetrate as far as the time would admit; but the weather proving cloudy, and likely to rain, we deferred ſetting out till nine, when appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gave us the hope of its clearing up. Accordingly
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031692_0080_0FEE0D88F98CD960"/>
we procured three excellent guides, and aſcended on horſeback ſome part of the way over the mountain, which leads to the Glacier above-mentioned. We were then obliged to diſmount, and ſcrambled up the reſt of the mountains, (chiefly covered with pines) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long a ſteep and rugged path called "the road of the chryſtal-hunters." From the ſummit of Montanvert we deſcended a little to the edge of the Glacier, and made a refreſhing meal upon ſome cold proviſion which we brought with us. A large block of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, called "<note n="*" place="bottom">The Engliſh Stone.</note> La Pierre des Anglois," ſerved us for a table; and near us was a miſerable hovel, where thoſe who make expeditions towards Mont Blanc, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs the night. The ſcene around us was magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſublime; numberleſs rocks riſing boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the clouds, ſome of whoſe tops were bare, others covered with ſnow. Many of theſe, gradually dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing towards their ſummits, end in ſharp points; and from this circumſtance they are called the <hi>Needles.</hi> Between theſe rocks the Valley of Ice ſtretched ſeveral leagues in length, and is nearly a mile broad; extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one ſide towards Mont Blanc, and, on the other, towards the plain of Chamount.</p>
                     <p>After we had ſufficiently refreſhed ourſelves, we drepared for our adventure acroſs the ice. We had each of us a long pole ſpiked with iron; and, in order
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031692_0081_0FEE0D8A8AFCD9D8"/>
to ſecure us as much as poſſible from ſlipping, the guides faſtened to our ſhoes <hi>crampons,</hi> conſiſting of a ſmall bar of iron, to which are fixed four ſmall ſpikes of the ſame metal.</p>
                     <p>The difficulty of croſſing theſe valleys of ice, ariſes from the immenſe chaſms. They are produced by ſeveral cauſes; but more particularly by the continual melting of the interior ſurface. This frequently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a ſinking of the ice; and under ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the whole maſs is ſuddenly rent aſunder in that particular place with a moſt violent exploſion. We rolled down large ſtones into ſeveral of them, and the great length of time before they reached the bottom, gave us ſome conception of their depth. Our guides aſſured us, that in ſome places they are five hundred feet deep. I can no otherwiſe convey to you an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of this immenſe body of ice, conſiſting of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed irregular ridges and deep chaſms, than by reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it to a raging ſea, that had been inſtantaneouſly frozen in the midſt of a violent ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>We began our walk with great ſlowneſs and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but we gradually gained more courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as we advanced; and we ſoon found that we could ſafely paſs along thoſe parts, where the aſcent and deſcent were not very conſiderable, much faſter even than when walking at the rate of our common pace. In other parts we leaped over the clefts, and
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031692_0082_0FEE0D8C18EAE030"/>
ſlid down the ſteeper deſcents as well as we could. In one place where we deſcended, and ſtepped acroſs an opening upon a narrow ridge of ice ſcarcely three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches broad, we were obliged to tread with peculiar caution; for on each ſide were chaſms of a great depth. We walked ſome paces ſideways along this ridge; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ept acroſs the chaſm into a little hollow, which the guides made on purpoſe for our feet, and got up an aſcent, by means of ſmall holes, which we made with the ſpikes of our poles. All this ſounds terrible; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> at the time we had none of us the leaſt apprehenſions of danger, as the guides were exceedingly careful, and took excellent precautions. One of our ſervants had the courage to follow us without <hi>crampons,</hi> and with no nails to his ſhoes, which was certainly dangerous, on account of the ſlipperineſs of the leather when wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He got along, however, ſurpriſingly well: though in ſome places we were alarmed, leſt he ſhould ſlip up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the edge of one of thoſe chaſms; for had that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happened to any of us, we muſt inevitably have been loſt, having neglected to provide ourſelves with long ropes in caſe of ſuch an event. This man was probably the firſt perſon who ever ventured acroſs the Valley of Ice, without either <hi>crampons</hi> or nails to his ſhoes.</p>
                     <p>We were now almoſt arrived at the other extremity, when we were ſtopped by a chaſm ſo broad that there
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031692_0083_0FEE0D9317AA74D8"/>
was no poſſibility of paſſing it. We were obliged to make a circuit of above a quarter of a mile, in order to get round this vaſt opening. This will give you ſome idea of the difficulty attending excurſions over ſome of theſe Glaciers; and our guides informed us, that when they hunt the <hi>chamois</hi> and the <hi>marmottes</hi> in theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> regions, theſe unavoidable circuits generally carry them ſix or ſeven miles about, when they would have only two miles to go if they could proceed in a ſtraight line.</p>
                     <p>A ſtorm threatening us every moment, we were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to haſten off the Glacier as faſt as poſſible, for rain renders the ice exceedingly ſlippery; and in caſe of a fog (which generally accompaneis a ſtorm in theſe upper regions) our ſituation would have been extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous. And indeed we had no time to loſe; for the tempeſt began juſt as we had quitted the ice, and ſoon became very violent, attended with frequent flaſhes of lightning, and loud peals of thunder, which being re-echoed within the hollows of the mountains, added greatly to the awful ſublimity of the ſcene. We now deſcended a very ſteep precipice, and for ſome way were obliged to crawl upon our hands and feet down a bare rock; the ſtorm at the ſame time roaring over us, and rendering the rock extremely ſlippery. We were by this time quite wet through, but we got to the bottom, however, without much hurt. Upon
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031692_0084_0FEE0D94A40D7A18"/>
obſerving the immenſe extent of theſe Glaciers, I could not help remarking, (and it is a circumſtance which many other travellers have obſerved before) what a fund is here laid up for the ſupply of rivers, and that the ſources which give riſe to the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Po, will never fail. I returned at length to the inn, as dripping wet as if I had been plunged into water, but perfectly ſatisfied with my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
                     <p>I cannot conceive any ſubject in natural hiſtory more curious than the formation and progreſs of theſe Glaciers; running far into fields of corn and rich paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and lying, without being melted, in a ſituation where the ſun has power ſufficient to ripen the fruits of the field. It is literally true, that with one hand we could touch ice, and with the other ripe corn. But as this is a ſubject too important to be treated ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially, and requires much accurate obſervation, and repeated experimental inveſtigation, I ſhall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to enter into it. I beg leave nevertheleſs, to make one obſervation, which will ſerve to prove the occaſional increaſe and diminution of the Glaciers, contrary to the opinion of ſome philoſophers, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance that they remain always the ſame; and of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who aſſert that they are continually increaſing. I think I may venture to aſſert, that both theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are untenable; and it happens in this, as in many
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031692_0085_0FEE0D9631D4A338"/>
other ſubjects, that experience and truth are ſacrificed to the ſupporting of a favourite hypotheſis. Indeed the fact ſeems to be, that theſe Glaciers in ſome years, increaſe conſiderably in extent, while in others they recede; and of this I am perfectly convinced from the following circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>The borders of the Valley of Ice of the Glacier of Montanvert are moſtly ſkirted with trees. Towards its foot a vaſt arch of ice riſes to near an hundred feet in heighth; from under which, the continued drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings from the melting of the ice and ſnow are collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and form the Arveron, which ruſhes forth with conſiderable force, and in a large body of water. As we approached the extremity of this arch, we paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a wood of firs. Thoſe which ſtand at a little diſtance from the ice are about eighty feet high, and are undoubtedly of a very great age. Between theſe and the Glacier, the trees are of a later growth, as is evident as well from their inferior ſize, as from their texture and ſhape. Others, which reſemble the latter, have been overturned and enveloped in the ice. In all theſe ſeveral trees, reſpectively ſituated in the ſpots I have mentioned, there ſeems to be a kind of regular gradation in their age, from the largeſt ſize to thoſe that lie proſtrate.</p>
                     <p>Theſe facts fairly lead, it ſhould ſeem, to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluſions;—that the Glacier once extended as
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031692_0086_0FEE0D9D65E6CA10"/>
far as the row of tall firs; that, upon its retiring, a number of trees have ſhot up in the very ſpots, which it formerly occupied; that within ſome years the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier has again begun to advance, and in its progreſs has overturned the trees of later date, before they have had time to grow up to any conſiderable heighth.</p>
                     <p>To theſe circumſtances, another fact may be added, which appears to me convincing. There are large ſtones of granite, which are found only at a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the extremities of the Glacier. Theſe are vaſt fragments, which have certainly fallen down from the mountains upon the ice, have been carried on by the Glacier in its increaſe, and have tumbled into the plain, upon the melting or ſinking of the ice which ſupported them.</p>

                     <p>I WAS very much ſtruck upon my entrance into Berne, with its ſingular neatneſs and beauty. I do not remember to have ſeen any town (Bath alone except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) the firſt appearance whereof had ſo pleaſing an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031692_0087_0FEE0D9EF1F91B28"/>
The principal ſtreet is broad and long; the houſes are moſtly uniform, built of a greyiſh ſtone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on arcades, which are admirably well paved. Through the middle of the ſtreet runs a lively ſtream of the cleareſt water, in a channel conſtructed for its recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But beſides this ſtream, it abounds with foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, not leſs ornamental to the place than beneficial to the inhabitants. The river Aar flows cloſe by the town, and indeed almoſt ſurrounds it, winding its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine courſe over a rocky bottom, much below the level of the ſtreets; and for a conſiderable way form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by its banks, which are ſteep and craggy, a kind of natural rampart. The cathedral church is a noble piece of Gothic architecture. It ſtands upon a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that has been raiſed at a great expence from the bed of the river, and which commands as fine a view as any I have ſeen in Swiſſerland.</p>
                     <p>The country around is richly cultivated, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diverſified with hills, lawns, wood, and water; the river flows rapidly below, and an abrupt chain of high and rugged Alps appears at ſome diſtance, the tops whereof are covered with eternal ſnow. Such an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage of beautiful objects would, in any view, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a moſt ſtriking proſpect; but its effect becomes greatly heightened when ſeen from the midſt of a large town.</p>
                     <p>All the public buildings are in a moſt noble ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031692_0088_0FED37898AEFF8F8"/>
of ſtyle, and announce the riches and grandeur of the republic. The arſenal contains arms for ſixty thouſand men, beſides a conſiderable quantity of cannon which were caſt here. The granary is an excellent inſtitution, ſimilar to that of Zuric; but it differs from that of Geneva, as the expence does not fall chiefly upon the poor: for the bakers are not compelled by government to purchaſe their corn from the public magazine.</p>
                     <p>The hoſpitals, which are large, airy, and well bulit, are excellently regulated, both with reſpect to the care and attention paid to the ſick, and to the cleanlineſs of the ſeveral wards. The town is kept neat by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of felons, who are ſentenced to this drudgery dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain time, according to the nature of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and as capital condemnations are very rare, this is the moſt uſual manner of puniſhing their cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals. Theſe culprits are diſtinguiſhed by an iron collar, with a hook projecting over their heards.</p>
                     <p>The library is a ſmall, but well choſen collection, and contains ſome very curious manuſcripts. Of theſe, Mr. Sinner, a man of great erudition, has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a very ſatisfactory and judicious catalogue. He has not only ſet forth their titles, and aſcertained their age, but has alſo given a general and ſuccinct account of their reſpective ſubjects; and from many of them has publiſhed extracts equally curious and intereſting.

Among theſe manuſcripts are ſome of the thirteenth century, conſiſting of ſeveral ſongs and romances of the Troubadours, written in that and the preceding ages, which merit the attention of thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in that ſpecies of ancient poetry.</p>
                     <p>I have been much diſappointed in not ſeeing the great Haller. His very infirm ſtate of health would not admit of his receiving a viſit from us. I need not mention how eminently that celebrated author has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed himſelf in every ſpecies of polite literature, and in ſeveral branches of natural philoſophy. Unlike certain minute philoſophers of the preſent age, whoſe atheiſtical and infidel writings are too well known, and too widely diſſemminated, this great man is ſo unfaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable as to have followed the ſteps of a Locke and a Newton; and to have proved himſelf, both in his life and his writings, a zealous friend and able advocate of Chriſtianity. When literature and philoſophy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being employed, as they too often have been, in ſupporting ſceptical tenets by artful ſophiſtry, thus lend their joint aſſiſtance to the cauſe of religion, it is then only that they become an honour to the poſſeſſor, and a benefit to ſociety.</p>
                     <p>Learning is neither ſo univerſally encouraged, nor ſo ſucceſsfully cultivated here as at Zuric. The acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical ſtudies are almoſt ſolely directed to thoſe branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of knowledge more eſſentially neceſſary for entering
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031692_0090_0FEE0DA917F2BCC0"/>
into the church. The ſociety for the promotion of agriculture, is almoſt the only eſtabliſhment which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tends to the progreſs of the arts and ſciences; and even this meets with no great countenance from government. There is but little trade in the capital. Some few manufactures indeed (chiefly of linen and ſilk) have been eſtabliſhed; but they are carried on by thoſe only who have no proſpect of being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ſovereign council. For thoſe famalies, who have any influence on public affairs, would hold themſelves degraded were they to engage in any branch of commerce; and as offices of the ſtate, except bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liages, are in general not very profitable, nor indeed, numerous, many of them enter, as their ſole reſource, into sovereign armies. With reſpect to thoſe among them who have ſufficient intereſt to be choſen into the ſovereign council, they muſt have attained the full age of twenty-nine before they are eligible. In the mean while, as very few of them apply their minds to literary purſuits, they uſually, from mere want of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, waſte the interval in an idle and diſſipated courſe of life. Nevertheleſs, there are ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſovereign council, who are juſtly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their political abilities; and, being thoroughly acquainted with the reſpective intereſts of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent powers of Europe, they know perfectly well how to avail themſelves of every conjuncture, which may
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031692_0091_0FEE0DAE5B1B0E70"/>
be turned to the advantage or the glory of their own republic.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of Berne value themſelves much upon their politeneſs to ſtrangers. And indeed, it is but doing them ſtrict juſtice to acknowledge, that they have ſhown us (with that peculiar frankneſs and unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected affability I have ſo often had occaſion to admire in the Swiſs) every civility in their power.</p>

But this, as one may perceive, that in proportion, bread is much dearer than the other articles, and the reaſon is obvious; for all theſe mountainous parts conſiſt almoſt entirely of paſturages, and produce little corn. The peaſants of Swiſſerland (I mean thoſe who inhabit the mountainous diſtricts) live chiefly upon milk, and what reſults from it, together with potatoes, which are here much cultivated. According to the price of proviſions in England, the above liſt will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear exceedingly cheap; but then it ought, at the ſame time, to be conſidered, that money is very ſcarce in theſe parts. Nor indeed is it ſo much neceſſary in a country, where there is no luxury; where all the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry have, within themſelves, more than ſufficient for their own conſumption; and are tolerably well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with every neceſſary of life from their own little demeſnes. I had a long converſation with one of the lads, who came with us from Altdorf, and takes care of the horſes. He lives upon the mountains of Uri; and, as their winter laſts near eight months of the year, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome part of which time there can be little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the ſeveral cottages, every fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is of courſe obliged to lay in their proviſion for the whole winter. His own, it ſeems, conſiſts of ſeven perſons, and is provided with the following ſtores;—Seven cheeſes, each weighing twenty-five pounds; an hundred and eight pounds of hard bread, twenty-five
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031692_0093_0FEE0DB34B973D48"/>
baſkets of potatoes, each weighing about forty pounds; ſeven goats, and three cows, one of which they kill. The cows and horſes (if they keep any) are fed with hay, and the goats with the boughs of firs; which in a ſcarcity of hay, they give alſo to their other cattle. During this dreary ſeaſon the family are employed in making linen, ſhirts, &amp;c. ſufficient for their own uſe: and, for this purpoſe, a ſmall patch of the little piece of ground belonging to every cottage, is generally ſown with flax. The cultivation of the latter has been much attended to and with increaſing ſucceſs, in theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous parts of Swiſſerland.</p>
                     <p>The houſes are generally built of wood; and it was a natural remark of one of our ſervants, as we paſſed through ſuch a continued chain of rocks, that as there was ſtone enough to build all the cottages in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it was wonderful they ſhould uſe nothing but wood for that purpoſe; a remark that has been made by many travellers. But it ſhould ſeem, that theſe wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en houſes are much ſooner conſtructed, and are eaſily repaired; that they are built in ſo ſolid and compact a manner (the rooms ſmall, and the ceilings low) as to be ſufficiently warm even for ſo cold a climate. The chief objection to them ariſes from the danger of fire; as the flames muſt rage with great rapidity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate eaſily from one to the other. This incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience however, is in a great meaſure obviated by
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031692_0094_0FEE0DB886032770"/>
the method of building their cottages apart; all their villages conſiſting of detached and ſcattered hamlets. But this obſervation does not hold with reſpect to ſome of their largeſt burghs; and theſe muſt conſequently be expoſed to the ravages of this moſt dreadful of all calamities.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XVII. GENERAL REFLECTIONS UPON THE THIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEEN SWISS CANTONS. A. D. 1776.</head>
                     <p>THERE is no part of Europe which contains, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame extent of region, ſo many independent commonwealths, and ſuch a variety of different gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, as are collected together in this remarkable and delightful country; and yet, with ſuch wiſdom was the Helvetic union compoſed, that ſo little have the Swiſs, of late years, been actuated with the ſpirit of conqueſt, that ſince the firm and complete eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their general confederacy, they have ſcarcely ever had occaſion to employ their arms againſt a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign enemy; and have had no hoſtile commotions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, which were not very ſoon happily terminated. Perhaps there is not a ſimilar inſtance in ancient or modern hiſtory, of a warlike people, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031692_0095_0FEE0DBA12AC9FD8"/>
into little independent republics, cloſely border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon each other, and of courſe having occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interfering intereſts, having continued, during ſo long a period, in an almoſt uninterrupted ſtate of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. And thus, while the ſeveral neighbouring kingdoms have ſuffered, by turns, all the horrors of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal war, this favoured nation hath enjoyed the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city deſcribed by Lucretius, and looked down with ſecurity upon the various tempeſts, which have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the world around them.</p>
                     <p>But the happineſs of a long peace, has neither bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſpirit, not enervated the arm of this people. The youth are diligently trained to all the martial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, ſuch as running, wreſtling, and ſhooting both with the croſs-bow and the muſket; a conſiderable number of well diſciplined Swiſs troops are always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in foreign ſervices; and the whole people are enrolled, and regularly exerciſed in their reſpective militia. By theſe means they are capable, in caſe it ſhould be neceſſary, of collecting a very reſpectable body of forces, which could not fail of proving formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to any enemy, who ſhould invade their country, or attack their liberties. Thus, while moſt of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtates upon the continent are tending more and more towards a military government, Swiſſerland alone has no ſtanding armies; and yet; from the nature of its ſituation, from its particular alliances, and from the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031692_0096_0FEE0DBD6C8A7B28"/>
policy of its internal government, is more ſecure from invaſion than any other European power, and full as able to withſtand the greateſt force that can be brought againſt it.</p>
                     <p>But the felicity of Swiſſerland does not conſiſt mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in being peculiarly exempted from the burdens and miſeries of war; there is no country in which happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and content more univerſally prevail among the people. For, whether the government be ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, democratical, or mixed; abſolute or limited; a general ſpirit of liberty pervades and actuates the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral conſtitutions; ſo that even the eligarchical ſtates (which, of all others, are uſually the moſt tyrannical) are here peculiarly mild; and the property of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is ſecurely guarded againſt every kind of viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But there is one general defect in their criminal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence, which prevails throughout this country. For although the Caroline code, as it is ſtyled, or the code of the Emperor Charles V. forms in each of the republics, the principal baſis of their penal laws, with particular modifications and additions in different diſtricts, yet much too great a latitude is allowed to the reſpective judges, who are leſs governed in their determinations by this code, or any other written law, than by the common principles of juſtice. How far long experience may have juſtified the prudence of truſting them with this extraordinary privilege, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:031692_0097_0FEE0DC44CF3B068"/>
ſay; but diſcretionary powers, of this kind are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly liable to the moſt alarming abuſe, and can never, without the greateſt hazard, be committed to the hands of the magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>I cannot forbear reflecting, upon this occaſion, on the ſuperior wiſdom, in the preſent inſtance, as well as in many others, of our own moſt invaluable conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and indeed, it is impoſſible for an Engliſhman to obſerve, in his travels, the governments of other countries, without becoming a warmer or more affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate admirer of his own. In England, the life and liberty of the ſubject does not depend upon the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diciſion of his judge, but is ſecured by expreſs laws, from which no magiſtrate can depart with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This guarded preciſion, it is true, may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, perhaps, be attended with ſome inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; but they are over-balanced by advantages of ſo much greater weight, as to be ſcarcely perceptible in the ſcales of juſtice. I do not mean, however, to throw any imputation upon the officers of criminal juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Swiſſerland. As far as I could obſerve, they adminiſter diſtributive juſtice with an impartial and equitable hand.</p>
                     <p>One cannot but be aſtoniſhed, as well as concerned, to find, that, in a country where the true principles of civil government are ſo well underſtood, and ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally adopted as in Swiſſerland, the trial by torture is
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031692_0098_0FED378CA75E2FA0"/>
yet aboliſhed. For in ſome particular caſes, the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected criminal is ſtill put to the rack. The ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no leſs than the inhumanity, of endeavouring to extort the truth by the ſeveral horrid inſtruments, which too ingenious cruelty have deviſed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, has been ſo often expoſed by the ableſt writers, that it would be equally impertinent and ſuperfluous to trouble the world with any reflections of mine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject. And indeed, the whole ſtrength of the ſeveral arguments, which have been urged upon this occaſion, is compriſed in the very juſt and pointed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the admirable Bruyere, that "<note n="*" place="bottom">The torture is a wonderful invention, and very certain of deſtroying an innocent perſon, who has a delicate conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and of ſaying a guilty one, to whom nature has been more kind.</note> la queſtion eſt une invention marveilleuſe et tout-a-fait ſure, pour perdre un innocent qui a la complexion foible, et ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver un coupable qui eſt ne robuſte." I cannot howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver but add, in juſtice to the Swiſs, that zealous advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates have not been wanting among them for the total abolition of torture. But arguments of reaſon, and ſentiments of humanity, have been found, even in this civilized and enlightened country, to avail little againſt inveterate cuſtom and long confirmed preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="unknown:031692_0099_0FEE0DC5D79454C8"/>
Criminal juſtice is in Swiſſerland, as in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Europe, adminiſtered agreeable to the rules of the civil law. According to the maxims of that code, the criminal's confeſſion is abſolutely requiſite, in order to his ſuffering capital puniſhment; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, all thoſe nations, who have not eſtabliſhed a new code of criminal juriſprudence, retain the uſe of torture.</p>
                     <p>The preſent king of Pruſſia, it is well known, ſet the example in Germany, of aboliſhing this inhuman practice, but few, perhaps, are appriſed, that the firſt hint of this reformation was ſuggeſted to him by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hiſtory of England. For, one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal arguments in ſupport of this method of extorting confeſſion, being, that it affords the beſt means of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering plots againſt government, the ſagacious mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch remarked, that the Britiſh annals fully confute the fallacy of that reaſoning. Few kingdoms, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, had abounded more in conſpiracies and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions than England; and yet that the leaders and abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of them had been more ſucceſsfully traced and diſcovered, without the uſe of torture, than in any country where it was practiſed. "From thence," ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this wiſe politician, ſpeaking upon the ſubject, "I ſaw the abſurdity of torture, and aboliſhed it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly."</p>
                     <p>The above anecdote, which I had from very reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031692_0100_0FEE0F15335FA068"/>
authority, bears the moſt honourable teſtimony to the efficacy as well as the mildneſs of our penal laws, and to the ſuperior excellency of the proceſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in our courts of criminal juſtice.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to agriculture; there is, perhaps, no country in the world where the advantageous effects of unwearied and perſevering induſtry are more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſpicuous. In travelling over the mountainous parts of Swiſſerland, I was ſtruck with admiration and aſtoniſhment, to obſerve rocks, that were formerly bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, now planted with vines, or abounding in rich paſture; to mark the traces of the plough, along the ſide of the precipices, ſo ſteep, that it muſt be with great difficulty, that a horſe could even mount them. In a word, the inhabitants ſeem to have ſurmounted every obſtruction which ſoil, ſituation, and climate, had thrown in their way, and to have ſpread fertility over various ſpots of the country, which nature ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have conſigned to everlaſting barrenneſs. In fine, a general ſimplicity of manners, an open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected frankneſs, together with an invincible ſpirit of freedom, may juſtly be mentioned in the number of thoſe peculiar qualities, which dignify the public character of the people, and diſtinguiſh them with honour among the nations of Europe.</p>
                     <p>Learning is leſs generally diffuſed among the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic than the proteſtant ſtates. But in both, a man of
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031692_0101_0FEE0DCB0826BF08"/>
letters will find abundant opportunities of gratifying his reſearches and improving his knowledge. To the natural philoſopher, Swiſſerland will afford an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible ſource of entertainment and information, as well from the great variety of phyſical curioſities, ſo plentifully ſpread over the country, as from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of perſons eminently ſkilled in that branch of ſcience. Indeed in every town, and almoſt in every village, the curious traveller will meet with collections worthy of his attention.</p>

for an ordinary is ſtill retained in France, though the landlord does not ſit at the table, which was the caſe formerly in that country, and ſtill is the cuſtom in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</p>
                     <p>There are no private lodgings to be had here as in London. Strangers, therefore, retain apartments at the inn during the whole time of their reſidence in any of the towns. And travellers of every denomination in this country, under the rank of ſovereign princeſs, make no ſcruple of eating occaſionally at the table d'Hôte of the inn where they lodge, which cuſtom is univerſally followed by ſtrangers from every country on the continent of Europe.</p>
                     <p>Many of our countrymen, however, who deſpiſe oeconomy, and hate the company of ſtrangers, prefer eating in their own apartments to the table d'Hôte, or any private table to which they may be invited.</p>
                     <p>It would be arrogance in any body to diſpute the right which every free born Engliſhman has to follow his own inclination in this particular. Yet when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wiſh to avoid the company of ſtrangers, it ſtrikes me, that they might indulge their fancy as completely at home as abroad; and while they continue in that humour, I cannot help thinking that they might ſave themſelves the inconveniency and expence of travelling.</p>
                     <p>The manners and genius of nations, it is true, are not to be learnt at inns; nor is the moſt ſelect compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031692_0103_0FEE0DCE1D357290"/>
to be found at public ordinaries; yet a perſon of obſervation, and who is fond of the ſtudy of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will ſometimes find inſtruction and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at both. He there ſees the inhabitants of the country on a leſs ceremonious footing than he can elſewhere, and hears the remarks of travellers of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery degree.</p>
                     <p>The firſt care of a traveller certainly ſhould be, to form an acquaintance and ſome degree of intimacy with the principal people in every place where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to reſide;—to accept invitations to their family parties, and attend their ſocieties;—to entertain them at his apartments, when that can be conveniently done, and endeavour to acquire a juſt notion of their gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, cuſtoms, ſentiments, and manner of living.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are fond of the ſtudy of man, which, with all due deference to the philoſophers who prefer that of beaſts, birds and butterflies, is alſo a pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amuſement, will mix occaſionally with all degrees of people, and when not otherwiſe engaged, will not ſcruple to take a ſeat at the table d'Hôte. It is ſaid, that low people are ſometimes to be found at theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries. This, to be ſure is a weighty objection; but then it ſhould be remembered, that it is within the bounds of poſſibility that men, even engaged in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, may have liberal minds, and may be able to give as diſtinct accounts of what is worthy of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031692_0104_0FEE0DD5DF66ECD8"/>
as if they had been as idle as people of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faſhion through the whole of their lives. A man muſt have a very turgid idea of his own grandeur, if he cannot ſubmit, in a foreign country, to dine at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a perſon of inferior rank, eſpecially as he will meet, at the ſame time, with others as equal, or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior rank to himſelf. For all etiquette of this nature is waved, even in Germany at the tables d'Hôtes.</p>
                     <p>A knowledge of the characters of men, as they appear varied in different ſituations and countries; the ſtudy of humun nature, indeed, in all its forms and modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is highly intereſting to the mind, and worthy the attention of the greateſt man. This is not to be perfectly attained in courts and palaces. The inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator of nature muſt viſit her in humbler life, and put himſelf on a level with the men whom he wiſhes to know.</p>
                     <p>It is generally found, that thoſe who poſſeſs real great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, never heſitate to overleap the obſtacles, and deſpiſe the forms, which may ſtand in the way of their acquiring this uſeful knowledge.</p>
                     <p>The moſt powerful of all arguments againſt entirely declining to appear at the public table of the inn, is, that in this country it is cuſtomary for the ladies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when on a journey, to eat there; and my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality for the table, d'Hôte may poſſibly be owing in ſome degree to my having met at one of them, with
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031692_0105_0FEE0DD76BB433B0"/>
two of the handſomeſt women that I have ſeen ſince I have been in this country, which abounds in female beauty.</p>
                     <p>There is more expreſſion in the countenances of French women; but the ladies in Germany have the advantage in the fairneſs of their ſkin and the bloom of their complexion. They have a greater reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to Engliſh women than to French; yet they differ conſiderably from them both. I do not know how to give an idea of the various ſhades of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which, if I miſtake not, I can diſtinguiſh in the features of the ſex in theſe three countries.</p>
                     <p>A handſome French woman, beſides the eaſe of her manner, has commonly a look of cheerfulneſs and great vivacity. She appears willing to be acquainted with you, and ſeems to expect that you ſhould addreſs her.</p>
                     <p>The manner of an Engliſh woman is not ſo devoid of reſtraint; and a ſtranger, eſpecially if he be a foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, may obſerve a look which borders on diſdain in her countenance. Even among the lovelieſt features, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a ſulky air often appears.</p>
                     <p>A German beauty, without the ſmart air of the one or the reſerve of the other, has generally a more placid look than either.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XIX. OF THE QUEEN OF DENMARK. A. D. 1775.</head>
                     <p>THE D—of H—having determined to pay his reſpects to the Queen of Denmark before he left Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, choſe to make his viſit while the Hereditary princeſs was with her ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>I accompanied him to Zell, and next day waited on the Count and Counteſs Dean, to let them know of the D—'s arrival, and to be informed when we could have the honour of being preſented to the Queen. They both belong to the princeſs of Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick's family, and while I was at breakfaſt with them, her royal highneſs entered the room, and gave me the information I wanted.</p>
                     <p>Before dinner I returned with the duke to the caſtle, where we remained till late in the evening. There was a concert of muſic between dinner and ſupper, and the queen ſeemed in better ſpirits than could have been expected.</p>
                     <p>Zell is a ſmall town, without trade or manufactures; the houſes are old, and of a mean appearance, yet the high courts of appeal for all the territories of the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral Houſe of Brunſwick Lunenburg are held here.
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031692_0107_0FEE0DDEAB655060"/>
The inhabitants derive their principal means of ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from this circumſtance.</p>
                     <p>This town was ſeverely harraſſed by the French army at the beginning of the late war, and was afterwards pillaged, in revenge for the ſuppoſed infraction of the treaty of Cloſter-Seven. The Duke de Richlieu had his head quarters here, when Duke Ferdinand re aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the troops who had been diſarmed and diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediately after that convention.</p>
                     <p>The caſtle is a ſtately building, ſurrounded by a moat, and ſtrongly fortified. It was formerly the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Dukes of Zell, and was lately repaired by order of the King of Great Britain, for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his unfortunate ſiſter. The apartments are ſpacious and convenient, and now handſomely furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>The officers of the court, the Queen's maids of honor, and other attendants, have a very genteel appearance; and retain the moſt reſpectful attachment to their ill-fated miſtreſs. The few days we remained at Zell were ſpent entirely at court, where every thing ſeemed to be arranged in the ſtyle of the other ſmall German courts, and nothing wanting to render the Queen's ſituation as comfortable as circumſtances would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; but by far her greateſt conſolation is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and converſation of her ſiſter. Some degree of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction appears in her countenance, while the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031692_0108_0FEE0DE4F3550D60"/>
remains at Zell; but the moment ſhe goes away, the Queen, as we were informed, becomes a prey to dejection and deſpondency. The Princeſs exerts her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to prevent this, and devotes to her ſiſter all the time ſhe can ſpare from the duties ſhe ows to her own family. Unlike thoſe who take the firſt pretext of breaking connections which can no longer be of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, this humane Princeſs has diſplayed even more attachment to her ſiſter ſince her misfortunes, than ſhe ever did while the Queen was in the meridian of her proſperity.</p>
                     <p>The youth, the agreeable countenance, and obliging manners of the Queen, have conciliated the minds of every one in this country. Though ſhe was in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, and appeared cheerful, yet, convinced that her gaiety was aſſumed, and the effect of a ſtrong ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I felt an impreſſion of melancholy, which it was not in my power to overcome all the time we remained at Zell.</p>
                     <p>On the evening of our arrival at Hanover, we had the pleaſure of hearing Handel's Meſſiah performed. Some of the beſt company of this place were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on the occaſion, and we were here made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with old Field-Marſhal Sporken, and other people of diſtinction. Hanover is a neat, thriving, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable city. It has more the appearance of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh town than any other I have ſeen in Germany;
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031692_0109_0FEE0DE682212E68"/>
and the Engliſh manners and cuſtoms gain ground ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery day among the inhabitants. The genial influence of freedom has extended from England to this place. Tyranny is not felt, and eaſe and ſatisfaction appear in the countenances of the citizens.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XX. ON THE PALACE AT POTSDAM, AND THE KING OF PRUSSIA. A. D. 1775.</head>
                     <p>THE palace at Potſdam, or what they call the caſtle, is a very noble building, with magnificent gardens ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent. I ſhall not particularly deſcribe either; only it ſtruck me as a thing rather uncommon in a palace, to find the ſtudy by far the fineſt apartment in it. The ornaments of this are of maſſy ſilver. The writing-deſk, the embeliſhments of the table, and the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the books, were all in fine taſte.</p>
                     <p>The perſon who attended us, aſked if we had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee his Majeſty's wardrobe? On being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the affirmative, he conducted us to the chamber where the monarch's clothes are depoſited. The whole wardrobe conſiſted of two blue coats faced with red, the lining of one a little torn;—two yellowiſh waiſt;
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031692_0110_0FEE0DE80D568148"/>
coats, a good deal ſoiled with Spaniſh Snuff;—three pair of yellow breeches, and a ſuit of blue velvet, embroidered with ſilver, for grand occaſions.</p>
                     <p>I imagined at firſt, that the man had got a few of the King's old clothes, and kept them here to amuſe ſtrangers. But, upon enquiry, I was aſſured, that what I have mentioned, with two ſuits of uniform which he has at Sans-Souci, from the entire wardrobe of the King of Pruſſia. Our attendant ſaid he had never known it more complete. As for the velvet ſuit, it was about ten years of age, and ſtill enjoyed all the vigour of youth. Indeed, if the moths ſpared it as much as his Majeſty has done, it may laſt the age of Methuſalem.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame room are ſome ſtandards belonging to the cavalry. Inſtead of the uſual ſquare flag, two or three of theſe have the figures of eagles in carved ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, fixed on a pole.</p>
                     <p>In the bed-chamber where the late King died, at the lower part of the window which looks into the garden, four p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>anes have been removed, and a piece of glaſs, equal in ſize to all the four, ſupplies their place. We were informed that his late Majeſty's ſupreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light through life had been to ſee his troops exerciſe, and that he had retained this paſſion till his late breath. When he was confined to his room by his laſt illneſs, he uſed to ſit and view them through the window,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031692_0111_0FEE0DEDA9758680"/>
which had been framed in this manner, that he might enjoy theſe dying contemplations with the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency. Becoming gradually weaker by the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtemper, he could not ſit, but was obliged to lie on a couch through the day. When at any time he was uncommonly languid, they raiſed his head to the window, and a ſight of the men under arms was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to operate like a cordial, and revive his ſpirits. By frequent repetition, however, even this cordial loſt its effect. His eyes became dim; when his head was raiſed, he could no longer perceive the ſoldiers, and he expired.</p>
                     <p>This was feeling the ruling paſſion as ſtrong in death as any man ever felt it.</p>
                     <p>When we arrived at Potſdam, there was nothing I was ſo eager to ſee, as the Pruſſian troops at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; but the frequent reviews have completely ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated my curioſity. And though the gardens of the palace are juſt oppoſite to the windows of our inn, I hardly ever go to look at the guards, who parade there every morning. A few days ago, however, I happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take a very early walk about a mile out of town, and ſeeing ſome ſoldiers under arms, in a field at a ſmall diſtance from the road, I went towards them. An offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer on horſeback, whom I took to be the Major, for he gave the word of command, was uncommonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and often rode among the ranks to reprimand, or
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031692_0112_0FEE0DF2D5D04638"/>
inſtruct the common men. When I came nearer, I was much ſurpriſed to find that this was the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He had his ſword drawn and continued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the corps for an hour after. He made them wheel, march, form the ſquare, and fire by diviſions, and in platoons, obſerving all their motions with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite attention; and, on account of ſome plunder, put two officers of the Prince of Pruſſia's regiment under arreſt. In ſhort, he ſeemed to exert himſelf with all the ſpirit of a young officer, eager to attract the notice of his General by uncommon alertneſs.</p>
                     <p>I expreſſed my ſurpriſe to an officer preſent, that the King was not willing to take ſome repoſe, particularly from that kind of employment of which he had had ſo very much of late, and that he could take ſo much pains with a mere handful of men, immediately after he had come from exerciſing whole armies.</p>
                     <p>This gentleman told me, that on this particular day the King had been trying ſome new evolutions; but though this had not been the caſe, he might very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been in the field:—for his maxim was, that his troops ſhould diſplay as much briſkneſs on a common field day, as if they were to engage in battle; and therefore it was never known when he intended to be preſent, or when not;—that as for repoſe, he took it between ten at night and four in the morning, and his other hours were all devoted to action, either of body
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031692_0113_0FEE0DF460A80BE0"/>
or mind, or both; and that the exerciſe he had juſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, was probably by way of relaxation, after three hours previous labour in his cabinet.</p>
                     <p>The more I ſee and hear of this extraordinary man, the more am I aſtoniſhed. He reconciles qualities which I uſed to think incompatible. I once was of opinion, that the mind, which ſtoops to very ſmall objects is incapable of embracing great ones. I am now convinced that he is an exception; for while few objects are too great for his genius, none ſeem too ſmall for his attention.</p>
                     <p>I once thought that a man of much vivacity was not capable of entering into the detail of buſineſs, I now ſee that he, who is certainly a man of wit, can continue methodically the neceſſary routine of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with the patience and perſeverance of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>We have lately ſeen the Italians perform; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the plays, nor the operas, nor any part of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, intereſt me half ſo much, or could draw me ſo aſſiduouſly to Sans-Souci, as the opportunity this attendance gives of ſeeing the King. Other monarchs acquire importance from their ſtation; this Prince gives importance to his. The traveller in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries has a wiſh to ſee the King, becauſe he admires the kingdom:—here the object of curioſity is reverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031692_0114_0FEE0DF5ECC45F78"/>
—And let us ſuppoſe the palaces, and the towns, and the country, and the army of Pruſſia ever ſo fine, yet our chief intereſt in them will ariſe from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Frederick the Second; the man who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ally but Britain, repelled the united force of Auſtria, France, Ruſſia, and Sweden.</p>
                     <p>Count Neſſelrode, talking with me on this ſubject, had an expreſſion equally lively and juſt:—"<note n="*" place="bottom">It is in adverſity that he ſhines; the more he is oppreſſed the more irreſiſtible he becomes.</note> C'eſt dans l'adverſité qu'il brille, lorſqu'il eſt bien comprimé il a un reſſort irréſiſtible."</p>
                     <p>The evening of the day on which I had ſeen the King in the field, I was at Sans-Souci; for I wiſh to neglect no opportunity of being preſent where this monarch is. I like to ſtand near him, to hear him ſpeak, and to obſerve his movements, attitudes, and moſt indifferent actions. He always behaves with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affability to the D—of H—. One evening, before the play began, his Grace and I were ſtanding accidentally with Count Finkenſtein, in a room adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the great apartment where the company were. The King entered alone, when he was not expected, and immediately began a converſation with the D—.</p>
                     <p>He aſked ſeveral queſtions relating to the Britiſh conſtitution; particularly at what age a Peer could
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:031692_0115_0FEE0DFCEAD72DA8"/>
take his ſeat in parliament? When the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "At twenty-one." It is evident from that, ſaid the King, that the Engliſh patricians acquire the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary talents for legiſlation much ſooner than thoſe of ancient Rome, who were not admitted into the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate till the age of forty.</p>
                     <p>He then enquired about the ſtate of Lord Chatham's health, and expreſſed high eſteem for the character of that miniſter. He aſked me if I had received letters by the laſt poſt, and if they mentioned any thing of the affairs in America? He ſaid there were accounts from Holland, that the Engliſh troops had been driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from Boſton, and that the Americans were in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that place. I told him our letters informed us, that the army had left Boſton to make an attack with more effect elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>He ſmiled, and ſaid,—If you will not allow the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to have been an affair of neceſſity, you will at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leaſt admit, that it was "<note n="*" place="bottom">Quite apropos.</note> tout-á-fait á-propos."</p>
                     <p>He ſaid he heard that ſome Britiſh officers had gone into the American ſervice, and mentioned Colonel Lee, whom he had ſeen at his court. He obſerved, that it was a difficult thing to govern-men by force at ſuch a diſtance; that if the Americans ſhould be beat (which appeared a little problematical), ſtill it would
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031692_0116_0FEE0DFE753621A0"/>
be next to impoſſible to continue to draw from them a revenue by taxation;—that if we intended concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with America, ſome of our meaſures were too rough; and if we intended its ſubjection, they were too gentle. He concluded by ſaying. "<note n="*" place="bottom">In ſhort, Gentlemen, I do not underſtand theſe matters, I have no colonies, I hope you will extricate yourſelves well out of trouble, but it appears to me a little difficult.</note> Enfin, Meſſieurs, je ne comprends pas ces choſes lá; je n'ai point de co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie; j'eſpère que vous vous tirerez bien d'affaire, mais elle me paròit un peu épineuſe." Having ſaid this, he walked into the Princeſs's apartment, to lead her to the play-houſe, while we joined the company already aſſembled there. The tragedy of Mahomet was performed, which, in my opinion, is the fineſt of all Voltaire's dramatic pieces, and that in which Le Kain appears to the greateſt advantage.</p>
                     <p>As moſt people are deſirous to be made acquainted with every thing which regards the King of Pruſſia, I am perhaps, in danger of lengthening my deſcriptions with a tedious minuteneſs. I do not, however, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to draw a complete portrait of this monarch. That muſt be the work of much abler painters, who have ſeen him in a more familiar, manner and whoſe colours can give an expreſſion worthy of the original. I ſhall only attempt to give a faithful ſketch of ſuch features as I was able to ſeize during the tranſient views I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031692_0117_0FEE0E000429C3F0"/>
had, or which I have learnt from thoſe who have paſſed with him many of the hours, which he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to free converſation and the pleaſures of the table.</p>
                     <p>The King of Pruſſia is below the middle ſize, well made, and remarkably active for his time of life. He has become hardy by exerciſe and a laborious life; for his conſtitution originally ſeems to have been none of the ſtrongeſt. His look anounces ſpirit and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He has fine blew eyes; and, in my opinion, his countenance upon the whole is agreeable. Some who have ſeen him are of a different opinion. All who judge from his portraits only, muſt be ſo; for although I have ſeen many, which have a little reſemblance of him, and ſome which have a great deal, yet none of them do him juſtice. His features acquire a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful degree of animation, while he converſes. This is entirely loſt upon canvas.</p>
                     <p>He ſtoops conſiderably, and enclines his head almoſt conſtantly on one ſide.</p>
                     <p>His tone of voice is the cleareſt, and moſt agreeable in converſation I ever heard.</p>
                     <p>He ſpeaks a great deal, yet thoſe who hear him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that he does not ſpeak a great deal more. His ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are always lively, very often juſt, and few men poſſeſs the talent of repartee in greater perfection.</p>
                     <p>He hardly ever varies his dreſs, which conſiſts of a blue coat, lined and faced with red, and a yellow
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031692_0118_0FEE0E0711311B98"/>
waiſtcoat and breeches. He always wears boots, while huſſar tops, which fall in wrinkles about his ancles, and are oftener of a dark brown than a black colour.</p>
                     <p>His hat would be thought extravagantly large in England, though it is of the ſize commonly uſed by the Pruſſian officers of cavalry. He generally wears one of the large ſide corners over his forehead and eyes, and the front cock at one ſide.</p>
                     <p>He wears his hair cued behind, and dreſſed with a ſingle buckle on each ſide. From their being very careleſsly put up and unequalled powdered, we may naturally conclude, that the friſeur has been greatly hurried in the execution of his office.</p>
                     <p>He uſes a very large gold ſnuff-box, the lid orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with diamonds, and takes an immoderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Spaniſh ſnuff, the marks of which very often appear on his waiſtcoat and breeches. Theſe are alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>able to be ſoiled by the paws of two or three Italian grey hounds, which he often careſſes.</p>
                     <p>He dreſſes as ſoon as he gets up in the morning. This takes up but a few minutes, and ſerves for the whole day. It has often been ſaid, that the King of Pruſſia's hours, from four or five in the morning till ten at night, are all dedicated methodically to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occupations, either of buſineſs or amuſement. This is certainly true; and the arrangement has not ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031692_0119_0FEE0E089BE96E78"/>
ſuch an interruption for many years, as ſince the preſent company came to Potſdam.</p>
                     <p>Some, who pretend to more than common pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, aſſert, that at preſent they can perceive marks of uneaſineſs in his countenance, and ſeem convinced, that there will not be ſuch another company at Sanſ-Souci during his reign.</p>
                     <p>All buſineſs with the King is tranſacted by letters. Every petition or propoſal muſt be made in this form, which is adhered to ſo invariably, as I have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that if any of his Generals wiſhed to promote a cadet to the rank of an enſign, he would not venture to make his propoſal in any other manner, even though he had daily opportunities of converſing with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                     <p>The meaneſt of his ſubjects may apply to him in writing, and are ſure of an anſwer. His firſt buſineſs every morning is the peruſing the papers addreſſed to him. A ſingle word written with his pencil on the margin, indicates the anſwer to be given, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made out in form by his ſecretaries. This method affords the King time to deliberate on the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice and propriety of every demand, and prevents the poſſibility of his being ſurpriſed into a promiſe, which it might be inconvenient to perform.</p>
                     <p>He ſits down to dinner preciſely at noon. Of ſafe he allows more time to his repaſt than formerly. It is
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031692_0120_0FEE0E0A290D3B48"/>
generally after three before he leaves the company. Eight or nine of his officers are commonly invited to dine with him. Since our coming to Potſdam, Count Neſſelrode, and the Abbé Baſtiani, two men of letters, were the only company beſides the officers, who dined with the King, while he lived in his uſual way at the Old Palace of Sans-Souci; and theſe two were then of his party almoſt every day. The Count has now left this Court; the Abbé has an apartment in the Palace. He is an Italian by birth, a man of wit, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent companion.</p>
                     <p>At table, the King likes that every perſon ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be on a footing, and that the converſation ſhould be carried on with perfect freedom. The thing, by the way, is impoſſible. That confidential unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained flow of the heart, which takes place in a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of equals, is a pleaſure, which a deſpotic Prince can never taſte. However, his Majeſty deſires that it may be ſo, and they make the beſt of it they can.</p>
                     <p>At one of theſe meetings, when the King was in a gay humour, he ſaid to Baſtiani,—When you ſhould obtain the tiara, which your exemplary piety muſt one day procure you, how will you receive me when I arrive at Rome to pay my duty to your Holineſs?—I will immediately give orders, replied the Abbé, with
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031692_0121_0FEE0E113B8486C8"/>
great readineſs, "<note n="†" place="bottom">That the black Eagle be admitted—that he may cover me with his wings, but—ſpare me from his talons.</note> Qu'on faſſe entrer l'aigle noir,—qu'il me couvre de ſes ailes, mais—qu'il m'épargne de ſon bec."</p>
                     <p>Nobody ſays more lively things in converſation than the King himſelf. Many of his bon mots are repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. I ſhall only mention one, which is at once an inſtance of his wit, and greatneſs of mind in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering juſtice to the merit of a man, who has cauſed him more vexation than perhaps any other perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. When the King of Pruſſia had a perſonal meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome years ſince with the Emperor, they always dined together, a certain number of their principal officers being with them. One day General Laudohn was going to place himſelf at the bottom of the table, when the King, who was at the head, called to him, "<note n="‖" place="bottom">Come, I intreat you, Monſ. Laudohn, ſet here—I had much rather have you on my ſide than oppoſed to me.</note> Venez, je vous en prie, Monſieur Landhon, placez vous ici. J' aime infiniment mieux vous avoir de mon cotè que vis-à-vie."</p>
                     <p>Though all the cordiality of friendſhip, and the full charms of unreſerved ſociety, cannot exiſt, where the fortune of every other individual depends on the will of one of the company; yet the King endeavours to put every one as much at his eaſe as the nature of the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031692_0122_0FEE0E12CB328808"/>
will admit, and I have heard of his bearing ſome very ſevere retorts with perfect good humour. He has too much wit himſelf, and is too fond of it in others, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel its attacks with any other weapons than thoſe which it furniſhes. None but the moſt abſurd of dunces could attempt to ralley, without being able to allow of raillery; and only the meaneſt of ſouls would think of revenging the liberties taken with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the power of a King.</p>
                     <p>A very ſtriking inſtance of the freedom which may be uſed with him occured a little before the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, and what makes it more remarkable, it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not during the gaiety of the table, but on the very ſcene of military ſtrictneſs.</p>
                     <p>Two regiments were in the field. That of General—was one of them. This officer is fond of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and paſſes more of his time in the ſociety of ſtrangers, and with the foreign miniſters, than moſt others in the Pruſſian ſervice. Something, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had chagrined the King that morning. While the regiment advanced in a line, he ſaid to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who ſtood near him, "<note n="‡" place="bottom">Your regiment is not in a line Sir—and it is not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, you devote ſo much of your time to playing cards.</note> Votre regiment n'eſt pas aligné Monſieur—, et ce n'eſt pas ſurprenant, vous jouez tant aux cartes." The General called out inſtantly with a loud voice to the regiment,<note n="§" place="bottom">Halt.</note> Alte! and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031692_0123_0FEE0E14554530C0"/>
they immediately ſtopped. Then, turning to the King, he ſaid, "<note n="§" place="bottom">My cards' out of the queſtion, Sir. Have the goodneſs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap>ce regiment n'eſt pas aligné,"—The regiment was in a very ſtraightline, and the King moved away without ſpeaking, and ſeemingly diſpleaſed, not with the General, but with himſelf. This manly officer never had reaſon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to believe that the King had taken his freedom amiſs.</p>
                     <p>It is abſolutely impoſſible for any man to enjoy an office in the King of Pruſſia's ſervice, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the duty of it. He is himſelf active and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous, and he makes it a point that all his miniſters and ſervants ſhall be ſo too. But to thoſe who know their buſineſs, and perform it exactly, he is an eaſy and equitable maſter.</p>
                     <p>A gentleman, who has been many years about his perſon, and is now one of his aid-de-camps, aſſured me of this:—The King underſtands what ought to be done; and his ſervants are never expoſed to the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous or contradictory orders of ignorance, or the mortifications of caprice.</p>
                     <p>His favourites, of whatever kind, never were able acquire influence over him in any thing regarding bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:031692_0124_0FEE0E17B42F2950"/>
Nobody ever knew better how to diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the merit of thoſe who ſerve him in the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant departments of ſtate, from theirs who contribute to his amuſement. A man who performs the duties of his office with alertneſs and fidelity, has nothing to apprehend from the King's being fond of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and converſation of his enemy. Let the one be regaled at the King's table every day, while the other never receives a ſingle invitation; yet the real merit of both is known; and if his adverſary ſhould ever try to turn the King's favour to the purpoſes of private hatred or malice, the attempt will be repelled with diſdain, and the evil he intended to another will fall on himſelf.</p>

                     <p>THE Hereditary Prince of Pruſſia lives in a ſmall houſe in the town of Potſdam. His appointments do not admit of that degree of magnificence, which might be expected in the heir of the crown;—but he diſplays a ſpirit of hoſpitality far more obliging than magnificence, and doubly meritorious, conſidering th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

very moderate revenue allowed him. We generally ſlip there two or three times a week.</p>
                     <p>The Prince is not often of the King's parties, nor is it imagined that he enjoys a great ſhare of his uncle's favour. In what degree he poſſeſſes the talants of a general is not known, as he was too young to have any command during the late war. But he certainly has a very juſt underſtanding, which has been improved by ſtudy. He has taken ſome pains to acquire the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh language, to which he was enduced by an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſeveral Engliſh authors, whoſe works he had read in French and German. He is now able to read Engliſh proſe with tolerable facility, and has been of late ſtudying Shakeſpear, having actually read two or three of his plays.</p>
                     <p>I took the liberty to obſerve, that as Shakeſpear's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius had traced every labyrinth, and penetrated into every receſs of the human heart, his ſentiments could not ſail to pleaſe his Royal Highneſs; but as his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was uncommonly bold and figurative, and full of alluſions to national cuſtoms, and the manners of our iſland two centuries ago, the Engliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who had not made a particular ſtudy of his works, did not always comprehend their full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy. I added, that to transfuſe the ſoul of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear into a tranſlation, was impoſſible; and to taſte all his beauties in the original, required ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031692_0126_0FEE0E202E56A7D8"/>
of the Engliſh manners and language, as few for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners, even after a long reſidence in the capital, could attain.</p>
                     <p>The Prince ſaid he was aware of all this; yet he was determined to ſtruggle hard for ſome acquaintance with an author ſo much admired by the Engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that though he ſhould never be able to taſte all his excellencies, he was convinced he ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand enough to recompence him for his trouble; that he had already ſtudied ſome detached parts, which he thought ſuperior to any thing he had ever met with in the works of any other poet.</p>
                     <p>His Royal Highneſs attends to military buſineſs, with as much aſſiduity as moſt officers of the ſame rank in the army; for in the Pruſſian ſervice, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of eminence in the article of birth can excuſe a remiſſion in the duties of that profeſſion. He is much eſteemed by the army, and conſidered as an exceeding good officer. To the frankneſs of a ſoldier he joins the integrity of a German, and is beloved by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic in general, on account of his good nature, affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and humane turn of mind.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XXII. OF THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY.</head>
                     <p>THE Emperor is of a middle ſize, well made, and of a fair complexion. He has a conſiderable reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to his ſiſter, the Queen of France, which, in my opinion, is ſaying a great deal in favour of his looks. Till I ſaw ſomething of his uſual behaviour, I did not think it poſſible for a perſon in ſuch an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſituation, to put every body with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed upon ſo eaſy a footing.</p>
                     <p>His manner is affable, obliging, and perfectly free from the reſerved and lofty deportment aſſumed by ſome on account of high birth. Whoever has the honor to be in company with him, ſo far from being checked by ſuch deſpicable pride, has need to be on his guard, not to adopt ſuch a degree of familiarity as, whatever the condition of the one might permit, would be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improper in the other to uſe.</p>
                     <p>He is regular in his way of life, moderate in his pleaſures, ſteady in his plans, and diligent in buſineſs. He is fond of his army, and enclines that the ſoldiers ſhould have every comfort and neceſſary conſiſtent with their ſituation. He is certainly an oeconomiſt, and laviſhes very little mony on uſeleſs pomp, miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or favourites; and it is, I ſuppoſe, on no better
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:031692_0128_0FEE0E29A4BBAFC0"/>
foundation than this, that his enemies accuſe him of avarice.</p>
                     <p>I cannot help regarding oeconomy as one of the moſt uſeful qualities in a prince. Liberality, even when puſhed to an imprudent length, may, in a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, proceed from a kind of greatneſs of mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his fortune is in every ſenſe his own, and he can injure no body but himſelf in laviſhing it away. He knows that when it is gone, no body will reimburſe him for his extravagance. He ſeems, therefore to have taken the reſolution to ſubmit to the inconveniency of future poverty, rather than renounce the preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of acting with a magnificent liberality, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing on others more than he can afford.</p>
                     <p>This is not the caſe with a prince. What he ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is not his own, but the public money. He knows that his pomp and ſplendour will be kept up, and that his ſubjects, not himſelf, are to feel the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his prodigality. When I hear, therefore, that a king has given great ſums of money to any particular perſon; from the ſums given, the perſon who receives it, the motive for the gift, and other circumſtances, I can judge whether it is well or ill diſpoſed of; but in either caſe, it cannot be called generoſity.</p>
                     <p>The virtue of generoſity conſiſts in a man's depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf of ſomething for the ſake of another. There can be no generoſity in giving to John what James
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:031692_0129_0FEE0E2B312FB878"/>
muſt replace the next moment. What is called gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity in kings, very often conſiſts in beſtowing that money on the idle part of their ſubjects which they have ſqueezed from the induſtrious. I have heard a parcel of fiddlers and opera dances praiſe a prince for his noble and generous behaviour to them, while men near his perſon, of uſeful talents and real worth, were diſtreſſed for bread. The Emperor certainly has none of that kind of generoſity.</p>
                     <p>His uſual dreſs (the only one indeed in which I ever ſaw him, except at the feaſt of the Knights of St. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen) is a plain uniform of white, faced with red. When he goes to Laxenberg, Schonbrun, and other places near Vienna, he generally drives two horſes in an open chaiſe, with a ſervant behind, and no other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of any kind. He very ſeldom allows the guard to turn out, as he paſſes through the gate. No body ever had a ſtronger diſpoſition to judicious enquiry. He is fond of converſing with ingenious people. When he hears of any perſon, of whatever rank or country, being diſtinguiſhed for any particular talent, he is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to converſe with him, and turns the converſation to the ſubject on which the perſon is thought to excel, drawing from him all the uſeful information he can. Of all the means of knowledge, this is perhaps the moſt powerful, and the moſt proper that can be uſed by one
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031692_0130_0FEE0E2CC0CF4680"/>
whoſe more neceſſary occupations do not leave him much time for ſtudy.</p>
                     <p>He ſeems to be of opinion, that the vanity and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of many princes are frequently owing to the forms in which they are entrenched, and to their being deprived of the advantages which the reſt of mankind enjoy from a free compariſon and exchange of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He is convinced, that unleſs a king can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to live in ſome ſocieties on a footing of equality, and can weigh his own merit, without throwing his guards and pomp into the ſcale, it will be difficult for him to know either the world or himſelf.</p>
                     <p>One evening at the Counteſs Walſtein's, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation leading that way, the Emperor enumerated ſome remarkable and ludicrous inſtances of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of etiquette, which had occurred at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain court. One perſon hinted at the effectual means his Majeſty had uſed to baniſh every inconveniency of that kind from the court of Vienna; to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, it would be hard indeed, if, becauſe I have the ill fortune to be an Emperor, I ſhould be deprived of the pleaſures of ſocial life, which are ſo much to my taſte. All the grimace, and parade to which people in my ſituation are accuſtomed from their cradle, have not made me ſo vain, as to imagine that I am in any eſſential quality ſuperior to other men; and if I had any tendancy to ſuch an opinion, the ſureſt way to
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031692_0131_0FEE0E33B73A5DE0"/>
get rid of it is the method I take of mixing in ſociety, where I have daily occaſions of finding myſelf inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in talents to thoſe I meet with. Conſcious of this, it would afford me no enjoyment to aſſume airs of a ſuperiority, which I feel does not exiſt. I endeavour therefore to pleaſe, and to be pleaſed; and as much as the inconveniency of my ſituation will permit, to enjoy the bleſſings of ſociety like other men, convinced that the man who is ſecluded from thoſe, and raiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above friendſhip, is alſo raiſed above happineſs, and deprived of the means of acquiring knowledge.</p>
                     <p>This kind of language is not uncommon with poor philoſophers; but I imagine it is rarely held by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the inferences to be drawn from it more rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put in practice.</p>
                     <p>A few days after this, there was an exhibition of fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works on the Prater. This is a large park, planted with wood, and ſurrounded by the Danube, over which there is a wooden bridge. No carriages being allowed to paſs, the company leave their coaches at one end, and walk. There is a narrow path railed off on one ſide of the bridge. Many people very injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly took this path, to which there is an eaſy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance at one end, but the exit is difficult at the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for only one perſon can go out at a time. The path, therefore, was very ſoon choaked up; the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate paſſengers crept on a ſnail's pace, and in the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031692_0132_0FEE0E35472262B0"/>
moſt ſtraitened and diſagreeable manner imaginable; whilſt thoſe who had kept the wide path in the middle of the bridge, like the fortunate and wealthy in their journey through life, moved along at their eaſe, total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regardleſs of the wretched circumſtances of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low paſſengers.</p>
                     <p>Some few of the priſoners in the narrow paſſage, who were of a ſmall ſize and uncommon addreſs, crawled under the rail, and got into the broad walk in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but all who were tall, and of a larger make, were obliged to remain and ſubmit to their fate. An En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, who had been at the Counteſs Walſtein's when the Emperor expreſſed himſelf as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was of the laſt claſs. The Emperor, as he paſſed, ſeeing that thoſe of a ſmall ſize extricated themſelves, while the Engliſhman remained fixed in a very awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſituation, called out, "<note n="§" place="bottom">Ah Sir! I have told you how inconvenient it is to be too great—now you will be entirely of my opinion, but as it is not in my power to afford you any relief, I recommend you to St. George.</note> Ah, Monſieur!

                     <head>SECT. XXIII. OF THE IDOLATRY OF THE ROMAN CATHOLICS.</head>
                     <p>THE preference which is given by individuals in Roman Catholic countries, to particular ſaints, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds ſometimes from a ſuppoſed connection between the characters of the ſaints and the votaries; men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the greateſt favour and indulgence from thoſe who moſt reſemble themſelves, and naturally admire others for the qualities which they value moſt in their own character.</p>
                     <p>A French officer of dragoons, being at Rome, went to view the famous ſtatue of Moſes, by Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo.
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031692_0134_0FEE0E3C209FF978"/>
The artiſt has conveyed into this maſter-piece, in the opinion of ſome, all the dignity which a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man form and human features are capable of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He has endeavoured to give this ſtatue a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance worthy of the great legiſlator of the Jews, the favorite of heaven, who had converſed face to face with the Deity. The officer happened to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the hiſtory of Moſes, but he laid no great ſtreſs on any of theſe circumſtances. He admired him much more on account of one adventure, in which he imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined Moſes had acquitted himſelf like a man of ſpirit, and as he himſelf would have done:—"<note n="†" place="bottom">How terrible! how ſublime he appears. There is a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low who has cudgelled and killed his man in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> Volià qui eſt terrible! volià qui eſt ſublime!" cried he at ſight of the ſtatute; and after a little pauſe he added:—'On voit là un drôle qui a donné des coups de bâton en ſon tems, et qui a tué ſon homme."</p>
                     <p>The crucifixes, and ſtatues, and pictures of ſaints, with which popiſh churches are filled, were no doubt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to awaken devotion when it became drowſy, and to excite in the mind gratitude and veneration for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons they preſent. But it cannot be denied, that the groſs imaginations of the generality of mankind, are exceedingly prone to forget the originals, and transfer their adoration to the ſenſeleſs figures which they behold,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031692_0135_0FEE0E4249B0F118"/>
and before which they kneel. So that whatever was the original deſign, and whatever effects thoſe ſtatues and pictures have on the minds of calm, ſenſible Roman Catholics, it is certain, that they often are the objects of as complete idolatry as ever was practiſed in Athens or Rome, before the ſtatues of Jupiter or Apollo.</p>
                     <p>On what other principle do ſuch multitudes flock from all the Roman Catholic countries in Europe, to the ſhrine of our Lady at Loretto? Any ſtatue of the Virgin would ſerve as effectually as that to recal her to the memory; and people may adore her as devoutly in their own pariſh churches, as in the chapel at Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto. The pilgrims therefore muſt be perſuaded, that there is ſome divine influence or intelligence in the ſtatue which is kept there; that it has a conſciouſneſs of all the trouble they have taken, and the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies to which they have been expoſed, by long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for the ſole purpoſe of kneeling before it in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all other images.</p>
                     <p>It was probably on account of this tendency of the human mind, that the Jews were forbid to make unto themſelves any graven image. This indeed ſeems to have been the only method of ſecuring that ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious people from idolatry; and notwithſtanding the peremptory tenor of the commandment, neither the zeal nor remonſtrances of their judges and prophets could always prevent their making idols, nor hinder
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031692_0136_0FEE0E43D50729D8"/>
their worſhipping them wherever they found them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-made.</p>
                     <p>Statues and pictures of ſaints, which have been long in particular families, are generally kept with great care and attention. The proprietors often have the ſame kind of attachment to them, that the ancient heathens had to their Dii Penates. They are conſidered as tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telary and domeſtic divinities, from whom the family expect protection. When a ſeries of unfortunate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents happens in a family, it ſometimes creates a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that the family ſtatues have loſt their influence. This alſo is a very ancient ſentiment. Suetonius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that the fleet of Auguſtus having been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed by a ſtorm, and many of the ſhips loſt, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror gave orders that the ſtatue of Neptune ſhould not be carried in proceſſion with thoſe of the other Gods, from an opinion that the God of the Sea was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or unable to protect his navy, and in either caſe he deemed him not worthy of any public mark of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction.</p>
                     <p>The genuine tenets of the Roman Catholic church certainly do not authoriſe any of the ſuperſtitions above mentioned, which are generally confined to the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and illiterate in the lower ranks of life. Yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſometimes to be met with in a higher ſphere. A Frenchman in a creditable way of life, had a ſmall figure of our Saviour on the croſs, of very curious
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031692_0137_0FEE0E473091FD90"/>
workmanſhip; he offered it for ſale to an Engliſh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of my acquaintance; after expatiating on the excellency of the workmanſhip, he told him he had long kept this crucifix with the moſt pious care; that he had always addreſſed it in his private devotion, and that in return he had expected ſome degree of protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and favour; inſtead of which he had of late been remarkably unfortunate; that all the tickets he had in the lottery had proved blanks; and having had a great ſhare in the cargo of a ſhip coming from the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he had recommended it in the moſt fervent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in his prayers to the crucifix, and that he might give no offence, by any appearance of want of faith, he had not inſured the goods; notwithſtanding all which, the veſſel had been ſhipwrecked, and the cargo totally loſt, though the ſailors, in whoſe preſervation he had no concern, had been all ſaved. "Enfin, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur," cried he, with an accent of indignation mingled with regret, and raiſing his ſhoulders above his ears, "<note n="§" place="bottom">In ſhort, Sir, I am in want, and muſt ſee my God.</note> Enfin, Monſieur, il m'a manqué, et je vends mon Chriſt."</p>
                     <p>Happy for Chriſtians of every denomination, could they abide by the plain, rational, benevolent precepts of the chriſtian religion, rejecting all the conceits of ſuperſtition, which never fail to deform its original beauty, and to corrupt its intrinſic purity!</p>

                     <p>I FIND hardly any inconveniency reſulting from my ignorance of the Daniſh language. Every perſon of faſhion ſpeaks French, and many of them Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen of the army and navy here in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, are almoſt univerſally uſed to theſe languages. They are, at leaſt ſeveral of them with whom I have fallen into company, extremely diſpoſed to treat a ſtranger with every mark of urbanity and politeneſs. One of them has already promiſed to accompany me over the iſland of Zealand, and to be my conducter on a tour I propoſe making to ſee the royal palaces.</p>
                     <p>Though the month of May will begin in a few days, the weather is ſtill very cold here. We have had hail almoſt every day ſince my arrival; nor are there as yet any marks of that ſweet ſeaſon, which the Italians ſo juſtly denominate, the <hi>Gioventa del anno,</hi> but which is pretty much unknown to Daniſh poets. Indeed, I apprehend the year is more properly divided here into the ſummer and winter, than as with us into four ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. A ſhort ſummer ſucceeds to the long ſeries of cold and darkneſs, which environs them from October till April; and during this period, they often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence very great heats for a few days, or ſometimes
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031692_0139_0FEE0E4FDE159578"/>
weeks. Certainly man is much affected by phyſical cauſes, and one is not ſurpriſed to find the elegant arts chiefly confined to luxurious and ſouthern climates, and faintly raiſing their heads amid theſe ſnowy and inhoſpitable regions, where the inhabitants ſeem, in ſome degree, to partake of the aſperities of their ſoil, and where royal munificence, however unbounded, can only raiſe a few ſickly and ſtraggling plants.</p>
                     <p>They ſeem to have a great turn for politics here, and as it may not be quite ſo ſafe to inſpect too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the conduct of their own ſovereign and ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they make themſelves ſome amends by intereſting themſelves in thoſe of the Engliſh nation. I am aſked a thouſand queſtions here, in every company, about the inhabitants of Boſton, and relative to the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia affairs. They are unanimous in opinion, that the colonies will be ſoon abſolutely free; and they give me a look of incredibility, and a ſignificant ſhake of the head, when I aſſure them, that Boſton muſt ſubmit, and that government have uniformly embraced the moſt gentle, mild, and parental meaſures; I ſee they do not believe me, and I am obliged to refer them to futurity for the teſt of my aſſertions.</p>
                     <p>So few perſons viſit this metropolis or kingdom from motives of curioſity, that they are quite ſurpriſed when I aſſure them I have no ſort of buſineſs here, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> only employed in the ſearch of knowledge. Indeed,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031692_0140_0FEE0E51699F49E8"/>
apprehend, a month or five weeks is fully adequate to the completion of theſe purpoſes; and I ſhall not delay my departure an hour after that time.</p>
                     <p>There is no face of induſtry or buſineſs here; and Copenhagen, though one of the fineſt ports in the world, can boaſt of little commerce. The public pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are filled with officers either in the land or ſea ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and they appear to conſtitute three-fourths of the audience at the comedy and opera. The number of forces are, indeed, much too large for this little kingdom, which has not been engaged in war theſe fifty years. They can boaſt, 'tis true, a vaſt extent of dominion; but of what importance are the barren and almoſt uninhabited mountains of Norway and Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſtretching to the pole? or the plains of Iceland, where the inhabitants are yet, and will probably ever remain, in the moſt profound barbariſm? Their Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dominions in Holſtein are by far the moſt rich, and furniſh a large part of the royal revenue. There needs, indeed, no ſtronger proof of the poverty of the kingdom, than the ſcarcity of ſpecie. I have ſeen no gold, and hardly any ſilver. They pay every thing in paper; and if you loſe a ſingle dollar at the card-table, or the billiard table, it is given in a bill. I received two hundred rix dollars yeſterday morning, and not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle one in money.</p>
                     <p>The police of Copenhagen is exceedingly good, and
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031692_0141_0FEE0E52F49424E0"/>
one may walk through the whole city at midnight with the moſt perfect ſafety. No robberies, no aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinations are beard of. They wear no cloaks nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any ſtillettoes under their habits, as in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern kingdoms of Europe. Indeed, it is uſually almoſt as quiet here at eleven o'clock at night as in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try village, and ſcarce a coach rattles through the ſtreets.</p>
                     <p>I do not apprehend this capital can be above the fourth part of the ſize of London, poſſibly not ſo much. It is fortified towards the land by a foſsè, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways full of water. The ſtreets are commonly of a good breadth, and the houſes very neat and handſome. There is one very beautiful place here, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches nearer to a circus than a ſquare; each ſide or diviſion of which is only one palace, and in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is an equeſtrian ſtatue in bronze of the late King Fredeick V. I muſt own I was much more pleaſed with this, than with the Place de Victories at Paris, and think it has a much better effect.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XXV. OF THE COURT AT COPENHAGEN.</head>
                     <p>I HAVE not had the honour of being preſented to the ſovereign here, as is cuſtomary with ſtrangers from the other kingdoms of Europe. It is ſufficient that I am an Engliſhman not to wiſh it; and, indeed, with ſo jealous an eye are we regarded, at preſent, in this capital, that I can aſſure you, becauſe I have it from the moſt reſpectable and inconteſtable authority, that ſo little an individual as myſelf, ſo humble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known a traveller as I am, is not only publickly talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, but even ſuſpected as a ſpy, becauſe I came from England, and have no avowed motive, except curioſity and knowledge. I have never, therefore, been at the levee, which is every Friday; but I go to the drawing room, and mingle unnoticed among the crowd. I was there laſt night, when his majeſty, the queen dowager, and Prince Frederick the king's brother, were preſent. To give you a picture of the court as it now exiſts, I muſt carry you back to the time of the late celebrated and unhappy favourite, Count Struenſee. I have made it my endeavour, ſince my arrival here, to gain the moſt authentic and unprejudiced intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence reſpecting him, and the late extraordinary revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031692_0143_0FEE0E5C73AA2E58"/>
which expelled a queen from her throne and kingdom, and brought the miniſters to the ſcaffold.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only mention ſome few anecdotes, which elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidate his character, and with which many may be unacquainted; though, as I never peruſed the printed account of his life, and trial, which appeared in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, I muſt be excuſed if I repeat what is contained there.</p>
                     <p>Struenſee had not any noble blood in his veins, nor conſequently any hereditary and preſcriptive title to the immediate guidance of affairs of ſtate. Fortune, and a train of peculiar circumſtances, coinciding with his own talents and addreſs, ſeem to have drawn him from his native mediocrity of condition, and placed him in an elevated rank. He originally practiſed phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic at Altena on the Elbe, and afterwards attended the preſent king of Denmark on his travels into England, in quality of phyſician. On his return, he advanced by rapid ſtrides in the royal favour, and ſeems to have eminently poſſeſſed the powers of pleaſing, ſince he became equally the favourite of both the king and queen. He was inveſted with the order of St. Matilda, inſtituted in honour of her majeſty, created a count, and poſſeſſed unlimited miniſterial power. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in this ſudden and uncommon eminence, marks a bold and daring mind; perhaps I might add, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded and patriotic heart. Unawed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031692_0144_0FEE0E61998ABDF8"/>
tenure of courtly greatneſs, and more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly of his own, he began a general reform. The ſtate felt him through all her members. The finances, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, army, navy, nobles, peaſants—all were ſenſible of his influence. He not only dictated, but penned his replies to every important queſtion or diſpatch; and a petition, or a ſcheme of public import and utility, rarely waited two hours for an anſwer. At preſent, I am told, you may be two months without receiving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The civil judicature of this capital was then veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thirty magiſtrates. Struenſee ſent a meſſage to this tribunal, demanding to know the annual ſalary or penſion annexed to each member. Rather alarmed at this enquiry, they ſent an anſwer, in which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed their emoluments two thirds, and eſtimated them at 1500, inſtead of 4000 rix-dollars. The count then informed them, that his majeſty had no farther occaſion for their ſervices; but in his royal munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and liberality, was graciouſly pleaſed to contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue to them the third part of the avowed incomes, as a proof of his ſatisfaction with their conduct. He at the ſame time conſtituted another court, compoſed only of ſix perſons of approved integrity, to whom the ſame power was delegated. He proceeded to purge the chancery, and other bodies of the law. Then enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the military department, he, at one ſtroke, broke all the horſe-guards, and afterwards the regiment
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031692_0145_0FEE0E63259D74A0"/>
of Norwegian foot-guards, the fineſt corps of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and who were not diſbanded without a ſhort, but very dangerous ſedition. Still proceeding in this ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but moſt critical and perilous atchievement, he ultimately began to attempt a diminution of the power of the nobles, and to ſet the farmers and peaſants at perfect liberty. We muſt not, therefore, wonder that he fell a victim to ſuch meaſures, and that all parties joined in his deſtruction. Theſe were his real crimes, and not that he was too acceptable to the queen, which only formed a pretext. It was the miniſter, and not the man, who had became obnoxious. I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, in the latter capacity, either to excuſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him; but as a politician, I rank him with the Clarendons and the Mores, whom tyranny, or public baſeneſs, and want of virtue, have brought, in almoſt every age, to an untimely and ignominious exit; but to whoſe memory impartial poſterity have done am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple juſtice. Yet I muſt avow, that though I cannot think Struenſee made a bad uſe, he certainly made a violent and imprudent one, of his extenſive power. He ſeems, if one may judge from his actions, to have been in ſome meaſure intoxicated with royal favour and ſuch accumulated honours, and not to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſufficiently to the examples which hiſtory fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes of Wolſey's in former days, and of Choſeuls in modern times who moſt ſtrikingly evince the ſlippery
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031692_0146_0FEE0E6682E739A0"/>
foundation of political grandeur. When he was even preſſed only a ſhort time before his ſeizure, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from court, and paſs the Belts, with the moſt ample ſecurity for his annual remitment of forty, fifty, a hundred thouſand dollars, an unhappy faſcination detained him, in defiance of every warning, and reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for the priſon and the block. The Queen Dowager, and Prince Frederic, were only the feeble inſtruments to produce this cataſtrophe, as being by their rank immediately about the perſon of the ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign; though common report has talked loudly of the former's intrigue, and attributed it to her imaginary abilities. The only mark of capacity or addreſs they exhibited, was in preſerving a ſecrecy, which deluded Struenſee and the Queen Matilda, till the time of their being arreſted. I have been aſſured, that on the laſt levee day preceeding this event, the Count was habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with uncommon magnificence, and never received greater homage of court ſervility from the crowd, than when on the verge of ruin. On the night fixed for his ſeizure, there was a <hi>bal paré</hi> in the palace; the Queen, after dancing as uſual, one country dance with the King, gave her hand to Struenſee during the reſt of the evening. She retired about two in the morning, and was followed by him and Count Brandt. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was now come. The Queen Dowager, and her ſon Prince Frederic, haſtened to the King's private
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031692_0147_0FEE0E6DD5F02E30"/>
chamber, where he was already in bed. They kneed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down beſide it, and implored him with tears and expoſtulations to ſave himſelf and Denmark from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending deſtruction, by arreſting thoſe whom they called the authors of it. 'Tis ſaid, the King was no eaſily induced to ſign the order, but did it with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and heſitation. At length, their intreaties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and he fixed his ſign manuel to the paper. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Koller Banner inſtantly repaired to Struenſee's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, which, as well as Brandt's, was in the palace they were both ſeized nearly at the ſame inſtant, and, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> all defence was vain, hurried away immediately to the citadel. When Count Struenſee ſtepped out of the coach, he ſaid with a ſmile to the commandant, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap> at all ſurpriſed, but on the contrary, have long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you." It was five o'clock in the morning when the Count Rantzau came to the door of her Majeſty's anti-chamber, and knocked for admitance. One of the women about the Queen's perſon was ordered to wake her, and give her information that ſhe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted. They then put her into one of the King's coaches, drove her down to Elſinoor, and ſhut her up in the caſtle of Cronſberg.</p>
                     <p>Mean while, as they dreaded an inſurrection in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031692_0148_0FEE0E6F610E7A88"/>
every military precaution was taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. The moſt infamous and ſilly reports were circulated among the populace, to render the ſtate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners odious: that they had put poiſon in the king's coffee to deſtroy him; that they intended to declare him incapable of governing; to ſend the Dowager Queen Juliana out of the kingdom, as well as her ſon Prince Frederic, and to proclaim Matilda regent. To confirm theſe extraordinary and contradictory reports, the King himſelf and he brother appeared in a ſtate-coach, and paraded through the ſtreets of the city, to ſhow himſelf unhurt, and as if eſcaped from the moſt horrid conſpiracy.</p>
                     <p>During theſe tranſactions, Struenſee and Brandt were detained in the moſt rigourous impriſonment. They loaded the former with very heavy chains about his arms and legs, and as he was at the ſame time fixed to the wall by an iron bar. I have ſeen the room, which is not above ten or twelve feet ſquare, with a little bed in it, and a miſerable iron ſtove. Yet here, in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of miſery, did he, though chained, complete with a pencil an account of his life and conduct as a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, which is penned as I have been aſſured, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common genius. A tribunal was appointed for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the Queen and the two Counts, and a council aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for each, to preſerve an appearance of juſtice and equity. All the world know the reſult, and the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031692_0149_0FEE0E732C12D258"/>
winding up of the whole on the 28th of April, 1772. I ſhall, however, mention ſome particulars relative to Count Brandt, as they are very remarkable and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true; nor do I apprehend that many in England have ever heard them.</p>
                     <p>This unfortunate man roſe chiefly under Struenſee's auſpices, though he was originally of an honourable deſcent. During a reſidence which the court made at one of the royal palaces, that of Hercſholm, it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his Majeſty quarrelled with Brandt, and, which was ſingular enough, challenged him. This the Count-declined. When they met ſoon after, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his defiance; called him coward; and Brandt ſtill behaving with temper, as became a ſubject, he thruſt his hand into his mouth, ſeized his tongue, and had very nearly choaked him. In this ſituation can it be wondered at, that he ſhould bite the King's fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or ſtrike him, or both? Self-preſervation muſt neceſſarily ſuperſede every other feeling at ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and plead his pardon. By Struenſee's mediation the quarrel was immediately made up, and the King promiſed never more to remember or reſent the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of his ſtriking him. Yet was this blow, given to preſerve himſelf from imminent deſtruction, and from the fury of an enraged man, made the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for his condemnation. They ſaid, he had liſted his hand againſt the King's ſacred perſon, which was
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031692_0150_0FEE0E7852FAF2A0"/>
death by the laws of Denmark. His lawyer, I am told, made an excellent defence for him, and very forcibly remarked the eſſential difference between aſſaulting the ſovereign, and defending himſelf from a private attack. "One of our former monarchs, ſaid he (Chriſtian V.) was uſed frequently to unbend himſelf among his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. On theſe occaſions it was his cuſtom to ſay, "The King is not at home." All the courtiers then behaved with the utmoſt freedom and familiarity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained by the royal preſence. When he choſe to reſume his kingly dignity, he ſaid, "The King is again at home." But what, added he, muſt we do now, when the King is never at home?" This ſeems more like the ſpeech of an Engliſhman than a Dane, and breathes a manly and unfettered ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>The ſkulls and bones of theſe unhappy men are yet expoſed on wheels about a mile and a half out of town. I have viewed them with mingled commiſeration and horror. They hold up an awful and affecting leſſon for future ſtateſmen.</p>
                     <p>I have been aſſured, that Struenſee reſigned himſelf to his own ſentence without murmuring, or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deprecate the blow; but that he expreſſed the utmoſt pity and abhorrence at the flagrant injuſtice committed in ſentencing Count Brandt to the ſame, death. They have portraits of Struenſee in all the ſhops, with this motto round him; "Mala multa Str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ipſum perdidit." You ſee it is a miſerable ſort of pun upon his name. Yet, in defiance of all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of a triumphant party, the terrors of a deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic government, and the natural reſerve among the people, there are, even here, who dare to ſpeak, though ambiguouſly, their genuine ſentiments. "Sir," ſaid a man of ſenſe and honour to me, a few days ſince, "between ourſelves, all is not as it ſhould be; we have at preſent neither king nor miniſter. An imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility mingled with diſorder, characterizes our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The effects are too viſible. The blue and white ribbons are proſtituted and contemptible. The finances are in a worſe ſtate than when Struenſee found them. The army devour us. In Norway, affairs are yet worſe. The king is unpopular there, and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is his authority reſpected, that the Norwegians have refuſed and ſtill refuſe, to pay the capitation tax; nor can it be levied among them." I have not amplified or exaggerated in this picture, which I really believe it too juſt in moſt of the particulars. The King has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuffered much in his intellectual capacity, and they make very little ſcruple in general to own it. He can play indeed at cards; he can dance, or go to an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>era; but he is doubtleſs in a ſtate of debility, which diſqualifies him for the conducting or ſuperintending affairs of national import and public conſequence. Theſe are left to the miniſters, who tread very cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031692_0152_0FEE0E7F87B436B8"/>
and will not preſently proſecute Struenſee's patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic meaſures. His fall is too recent, nor have his bones yet returned to their parent earth. There is a vacuity in his aſpect, which is ſtrongly marked; and he is much paler and thinner than when he was on his tour in England. The Queen Dowager and Prince Frederic live in the palace with him, and accompany him, like his ſhadow, wherever he moves. The Prince has received no other mark of bounty from nature, or fortune, than royal birth. He is very much deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this perſonal imperfection has gained him the appellation of Richard III. among thoſe who do not love the court, though it doubtleſs originated among the Engliſh.</p>

                     <p>AS I approached to this capital, the country appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more rocky, barren, and deſert; and at the diſtance of a ſingle mile from it, one is tempted to ſuppoſe one's-ſelf in the moſt unfrequented and deſolate wild.

diſcerns nothing on every ſide except firs and rugged rocks; and it would ſeem as if famine had here fixed her eternal reſidence.</p>
                     <p>I entered Stockholm over a floating bridge of a very conſiderable length acroſs the river. I was, indeed, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>opt at the gates; but policy, and not religion, was the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>I am lodged at preſent cloſe to the palace; and, as my landlord informs me, in the very apartment where his Grace the Archbiſhop of Upſal reſided, during ſix months previous to the coronation of his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which office he performed. You will perhaps ſuppoſe from this, that they are very elegant; that the hangings are of tapeſtry, and the chairs covered with velvet. Nothing leſs ſo, I aſſure you! A monk of La Trappe might almoſt occupy them without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of his vow of mortification; and though I pay a ducat and a half, or fourteen ſhilling a week, I was ſcarce ever ſo indifferently lodged in any city of Europe. The quality which induced the Archbiſhop to take them, was, no doubt, their neig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bourhood to the palace. It would be difficult to diſcover any other to recommend them.</p>
                     <p>I cannot ſay that I have ſound many charms as yet in this city. The court are all in the country, at their reſpective palaces, and there is only one public diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion during the week, which is a Swediſh opera.
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031692_0154_0FEE0E829CDDC540"/>
What kind of an entertainment this is, and how far the language is capable of muſical beauty, I am not yet a judge, as there was no repreſentation laſt Thurſday, which is the night when they uſually perform. For want, therefore, of other avocation, I have wandered over every part of the metropolis, and taken different views of it from the numerous eminences which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round it. Perhaps I may be accuſed of preſumption when I aſſert, that in almoſt every point of view, the ſituation of Stockholm is injudicious and improper for the capital of the kingdom. Policy, plenty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, ſeem all to dictate another part of Sweden as much more elegible. I ſhall endeavour to juſtify my opinion by a few remarks.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants themſelves aſſure me, that the place owed its original, only about three centuries ago, to an accidental contingency. The viceroy, who at that time governed the country under Chriſtian II. of Denmark, determined to found a city, and inſtead of fixing on a proper ſpot for the execution of his plan, he very wiſely ſet a large piece of wood a-float, down the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ler Lake, and reſolved that at whatever place it ſhould ſtop, there to build his projected town. A ſmall iſland arreſted the ſtick in its progreſs, and the name of Stockholm is ſaid to have been given it from this circumſtance</p>
                     <p>I was ſhown the exact point of land where tradition
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031692_0155_0FEE0E89AAD750D0"/>
ſays it happened, and where the firſt buildings of the city were erected. However this be, it was hardly poſſible to have found a more barren deſert, or a leſs inviting ſituation in almoſt all reſpects. Even the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has a number of inconveniencies, as it winds in a ſurpriſing manner, and having no tides, ſhips muſt have a fair wind to reach the town; and ſhould it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is abſolutely impoſſible. If I pointed out that part of Sweden, which appears to me deſigned by nature and wiſdom for the foundation of a capital, I ſhould mention Carlſcrone. Its centrical ſituation between Copenhagen and Peterſburg; its vicinity to Pomerania and Germany; the fertile province of Scania, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fineſt in Sweden, behind it; a port capable of containing the whole fleet and in which they are at this time always ſtationed; its climate, more mild and ſouthern than that of Stockholm, by ſome degrees; all theſe circumſtances ſeem to leave an unprejudiced perſon little room to diſpute its more advantageous ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                     <p>There is ſomewhat uncommonly ſavage and inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable in the whole circumjacent country here. Even in this lovely ſeaſon, when all animate and inanimate nature awakes from the long ſlumber of a polar winter, every thing is joyleſs and unfertile, and the rays of the ſun are reflected from the expanſe of ſtone which inveſts the city round on every ſide; and from
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031692_0156_0FEE0E8B36209910"/>
whoſe boſom no verdure ſprings to regale the eye. I repeat inſtinctively, as I gaze around, the celebrated lines in Churchill's prophecy of Famine, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exaggerated they may be for the country he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to paint, are almoſt ſtrictly and literally true here; nor am I ſurpriſed to find a Chriſtian flying from theſe uncivilized and unlettered regions, to the abodes of art and elegance.</p>
                     <p>This kingdom has however, been move productive of immortal and ſublime ſpirits, than all the others of the north. I feel myſelf affected with a reverential awe, as I walk through the church where repoſe the great names of Guſtavus Adolphus, of Torſtenſon, of Baner, and Charles XII. I tread with decent humility over the vaults where their bodies are interred, and find a melancholy ſatisfaction in ſurveying the marble raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their deathleſs ſame.</p>
                     <p>I have converſed ſeveral times ſince my arrival here with Swedes on the ſubject of the victories and death of the laſt of theſe heroes. They are almoſt unanimous in the apprehenſion, or rather avowal, that he was put to death by thoſe about him, and did not fall by a ſhot from the walls of Fredericſhall, as is commonly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. As every circumſtance relative to the fall of ſo extraordinary a man intereſts, and as there ſeems great reaſon to imagine he did not die by the chance of war, I hope ſhall not give offence, If I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what minute on this article.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="unknown:031692_0157_0FEE0E8EB1F696A0"/>
Monſieur Voltaire has taken great pains to prove the contrary, and to vindicate the engineer who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him, at the time, from ſo foul a ſuſpicion. I, however, think his reaſons very apocryphal, and even ſome of the facts he relates, as rather tending to give riſe to an oppoſite concluſion. "The King," ſays he, "walked out to view the ſtate of the advances made by his forces; it was night. He kneeled down the better to inſpect them, and leaned his head on his hands. In this attitude, amid the darkneſs, he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ball into his temple, and fell on the parapet, fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deep ſigh. He was dead in an inſtant; but in that inſtant he had yet force and courage to put his hand to his ſword, and lay in that poſture. Merget, a French engineer, immediately ſaid, with a coolneſs which diſtinguiſhed his character.—The play is over, let us begone!" I quote by memory, and therefore aſk Voltaire's pardon if I do not exactly and literally relate it, as he has given it to the world; but nothing material is added or omitted.</p>
                     <p>The Swedes allow moſt of theſe circumſtances to be true, though they infer very differently. Is it, ſay they, probable, that a ball from the fort, fired at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in the night, ſhould ſo exactly enter the King's brain? Or, is it not much more natural to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a piſtol from ſome nearer hand gave ſo well-aimed and deciſive a blow? His attitude indicated an
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:031692_0158_0FEE0E94ADA38090"/>
intention of defence from ſome near attack; nor would he have laid his hand on his ſword to reſiſt a cannon ſhot.</p>
                     <p>Merget's remark was ſuch, as one can with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuppoſe any one to make on ſo diſaſtrous and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected an event, as the King's death, and ſeems rather that of a pre-ſentiment of the winding up of this bloody cataſtrophe. Add to this, that the Swedes were tired of a prince, under whom they had loſt their richeſt provinces, their braveſt troops, their national riches; and who yet, untamed by adverſity, purſued an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful and pernicious war, nor would ever have liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the voice of peace, or conſulted the internal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of his country. Baron Gortz's oppreſſions, ſuperadded to theſe, were intolerable; and no reſource remained unleſs to diſpatch the King. It was a very favourable opportunity, and was improved to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. The Prince of Heſſe, his brother-in-law, made little enquiry into the affair, and all paſſed without noiſe or tumult.</p>
                     <p>I have been the more inclined to give credit to this relation of Charles's death, from my own remarks on his dreſs. In the arſenal they preſerve with great care, the cloathes he was habited in at the time he fell. Theſe I have examined very minutely. The coat is a plain blue cloth regimental one, ſuch as every common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier wore. Round the waiſt he had a broad buff-leather-belt,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031692_0159_0FEE0E9637EF0010"/>
in which hung his ſword. The hat is torn only about an inch ſquare in that part of it which lies over the temple, and certainly would have been much more injured by a large ſhot. His gloves are made of very fine leather, and as the leſt one is perfectly clean and unſoiled, could only have been newly put on. The right hand glove is covered in the inſide with blood; and the belt, at that part where the handle or hilt of his ſword lay, is likewiſe bloody; ſo that it ſeems clear he had previouſly put his hand to his head on receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blow, before he attempted to draw his ſword and make reſiſtance. However, as he expired in the inſtant, no abſolute inference can be made; and after having exhauſted conjecture, we muſt draw a veil over this ambiguous and dark tranſaction, and reſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that ignorance and uncertainty which ſo often waits on the death of ſovereigns. Dr. Johnſon has drawn the moſt finiſhed and maſterly portrait of this extraordinary man, which ever fell from the pen of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. The four concluding lines deſcribes his death.</p>

                     <p>THIS great capital, though only a creation of the preſent century, has already grown to a vaſt ſize, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains infinitely higher matter of entertainment and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than either of thoſe from whence I am lately come. I am ſtruck with a pleaſing aſtoniſhment, while I wander among havens, ſtreets, and public buildings, which have riſen as by inchantment, within the memory of men ſtill alive, and have converted the marſhy iſlands of the Neva into one of the moſt magnificent cities of the earth. The imagination, aided by ſo many viſible objects, riſes to the wondrous founder, and beholds in idea the tutelary genius of Peter, yet hovering over the child of his own production, and viewing with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's fondneſs, its riſing palaces and temples. The names, on which ancient ſtory dwells with ſo much fondneſs, ſink on a compariſon with this immortal man, and the fabulous legiſlators of Greece and Egypt nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er preſumed to attempt the mighty transformation which the Czar completed. The followers of Cadmus, of Theſeus, and of Romulus, were animated with the ſame ardour as their leader; but the Muſcovites, wrapt in the moſt profound barbariſm, ſecluded by their illiberal prejudices from an intercourſe with Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:031692_0161_0FEE0E9D217CFF80"/>
nations, and equally the ſlaves of ſuperſtition and long preſcription, were forcibly torn from this night of ignorance, and compelled to accept of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of refinement, and of civilization. I muſt own, I never conſider this ſo recent and ſo wondrous an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent without being hurried away by an enthuſiaſm I cannot avoid feeling, and from which I now return, to give an imperfect deſcription of the feſtivities to which I have been a witneſs during my ſtay here, and from which I am only juſt returned.</p>
                     <p>I had the pleaſure to accompany Sir Robert Gunn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laſt Saturday to the palace of Peterhoff, where the empreſs at preſent reſides. It was the anniverſary of her acceſſion, when there is generally a very brilliant court. As we arrived early, I had an opportunity of viewing the gardens before her majeſty's appearance. They are very extenſive, lying along the ſhore of the gulf of Finland, and waſhed by its waters. In ſhe midſt of them ſtands the palace itſelf, ſituate on an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inence, and commanding a fine view. The apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are all very ſplendid, but my attention was chiefly engroſſed by the drawing-room, where hung five matchleſs portraits of the ſovereigns of Ruſſia. They are all length pieces, but by what maſter I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay. Peter himſelf is the firſt, and oppoſite to him appears the Livonian villager, whom he raiſed from a cottage to the moſt unbounded ſovereignty. I ſtood
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031692_0162_0FEE0E9EABCC4F90"/>
for ſome moments under this painting in ſilent admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the woman, who had paſſed from ſo humble a ſtation to an imperial diadem, of which her genius, her fidelity, and her virtue made her worthy. She is drawn by the painter as in middle life; her eyes and hair black, her countenance open, ſmiling and ingratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and her perſon not exceeding the middle ſize. The Empreſs Anne and Elizabeth fill their reſpective places in this apartment, but did not long detain me from a portrait of the reigning ſovereign, which is of a ſingular kind. She is habited in the Ruſſian uniform, booted, and ſits aſtride on a white horſe. In her hat is the oaken bough, which ſhe wore at the memorable revolution, which placed her on the throne, and which was likewiſe taken by all her adherents. Her long hair floats in diſorder down her back; and the fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her face, the natural effect of the fatigue and heat ſhe had undergone, is finely deſigned. It is a faithful and exact reſemblance of her dreſs and perſon, as ſhe appeared twelve years ago, when ſhe came to Peterhoff, and ſeized the throne of Ruſſia.</p>
                     <p>While my eyes were rivetted to this picture, and my thoughts employed on the melancholy cataſtrophe of the unhappy emperor which ſo ſoon followed, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs's entrance was announced. She was pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

woman, whoſe vigour and policy, without any right of blood, has ſeated and maintains her in the throne of the Czars.</p>
                     <p>Though ſhe is now become rather corpulent, there is a dignity tempered with graciouſneſs in her deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and manner, which ſtrikingly impreſſes. She was habited in a deep blue ſilk with gold ſtripes, and her hair ornamented with diamonds. After the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign miniſters had paid her the cuſtomary compliments on this day, I had the honour to be preſented and to kiſs her hand. The grand duke and ducheſs of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia followed the empreſs, who continued ſcarce a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute in the circle, but ſat down at the card table.</p>
                     <p>There is not only a magnificence and regal pomp in this court, which far exceeds any I have beheld elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but every thing is on a vaſt and coloſſal ſcale, reſembling that of the empire itſelf. The public buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, churches, monaſteries, and private palaces of the nobility, are of an immenſe ſize; and ſeem as if deſigned for creatures of a ſuperior heighth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions to man; "to a puny infect ſhivering at the breeze!"</p>
                     <p>The ſtatue and pedeſtal which will ſoon be ſet up of Peter the Great, are of the ſame enormous and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic proportions, and may almoſt rank with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031692_0164_0FEE0EA7DBDADC00"/>
and more univerſal. The palace which the preſent empreſs has begun, is deſigned to be two or three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh miles in circumference; and in the mean time they have erected a tempory one of brick for her recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The city itſelf is an immenſe aggregate of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and the Muſcovite lords commonly go fifty or ſixty verſts which are at leaſt forty of our miles, to make viſits to each other. There is a ſort of ſavage and barbarous grandeur in this taſte, which never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the edifices and productions of Athenian ſculpture or architecture. I know it may be ſaid, that the difference of extent and greatneſs between the little republic of Attica, and the wide empire of Ruſſia, may give riſe to a different ſtandard of beauty and elegance; but this is not ſufficient to alter the original and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable criterion of nature, which is the ſame in every country.</p>
                     <p>Peterſburg is as yet only an immenſe outline, which will require future empreſſes, and almoſt future ages to complete. It ſtands at preſent on a prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ground; but as the houſes in many parts are not contiguous, and great ſpaces are left unbuilt, it is hard to aſcertain its real ſize and magnitude. Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has not been wanting to add her magnificence, and to erect places of worſhip in almoſt every part. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and novelty have carried me to all of them. The external architecture differs very little in any.
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031692_0165_0FEE0EADA63F65A8"/>
The Greeks ſeem as fond of domes, as the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans are of Minarets in their churches. They uſually encircle one large with four ſmaller cupolas, and cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er them with copper gilt, which has a fine effect to the eye, when the ſun ſhines upon it. The ornaments within are coſtly and barbarous. A Mexican temple can hardly be more ſo. They ſurround a daubing of the Virgin and Jeſus, with gold or ſilver head-dreſſes, and ſometimes complete habits, and only leave expoſed the fingers, which the multitude very devoutly kiſs. The papas or prieſts are dreſſed in veſtments which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much reſemble the Romiſh, and are generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of tiſſue and expenſive ſilks. The manner in which they perform the ſervice rather reminds one of an incantation, than of a prayer offered to the Deity; and they repeat much of it ſo incredibly faſt, that one is tempted to ſuppoſe it impoſſible the auditory can underſtand one articulate word the prieſt utters, let their attention be ever ſo ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>In the church of the citadel repoſe the body of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I. and the ſucceſſive ſovereigns ſince his death, who are ranged in coffers, ſide by ſide, but have not any of them marble monuments erected to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; nor is there any other motive to induce a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller to enter this church, except the conſciouſneſs that he beholds the wood which contains the aſhes of Peter, and that mingled ſentiments of reverence and
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031692_0166_0FEE0EAF3132C9A0"/>
pleaſure which the mind may experience from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of it. Only one monarch is excluded, as if unworthy to be entombed with his progenitors and predeceſſors in the throne of Ruſſia. This is the late unhappy Peter III. who, after his death, was expoſed during ſome days in the monaſtery of St. Alexander Newfsko;, a few miles out of town, to convince the people that he had not ſuffered any violence, but end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life naturally. He was afterwards privately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred there.—As I have mentioned his name, I am led to make a few remarks on his life and character. Though under the preſent reign it may be imagined, that few perſons either dare or chuſe to ſpeak their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents freely with reſpect to him, yet I am induced to believe from univerſal teſtimony, that he was very unworthy and unfit to reign, and that whatever private condemnation the empreſs, as his wife, may undergo, it was a moſt ſalutary and requiſite policy for Ruſſia to depoſe him. He brought to Peterſburg all the illiberal and pernicious prejudices of a German; he avowed his open contempt for their religion, their manners, their laws; he was on the point of commencing a war with Denmark for the recovery of his Holſtein dominions, and would have begun his march acroſs the immenſe track of country which ſeparates theſe kingdoms in a few days; he had perſonally ill-treated and injured his wife, and alienated by his imprudence and folly every heart.
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:031692_0167_0FEE0EB0BB719B08"/>
The vigour and celerity with which the Empreſs acted in effecting the revolution, could only be exceeded by the puſillanimity and meanneſs with which Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the crown. He was himſelf, on the day which preceeded this event, at the palace of Oranienbaum, and totally unprepared for ſuch a change, of which he entertained no ſuſpicion. She departed from Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoff, where ſhe then was, by a poſtern door in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, very early in the morning, Prince Orloff con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting her in his coach, and reached Peterſburg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her abſence was known. She inſtantly took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the palace without difficulty or oppoſition, and putting herſelf in an uniform at the head of the guards, marched towards Peterhoff. As ſoon as the Emperor received this intelligence, he embarked immediately from Oranienbaum, which is ſituate on the ſhore of the gulf of Finland, in one of the imperial yachts, in hopes to reach conſtadt, which is nearly oppoſite, and in the fortreſs of which he would have been ſecure. Here, however, he was diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Empreſs had already anticipated his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſpatched two admirals, who ſecured it. When he came near the fortreſs, they ordered him to keep off, or they would ſink him, and at the ſame time pointed the guns for that purpoſe. Beſides his miſtreſs, the Counteſs of Voronzoff, he had a number of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and attendants in the veſſel with him. Terrified
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031692_0168_0FEE0EB89CB53288"/>
with the appearance of oppoſition, they knelt round him, and rent the air with their cries, to enduce him to relinquiſh his purpoſe: effectively he did ſo, and yielding to his own fears, and their importunities, he had not the courage to attempt to land, but returned back to Oranienbaum. It proved afterwards that theſe guns were not loaded. The old Felt Marechal Count Munich, who had been newly recalled from his long exile in Siberia, was with him at this critical emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and gave him the only advice which could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have ſaved him. He implored him to go boldly and meet the empreſs, to charge the guards on their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to obey his orders as their ſovereign, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to loſe his own life in his defence. Peter had not ſufficient magnanimity and greatneſs of mind, either to perceive the abſolute neceſſity of this conduct, or to embrace it inſtantly. On the contrary, conſulting only with his terrors, he threw himſelf on the ground before the empreſs, in the gardens Oranienbeum, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering his feet with both his hands, burſt into all the impotence of tears, and only implored in terms of the moſt abject ſubmiſſion, that his life might be ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his paternal dominions of Holſtein aſſigned him. She commanded him to riſe, and conducted him to the palace of Peterhoff, where he ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a paper, by which he reſigned all power into her hands. Mean while covered waggons were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,

which took different roads, that it might not be known in which was the depoſed prince; and this mighty revolution, which transferred the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt empire on earth, was effected in a few hours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without any confuſion or uproar. The people accuſtomed to deſpotiſm, and indifferent who was the ruler, remained ſilent and quiet ſpectators of it, the guards being the only actors, and the whole a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the princeſs Elizabeth's conduct ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when young Ivan was depoſed, and ſhe ſeized the throne.—Over the reſt of this mournful ſtory we muſt draw a veil. Such a priſoner, it is natural to ſuppoſe, could not long remain in that condition. On the ninth day conſequent to his ſeizure it was reported he had a diſorder in his bowels, and ſoon after his death was announced. We know no more. Hiſtory, in ſome future age, may poſſibly elucidate his end; but in this century it is not likely ſuch a ſecret will be divulged.</p>
                     <p>Though I would not, however indirectly, appear the apologiſt of crimes, yet juſtice requires I ſhould ſay, that it is univerſally allowed the empreſs might plead ſelf-defence, if not even ſelf-preſervation to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy her conduct, as it is known that Peter had concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and would have carried into execution the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere meaſures againſt her if he had not been prevented by ſo vigorous an attack.

                     <p>THIS is a great city, a rich city, and a commercial one; but I cannot ſay I think it very agreeble, or that it contains much to gain a traveller's attention. Was human life of double the limits nature has aſſigned to it, one ſhould not be tempted to viſit it more than once. It muſt however be confeſſed I ſaw it to ſome diſadvantage, not being provided with letters of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as I had not intended to have included it in the plan of my tour. By the help, however, of my landlord, to whoſe good offices neceſſity has made me a debtor, I have ſeen every thing deſerving attention here, and ſhall leave it this afternoon perfectly well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with my ſtay. One of theſe has appeared to me ſo extraordinary; and is in itſelf, I apprehend, ſo very
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031692_0171_0FEE0EC31169A440"/>
ſingular, that if I had not been an eye witneſs of it, no teſtimony would have convinced me of its reality; and if it was not of ſuch a nature as to be univerſally examined, I ſhould fear the world would doubt my veracity.</p>
                     <p>I always apprehended that human bodies after death, if interred, or expoſed to the air without any prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to defend them from the attacks of it, would of neceſſity corrupt, become offenſive and putrify. The art of embalming is very ancient, and was invented to preſerve them from this inevitable conſequence of death; but that they may remain unputrified for cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies without any ſort of artificial aid, I have ſeen ſo inconteſtibly proved ſince my arrival, that I imagine not the ſhadow of doubt can remain about it.</p>
                     <p>Under the cathedral church is a vaulted apartment, ſupported on pillars; it is near ſixty paces long, and half as many broad. The light and air are conſtantly admitted into it by three windows, though it is ſeveral feet beneath the level of the ground. Here are five large oak coffers, rather than coffins, each containing a corpſe. I examined them ſeverally for near two hours. The moſt curious and perfect, is that of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Tradition ſays ſhe was an Engliſh counteſs, who dying here at Bremen, ordered her body to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this vault uninterred, in the apprehenſion that her relations would cauſe it to be brought own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

native country. They ſay it has lain here 250 years. Though the muſcular ſkin is totally dried in every part, yet ſo little are the features of the face ſunk or changed, that nothing is more certain than that ſhe was young, and even beautiful. It is a ſmall counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, round in its contour. The cartilage of the noſe and the noſtrils have undergone no alteration. Her teeth are all firm in the ſockets, but the lips are drawn away from over them. The cheeks are ſhrunk in, but yet leſs than I ever remember to have ſeen in embalmed bodies. The hair of her head is at this time more than eighteen inches long, very thick, and ſo faſt, that I heaved the corps out of the coffer by it. The colour is a light brown, and as freſh and gloſſy, as that of a living perſon. That this lady was of high rank ſeems evident, from the extreme fineneſs of the linen which covers her body; but I have in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to procure any lights into her hiſtory, her title, or any other particulars, though I have taken no little pains for that purpoſe. The landlord of the inn, who was with me, ſaid he remembered it for forty years paſt, during which time there is not the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible alteration in it.</p>
                     <p>In another coffer is the body of a workman, who is ſaid to have tumbled off the church, and was killed by the fall. His features evince this moſt forcibly. Extreme agony is marked in them. His mouth is
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031692_0173_0FEE0EC627F5B0C8"/>
wide open, and his eye-lids the ſame. The eyes are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. His breaſt is unnaturally diſtended, and his whole frame betrays a violent death.</p>
                     <p>A little child who died of the ſmall-pox is ſtill more remarkable. The marks of the puſtules, which have broken the ſkin on his hands and head, are very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible; and one ſhould ſuppoſe that a body which died of ſuch a diſtemper, muſt contain in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the ſeeds of putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>The two other corpſes are not leſs extraordinary. There are in this vault, likewiſe, turkeys, hawks, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and other animals, which have been hung up here; ſome, time immemorial, ſome very lately; and are in the moſt complete preſervation; the ſkin, bills, feathers, all unaltered. The cauſe of this phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is, doubtleſs, the dryneſs of the place where they are laid. It is in vain to ſeek for any other. The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtrates do not permit that any freſh bodies be brought here, and there is no other ſubterranean chamber which has the ſame property. It would have made an excellent miracle two or three centuries ago in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hands, but now mankind are grown too wiſe.</p>
                     <p>This city is celebrated for its old hock. The wine is all brought from the banks of the Rhine by land carriage, and depoſited in the public cellars. Theſe are wondrouſly capacious, running beneath the Town-Houſe and Exchange; but are not comparable in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence

to thoſe I have ſeen at Oeyras in Portugal, belonging to the Marquis de Pombal, or thoſe of Conſtantia at the Cape of Good-Hope. There is one particular room, called the Roſe, where they keep wine, as they ſay, of 170 years old, and for which they aſk ſeven dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, or twenty-five ſhillings a bottle; but it is not fit at this time to drink.</p>
                     <p>Bremen ſtands upon the river Weſel. Veſſels of burden lie twelve or fifteen miles below the city, there not being ſufficient depth of water higher up. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 45,000 inhabitants. It is a free city, under the protection of the empire, and ſtiles itſelf a republic, on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The king of England, as elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Hanover, has, however, ſome important rights within the place; and not only the cathedral belongs to him, but a conſiderable number of buildings, public and private. He poſſeſſes, likewiſe, a ſpecies of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judicatorial power, as, though the magiſtrates take cognizance of all crimes within the territory of Bremen, his delegate or bailiff muſt pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. The fortifications though kept in very good order, are of no conſequence or ſtrength. The ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt army in the field is ever maſter; and during the laſt war, French or Engliſh were alternately received into the place, as they appeared before it.</p>

This excluſion has given riſe to a ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtic remark on the inhabitants themſelves, which, whether juſt or not, I am no judge. Hamburg has adopted a contrary policy, and admits indiſcriminately theſe people, with European nations. In a lucrative view, I know not which may be the wiſeſt meaſure, but certainly the latter is the moſt generous, and breathes a greater philanthropy. If every government barred its gates to theſe wanderers of Paleſtine, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy labouring under the curſe of diſperſion without leaders, without political ſtrength, where muſt they fly for aſylum?

The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, indeed, might be ſomewhat different, though it has always ſeemed to me, as if the intrinſic value of the firſt calf conſtituted the moſt adorable part of his divinity in the opinion of his worſhippers; elſe why did not Aaron make him of braſs at once?</p>

The moſt polite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpending an evening known for ſeveral centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries paſt in Bremen, has been that of meeting in ſmall-boxes about twenty feet long and fix wide, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic cellar, where they drink hock under a cloud of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     <p>WHILE I was changing horſes, I was peculiarly ſtricken with the ſingular impatience of a paſſenger for the departure of the diligence. I obſerved him to intreat his companions, with a gentleneſs and elegant courteſy, to haſten the ſame; then he flew to the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, to give his commands to the driver, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the driver himſelf, then to the ſtable to ſee if the horſes were harneſſed; then to the gateway biting his nails, and walking backwards, and forward, much agitated. His countenance was urgently thoughtful; his complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion livid; his eyes ſunk into his head, and over-arched with a large circular and black brow; his look altogether ſeemed hagged through fatigue, and an inward dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which preyed upon him. I judged him to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five and thirty years of age. He was genteel; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the common in his manner, but very negligently attired. In ſhort, his appearance touched me home, and awakened my curioſity.</p>
                     <p>Mon Dieu! cried the Flemiſh Whip, that there was a little more patience in the world.—It would
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031692_0178_0FEE0ED98E7FDE48"/>
be a ſix ſous out of your pocket, if there was, I thought within myſelf; for I obſerved the impatient paſſenger to give him that little ſum, as a ſtimulus to accelerate his motions.</p>
                     <p>A difficulty aroſe, which increaſed the paſſenger's impatience beyond all bounds. He was almoſt mad with diſappointment; for as the diligence was prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet off, a female paſſenger was unfortunately miſſing, who, having ſome buſineſs in the own, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented herſelf till the uſual time of its departure; and now the driver declared that it was impoſſible to ſet off before the clock ſtruck a certain hour, the ſtated time for its departure, unleſs Madame arrived.</p>
                     <p>My barouche was, at this inſtant, drawing up to the door; and as curioſity was fermenting juſt as ſtrong in me as impatience in the paſſenger, I offered him a feat in it; concluding, Ghent was his next ſtation.</p>
                     <p>There was a polite gratitude in the manner with which he accompanied his ſimple thanks; and he flew like an arrow to the diligence, ſnatching out of it a ſmall valiſe.

Though there are no magnificent houſes in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, moſt of them being built only one, and none more than two ſtories; yet they take up a large extent of ground, many of them having ſquare courts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their walls.</p>
                     <p>They have all ſuch a regard to privacy, that no windows are made towards the ſtreets, but in ſhops and places of pulic buſineſs. None of their windows look towards thoſe of their neighbours. Within the gate or entry of each houſe, a ſcreen is placed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſtrangers from looking in upon the opening of the gate; and you enter the houſe either on the right or left ſide of the middle ſcreen, where there are little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys to the right and left, from whence you paſs into the ſeveral courts, which are walled on all ſides.</p>
                     <p>Their entertainments are held in a ſort of hall at the entrance of their houſes, which have no other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſides a ſingle order of painted columns which ſupport the building. The roofs are open to the tiles, without any ceiling. In theſe they uſe no looking-glaſſes, hangings, or fine chairs; and their beds, which are the principal ornaments of their houſe, are ſeldom ſeen by ſtrangers, who are not permitted to go farther than the firſt great hall. The Chineſe, who keep ſhops, were leſs reſerved, and would frequently invite us to their houſes with great freedom, as they obſerved it would be agreeable to us.</p>

The furniture of the beſt houſes is cabinets, tables, painted ſcreens, china, pictures, and pieces of white taffety upon the walls, upon which are written in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe characters, religious and moral ſentences.</p>
                     <p>They have no chimneys; but in their ſtead, they place a ſhallow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

They have a copper built in brick-work in their kitchen for boiling, much about the heighth of our Engliſh ſtoves.</p>
                     <p>The inſides of their houſes are never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     <p>The windows are made of cane or rattan. In winter they cut oyſter-ſhells into diamond-ſhapes, and ſet them in wooden frames, which afford but a very dull light.</p>
                     <p>The ſhops of thoſe that deal in ſilk are very neat, make a fine ſhow, and are all in one place; for tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or dealers in one kind of goods, herd together in the ſame ſtreet. For this reaſon, you may hear the Engliſh ſailors talking of the ſtreets of Canton, as if they were ſpeaking of London, or ſome other Engliſh city. The ſtreets where the china-ſhops are, they call China-row; the ſtreets where clothes are fold, they call Monmouth-ſtreet; that narrow ſtreet where men's caps, ſhoes, &amp;c. are ſold, is well known by the name of Mandarine Cap-alley; and a narrow paſſage cloſe

by the city-wall, where lapidary and glaſs-work are ſold, is called Stone-cutters alley; and ſo of many oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The ſhops have counters, drawers, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, much like our own; and there are few of the merchants but have a perſon who can ſpeak broken Engliſh or Portugueſe. So that French, Dutch, and Danes, are obliged to ſpeak either the one or the other when they traffic with them.</p>
                     <p>There are great numbers of market-places for fiſh, fleſh, poultry, garden herbs, and all proviſions. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is ſold cheap. Fiſhmongers keep their fiſhes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I have ſeen the fiſhermen take great numbers of different fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the ditch on the eaſt ſide of the city-wall, where a multitude of ſmall boats or ſampans are continually plying. The ditch goes quite round the city, and ſome ſmall canals run in it; and as it has a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the river Ta, it is of great advantage to the city.</p>
                     <p>I was very much ſurpriſed at firſt, to ſee dogs, cats, rats, frogs, &amp;c. in their market-places for ſale. But I ſoon found that they made no ſcruple of eating any ſort of meat, and have as good an appetite for that which died in a ditch, as that which was killed by a butcher.</p>

                     <p>The rats, ſome of which are of a monſtrous ſize, were very fat, and commonly hung up with the ſkin upon them, on nails at the poſts of the market-place.</p>
                     <p>Frogs, which are the greateſt dainty here, are ſold very dear. They are black and loathſome to an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean eye; but the Chineſe ſay they have a very fine taſte. The rats, they ſay, eat well; and ſnake broth has been in reputation there, long before it was known to us. The frogs are ſtrung upon a rod in the ſame manner as we do fiſh in England.</p>

                     <p>In the ſtreets of Canton, we often meet with blind beggars, of both ſexes, a diſeaſe which ſome imagine is the conſequence of their living ſo much on rice; but I rather think it may be occaſioned by the hot winds which blow here at certain ſeaſons. They are indeed miſerable objects, and commonly go naked, excepting a trouſer or cloth over their middle. They go ſometimes in companies, and are ſure to plague and follow the Europeans; becauſe from one of them they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As it is natural for Europeans to let flip no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing the fair ſex, and as the women there are kept ſo very private, that many of us have made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral voyages thither, without having ſeen a woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the loweſt rank, we were now and then induced, on proper occaſions, to pry into the moſt retired and unfrequented places, where we imagined the females might be leſs upon their guard; as few Europeans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

curioſity was ſeldom entirely diſappointed. Sometimes we would pop in upon a percel of young boys and girls, attended by their nurſes, who were all ſo affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the fight of Fanquay, as they called us, that they would ſcream aloud, run into their houſes, and, by the noiſe, alarm the whole ſtreet. As I have obſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that they have no windows to the ſtreet, and have a ſcreen of ſplit cane before the door of each houſe, we could not ſee them, though they could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee us through that lattice: we could only very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly perceive them peeping at us, and pointing to us withinſide the ſcreen.</p>
                     <p>Now and then, on turning a corner, or entering a private ſtreet, all of a ſudden we found ourſelves in the midſt of a company of young ladies converſing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

diſtance from their houſes; and as their feet are ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that they cannot walk or run, but rather trip or hobble along, and are often obliged to aſſiſt themſelves by laying hold of the wall as they move along; this gave us an opportunity of gazing upon them attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on theſe occaſions. They ſeemed ſo affrighted, and walked ſo awkwardly, that we were glad to retire, leſt we ſhould have made them ſtumble and fall, for which we ſhould certainly have been bamboo'd.</p>
                     <p>The complexion of the ladies is exceedingly fair, their hair of the fineſt black, dreſſed up with gold and ſilver bodkins, adorned with flowers. Their ſhape is exquiſitely fine, and their dreſſes the moſt becoming, natural, eaſy and ſplendid of any I ever ſaw.</p>
                     <p>It is reckoned, that there are in the city and ſuburbs of Canton 1,200,000 people; and you will ſcarce find a day in the whole year, but there are 5000 trading veſſels lying before the city.</p>
                     <p>The temples and places of public worſhip are the moſt magnificent buildings in Canton. They are well filled with images. The people pay profound adoration to them, by falling down on their knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, wringing their hands, and beating their foreheads againſt the ground.

ſuburbs, makes a ſplendid appearance. It is four ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries high, has a fine cupola, with many out-houſes and galleries. The lower part of it is built with fine hewn ſtone, but the upper part is all of timber. We went firſt into the lower hall, where we ſaw images of all ſizes, of different dignities, and finely gilded, and kept exceedingly clean by the prieſts. The leſſer images, were placed in corners of the wall, and one of a larger ſize in the middle of the hall. The large god, who is placed in the center, ſits in a lazy poſture, almoſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and leaning on a large cuſhion. He is ten times larger than an ordinary man, very corpulent, of a merry countenance, and gilt all over. We were next conducted up ſtairs, where we ſaw a great many ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of men and women; who had been deified for their brave and virtuous actions.</p>
                     <p>Though Canton is but twenty-four degrees from the equator, and is ſcorching hot in ſummer, yet about the months of December and January, it is ſubject to high winds and very heavy rains. The ſudden alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which the climate then undergoes, is very ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. At this time the people of China take to their winter dreſs, which is lined with furs, or quilted cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Inſtead of wearing fans, which are uſed by men, women, and children, in hot weather, they hold a live quail in their hands to keep them warm, and have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

hands. Thus equipped, they walk ſo ſtiff, and ſhrug up their ſhoulders ſo much, that one would think they were freezing to death.</p>
                     <p>The river Ta at Canton is ſomewhat broader than the Thames at London. But the crowds of ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that ply the Ta, are vaſtly more numerous. For the ſpace of four or five miles oppoſite the city of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, you have an extenſive wooden town of large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and boats, ſtowed ſo cloſely, that there is ſcarcely room for a large boat to paſs. They are generally drawn up in ranks, with a narrow paſſage left for veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to paſs and repaſs. Some of them are large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of eight or nine hundred tons burden, called jonks, with which they perform their foreign voyages. Here are alſo an incredible number of ſmall boats, in which poor families live all their life long, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver putting a foot on ſhore. In theſe they keep dogs, cats, hogs, geeſe, and other domeſtic animals, both for ſubſiſtence and ſale. There is nothing ſimilar to this in Europe; for the people in this country are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly numerous, that vaſt numbers of families are obliged to betake themſelves to boats on the river, for want of room, or the means of ſubſiſtence on land, where almoſt every habitable ſpot is occupied. Theſe boats are very conveniently built, with arched covers and tilts made of ſolid wood, or bamboo or caian leaves, ſo high, that the people can walk upright un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <p>AMONGST the ſeveral models and plans of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments which the ancients framed, we ſhall perhaps meet with none ſo perfect and exact as is that of the Chineſe monarchy. The ancient lawgivers of this potent empire formed it in their days very little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from what it is in ours. Other ſtates, according to the common fate of the things of this world, are ſenſible of the weakneſs of infancy; are born miſsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and imperfect; and like men, they owe their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and maturity to time. China ſeems more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the common laws of nature; and as though the Supreme being himſelf had founded their empire, the plan of their government was not a whit leſs perfect in its cradle, than it is now after the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and trial of four thouſand years.</p>

During all which time the Chineſe had never ſo much as heard of the name of a Republic; and when lately, on the arrival of the Hollanders, they heard of it, it ſeemed ſo ſtrange to them, that they have ſcarcely yet done admiring at it. Nothing could make them underſtand how a ſtate could regularly be governed without a king. They looked upon a republic to be a monſter with many heads, formed by the ambition, headineſs, and corrupt inclination of men in times of public diſorder and confuſion.</p>
                     <p>As they bear an averſion to republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo they are yet more ſet againſt tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which they ſay proceeds not from the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of the prince's power, but from his wildneſs, which neither the voice of nature, nor the laws of God can ever countenance. The Chineſe are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the obligation which is laid on their kings not to abuſe their power, is rather a mean to confirm and eſtabliſh them, than to occaſion their ruin; and that this uſeful conſtraint, which they themſelve lay on their paſſions, does not more diminiſh their power or authority here on earth, than the like conſtraint derogates from the majeſty and power of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who is not the leſs powerful becauſe he cannot do evil.</p>
                     <p>An unbounded authority which the laws give the Emperor, and the neceſſity which the ſame lay upon
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031692_0199_0FEE0F2B0CA71708"/>
him to uſe that authority with moderation and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are the two props which have for ſo many ages ſupported this great fabric of the Chineſe monarchy. The firſt principle, therefore, that is inſtilled into the people, is to reſpect their prince with ſo high a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration as almoſt to adore him. They ſtile him the ſon of heaven, and the only maſter of the world. His commands are indiſputable. His words carry no leſs authority with them than if they were oracles. In ſhort, every thing that comes from him is ſacred. He is ſeldom ſeen, and never ſpoken to but on the knees. The grandees of the court, the princes of the blood, nay, his own brothers bow to the ground, not only when he is preſent, but even before the throne; and there are ſet days every week or month, on which the nobility aſſemble, who meet in one of the courts of the palace to acknowledge the authority of their prince, by their moſt ſubmiſſive adorations, though he, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be not there in perſon.</p>
                     <p>When he is ill, the palace is full of Mandarines of every òrder, who ſpend night and day, in a large court, in habits proper for the occaſion, to expreſs their own grief, and to aſk of heaven their prince's cure. Rain, ſnow, cold, or any other inconveniencies, excuſe them not from the performance of this duty; and as long as the Emperor is in pain, or in danger, any one that ſaw the people would think that they feared nothing but the loſs of him.</p>

The towns of China are generally divided into four parts, and thoſe again into ſeveral ſmaller diviſions, each of which contains ten houſes, over every one of which ſubdiviſions an officer preſides, who takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every thing which paſſes in his little ward, tells the Mandarine what contentions or extraordinary things happen, and what ſtrangers come thither or go thence. The neighbourhood is obliged to give mutual aſſiſtance, and in caſe of any alarm to lend one anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a helping hand; for if any theft or robbery is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted during the night, the neighbourhood muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards repairing the loſs.

                     <p>The gates of the cities are well looked after, and even in time of peace are ſhut up at the approach of night. In the day time there are guards to examine all who come in. When they obſerve any thing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or ſuſpicious, they take the perſon up, or inform the Mandarine of it. So that European miſſionaries, whoſe aſpect is infinitely different from that of the Chineſe, are known at firſt ſight; and thoſe who have not the Emperor's approbation, find it very difficult to make a long journey.</p>
                     <p>In certain places, as at Pekin, as ſoon as night comes on, they tie chains a-croſs the ſtreets: the guards go the patrole up and down the principal ſtreets, and

                        </gap>uſquerades, and balls, and ſuch like night works, are good, ſay the Chineſe, for none but thieves and the mob. Orderly people ought, at that time, either to ſit up providing for their family, or elſe to take their reſt, that they may be refreſhed, and better able the next day to manage the buſineſs of the family.</p>
                     <p>Gaming is forbidden both to the common people and the gentry. This, however, does not hinder the Chineſe from playing, ſometimes even ſo long, as till they had loſt all their eſtates, their houſes, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and their wives, which they ſometimes hazard upon a card; for there is no degree of extravagance to which the deſire of lucre and riches will not carry a Chineſe.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſaid concerning wives, that their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands may fell them, or loſe them at play, puts me in mind to give ſome account of the rules which their civil conſtitution, rather than their religion, has ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning marriages. Thoſe who have a mind to marry, do not, as among us, follow their own fancies in the choice of a wiſe. They never ſee the women they are to have, but take her parents' word in the caſe; or elſe they have their information from ſome old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ſeldom give a juſt deſcription of her whom they go to view.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="unknown:031692_0202_0FED37AFC5824F10"/>
The woman's parents generally give money to theſe emiſſaries, to oblige them to give a favourable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is for the advantage of the parents that their daughter ſhould be reputed handſome, witty, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel; becauſe the Chineſe buy their wives, and, as in other merchandiſe, they give more or leſs according to the good or bad properties of them.</p>
                     <p>When the parties are agreed about the price, the contract is made, and the money paid down. Then preparation is made on both ſides for the nuptial ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities. When the day of marriage is come, they carry the bride in a ſumtuous chair, before which go hautboys, drums and fifes, and after it follow her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and other particular friends of her family. All the portion which ſhe brings, is her marriage-garments, ſome clothes and houſehold goods, which her father preſents her with. The bridegroom ſtands at his door richly attired, waiting for her. He himſelf opens the ſedan, which is cloſely ſhut; and having conducted her into a chamber, delivers her to ſeveral women, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thither for that purpoſe, who ſpend there the day together in feaſting and ſporting, while the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in another room entertains his friends acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>This being the firſt time that the bride and bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſee each other, and one, or both, perhaps, not liking their bargain, it is frequently a day of rejoicing
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:031692_0203_0FED37EC1A2661B8"/>
for their gueſts, but of ſorrow for themſelves. The women muſt ſubmit, though they do not like, becauſe their parents have ſold them; but the huſbands ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are not ſo complaiſant; for there have been ſome, who when they firſt opened the ſedan to receive the bride, repulſed by her ſhape and aſpect, have ſhut the chair, and ſent her and her parents and friends back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, willing rather to loſe their money than enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo bad a purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>Although a man be allowed but one wife, he may have as many concubines as he pleaſes. All the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have an equal claim to the eſtate, becauſe they are reckoned as the children of the wife, even though they be thoſe of the concubines. They all call the wife mother, who is indeed ſole miſtreſs of the houſe. The concubines ſerve and honour her, and have no manner of authority or power but what they derive from her.</p>
                     <p>The Chineſe think it a ſtrange thing that the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not allowed to have concubines; yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it is a commendable ſign of moderation in them. But when we obſerved to them the troubles, quarrels, contentions, and jealouſies which many women muſt needs occaſion in a family, they ſay that there was no ſtate without ſome inconvenience; but that perhaps there were more croſſes in having but one, than in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many women. The beſt way, they owned, was to have none at all.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XXXIII. OF CONFUCIOUS.</head>
                     <p>THIS celebrated Chineſe philoſopher was born in the kingdom of Lou, which is at preſent in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Chan, 551 years before the birth of Chriſt. He was contemporary with Pythagoras, and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Socrates. He was but three years old when he loſt his father, who had enjoyed the higheſt offices of the kingdom of Long.</p>
                     <p>Confucius did not grow in knowledge by degrees, as children uſually do, but ſeemed to arrive at reaſon and the perfection of his faculties almoſt from his infancy.</p>
                     <p>He took no delight in playing, running about, and ſuch amuſements as were proper for his age. He had a grave and ſerious deportment, which gained him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and plainly foretold what he would one day be. But what diſtinguiſhed him moſt was his unexampled and exalted piety. He honoured his relations; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in all things to imitate his grandfather, who was then alive in China, and a moſt holy man. And it was obſervable, that he never ate any thing but he proſtrated himſelf on the ground, and offered it firſt to the ſupreme Lord of heaven.</p>
                     <p>One day, while he was a child he heard his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father fetch a deep ſigh; and going up to him with
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:031692_0205_0FED38AC9E198D18"/>
much reverence, "May I preſume," ſays he, "with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing the reſpect I owe you, to enquire into the occaſion of your grief? Perhaps you fear that your poſterity ſhould degenerate from your virtue, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour you by their vices." What put this thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your head, ſays his grandfather to him; and where have you learnt to ſpeak in this manner? "From yourſelf," replied Confucius. "I attend diligently to you every time you ſpeak; and I have often heard you ſay, that a ſon, who does not by his virtue ſupport the glory of his anceſtors, does not deſerve to bear their name."</p>
                     <p>After his grandfather's death, Confucius applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Teem-ſe, a celebrated doctor of his time; and under the direction of ſo great a maſter, he ſoon made a vaſt progreſs into antiquity, which he conſidered as the ſource, from whence all genuine knowledge was to be drawn. This love of the ancients very nearly coſt him his life, when he was no more than ſixteen years of age. Falling into diſcourſe one day about the Chineſe books with a perſon of high quality, who thought them obſcure, and not worth the pains of ſearching into; "The books you deſpiſe, ſays Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucius are full of profound knowledge, which is not to be attained but by the wiſe and learned; and the people would think cheaply of them, could they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them of themſelves. This ſubordination of
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:031692_0206_0FEE0F2C969EB9C8"/>
ſpirits, by which the ignorant are dependent upon the knowing, is very uſeful, and even neceſſary to ſociety. Were all families equally rich, and equally powerful, there could not ſubſiſt any form of government; but there would happen a yet ſtranger diſorder, if all men were equally knowing; for then every one would be for governing, and none would think themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obey. Some time ago, added Confucius, an ordinary fellow made the ſame obſervation to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the books as you have done; and from ſuch a one indeed nothing better could be expected; but I admire that you, a doctor, ſhould thus be found ſpeaking like one of the loweſt of the people.</p>
                     <p>This rebuke had indeed the good effect of ſilencing the Mandarine, and bringing him to a better opinion of the learning of his country; yet it vexed him ſo at the ſame time, as it came from almoſt a boy, that he would have revenged it by violence, if he had not been prevented.</p>
                     <p>At the age of nineteen years Confucius took a wife, who brought him a ſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Tſou-tſe, who, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his father, applied himſelf entirely to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of wiſdom, and by his merit arrived to the higheſt offices of the empire. Confucius was content with his wife only, ſo long as ſhe lived with him; and never kept any concubines, as the cuſtom of his country would have allowed him to have done, becauſe he thought
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:031692_0207_0FEE0F2E21C1A9A0"/>
it contrary to the law of nature. I ſay, ſo long as ſhe lived with him; for it ſeems he divorced her after ſome time, and for no other reaſon, ſay the Chineſe, but that he migh be free from all incumbrances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, and at liberty to propogate his philoſophy throughout the empire. At the age of twenty-three, when he had gained a conſiderable knowledge of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and acquainted himſelf with the laws and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of his country, he began to project a ſcheme for a general reformation; for then every province of the empire was a diſtinct kingdom, which had its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar laws and was governed by a prince.</p>
                     <p>To ſay the truth, all the little kingdoms depended upon the emperor; but it often happened that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial authority was not able to keep them within the bounds of their duty. Every one of theſe kings was maſter in his dominions. They levied taxes, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed tributes, diſpoſed of dignities and offices, declared war againſt their neighbours when they thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſometimes became formidable to the emperor himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Confucius, wiſely perſuaded that the people could never be happy, ſo long as avarice, ambition, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and falſe policy ſhould reign in this manner, reſolved to preach up a ſevere morality; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he began to enforce temperance, juſtice, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er virtues, to enſpire a contempt of riches and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:031692_0208_0FEE0F374DFB1230"/>
pomp, to excite to magnanimity and a greatneſs of, ſoul, which ſhould make men incapable of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inſincerity: and to uſe all the means he could think of, to redeem his countrymen from a life of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to a life of reaſon. He was every where known, and as much beloved. His extreme knowledge and great wiſdom ſoon made him known; his integrity, and the ſplendor of his virtues made him beloved. Kings were governed by his wiſdom, and the people reverenced him as a ſaint. He was offered ſeveral high offices in the magiſtracy which he ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; but never from a motive of ambition, which he was not at all concerned to gratify, but always with a view of reforming a corrupt ſtate, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mankind: for he never failed to reſign thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as ſoon as he perceived that he could be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger uſeful in them. Thus, for inſtance, he was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a conſiderable place of truſt in the kingdom of Lou, his own native country; where he had not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his charge above three months, when the court and provinces, through his counſels and management, were become quite another thing. He corrected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny frauds and abuſes in the mercantile way, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the weights and meaſures to their proper ſtandard. He inculcated fidelity and candour among the men, and exhorted the women to chaſtity and ſimplicity of manners. By ſuch methods he wrought a general
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031692_0209_0FEE0F3C7909E9D8"/>
reformation, and eſtabliſhed every where ſuch con cord and unanimity, that the whole kingdom ſeemed as if it were but one great family.</p>
                     <p>The neighbouring princes began to be jealous. They eaſily perceived, that a king, under the counſels of ſuch a man as Confucius, would quickly render himſelf too powerful; ſince noting can make a ſtate flouriſh more than good order among the members, and an exact obſervance of its laws. Alarmed at this, the king of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> aſſembled his miniſters to conſider of methods, which might put a ſtop to the career of this new government; and after ſome deliberations the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing expedient was reſolved upon. They got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a great number of young girls, of extraordinary beauty, who had been inſtructed from their infancy in ſinging and dancing, and were perfect miſtreſſes of all thoſe charms and accompliſhments, which might pleaſe and captivate the heart. Theſe, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of an embaſſy, they preſented to the king of Lou, and to the grandees of his court. The preſent was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received, and had its deſired effect. The arts of good government were immediately neglected, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was thought of, but inventing new pleaſures for the entertainment of the fair ſtrangers. In ſhort, nothing was regarded for ſome months, but feaſting, dancing, ſhows, &amp;c. and the court was entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in luxury and pleaſure. Confucius had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:031692_0210_0FEE0F3E09700BD0"/>
all this, and endeavoured to prevent it by advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the refuſal of the preſent; and he now laboured to take off the deluſion they were fallen into, and to bring men back to reaſon and their duty. But all his endeavours proved ineffectual. There was nothing to be done; and the ſeverity of the philoſopher, whether he would or no, was obliged to give way to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing faſhion of the court. Upon which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quitted his employment, becoming an exile at the ſame time from his native country, to try, if he could find in other kingdoms, minds and diſpoſitions more fit to reliſh and purſue his maxims.</p>
                     <p>He paſſed through the kingdoms of Tſi, Guci, and Tſom, but met with inſurmountable difficulties every where. He had the misfortune to live in times, when rebellion, wars, and tumults raged throughout the empire. Men had no time to liſten to his philoſophy. They had even leſs inclination to do it; for as we have ſaid, they were ambitious, avaricious, and voluptuous. Hence be often met with ill treatment and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful language, and it is ſaid, that conſpiracies were formed againſt his life; to which may be added, that his neglect of his own intereſts had reduced him to the extremeſt poverty. Some philoſophers among his contemporaries were ſo effected with the terrible ſtate of things, that they had ruſticated themſelves into the mountains and deſerts, as the only places where happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:031692_0211_0FEE0F3F93DF5B48"/>
could be found; and would have perſuaded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucius to follow them. But, "I am a man, ſays Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucius, and cannot exclude myſelf from the ſociety of men, and conſort with boaſts. Bad as the times are, I ſhall do all that I can to recal men to virtue; for in virtue are all things, and if mankind would but once imbrace it, and ſubmit themſelves to its diſcipline and laws, they would not want me nor any body elſe to inſtruct them. It is the duty of a good man, firſt to perfect himſelf, and then to perfect others. Human nature, ſaid he, came to us from heaven pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but in proceſs of time, ignorance, the paſſions, and evil examples, have corrupted it. All conſiſts in reſtoring it to its primative beauty: and to be perfect, we muſt re-aſcend to that point, from whence we have fallen. Obey heaven, and follow the orders of, him who governs it. Love your neighbour as yourſelf. Let your reaſon, and not your ſenſes, be the rule of your conduct; for reaſon will teach you to think wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſpeak prudently, and to behave yourſelf worthily on all occaſions."</p>
                     <p>Confucius in the mean time, though he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf from kings and palaces, did not ceaſe to travel about, and do what good he could among the people, and among mankind in general. He ſent ſix hundred of his diſciples into different parts of the empire, to reform the manners of the people; and not
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:031692_0212_0FEE0F49BA386758"/>
ſatisfied with benefiting his own country only, he made frequent reſolutions to paſs the ſeas, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his doctrine to the fartheſt part of the world. Hardly any thing can be added to the purity of his morality. He ſeems rather to ſpeak like a doctor of a revealed law, than like a man who had no light, but what the law of nature afforded him: and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces us of his ſincerity is, that he taught as forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by example as by precept. In ſhort, his gravity and ſobriety, his rigorous abſtinence, his contempt of riches and what are commonly called the goods of this life, his continual attention and watchfulneſs over his actions, and above all that modeſty and humility, which are not to be found among the Grecian ſages; all theſe, I ſay, would almoſt tempt one to believe, that he was not a more philoſopher formed by reaſon only, but a man inſpired by God for the reformation of the world, and to check that torrent of idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, which was going to overſpread that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part of it.</p>
                     <p>Confucius is ſaid to have lived in retirement three years, and to have ſpent the latter part of his life in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. A few days before, his laſt illneſs, he told his diſciples with tears in his eyes, that he was overcome, with grief at the ſight of the diſorders, which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the empire. "The mountain, ſaid he, is fallen; the high machine is demolliſhed, and the ſages are all
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:031692_0213_0FEE0F4B4B72DCC8"/>
ſled." His meaning was, that the edifice of perfection, which he had endeavoured to raiſe, was entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. He began to languiſh from that time, and on the ſeventh day before his death, "The kings, ſaid he, reject my maxims; and ſince I am no longer uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on the earth, I may as well leave it." After theſe words he fell into a lethargy, and at the end of ſeven days expired in the arms of his diſciples, in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-third year of his age. Upon the firſt hearing of his death, the king of Lou could not refrain from tears: "The Tien is not ſatisfied with me, cried he, as Confucius is taken away from me." In reality, wiſe men are precious gifts, with which heaven bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the earth; and their worth is never ſo well known till they are taken away. Confucius was lamented by the whole empire, which from that very moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to honour him as a ſaint; and eſtabliſhed ſuch a veneration for his memory, as will probably laſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in thoſe parts of the world. Kings have built palaces for him in all the provinces, whither the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed go at certain times to pay him homage. There are to be ſeen upon ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Confucius did not altogether truſt to the memory of his diſciples for the preſervation of his philoſophy,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:031692_0214_0FEE0F51414E4250"/>
but committed the ſubſtance of it to writing. His books are four in number. The firſt is entitled, "Ta Hio the Grand Science, or the School of the Adults." It is this that beginners ought to ſtudy, firſt, becauſe it is, as it were, the porch of the temple of wiſdom and virtue. It treats of the care we ought to take in governing ourſelves, that we may be able afterwards to govern others. The ſecond book is called, "Tchong Young, or the Immutable Mean;" and treats of the means which ought to be obſerved in all things. The third book, "Yun Lu, or the Book of Maxims," is a collection of ſententious and moral diſcourſes; and the fourth book gives an idea of a perfect govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They who would have a perfect knowledge of all theſe works, will find it in the Latin of father Noel, one of the moſt ancient miſſionaries of China, which was printed at Prague in the year 1711.</p>

                     <p>IT is remarkable that the manners of the modern differ not much from thoſe of the ancient Chineſe. Pliny ſays "that ſilk originally came from China; that the Chineſe, whom he called Seres, (from which name is derived the Roman word <hi>ſericum,</hi> ſilk) like wild animals, induſtriouſly ſhunned any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with ſtrangers; and that they were of mild diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions." They are at this day courteous and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but will not ſuffer merchants of other nations to penetrate into their country.</p>
                     <p>How admirable are their political maxims! They demonſtrate by experience, that from the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the ground the true riches and proſperity of a country ariſe. By the aſſiduous cultivation of every inch of ground, they are enabled to maintain an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing multitude of people, who are ſaid to be more in number than all the inhabitants of Europe. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that in China there are ſeventy millions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though it does not ſeem to be more than three times the ſize of great Britain, which does not contain above ſeven or eight millions. How great a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:031692_0216_0FEE0F5629897BE0"/>
do we find with reſpect to the number of inhabitants of theſe two countries! And indeed, if we caſt our eyes upon any neglected country, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the Highlands of Scotland, we ſhall always ſee few inhabitants and even thoſe diſtreſſed and poor. Their circumſtances would not be much happier, if they even had the rich metals of Peru, whilſt they idly refuſe to till the earth, which always gratefully rewards the toil of the huſbandman.

                     <p>The Chineſe language bears no affinity to any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, dead or living, with which we are acquainted. All other languages have an alphabet compoſed of a certain number of letters, by the various combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which, ſyllables and words are formed. Whereas there is no alphabet of the Chineſe language; but there are as many different characters and figures as words. The number of Chineſe characters is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be about 80,000. A perſon, however, that underſtands 10,000 characters is able to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this language, and to underſtand many books. Moſt of the learned do not underſtand above 15,000 or 20,000; and but few doctors are maſters of 40,000,</p>
                     <p>A dictionary was compiled, by order of the late em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, conſiſting of one hundred and nineteen vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:031692_0217_0FEE0F5CB04FFF08"/>
moſt of them written in a ſmall character, and very thick. It is certain that no language in the world is more copius than the Chineſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſe of the Chineſe language is very much varied by the different accents, inflections, tones, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations, and other changes of the voice; hence it is, that perſons, who are not exceedingly well verſed in this language, often miſtake one word for another. Of this father du Halde gives ſome examples; ſuch as that the world Tchu, when differently ſounded, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a lord, or maſter, a hog, a kitchen, or a column. In like manner the ſyllable Po, has, according as it is ſounded, the following different meanings; glaſs, wiſe, liberal, to prepare, an old woman, to break, to cleave, inclined, a very little, to water, a ſlave, a captive, to boil, to winnow rice. Likewiſe the ſame word join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others is capable of a variety of ſenſes. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Mou or Moo, when ſingle, ſignifies, a tree or wood; but when compounded, it has many more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications; Moo ſiang, ſignifying a cheſt of drawers; Moo nu, a kind of ſmall orange, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In this manner the Chineſe, by variouſly combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their monoſyllables, can form regular diſcourſes, and expreſs themſelves with clearneſs and elegance, almoſt in the ſame manner as the Europeans compoſe all their words by the different combinations of about twenty-four letters.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XXXV. OF THE TEA-PLANT.</head>
                     <p>OF all the vegetable productions of China, the tea-plant is the moſt valuable. The ſhrub, which ſeems to be a ſpecies of myrtle, ſeldom grows beyond the ſize of a roſe-buſh, or at moſt ſix or ſeven feet in heighth, though ſome have extended it to an hundred. It ſucceeds beſt in a gravelly ſoil, and is uſually plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in rows upon little hills, about three or four feet diſtant from each other. Its leaves are about an inch and an half long, narrow, tapering to the point, and indented like our roſe or ſweet-briar leaves, and its flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are much like thoſe of the latter. The ſhrub is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergreen, and bears a ſmall fruit which contains ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral round blackiſh ſeeds, about the bigneſs of a large pea; but ſcarce above one in an hundred comes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. By theſe ſeeds the plant is propagated, nine or ten of them being put into a hole together; and the ſhrubs thence ariſing are afterwards tranſplanted into proper ground. They thrive beſt when expoſed to the ſouth-ſun, and yield the beſt tea; but there is a ſort that grows without any cultivation, which, though leſs valuable, often ſerves the poorer ſort of people.</p>
                     <p>The Chineſe know nothing of imperial tea, and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral other names which in Europe ſerve to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:031692_0219_0FEE0F6364D44C88"/>
the goodneſs and price of this faſhionable commodity. In truth, tho' there be various kinds of tea, they are now generally allowed to be the produce of the ſame plant, only differing in the colour, fragrancy, &amp;c. according to the difference of ſoil, the time of gathering it, and the method of preparation. Bohi or Bohea tea, is ſo called, not from the mountains of Bokein, where the beſt of that ſort is ſaid to grow, but from its dark and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour. This chiefly differs from the green tea, by its being gathered ſix or ſeven weeks ſooner, that is in March or April, according as the ſeaſon proves, when the plant is in full bloom, and the leaves full of juice; whereas the other, by being left ſo much the longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tree, loſes a great part of its juice, and contracts a different colour, taſte, and virtue.</p>
                     <p>The green tea is moſt valued and uſed in China; and the Bohea ſeems not to have been known there till about the concluſion of the fifteenth century; for a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Hollander, who was phyſician and botaniſt to the emperor of Japan at that period, tells us that he had heard of the Bohi or black tea being come into vogue in China; but upon the ſtricteſt ſearch he could make, could find no ſuch thing, and therefore believed it was a falſe report. This makes it probable, that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally they gathered all the tea at the ſame time, but that, ſince the diſcovery of the ſmoothneſs and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the more juicy Bohea, they have carried on
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:031692_0220_0FEE0F64F04A0B98"/>
the experiments ſtill farther, by gathering it at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeaſons.</p>
                     <p>As to the manner of curing the tea, the Bohea is firſt dried in the ſhade, and afterwards expoſed to the heat of the ſun, or over a ſlow fire, in earthern pans, till it is convolved or ſhrivelled up (as we ſee it) into a ſmall compaſs. The other ſorts are commonly criſped and dried as ſoon as gathered; though according to Dr. Cunninham, the Bohea is dried in the ſhade, and the green in pans over the fire.</p>
                     <p>It is very rare to find tea perfectly pure, the Chineſe generally mixing other leaves with it to encreaſe the quantity; though one would think the price is too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate to tempt them to ſuch a cheat, it being uſually ſold amongſt them for three-pence per pound, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for more than nine-pence; ſo that it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the worſt adulterations of it are made by our own retailers.</p>
                     <p>Bohea, if good, is all of a dark colour, criſp and dry, and has a fine ſmell.</p>
                     <p>Green tea is alſo to be choſen by its criſpneſs, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſmell, and light colour with a bluiſh caſt; for it is not good if any of the leaves appear dark or browniſh.</p>
                     <p>As to the properties of tea, they are very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted by our phyſicians; but the Chineſe reckon it an excellent diluter and purifier of the blood, a great ſtrengthener of the brain and ſtomach, a promoter of
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:031692_0221_0FEE0F667B588910"/>
digeſtion, perſpiration, and other ſecretions. They drink large quantities of it in fevers, in ſome ſorts of colics, and other accute diſeaſes; and think it corrects the acrimony of the humours, removes obſtructions of the viſcera, and reſtores decayed ſight. That the gout and ſtone are unknown in China, is aſcribed to the uſe of this plant. Some of the virtues attributed to tea, are undoubtedly imaginary, and it has bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon ſome conſtitutions; but experience ſhows, that ſeveral advantages attend the drinking it with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. It quickens the ſenſes, prevents drowſineſs, corrects the heat of the liver, removes the head-ach, eſpecially that proceeding from a crapula, and being greatly aſtringent, it ſtrengthens the tone of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>

                     <p>IN Europe, women act parts of great conſequnce, and often reign ſovereigns on the world's vaſt theatre: they influence manners and morals, and decide on the moſt important events; the fate of nations is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their hands.

                     <p>Their firſt care is to educate their children, and a numerous poſterity is their moſt fervent wiſh. Moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers always ſuckle their children.

Sometimes the Almai come, to enliven the ſcene with their dance, and effecting recitals, and by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting amorous romances; and at the cloſe of the day there is a repaſt, in which exquiſite fruits and perfumes are ſerved with profuſion.

The Egyptian women receive each other's viſits very affectionately.

                     <p>While a viſitor is in the harem, the huſband muſt not enter; it is the aſylum of hoſpitality, and cannot be violated without fatal conſequences; a cheriſhed right, which the Egyptian women carefully maintain, being intereſted in its preſervation.

                     <p>I AM perſuaded that our phyſicians are under ſome miſtake with regard to this climate. It is certainly one of the warmeſt in Italy; but it is as certainly one of the moſt inconſtant; and from what we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, diſagrees with the greateſt part of our valetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarians; but more particularly with the gouty peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have all found themſelves better at Rome; which, though much colder in winter, is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, a healthier climate. Naples, to be ſure, is more eligible in ſummer, as the air is conſtantly refreſhed by the ſea breeze, when Rome is often ſcorched by the moſt inſupportable heat.</p>
                     <p>We have ſome very agreeable ſociety amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here, though we cannot boaſt much of that with the inhabitants. There are to be ſure many good people among them; but in general, there is ſo very little analogy betwixt an Engliſh and a Neapolitan mind that the true ſocial harmony, that great ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of human life, can ſeldom be produced. In lieu of this, (the exchange you will ſay is but a bad one) the country round Naples abounds ſo much in every thing that is curious, both in nature and art, and affords ſo ample a field of ſpeculation for the naturaliſt and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary,

                     <p>Beſides the diſcoveries of Herculaneum and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia, which of themſelves, afford a great fund of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, the whole coaſt that ſurrounds this beautiful bay, particularly that near Puzzoli, Cuma, Micenum, and Baia, is covered with innumerable monuments of Roman magnificence. But, alas? how are the mighty fallen! This delightful coaſt, once the garden of all Italy, and inhabited only by the rich, the gay, and luxurious, is now abandoned to the pooreſt and moſt miſerable of mortals. Perhaps there is no ſpot on the globe that has undergone ſo through a change, or that can exhibit ſo ſtriking a picture of the vanity of human grandeur. Thoſe very walls that once lodged a Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, a Lucullus, an Anthony, the richeſt and moſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous of mankind, are now occupied by the very meaneſt and moſt indigent wretches on earth, who are actually ſtarving for want in thoſe very apartments that were the ſcenes of the greateſt luxury.

The walls of theſe palaces ſtill remain, and the poor peaſants, in ſome places, have built up their miſerable huts within them; but at preſent, there is not one gentleman or man of fash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſiding in any part of this country: the former ſtate of which, compared with the preſent, certainly makes the moſt ſtriking contraſt imaginable. We rode over the greateſt part of it a-ſhooting porcupines, a new ſpecies of diverſion which I had never heard of before. We killed, ſeveral of theſe animals on the Monte Barbaro, the place which formerly produced the Falernian wine, but now a barren waſte. The novelty of this ſport was to me its greateſt merit; and I would not at any time give a day of patridge for a month of Porcupine ſhooting. Neither, indeed is the fleſh of theſe animals the moſt delicious in the world. It is extremely luſcious, and ſoon palls upon the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
                     <p>The bay of Naples, ſurrounded by the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcenery in the world, deſerves a particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is of a circular figure; in moſt places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of twenty miles in diameter; ſo that includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all its breaks and inequalities, the circumference

is conſiderably more than ſixty miles. The whole of this ſpace is ſo wonderfully diverſified, by all the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es both of art and nature, that there is ſcarce an object wanting to render the ſcene complete; and it is hard to ſay, whether the view is more pleaſing from the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of many of theſe objects, or from the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble variety of the whole. You ſee an amazing mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ancient and modern; ſome riſing to fame, and ſome ſinking to ruin.

It was the ſtudy of this wild and beautiful country that formed our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt land ſcape-painters. This was the ſchool of Pouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, and Salvator Roſa, but more particularly of the laſt, who compoſed many of his moſt celebrated pieces from the bold craggy rocks that ſurround this coaſt; and no doubt it was from the daily contemplation of theſe romantic objects that they ſtored their minds with that veriety of ideas they have communicated to the world with ſuch elegance in their works.</p>
                     <p>Now, ſhould I ſay that this extenſive coaſt, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious variety of mountains, valleys, promontories, and iſlands, covered with an everlaſting verdure, and loaded with the richeſt fruits, is all the produce of ſubteraneous fire; it would require, I am afraid, too great a ſtretch of faith to believe me; yet the fact is certain, and can only be doubted by thoſe who have wanted time or curioſity to examine it. It is ſtrange, one may ſay, that nature ſhould make uſe of the ſame agent to create as to deſtroy; and that what has only

been looked upon as the conſumer of countries, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact the very power that produces them. Indeed, this part of our earth ſeems already to have undergone the ſentence pronounced upon the whole of it; but, like the phoenix, has riſen again from its own aſhes, in much greater beauty and ſplendour than before it was conſumed. The traces of theſe dreadful conflagrations are ſtill conſpicuous in every corner; they have been violent in their operations, but in the end have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſalutary in their effects.

                     <head>SECT. XXXVIII. OF STROMBOLO.</head>
                     <p>THE Lipari Iſlands are very pictureſque, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them ſtill emit ſmoke, particularly Volcano and Volcanello; but none of them, for ſome ages paſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Strombolo, have made any eruptions of fire. It appears to be a Volcano of a very different nature from Veſuvius, the exploſitions of which ſucceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome degree of regularity, and have no great variety of duration. I cannot account for the variety of Strombolo.—Sometimes its exploſions reſemble
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:031692_0240_0FEE0FAC812F9E90"/>
thoſe of Veſuvius, and the light ſeems only to be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the quantity of fiery ſtones thrown into the air; and as ſoon as theſe have fallen down, it appears to be extinguiſhed, till another exploſion cauſes a freſh illumination. This I have obſerved always to be the caſe with Veſuvius, except when the lava has riſen to the ſummit of the mountain, and continued without variety to illuminate the air round it. The light from Strombolo evidently depends on ſome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cauſe. Sometimes a clear red flame iſſues from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of the mountain, and continues to blaze with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, for near the ſpace of half an hour. The fire is of a different colour from the exploſions of ſtones, and is evidently produced from a different cauſe. It would ſeem as if ſome inflammable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance were ſuddenly kindled up in the bowels of the mountain.</p>
                     <p>The crater of Strombolo ſeems to be different from that of Veſuvius, and all the old volcanoes that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded Naples. Of theſe, the craters are without exception in the centre, and from the higheſt part of the mountain. That of Strombolo is on its ſide, and not within two hundred yards of its ſummit. From the crater to the ſea, the iſland is entirely compoſed of the ſame ſort of aſhes and burnt matter as the conical part of Veſuvius; and the quantity of this matter is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually increaſing, from the uninterrupted diſcharge
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:031692_0241_0FEE0FB255A42D28"/>
from the mountain; for of all the volcanos we read of, Strombolo ſeems to be the only one that burns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing. AEtna and Veſuvius often lie quiet for many months, even years, without the leaſt appearance of fire, but Strombolo is ever at work, and for ages paſt has been looked upon as the great light-houſe of theſe ſeas.</p>
                     <p>It is truly wonderful, how ſuch a conſtant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe fire is maintained, for thouſands of years, in the midſt of the ocean! That of the other Lipari iſlands ſeem now almoſt extinct, and the force of the whole to be concentered in Strombolo, which acts as one great vent to them all. We ſtill obſerve Volcano and Volcanello throwing out volumes of ſmoke, but during the whole night we could not perceive the leaſt ſpark of fire from either of them.</p>
                     <p>It is probable, that Strombolo, as well as all the reſt of theſe iſlands, is originally the work of ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fire. The matter of which they are compoſed, in a manner demonſtrates this; and many of the Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian authors confirm it. There are now eleven of them in all, and none of the ancients mention more than ſeven. Fazzello, one of the beſt Sicilian authors, gives an account of the production of Volcano, now one of the moſt conſiderable of theſe iſlands. He ſays it happened in the early time of the republic, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by Euſebius, Pliny, and others. He adds, that

even in his time, in the beginning of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, it ſtill diſcharged quantities of fire and of pumice ſtones; but that in the preceeding century there had been a very great eruption of this iſland, which ſhook all Sicily, and alarmed the coaſt of Italy as far as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. He ſays the ſea boiled all around the iſland, and rocks of a vaſt ſize were diſcharged from the crater; that fire and ſmoke in many places pierced through the waves, and that the navigation amongſt theſe iſlands was totally changed; rocks appearing where it was formerly deep water; and many of the ſtraits and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows were entirely filled up. He obſerves that Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in his book on meteors, takes notice of a very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eruption of this iſland, by which not only the coaſt of Sicily, but likewiſe many cities in Italy were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with aſhes. It has probably been that very erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which formed the iſland. He deſcribes Strombo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo to have been, in his time, pretty much the ſame as at this day; only that it then produced a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of cotton, which is not now the caſe. The greateſt part of it appears to be barren. On the north ſide there are a few vineyards; but they are very meagre.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XXXIX. AN ACCOUNT OF THE ERUPTION OF MOUNT VESUVIUS, WHICH HAPPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED IN AUGUST, 1779.</head>
                     <p>AS many poetical deſcriptions of this eruption will not be wanting, I ſhall confine mine to ſimple matter of fact, in plain proſe, and endeavour to convey to my readers, as clearly and diſtinctly as I am able, what I ſaw myſelf, and the impreſſion it made upon me at the time, without aiming in the leaſt at a flowery ſtyle.</p>
                     <p>The uſual ſymptoms of an approaching eruption, ſuch as rumbling noiſes and exploſions within the bowels of the volcano, a quantity of ſmoke iſſuing with force from its crater, accompanied at times with an emiſſion of red hot ſcoriae and aſhes, were manifeſt, more or leſs, during the whole month of July; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the month, thoſe ſymptoms were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to ſuch a degree, as to exhibit in the night time the moſt beautiful fire-works that can be imagined.</p>
                     <p>Theſe kinds of throws of red-hot ſcoriae, and other volcanic matter, which at night are ſo bright and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, appear, in broad day-light like ſo many black ſpots in the midſt of the white ſmoke; and it is this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:031692_0244_0FEE0FBCA93A0038"/>
which occaſions the vulgar and falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that volcanos burn much more during the night than in the day-time.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 5th Auguſt, about two o'clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, I perceived from my villa at Pauſilipo, in the bay of Naples, from whence one has a full view of Veſuvius (which is juſt oppoſite, and at the diſtance of about ſix miles in a direct line from it) that the volcano was in a moſt violent agitation. A white and ſulphureous ſmoke iſſued continually and impetuouſly from its cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one puff impelling another, and by an accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe clouds of ſmoke, reſembling bales of the whiteſt cotton, ſuch a maſs of them was ſoon piled over the top of the volcano, as exceeded the height and ſize of the mountain itſelf at leaſt four times. In the midſt of this very white ſmoke, an immenſe quantity of ſtones, ſcoriae, and aſhes, were ſhot up to a wonderful height, certainly not leſs than two thouſand feet. I could alſo perceive, by the help of one of Ramſden's moſt excellent refracting teleſcopes, at times, a quantity of liquid lava, ſeemingly very weighty, juſt heaved up high enough to clear the rim of the crater, and then take its courſe impetuouſly down the ſteep ſide of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius, oppoſite to Somma. Soon after the lava broke out on the ſame ſide, from about the middle of the conical part of the volcano, and having run with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſome hours, ceaſed ſuddenly, juſt before it had
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:031692_0245_0FEE0FBE35525078"/>
arrived at the cultivated parts of the mountain above Portici, near four miles from the ſpot where it iſſued.</p>
                     <p>During this day's eruption, as I have been credibly informed ſince, the heat was intolerable at the towns of Somma and Ottaiano, that the air was darkened in ſuch a manner, as that objects could not be diſtinguſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the diſtance of ten feet. Long filaments of vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified matter, like ſpun glaſs, were mixed, and fell with theſe aſhes; and the ſulphureous ſmoke was ſo violent, that ſeveral birds in cages were ſuffocated, and the leaves of the trees in the neighbourhood of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma and Ottaiano were covered with white ſalts very corroſive. About two o'clock in the afternoon, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary globe of ſmoke, of a very great diameter, was diſtinctly perceived by many of the inhabitants of Portici, to iſſue from the crater of Veſuvius, and proceed haſtily towards the mountain of Somma, againſt which it ſtruck and diſperſed itſelf, having left a train of white ſmoke, marking the courſe it had taken. This train I perceived plainly from my villa, as it laſted ſome minutes; but I did not ſee the globe itſelf.</p>
                     <p>A poor labourer, who was making faggots on the mountain of Somma loſt his life at this time; and his body not having been found, it is ſuppoſed that, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated by the ſmoke, he muſt have fallen into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley from the craggy rocks on which he was at work, and been covered by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> of lava, that took its
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031692_0246_0FEE0FBFC5B7C690"/>
courſe through that valley ſoon after. An aſs, that was waiting for its maſter in the valley, left it very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly as ſoon as the mountain became violent, and arriving ſafe home, gave the firſt alarm to this poor man's family.</p>
                     <p>It was generally remarked, that the exploſions of the volcano were attended with more noiſe during this day's eruption, than in any of the ſucceeding one's, when, moſt probably, the mouth of Veſuvius was wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and the volcanic matter had a freer paſſage. It is certain, however, that the great eruption of 1767, (which in every other reſpect was mild when compared to the late violent eruption) occaſioned much greater concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the air by its louder exploſions.</p>
                     <p>Friday, Auguſt the 6th, the fermentation in the mountain was leſs violent; but about noon there was a loud report, at which time it was ſuppoſed that a portion of the little mountain within the crater had fallen in. At night the throws from the crater increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proceeded evidently from two ſeparate mouths, which, emitting red-hot ſcoriae, and in different direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, formed a moſt beautiful and almoſt continued firework.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday, Auguſt the 7th, the volcano remained much in the ſame ſtate; but about twelve o'clock at night, its fermentation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

itſelf at this time. I was watching its motions from the mole of Naples, which has a full view of the volcano, and had been witneſs to ſeveral glorious pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque effects produced by the reflection of the deep red fire which iſſued from the crater of Veſuvius, and mounted up in the midſt of the huge clouds, when a ſummer ſtorm, called here a <hi>tropea,</hi> come on ſuddenly, and blended its heavy watery clouds with the ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous, and mineral ones, which were already like ſo many other mountains, piled over the ſummit of the volcano. At this moment a fountain of fire was ſhot up to an incredible height, caſting ſo bright a light, that the ſmalleſt objects could be clearly diſtinguiſhed, at any place within ſix miles or more of Veſuvius.</p>
                     <p>The black ſtormy clouds paſſing ſwiftly over, and at times covering the whole or a part of the bright col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umn of fire, at other times clearing away, and giving a full view of it, with the various tints produced by its reverberated light on the white clouds above, in contraſt with the pale flaſhes of forked lightning that attended the <hi>tropea,</hi> formed ſuch a ſcene as no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of art can ever expreſs.</p>
                     <p>That which followed the next evening was ſurely much more formidable and alarming; but this was more beautiful and ſublime than even the moſt lively imagination can paint to itſelf. This great exploſion did not laſt above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

<pb n="248" facs="unknown:031692_0248_0FEE0FC8977347D8"/>
Veſuvius was totally eclipſed by the dark clouds, and there fell a heavy ſhower of rain.</p>
                     <p>Some ſcoriae and ſmall ſtones fell at Ottaiano dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this eruption, and ſome of a very great ſize in the valley between Veſuvius and the hermitage. All the inhabitants of the towns at the foot of the volcano were in the greateſt alarm, and preparing to abandon their houſes, had the eruption continued longer.</p>
                     <p>One of his Sicilian majeſty's game keepers, who was out in the fields near Ottaiano, whilſt this combined ſtorm was at its height, was greatly ſurpriſed to find the drops of rain ſcald his face and hands, which phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon was probably occaſioned by the clouds hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquired a great deal of heat in paſſing through the above mentioned column of fire. The king of Naples did me the honour of informing me of this curious circumſtance.</p>
                     <p>Sunday, Auguſt the eighth, Veſuvius was quiet till towards ſix o'clock in the evening, when a great ſmoke began to gather again over its c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ater, and about an hour after, a rumbling ſubterraneous noiſe was heard in the neighbourhood of the volcano; the uſual throws of red-hot ſtones and ſcoriae began and increaſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtant. I was at this time at Pauſilipo, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſeveral of my countrymen, obſerving with good teleſcopes the various phenomena in the crater of Veſuvius, which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

<pb n="249" facs="unknown:031692_0249_0FEE0FCA2535B608"/>
as well as if we had been actually ſeated on the ſummit of the volcano. The crater ſeemed much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by the violence of laſt night's exploſions, and the little mountain no longer exiſted. About nine o'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clock there was a loud report, which ſhook the houſes of Portici and its neighbourhood to ſuch a degree, as to alarm their inhabitants, and drive them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> into the ſtreets; and as I have ſince ſeen, many windows were broken and walls cracked, by the confuſion of the air from that exploſion, though faintly heard at Naples.</p>
                     <p>In an inſtant a fountain of liquid, tranſparent fire began to riſe, gradually increaſing, arrived at ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing a heighth as to ſtrike every one who beheld it with the moſt awful aſtoniſhment. I ſhall ſcarcely be credited when I affirm, that, to the beſt of my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the heighth of this ſtupendous column of fire could not be leſs than three times that of Veſuvius it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which riſes perpendicularly near 3700 feet above the level of the ſea.</p>
                     <p>Puffs of ſmoke, as black as can poſſibly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, ſucceeded one another haſtily, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the red-hot tranſparent and liquid lava, interrupting its ſplendid brightneſs here and there by patches of the darkeſt hue.</p>
                     <p>Within theſe puffs of ſmoke, at the very moment of their emiſſion from the crater, I could perceive a bright, but pale electrical fire, briſkly playing about in zig-zag lines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="250" facs="unknown:031692_0250_0FEE0FD18868E888"/>
The wind was S. W. and though gentle, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to carry theſe detatched clouds or puffs of ſmoke out of the column of fire; and a collection of them, by degrees, formed a black and extenſive curtain (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) behind it; in other parts of the ſky it was perfectly clear and the ſtars were bright.</p>
                     <p>The fiery fountain, of ſo gigantic a ſize upon the dark ground above-mentioned, made the moſt glorious contraſt imaginable, and the blaze of it reflected ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſurface of the ſea, which was at that time perfectly ſmooth, added greatly to this ſublime view.</p>
                     <p>The liquid lava, mixed with ſtones and ſcoriae, after having mounted, I verily believe, at the leaſt ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand feet, was partly directed by the wind towards Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiano, and partly falling almoſt perpendicularly, ſtill red-hot and liquid, on Veſuvius, covered its whole cone, part of that of the mountain of Somma, and the valley between them. The falling matter being near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as vivid and inflamed, as that which was continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſuing freſh from the crater, formed with it one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete body of fire, which could not be leſs than two miles and a half in breadth, and of the extraordinary heighth above mentioned, caſting a heat to the diſtance of at leaſt ſix miles around it.</p>
                     <p>The bruſh-wood on the mountain of Somma was ſoon in a blaze; which flame being of a different tint
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:031692_0251_0FEE0FD3149C0810"/>
from the deep red of the matter thrown out of the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano, and from the ſilvery blue of the electrical fire, ſtill added to the contraſt of this moſt extraordinary ſcene.</p>
                     <p>The black cloud increaſing greatly, once bent tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards Naples, and ſeemed to threaten this fair city with ſpeedy deſtruction; for it was charged with electrical matter, which kept conſtantly darting about it in ſtrong and bright zig-zags, juſt like thoſe deſcribed by Pliny the younger in his letter to Tacitus, and which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the great eruption of Veſuvius that proved fatal to his uncle. "Ab altero latere, nubes atra et horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, ignei ſpiritus tortois vibratiſque diſcurſibus rupta, in longas flammarum figuras dehiſcebat; fulgoribus illae et ſimilis et majores."</p>
                     <p>This volcanic lightning, however, as I particularly remarked, very rarely quitted the cloud, but uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the great column of fire towards the crater of the volcano from whence it originally came. Once or twice, indeed, I ſaw this lightning (or <hi>ferilla</hi> as it is called here) fall on the top of Somma, and ſet fire to ſome dry graſs and buſhes.</p>
                     <p>Fortunately for us, the wind increaſing from the S.W. quarter, carried back the threatening cloud juſt as it had reached the city, and began to occaſion great alarm. All public diverſions ceaſed in an inſtant, and the theatres being ſhut, the doors of the churches were
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:031692_0252_0FEE0FD4A0504EF0"/>
thrown open. Numerous proceſſions were formed in the ſtreets, and women, and children, with diſhevel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heads filled the air with their cries, inſiſting loudly upon the relics of St. Januarius being immediately op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the fury of the mountain. In ſhort, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace of this great city began to diſplay its uſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant mixture of riot and bigotry; and if ſome ſpeedy and well-timed precautions had not been taken, Naples would, Perhaps, have been in more danger of ſuffering from the irregularities of its lower claſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, than from the angry volcano.</p>
                     <p>But to return to my ſubject. After the column of fire had continued in full force near half an hour, the eruption ceaſed all at once, and Veſuvius remained ſullen and ſilent. After the dazzling light of the fiery fountain, all ſeemed dark and diſmal except the cone of Veſuvius, which was covered with glowing cinders and ſcoriae, from under which, at times, here and there, ſmall ſtreams of liquid lava had eſcaped, and rolled down the ſteep ſides of the volcano. This ſcene put me in mind of Martial's deſcription of Etna.</p>

have often found it in my viſits to Veſuvius during an eruption.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I endeavoured to convey to my readers, at leaſt a faint idea of a ſcene ſo glorious and ſublime, as perhaps may have never before been viewed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eyes, at leaſt in ſuch perfection.</p>

                     <p>A FEW days ago, we ſet off to viſit Mount AEtna, that venerable and reſpectable father of mountains. His baſe, and his immenſe declivities, are covered over with a numerous progeny of his own; for every great eruption produces a new mountain; and perhaps, by the number of theſe, better than by any other method, the number of eruptions, and the age of AEtna itſelf, might be aſcertained.</p>
                     <p>The whole mountain is divided into three diſtinct regions, called <hi>La Regione Culta,</hi> or <hi>Piedmonteſe,</hi> The Fertile Region; <hi>La Regione Sylvoſa,</hi> or <hi>Nemoroſa,</hi> The Woody Region; and <hi>La Regione Deſerta,</hi> or <hi>Scoperta,</hi> The Barren Region.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three are as different, both in climate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, as the three zones of the earth, and perhaps
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:031692_0254_0FEF29FBEDFEF2B8"/>
with equal propriety, might have been ſtiled the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, the Temperate, and the Frigid zone. The firſt region ſurrounds the foot of the mountain, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the moſt fertile country in the world on all ſides of it, to the extent of about fourteen or fifteen miles, where the woody region begins. It is compoſed almoſt entirely of lava, which, after a number of ages, is at laſt converted into the moſt fertile of all ſoils.</p>
                     <p>At Nicoloſi, which is twelve miles up the mountain, we found the barometer at 27 1½: at Catania it ſtood at 29 8½ although the former elevation is not very great, probably not exceeding 3000 feet, yet the climate was totally changed. At Catania the harveſt was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely over, and the heats were inſupportable; here they were moderate, and in many places the corn is as yet green. The road for theſe twelve miles is the worſt I ever travelled; entirely over old lavas and the mouths of extinguiſhed volcanos, now converted into corn-fields, vineyards, and orchards.</p>
                     <p>The fruit of this region is reckoned the fineſt in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily, particularly the figs, of which they have a great variety. One of theſe of a very large ſize, eſteemed ſuperior in flavour to all the reſt, they pretend is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to AEtna.</p>
                     <p>The great eruption of 1669, after ſhaking the whole country around for four months, and forming a very large mountain of ſtones and aſhes, burſt out about a
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:031692_0255_0FEF294C926C27F0"/>
mile above Monpelieri, and deſcending like a torrent, bore directly againſt the middle of that mountain, and (they pretend) perforated it from ſide to ſide. This however I doubt, as it muſt have broken the regular form of the mountain, which is not the caſe. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that it pierced it to a great depth. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va then divided into two branches; and ſurrounding this mountain, joined again on its ſouth ſide; and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſte the whole country betwixt that and Catania, ſcaled the walls of that city, and poured its flaming torrent into the ocean. In its way, it is ſaid to have deſtroyed the poſſeſſions of near 30,000 people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to beggary. It formed ſeveral hills where there were formerly valleys, and filled up a large lake, of which there is not now the leaſt veſtige to been ſeen.</p>
                     <p>As the events of this eruption are better known than any other, they tell a great many ſingular ſtories of it; one of which, however incredible it may appear, is well aſcertained. A vineyard, belonging to a convent of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, lay directly in its way; this vineyard was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on an ancient lava, probably a thin one, with a number of caverns and crevices under it. The liquid lava entering into theſe caverns, ſoon filled them up, and by degrees bore up the vineyards; and the Jeſuits, who every moment expected to ſee it buried, beheld with amazement the whole field began to move off. It was carried on the ſurface of the lava to a conſiderable
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:031692_0256_0FEF294E190570F8"/>
diſtance; and though the greateſt part was deſtroyed, yet ſome of it remains to this day.</p>
                     <p>We went to examine the mouth from whence this dreadful torrent iſſued; and were ſurpriſed to find it only a ſmall hole, of about three or four yards diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The mountain from whence it ſprung, I think, is little leſs than the conical part of Veſuvius.</p>

                     <p>We found a degree of wildneſs and ferocity in the inhabitants of this mountain, that I have not obſerved any where elſe. It was with much difficulty I could perſuade them that we were not come to ſearch for hidden treaſures, a great quantity of which they believe is to be found in Monpelieri; and when I went to that mountain, they were then fully convinced that this was our intention. Two of the men followed me, and kept a cloſe eye on every ſtep that I took; and when I lifted any bit of lava or pumice, they came running up, thinking it was ſomething very precious; but when they obſerved they were only bits of ſtones, and that I

put them into my pocket, they laughed heartily, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one another in their mountain jargon, which is unintelligible even to Italians. However, as moſt of them ſpeak Italian ſo as to be underſtood, they aſked me what I was going to make of thoſe bits of ſtone? I told them they were of great value in our country; that the people there had a way of making gold of them. At this they both ſeemed exceedingly ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſpoke again in their own tongue. However, I found they did not believe me. One of them told me, if that had been true, I certainly would not have been ſo ready in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I aſſured them, that I had not yet learned it myſelf, and that it was a ſecret known only to very few. They were likewiſe a good deal ſurpriſed to ſee me pull out of my pocket a magnetical needle, and a ſmall electro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, which I had prepared at Catania to examine the electrical ſtate of the air; and I was at firſt afraid they ſhould have taken me for a conjurer, (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready happened amongſt the Appenines) but luckily that idea did not ſtrike them.</p>
                     <p>After leaving Nicoloſi, and travelling for about an hour and a half over barren aſhes and lava, we arrived on the confines of the Regione Sylvoſa, or the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Zone. As ſoon as we entered theſe delightful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:031692_0258_0FEF295A2FB4B908"/>
we ſeemed to have got into another world. The air, which before was ſultry and hot, was now cool and refreſhing; and every breeze was loaded with a thouſand perfumes, the whole ground being covered over with the richeſt aromatic plants. Many parts of this region are ſurely the moſt heavenly ſpots, upon earth; and if AEtna reſembles hell within, it may with equal juſtice be ſaid to reſemble paradiſe without.</p>
                     <p>It is indeed a curious conſideration, that this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhould re-unite every beauty and every horror; and, in ſhort, all the moſt oppoſite and diſſimilar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in nature.

Here the ground is covered with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery flower; and we wander over theſe beauties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template this wilderneſs of ſweets, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hell, with all its terrors, is immediately under our feet; and that but a few yards ſeparate us from lakes of liquid fire and brimſtone.</p>
                     <p>But our aſtoniſhment ſtill increaſes, on caſting our eyes on the higher regions of the mountain. There we behold, in perpetual union, the two elements that are at perpetual war; an immenſe gulph of fire, for ever exiſting in the midſt of ſnows which it has not

                     <p>The woody region of AEtna aſcends for about eight or nine miles, and forms a zone or girdle, of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt green, all around the mountain. This night w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Here we were delighted with the contemplation of many grave and beautiful objects; the proſpect on all ſides is immenſe; and we already ſeem to be lifted up from the earth, and to have got into a new world.</p>
                     <p>After taking a comfortable nap in the cave, on a bed of leaves, we awoke about eleven o'clock; and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a ſufficient quantity of ſnow, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes we found ourſelves aſcending great rocks of lava, where if our mules ſhould make but a falſe ſtep, we might be thrown headlong over the precipice. However, by the aſſiſtance of the Cyclops, we overcame all theſe difficulties; and he managed matters ſo well, that in the ſpace of two hours, we fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The proſpect before us was of a very different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we beheld an expanſe of ſnow and ice that alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us exceedingly, and almoſt ſtaggered our reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the centre of this, but ſtill at a great diſtance, we deſcried the high ſummit of the mountain, rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its tremendous head, and vomiting out torrents of ſmoke. It indeed appeared altogether inacceſſable, from the vaſt extent of the fields of ſnow and ice that ſurround it. Our diffidence was ſtill encreaſed by the ſentiments of the Cyclops. He told us that it often happened that the ſurface of the mountain being hot below, melted the ſnow in particular ſpots, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:031692_0261_0FEF2970AE433360"/>
pools of water, where it was impoſſible to foreſee our danger; that it likewiſe happened, that the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water, as well as the ſnow, was ſometimes covered with black aſhes, that rendered it exceedingly deceitful; that, however, if we thought proper, he would lead us on with as much caution as poſſible. Accordingly; after holding a council of war, which people generally do when they are very much afraid, we detached our cavalry to the foreſt below, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to climb the ſnow. The Cyclops, after taking a great draught of brandy, deſired us to be of good cheer; that we had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Accordingly, taking each of us a dram of liqueur, which ſoon removed ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery objection, we began our march.</p>

However, we determined to perſevere, calling to mind in the midſt of our labour, that the Emperor Adrian, and the pholoſopher Plato had undergone the ſame, and from the ſame motive too; to ſee the riſing ſun from the top of AEtna. After incredible labour and fatigue, but at the ſame time mixed with a great deal of pleaſure, we arrived before dawn at the ruins of an ancient ſtructure, called <hi>Il Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re del Filoſefo,</hi> ſuppoſed to have been built by the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher Empedocles, who took up his habitation here, the better to ſtudy the nature of Mount AEtna.

Here we reſted our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſome time, and made a freſh application to our liqueur bottle, which I am perſuaded both Vulcan and Empedocles, had they been here, would have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved of after ſuch a march.</p>
                     <p>I found the mercury had fallen to 20. 6. We had now time to pay our adorations in a ſilent contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſublime objects of nature. The ſky was clear, and the immenſe vault of the heavens appeared in awful majeſty and ſplendour. We found ourſelves more ſtruck with veneration than below, and at firſt were at a loſs to know the cauſe; till we obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:031692_0263_0FEF297AAE7B0C40"/>
with aſtoniſhment, that the number of ſtars ſeemed to-be infinitely increaſed, and the light of each of them appeared brighter than uſual. The white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the milky way was like a pure flame that ſhot acroſs the heavens; and with the naked eye we could obſerve cluſters of ſtars that were inviſible in the regions below. We did not at firſt attend to the cauſe, nor recollect that we had now paſſed through ten or twelve thouſand feet of groſs vapour, that blunts and confuſes every ray, before it reaches the ſurface of the earth. We were amazed at the diſtinctneſs of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and exclaimed together, What a glorious ſituation for an obſervatory! Had Empedocles had the eyes of Galileo, what diſcoveries muſt he not have made! We regretted that Jupiter was not viſible, as I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded we might have diſcovered ſome of his ſatellites with the naked eye, or at leaſt with a ſmall glaſs, which I had in my pocket. We obſerved a light a great way below us on the mountain, which ſeemed to move a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the foreſts, but whether an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> or what it was, I ſhall not pretend to ſay. We likewiſe took notice of ſeveral of thoſe meteors, called <hi>Falling Stars,</hi> which ſtill appeared to be as much elevated above us, as when ſeen from the plain; ſo that in all probability, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

After contemplating theſe objects for ſome time, we ſet off, and ſoon after arrived at the foot of the great crater of the mountain. This is of an exact conical fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and riſes equally on all ſides. It is compoſed ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of aſhes and other burnt materials, diſcharged from the mouth of the volcano, which is in its centre. This conical mountain is of a very great ſize. Its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference cannot be leſs than ten miles. Here we took a ſecond reſt, as the greateſt part of our fatigue ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. The mercury had fallen to 20 4½ We found this mountain exceſſively ſteep; and although it had appeared black, yet it was likewiſe covered with ſnow; but the ſurface (luckily for us) was ſpread over with a pretty thick layer of aſhes, thrown out from the crater. Had it not been for this, we never ſhould have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to get to the top, as the ſnow was every where fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen hard and ſolid from the piercing cold of the air.</p>
                     <p>In about an hour's climbing, we arrived at a place where there was no ſnow, and where a warm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vapour iſſued from the mountain, which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us to make another halt. Here I found the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury at 19 6½. The thermometer was fallen three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees below the point of congelation; and before we left the ſummit of AEtnea, it fell two degrees more, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to 27.—From this ſpot it was only about three hundred yards to the higheſt ſummit of the mountain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

But here deſcription muſt ever fall ſhort; for no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination has dared to form an idea of ſo glorious and ſo magnificent a ſcene. Neither is there on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of this globe, any one point that unites ſo many awful and ſublime objects. The immenſe elevation from the ſurface of the earth, drawn as it were to a ſingle point without any neighbouring mountain for the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and imagination to reſt upon, and recover from their aſtoniſhment in their way down to the world. This point or pinacle raiſed on the brim of a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs gulph, as old as the world, often diſcharging rivers of fire, and throwing out burning rocks, with a noiſe that ſhakes the whole iſland. Add to this the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded extent of the proſpect, comprehending the greateſt diverſity, and the moſt beautiful ſcenery in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with the riſign ſun advancing in the eaſt to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the wondrous ſcene.</p>
                     <p>The whole atmoſphere by degrees kindled up, and ſhowed dimly and faintly the boundleſs proſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round. Both ſea and land looked dark and confuſed, as if only emerging from their original chaos, and light and darkneſs ſeemed ſtill undivided; till the morning by degrees advancing, completed the ſeparation. The ſtars are extinguiſhed, and the ſhades diſappear. The foreſts, which but now ſeemed black and bottomleſs gulphs, from whence no ray was reflected to ſhow their form or colours, appear a new creation riſing to the

ſight, catching life and beauty from every increaſing beam. The ſcene ſtill enlarges, and the horizon ſeems to widen and expand itſelf on all ſides; till the ſun, like the great Creator, appears in the eaſt, and with his plaſtic ray completes the mighty ſcene.—All ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears enchantment, and it is with difficulty we can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we are ſtill on earth. The ſenſes, unaccuſtomed to the ſublimity of ſuch a ſcene, are bewildered and confounded; and it is not till after ſome time, that they are capable of ſeparating and judging of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that compoſe it. The body of the ſun is ſeen ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the ocean, immenſe tracks both of ſea and land intervening; the iſlands of Lipari, Panari, Alicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, Strombolo, and Volcano, with their ſmoking ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, appear under your feet; and you look down on the whole of Sicily as on a map, and can trace every river through all its windings from its ſource to its mouth. The view is abſolutely boundleſs on every ſide; nor is there any one object within the circle of viſion to interrupt it; ſo that the ſight is every where loſt in the immenſity: and I am perſuaded it is only from the imperfection of our organs, that the coaſts of Africa, and even of Greece, are not diſcovered, as they are certainly above the horizon. The circumference of the viſible horizon on the top of AEtna, cannot be leſs than 2000 miles. At Malta, which is near 200 miles diſtant, they perceive all the eruptions from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:031692_0267_0FEF29908A637068"/>
region, and that iſland is often diſcovered from about one half the elevation of the mountain; ſo that at the whole elevation, the horizon muſt extend to near dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that diſtance, or 400 miles, which makes 800 for the diameter of the circle, and 2400 for the circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But this is by much too vaſt for our ſenſes, not intended to graſp ſo boundleſs a ſcene.</p>
                     <p>I find indeed, by ſome of the Sicilian authors, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Maſſa, that the African coaſt as well as that of Naples, with many of its iſlands, have been diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from the top of AEtna. Of this, however, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not boaſt, though we can very well believe it. Indeed, if we knew the heighth of the mountain, it would be eaſy to calculate the extent of its viſible horizon, and (<hi>vice verſa</hi>) if its viſible horizon were exactly aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would be an eaſy matter to calculate the heighth of the mountain.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt beautiful part of the ſcene is certainly the mountain itſelf; the iſland of Sicily, and the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous iſlands lying round it. All theſe, by a kind of magic in viſion, that I am at a loſs to account for, ſeem as if they were brought cloſe round the ſkirts of AEtna, the diſtances appearing reduced to nothing. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this ſingular effect is produced by the rays of light paſſing from a rarer medium into a denſer, which (from a well-known law in optics) to an obſerver in the rare medium, appears to lift up the objects that are
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:031692_0268_0FEF299A8B330120"/>
at the bottom of the denſe one, as a piece of money placed in a baſon appears lifted up as ſoon as the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is filled with water.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Regione Deſerta,</hi> or the frigid zone of AEtna, is the firſt object that calls your attention. It is marked out by a circle of ſnow and ice, which extends on all ſides to the diſtance of about eight miles. In the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this circle, the great crater of the mountain rears its burning head; and the regions of intenſe cold, and of intenſe heat, ſeem for ever to be united in the ſame point. On the north ſide of the ſnowy region, they aſſure us there are ſeveral ſmall lakes that are never thawed; and that in many places, the ſnow, mixed with the aſhes and ſalts of the mountain, is accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to a vaſt depth. And indeed I ſuppoſe the quantity of ſalts contained in this mountain is one great reaſon of the preſervation of its ſnows.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Regione Deſerta</hi> is immediately ſucceeded by the <hi>Sylvoſa,</hi> or the woody region, which forms a circle or girdle of the moſt beautiful green, which ſurrounds the mountain on all ſides, and is certainly one of the moſt delightful ſpots on earth. This preſents a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contraſt with the deſert region. It is not ſmooth and even like the greateſt part of the latter; but it is finely variegated by an infinite number of thoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful little mountains that have been formed by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eruptions of AEtna. All theſe have now acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wonderful degree of fertility, except a very few
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:031692_0269_0FEF299C1E694740"/>
that are but newly formed; that is, within theſe five or ſix hundred years: for it certainly requires ſome thouſands to bring them to their greateſt degree of perfection. We looked down into the craters of theſe, and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in vain, to number them.</p>
                     <p>The circumference of this zone or great circle on AEtna, is not leſs than ſeventy or eighty miles. It is evry where ſucceeded by the vineyards, orchards, and corn-fields that compoſe the <hi>Regione Culta,</hi> or the fertile region. This laſt zone is much broader than the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and extends on all ſides to the foot of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Its whole circumference, according to Recupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, is 183 miles. It is likewiſe covered with a number of little conical and ſpherical mountains, and exhibits a wonderful variety of forms and colours, and makes a delightful contraſt with the other two regions. It is bounded by the ſea to the ſouth and ſouth-eaſt, and on all its other ſides by the river Semetus and Alcantara, which run almoſt round it. The whole courſe of theſe rivers is ſeen at once, and all their beautiful wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through theſe fertile valleys, looked upon as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite poſſeſſion of Ceres herſelf, and the very ſcene of the rape of her daughter Proſerpine.</p>
                     <p>Caſt your eyes a little farther, and you embrace the whole iſland, and ſee all its cities, rivers and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, delineated in the great chart of Nature: All the adjacent iſlands, the whole coaſt of Italy, as far as your
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:031692_0270_0FEF299DA5F099C8"/>
eye can reach; for it is no where bounded, but every where loſt in the ſpace. On the ſun's firſt riſing, the ſhadow of the mountain extends acroſs the whole iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, and makes a large tract viſible even in the ſea, and in the air. By degrees this is ſhortened, and in a little time is confined only to the neighbourhood of AEtna.</p>
                     <p>We now had time to examine a fourth region of this wonderful mountain, very different indeed from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and productive of very different ſenſations; but which has, undoubtedly, given being to all the reſt; I mean the region of fire.</p>
                     <p>The preſent crater of this immenſe volcano is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of about three miles and a half in circumference. It goes ſhelving down on each ſide, and forms a regular hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low like a vaſt amphitheatre. From many places of this ſpace, iſſue volumes of ſulphureous ſmoke, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much heavier than the circumambient air, inſtead of riſing in it, as ſmoke generally does, immediately on its getting out of the crater, rolls down the ſide of the mountain like a torrent, till coming to that part of the atmoſphere of the ſame ſpecific gravity with itſelf, it ſhoots off horizontally, and forms a large track in the air, according to the direction of the wind; which happily for us, carried it exactly to the ſide oppoſite to that where we were placed.</p>
                     <p>The crater is ſo hot, that it is very dangerous, if
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:031692_0271_0FEF299F2AA9EFA0"/>
not immoffible, to go down into it; beſides the ſmoke is very incommodious, and, in many places, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is ſo ſoft, there have been inſtances of people ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down in it, and paying for their temerity with their lives. Near the centre of the crater is the great mouth of the volcano: That tremendous gulph ſo celebrated in all ages, looked upon as the terror and ſcourge both of this and another life; and equally uſeful to anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent poets, or to modern divines, when the Muſe or when the Spirit inſpires. We beheld it with awe and with horror, and were not ſurpriſed that it had been conſidered as the place of the damned. When we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the immenſity of its depth, the vaſt cells and caverns whence ſo many lavas have iſſued; the force of its internal fire, to raiſe up thoſe lavas to ſo vaſt a heighth, to ſupport them, as it were, in the air, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to force them over the very ſummit of the crater, with all their dreadful accompaniments; the boiling of the matter, the ſhaking of the mountain, the explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of flaming rocks, &amp;c. we muſt allow, that the moſt enthuſiaſtic imagination, in the midſt of all its terrors, hardly ever formed an idea of a hell more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                     <p>It was with a mixture both of pleaſure and pain, that we quitted this awful ſcene. But the wind had riſen very high, and clouds began to gather round the mountain. In a ſhort time they formed like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:031692_0272_0FEF29A0B25331A8"/>
heaven below us, and we were in hopes of ſeeing a thunder-ſtorm under our feet; A ſcene that is not uncommon in theſe exalted regions, and which I have already ſeen on the top of the high Alps. But the clouds were ſoon diſpelled again by the force of the wind, and we were diſappointed in our expectations.</p>
                     <p>I had often been told of the great effect produced by diſcharging a gun on the top of high mountains. I tried it here, when we were a good deal ſurpriſed to find, that inſtead of increaſing the ſound, it was almoſt reduced to nothing. The report was not equal to that of a pocket-piſtol. We compared it to the ſtroke of a ſtick on a door; and ſurely it is conſiſtent with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the thinner the air is, the leſs its impreſſion muſt be on the ear; for in a vacuum there can be no noiſe; and the nearer the approach to a vacuum, the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt always be the ſmaller. Where thoſe great effects have been produced, it muſt have been amongſt a number of mountains, where the ſound is reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from one to the other.</p>

                     <p>WE left the ſummit of the mountain about ſix o'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clock, and it was eight at night before we reached Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania. We obſerved, both with pleaſure and pain, the change of the climate as we deſcended. From the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the moſt rigid winter, we ſoon arrived at thoſe of the moſt delightful ſpring. On firſt entering the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, the trees were ſtill bare as in December, not a ſingle leaf to be ſeen; but after we had aſcended a few miles, we found ourſelves in the mildeſt, and the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of climates; the trees in full verdure, and the fields covered with all the flowers of the ſummer; but as ſoon as we got out of the woods, and entered the torrid zone, we found the heats, altogether inſupportable, and ſuffered dreadfully from them before we reached the city.</p>
                     <p>On our arrival at Catania, we went immediately to bed, being exceedingly oppreſſed by the fatigue of our expedition; but ſtill more by the violent heat of the day.</p>
                     <p>AEtnea has been often meaſured, but I believe never with any degree of accuracy; and it is really a ſhame
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:031692_0274_0FEF29AFA2FA9ED0"/>
to the ſociety eſtabliſhed in this place called the AEtne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Academy, whoſe original inſtitution was to ſtudy the nature and operations of this wonderful moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It was my full intention to have meaſured it geometrically; but I am ſorry to ſay, although this is both the ſeat of an academy and univerſity, yet there was no quadrant to be had. Of all the mountains I have ever ſeen, AEtna would be the eaſieſt to meaſure, and with the greateſt certainty, and perhaps the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt place on the globe to eſtabliſh an exact rule of menſuration by the barometer. There is a beach of a vaſt extent, that begins exactly at the foot of the mountain, and runs for a great many miles along the coaſt. The ſea-mark of this beach forms the meridian to the ſummit of the mountain. Here you are ſure of a perfect level, and may make the baſe of your trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of what length you pleaſe. But unfortunately this menſuration has never been executed, at leaſt with any tolerable degree of deciſion.</p>
                     <p>Kircher pretends to have meaſured it, and to have found it 4000 French toiſes in heighth; which is more than any of the Andes, or indeed than any mountains upon earth. The Italian mathematicians are ſtill more abſurd. Some of them make it eight miles, ſome ſix, and ſome four.</p>
                     <p>Amici, the laſt, and I believe the beſt who has made the attempt, reduces it to 3 miles, 264 paces; but even
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:031692_0275_0FEF29B128BE6B80"/>
this muſt be exceedingly erroneous; and probably the perpendicular height of AEtna does not exceed 12,000 feet, or little more than two miles.</p>
                     <p>I own I did not believe we ſhould find AEtna ſo high as it really is. I had heard indeed that it was higher, than any of the Alps, but I never gave credit to it. How great then was my aſtoniſhment to find that the mercury fell almoſt two inches lower than I had ever obſerved it on the very higheſt of the acceſſible Alps; at the ſame time I am perſuaded there are many inaceſſible points of the Alps, (particularly Mont Blanc) are ſtill much higher than AEtna.</p>
                     <p>The wind, and other circumſtances, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure prevented our electrical experiments, on which we had built not a little; however I found that round Nicoloſi, and particularly on the top of Monpelieri, the air was in a very favourable ſtate for electrical ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Here the little pith-balls, when inſolated, were ſenſibly affected, and repelled each other above an inch. I expected this electrical ſtate of the air would have increaſed as we advanced on the mountain; but at the cave where we ſlept, I could obſerve no ſuch effect. Perhaps it was owing to the exhalations from the trees and vegetables, which are there exceedingly luxuriant; whereas about Nicoloſi, and round Monpelieri, there is hardly any thing but lava and dry hot ſand. Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it might be owing to the evening being farther advanced, and the dews beginning to fall. However;
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:031692_0276_0FEF29BC038565D0"/>
I have no doubt, that upon theſe mountains formed by eruption, where the air is ſtrongly impregnated with ſulphureous effluvia, great electrical diſcoveries might be made. And perhaps, of all the reaſons aſſigned for the wonderful vegetation that is performed on this mountain, there is none that contributes ſo much tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards it, as this conſtant electrical ſtate of the air. For, from a variety of experiments, it has been found, that an increaſe of the electrical matter adds much to the progreſs of vegetation. It probably acts there in the ſame manner as on the animal body. The circulation we know is performed quicker; and the juices are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven through the ſmall veſſels with more eaſe and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This has often been proved from the immediate removal of obſtructions by electricity;—and probably the rubbing with dry and warm flannel, eſteemed ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious in ſuch caſes, is doing nothing more than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing a greater degree of electricity in the part; but it has likewiſe been demonſtrated, by the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of making water drop through a ſmall capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary ſyphon, which the moment it is electrified runs in a full ſtream. I have, indeed, very little doubt, that the fertility of our ſeaſons depend as much on this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the air, as either on its heat or moiſture.</p>
                     <p>Electricity will probably ſoon be conſidered as the great vivifying principal of nature, by which ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on moſt of her operations. It is a fifth element,
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:031692_0277_0FEF29C03091A7A0"/>
diſtinct from, and of ſuperior nature to the other four, which only compoſe the corporeal parts of matter. But this ſubtile and active fluid is a kind of ſoul that pervades and quickens every particle of it. When an equal quantity of this is diffuſed through the air, and over the face of the earth, every thing continues calm and quiet; but if by any accident one part of matter has acquired a greater quantity than another, the moſt dreadful conſequences often enſue before the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium can be reſtored. Nature ſeems to fall into convulſions, and many of her works are deſtroyed:—All the great phaenomena are produced; thunder, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, earthquakes, and whirlwinds: for, I believe, there is little doubt, that all theſe frequently depend on this ſole cauſe. And again, if we look down from the ſublime of nature to its minutiae, we ſhall ſtill find the ſame power acting though perhaps in leſs legible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; for as the knowledge of its operations is ſtill leſs in its infancy, they are generally miſunderſtood, or aſcribed to ſome other cauſe. However, I have no doubt, that in proceſs of time theſe will be properly inveſtigated; when mankind will wonder how much they have been in the dark. It will then poſſibly be found, that what we call ſenſibility of nerves, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe diſeaſes that the faculty have as yet only invented names for, are owing to the body's being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of too large or too ſmall a quantity of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:031692_0278_0FEF29C1B45F45B8"/>
and active fluid, that very flued perhaps, which is the vehicle of all our feelings; and which they have ſo long ſearched for in vain in the nerves. For I have ſometimes been led to think, that this ſenſe was noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſe than a ſlighter kind of electric effect, to which the nerves ſerve as conductors; and that it is by the rapid circulation of this penetrating and animating fire that our ſenſations are performed. We all know, that in damp and hazy weather, when it ſeems to be blunted and abſorbed by the humidity; when its activity is loſt, and little or none of it can be collected; we ever find our ſpirits more languid, and our ſenſibility leſs acute; but in the Sirecc wind at Naples, when the air ſeems totally deprived of it, the whole ſyſtem is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrung, and the nerves ſeem to loſe both their tenſion and elaſticity, till the north or weſt wind awakens the activity of this animating power, which ſoon reſtores the tone, and enlivens all nature, which ſeemed to droop and languiſh during its abſence.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe well known that there have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the human body becoming electric without the mediation of any electric ſubſtance, and even e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſparks of fire with a diſagreeable ſenſation, and an extreme degree of nervous ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>About ſeven or eight years ago, a lady in Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was affected in this manner, and though I was not able to learn all the particulars of her caſe, yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:031692_0279_0FEF29C92557E020"/>
Swiſs gentlemen have confirmed to me the truth of the ſtory. She was uncommonly ſenſible of every change of weather, and had her electrical feelings ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt in a clear day, or during the paſſage of thunder-clounds, when the air is known to be replete with that fluid. Her caſe, like moſt others which the doctors can make nothing of, was decided to be a <hi>nervous</hi> one; for the real meaning of that term I take to be only, that the phiſician does not underſtand what it is.</p>
                     <p>Two gentlemen of Geneva had a ſhort experience of the ſame ſort of complaint, though ſtill in a much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior degree. Profeſſor Sauſſure and young Mr. Jala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, when travelling over one of the high Alps, were caught amongſt thunder clouds, and to their utter aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment, found their bodies ſo full of electrical fire, that ſpontaneous flaſhes darted from their fingers with a crackling noiſe, and the ſame kind of ſenſation as when ſtrongly electrified by art. This was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Mr. Jalabert to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, I think, in the year 1763; and you will find it recorded in their memoirs.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems pretty evident, I think, that theſe feelings were owing to the bodies being poſſeſſed of too great a ſhare of electric fire. This is an uncommon caſe; but I do not think it at all improbable, that many of our invalids, particularly the hypochondriac, and thoſe we call <hi>Malades Imaginares,</hi> owe their diſagreeable feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:031692_0280_0FEF29D12F009BA8"/>
to the oppoſite cauſe, or the bodies being poſſeſſed of too ſmall a quantity of this fire; for we find that a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of it in the air ſeldom fails to increaſe their uneaſy ſenſations, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Perhaps it might be of ſervice to theſe people to wear ſome electric ſubſtance next their ſkin, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the nerves and fibres from the damp, or non-elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric air. I would propoſe a waiſtcoat of the fineſt flannel, which ſhould be kept perfectly clean and dry; for the effluvia of the body, in caſe of any violent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, will, ſoon deſtroy its electric quality. This ſhould be covered by another of the ſame ſize of ſilk, the animal heat, and the friction that exerciſe muſt occaſion betwixt theſe two ſubſtances, produce a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful electricity; and would form a kind of electric at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere around the body, and might poſſibly be one of the beſt preſervatives againſt the effect of damps.</p>
                     <p>As for our Swiſs lady, I have little doubt that her complaints were owing in great part, perhaps entirely, to her dreſs; and that a very ſmall alteration, would effectually have cured her. A lady who has her head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rounded with wires, and her hair ſtuck full of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal pins, and who at the ſame time ſtands upon dry ſilk, is to all intents and purpoſes an electrical conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor inſolated, and prepared for collecting the fire from the atmoſphere. And it is not at all ſurpriſing that during thunderſtorms, or when the air is extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:031692_0281_0FEF29D49F7A5980"/>
with electrical matter, ſhe would emit ſparks, and exhibit other appearances of electricity. I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a very trifling change of dreſs, which from the conſtant verſatility of their modes may ſome day take place, would render this lady's diſeaſe altogether epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical amongſt the ſex. Only let the ſoles of their ſhoes be made of an electric ſubſtance, and let the wires of their caps, and pins of their hair, be ſomewhat lengthened and pointed outwards; and I think there is little doubt, that they will often find themſelves in an electrified ſtate. But, indeed, if they only wear ſilk, or even worſted ſtockings, it may ſometimes prove ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; for I have often inſolated electrometers as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly by placing them on a piece of dry ſilk or flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, as on glaſs.</p>
                     <p>How little do our ladies imagine, when they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round their heads with wire, the moſt powerful of all conductors; and at the ſame time wear ſtockings, ſhoes, and gowns of ſilk, one of the moſt powerful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellents, that they prepare their bodies in the ſame manner, and according to the ſame principles as elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians prepare their conductors for attracting the fire of lightning! If they cannot be brought to relinquiſh their wire caps and their pins, might they not fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſuch preſervative as thoſe which of late years have been applied to objects of leſs conſequence?</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe that every lady ſhould provide herſelf with a
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:031692_0282_0FEF29D624B53B68"/>
ſmall chain or wire, to be hooked on at pleaſure dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thunder-ſtorms. This ſhould paſs from her cap over the thickeſt part of her hair, which will prevent the fire from being communicated to her head; and ſo down to the ground. It is plain this will act in the ſame manner as the conductors on the tops of ſteeples, which from the metal ſpires that are commonly placed there, analagous to the pins and wires, were ſo liable to accidents. Some people may laugh at all this; but I never was more ſerious in my life. A very amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lady of my acquaintance, Mrs. Douglas, of Kelſo, had almoſt loſt her life by one of thoſe caps mounted on wire. She was ſtanding at an open window during a thunder-ſtorm. The lightning was attracted by the wire, and the cap was burnt to aſhes; happily her hair was in its natural ſtate, without powder, pomatum, or pins; and prevented the fire from being conducted to her head; for as ſhe felt no kind of ſhock, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it went off from the wires of the cap to the wall, cloſe to which ſhe then ſtood. If it had found any conductor to carry it to her head or body, in all probability ſhe muſt have been killed. A good ſtrong head of hair, if it is kept perfectly clean and dry, is probably one of the beſt preſervatives againſt the fire of lightning. But ſo ſoon as it is ſtuffed full of powder and pomatum, and bound together with pins, its repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent force is loſt, and it becomes a conductor.—But I
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:031692_0283_0FEF29E1A6F39690"/>
beg pardon for theſe ſurmiſes. I throw them in the way of my readers only for them to improve upon at their leiſure: For we have it ever in our power to be making experiments in electricity. And although this fluid is the moſt ſubtile and active of any we know, we can command it on all occaſions; and I am now ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to its operations, that I ſeldom comb my hair, or pull off a ſtocking, without obſerving them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome form or other. How ſurpriſing is it then, that mankind ſhould have lived and breathed in it for ſo many years, without almoſt ever ſuppoſing that it exiſted! But to return to our mountain.</p>
                     <p>So highly electrical is the vapour of volcanos, that it has been obſerved in ſome eruptions both of AEtna and Veſuvius, that the whole track of ſmoke, which ſometimes extended above an hundred miles, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the moſt dreadful effects; killing ſhepherds and ſtocks on the mountains; blaſting trees, and ſetting fire to houſes, wherever it met with them on an eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſituation. Now probably the flying of a kite, with a wire round its ſtring, would ſoon have diſarmed this formidable cloud. Theſe effects, however, only happen when the air is dry and little agitated; but when it is full of moiſt vapour, the great rare faction from the heat of the lava generally brings it down in violent torrents of rain, which ſoon convey

                     <p>A man, on his firſt arrival at Rome, is not much fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its appearance. The narrowneſs of the ſtreets, the thinneſs of the inhabitants, the prodigious quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of monks and beggars, give but a gloomy aſpect to this renowned city. There are no rich tradeſmen here, who, by their acquiſitions, either ennoble their ſons, or marry their daughters into the houſes of princes. All the ſhops ſeem empty, and the ſhop-keepers poor. This is the firſt impreſſion. But turn your eye from that point of view to the magnificence of their church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to the venerable remains, of ancient Rome, to the prodigious collection of pictures and antique ſtatues, to the very river and ground itſelf; formerly the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that people, whom, from our cradles we have been taught to adore, and with a very few grains of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm in your compoſition, you will feel more than ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>The ſurface of modern Rome is certainly more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:031692_0285_0FEF29EA78B0B200"/>
than it was in ancient times. Such an alteration muſt happen, in the courſe of ages, to every city which has been often deſtroyed by time and fire, as all the rubbiſh is ſeldom removed; but the ancient pavement, on which Trajan's pillars ſtands, ſhoes the elevation in that place not to be above ſeven or eight feet; and, I am informed, ſome of the triumphal arches are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three or four feet in the ground. The moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable change is this; that the <hi>Campus Martius</hi> was in the time of the ancient Romans an open area, and now it is covered with houſes. The circuit of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in Pliny's time, did not, by his account, exceed the preſent dimenſions, but its populouſneſs muſt have been amazingly different.</p>
                     <p>Were an antiquarian to lament over any fall, any metamorphoſis of ancient Rome, perhaps it might be the preſent ſtate of the Forum, where, now, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thurſday and Friday, a market for cows and ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, on the very ſpot where the Roman orators were accuſtomed to thunder out their eloquence in the cauſe of their clients, their country, and their gods.

of the Emperors. The great Amphitheatre, called alſo <hi>Il Coloſſeo,</hi> where the ſpectacle of combats was exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited, is alſo in its neighbourhood. In this place the ſpirit of modern Rome ſeems to prevail over that of ancient Rome; for where the wild beaſts and gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors formerly entertained ſeventy or eighty thouſand ſpectators, you now ſee a few miſerable old women and beggars, who are praying at the feet of fourteen ſmall chapels, which repreſent the fourteen myſteries of our Saviour's paſſion.</p>
                     <p>The magnificence of the Roman Emperors, in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhing the city, roſe to ſuch a heighth, that they ranſacked all the quarries of Egypt for alabaſter, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, porphyry, and every kind of marble that country afforded; and though time and Gothic rage muſt have deſtroyed great quantities, yet, ſuch was the profuſion brought to Rome, that, beſides the amazing number of columns, ſtatues, vales, and tables, ſtill preſerved en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, you ſee the very poſts in the ſtreets, all of them without exception, made of granite, alabaſter, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But the moſt ſtupendous ſights of all, are the prodigious obeliſks, conſiſting of only one piece of marble. I meditate on theſe objects till I am loſt in wonder and confuſion. We have no idea of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical powers by which they were dug out of the quarry, and brought from Egypt. We are aſtoniſhed at the enormous ſize of the ſtones at <hi>Stonehenge,</hi> and
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:031692_0287_0FEF29EC034B5E58"/>
cannot comprehend by what contrivance they were carried and laid in that form; but the largeſt of them is ſmall, when compared with the largeſt obeliſk at Rome, which I think is one hundred and one feet long, and proportionably thick.</p>
                     <p>The ruin of the triumphal bridge near St. Angelo is in object that cannot but ſtrike a man of letters. This was the bridge over which every general marched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the city, to whom a triumph was decreed, either for the conqueſt of a province, or any other ſignal vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. From the time of Romulus to that of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Probus, there were about three hundred and twenty of theſe triumphs. There are now only a few remains of the piers. Who can behold this ſcene, without ruminaring on the nature of the human heart, and recollecting to what trials it muſt have been expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the courſe of ſo proud and ſo flattering a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion?</p>
                     <p>Many of the churches in this city, and above all St. Peter's, are ſo very magnificent, that they vie with anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Rome in every article but that of durableneſs, much of their beauty being derived from pictures, ſtucco, and gilding, the tranſitory ornaments of two or three ages. I cannot forbear remarking, in this place, that the pride of modern Rome is one of the cauſes of her wretchedneſe. She boaſts of her gold and ſilver lying dead in her churches; but had that gold and ſilver a
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:031692_0288_0FEF282E2AF62758"/>
free circulation through the country; it would enliven trade, and furniſh property to thouſands, who are now ſtarving in the moſt preſſing indigence.</p>
                     <p>St. Peter's never fails to pleaſe both the learned and the unlearned eye. The wonderful regularity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment of its parts, like the beauty of a fine face, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand no ſkill in drawing to taſte its charms. Its colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades, fountains, and obeliſk, give it an inimitable ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. It muſt be confeſſed, however, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to this noble edifice is confined and ſhabby; but they now talk of demoliſhing the narrow mean ſtreet leading from St. Angelo; and ſhould this deſign take place, the avenue will be anſwerable to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; though, to render St. Peter's church ſtill more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the Vatican, with its eleven thouſand chambers, ſhould be removed, which like an ugly excreſcence, protuberates' on one ſide, and deſtroys the ſymmetry of the elevation.</p>
                     <p>In the Vatican, beſides a great number of Raphael's paintings, and the excellent and celebrated ſtatues of the Belvedere Appollo, the Laocoon, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. The Laocoon wants an arm. There lies on the ground one of marble, which, it is ſaid, Michael Angelo had begun, in order to perfect the ſtatue, but, perceiving how unſpirited his work would appear, compared with the original, he left the limb in the ſtate we ſee it; not half executed, a monument of his modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and ſelf-knowledge. It may be imagined that no one ſince has been ſo preſumptuous as to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt after him, and therefore the deficiency is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by an arm of <hi>terra cuota.</hi>

                     <p>IN their external deportment, the Italians have a grave ſelemnity of manner, which is ſometimes thought to ariſe from a natural gloomineſs of diſpoſition. The French, above all other nations, are apt to impute to melancholy, the ſedate ſerious air which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies reflection.</p>
                     <p>Though in the pulpit, on the theatre, and even in common converſation, the Italians make uſe of a great deal of action; yet Italian vivacity is different from French; the former proceeds from ſenſibility, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from animal ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of this country have not the briſk look, and elaſtic trip, which is univerſal in France: they move rather with a ſlow compoſed pace. Their ſpines never having been forced into a ſtraight line, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the natural bend; and the people of the moſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed faſhion, as well as the neglected vulgar, ſeem
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:031692_0290_0FEF29FF1B64DCF8"/>
to prefer the unconſtrained attitude of the Antinous, and other antique ſtatues, to the artificial graces of a French dancing-maſter, or the erect ſtrut of a German ſoldier. I imagine I perceive a great reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween many of the living countenances I ſee daily, and the features of the ancient buſts, and ſtatues; which leads me to believe, that there are a greater number of the genuine deſcendants of the old Romans in Italy, than is generally imagined.</p>
                     <p>I am often ſtruck with the fine character of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to be ſeen in the ſtreets of Rome. I never ſaw features more expreſſive of reflection, ſenſe, and geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. In the very loweſt ranks there are countenances which announce minds fit for the higheſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſituations; and we cannot help regretting, that thoſe to whom they belong, have not received an edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation adequate to the natural abilities we are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced they poſſeſs, and been placed where theſe abilities could be brought into action.</p>
                     <p>Of all the countries in Europe, Switzerland is that, in which the beauties of nature appear in the greateſt variety or forms, and on the moſt magnificent ſcale. In that country, therefore, the young landſcape painter has the beſt chance of ſeizing the moſt ſublime ideas. But Italy is the beſt ſchool for the hiſtory painter, not only on account of its being enriched with the works of the greateſt maſters, and the nobleſt models of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique ſculpture; but alſo on account of the fine expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtyle of the Italian countenance.</p>

Strangers, on their arrival at Rome, from no high idea of the beauty of the Roman women, from the ſpecimens they ſee in the faſhionable circles to which they are firſt introduced. There are ſome exceptions; but in general it muſt be acknowledged, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent race of women of high rank, are more diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their other ornaments than by their beauty. Among the citizens, however, and the lower claſſes, you frequently meet with the moſt beautiful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. For a brilliant red and white, and all the charms of complexion, no women are equal to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. If a hundred, or any greater number, of Engliſh women were taken at random, and compared with the ſame number of the wives and daughters of the citizens of Rome, I am convinced, that ninety of the Engliſh would be found handſomer than ninety of the Romans; but the probability is, that two or three in the hundred Italians, would have finer countenances than any of the Engliſh. Engliſh beauty is more remarkable in the country than in towns. The peaſantry of no country in Europe can ſtand a compariſon, in point of looks, with thoſe of England. That race of people have the conveniencies of life in no other country in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; they are no where ſo well fed, ſo well defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the injuries of the ſeaſons, and no where elſe do they keep themſelves ſo perfectly clean, and free from all the vilifying effects of dirt. The Engliſh
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:031692_0292_0FEF2A0AC0408F58"/>
country girls, taken collectively, are unquestionably, the handsomest in the world. The female peasants of most other countries, indeed, are so hard worked, so ill fed, so much tanned by the sun, and so dirty, that it is difficult to know whether they have any beauty or not. Yet I have been informed, by some amateurs, since I came here, that, in spite of all these disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they sometimes find among the Italian peasantry, countenances highly interesting, and which they prefer to all the cherry cheeks of Lancashire.</p>
                     <p>Beauty, doubtless, is infinitely varied; and happily for mankind, their tastes and opinions on the subject are equally various. Notwithstanding this variety, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a style of face, in some measure peculiar to its own inhabitants, has been found to prevail in each differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nation of Europe. This peculiar countenance is again varied, and marked with every degree of discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination between the extremes of beauty and ugliness. I will give you a sketch of the general style of the most beautiful female heads in this country, from which you may judge whether they are to your taste or not.</p>
                     <p>A great profusion of dark hair, which seems to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the forehead, rendering it short and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; the nose generally either aquiline, or continued in a straight line from the lower part of the brow; a full and short upper lip; (by the way nothing has a worse effect on a countenance, than a large interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nose and month;) the eyes are large, and of
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:031692_0293_0FEF2A1369911530"/>
a ſparkling black. The black eye certainly labours under one diſadvantage, which is that from the iris and pupil being of the ſame colour, the contraction and dilatation of the latter is not ſeen, by which the eye is abridged of half its powers. Yet the Italian eye is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully expreſſive; ſome people think it ſays too much. The complexion, for the moſt part, is of a clear brown, ſometimes fair, but very ſeldom florid, or of that bright fairneſs which is common in England and Saxony. It muſt be owned, that thoſe features which have a fine expreſſion of ſentiment and meaning in youth, are more apt than leſs expreſſive faces, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſoon ſtrong and maſculine. In England and Germany, the women, a little advanced in life, retain the appearance of youth longer than in Italy.</p>

                     <p>IN the afternoon a large party of us ſallied out to take a view of Pompey's Pillar, the theme of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, and the admiration of paſt times! Beſides my

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier Meillon, and ſome young gentleman of the French factory. We mounted the firſt aſſes that preſented themſelves for hire, and, attended by our Janizary, took the courſe we perſued yeſterday. We left the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent on our right, and preſently came among broken arches and long pavements, which are the remains of an aqueduct. Several towers reared up their diſmant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led heads on each ſide of us, whoſe appearance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces them to have been poſts of great importance and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>A number of ſtately pillars next engaged our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are placed in two parallel lines, and ſeem to have formerly ſupported ſome magnificent portico. The pillars are of granite, or Thebaic marble, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty feet high, of a ſingle ſtone; and we count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs than thirty of them ſtill ſtanding. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever choice theſe columns might be in any other place, they were but foils to the pillar which now appeared before us. We had been buried amid the ruins and the hills of ſand which the winds have thrown up, when leaving the city by the gate of Roſeto, we came unexpectedly upon the pillar. It is impoſſible to tell which is moſt worthy of admiration, the heighth, the workmanſhip, or the condition of this pillar. By the beſt accounts we can obtain, it is an hundred and tent
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:031692_0295_0FEF2A1C6A0B5DE0"/>
feet high. The ſhaft, which is of a ſingle ſtone of granite, is ninety feet, and the pedeſtal is twenty feet more. It is of the Corinthian order, which gives a beautiful dignity to its ſimplicity, rarely to be met with in modern architecture. It has ſuffered little or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury from time. The poliſh upon the ſhaft has won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully withſtood the buffeting of the tempeſt; and it promiſes to hand down a patriot name to the late poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of the ignorant native, who has no other trace of the fame of Pompey! The pedeſtal has been ſomewhat damaged by the inſtruments of travellers, who are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to poſſeſs a relic of this antiquity; and one of the volutes of the column was immaturely brought down about four years ago, by a prank of ſome Engliſh cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which is too ludicrous to paſs over.</p>
                     <p>The jolly ſons of Neptune had been puſhing about the cann on board one of the ſhips in the harbour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a ſtrange freak entered into one of their brains. The eccentricity of the thought occaſioned it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be adopted; and its apparent impoſſibility was but a ſpur for putting it into execution. The boat was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and with proper implements for the attempt, theſe enterpriſing heroes puſhed a ſhore to drink a bowl of punch on the top of Pompey's Pillar! At the ſpot they arrived, and many contrivances were propoſed to accompliſh the deſired point. But their labour was vain; and they began to deſpair of ſucceſs, when the
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:031692_0296_0FEF2A1DEF5E6760"/>
genius who ſtruck out the frolic, happily ſuggeſted the means of performing it. A man was diſpatched to the city for a paper kite. The inhabitants were by this time apprized of what was going forward, and flocked in crouds to be witneſſes of the addreſs and boldneſs of the Engliſh. The Governor of Alexandria was told, that theſe ſeamen were about to pull down Pompey's Pillar. But whether he gave them credit for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Roman warrior, or to the Turkiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he left them to themſelves, and politely anſwered, that the Engliſh were too great patriots to injure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Pompey.</p>
                     <p>He knew little, however, of the diſpoſition of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who were engaged in this undertaking. Had the Turkiſh empire roſe in oppoſition, it would not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, at that moment have detered them. The kite was brought, and flown ſo directly over the pillar, that when it fell on the other ſide, the ſtring lodged upon the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital. The chief obſtacle was now overcome. A two-inch rope was tied to one end of the ſtring, and drawn over the pillar by the end to which the kite was affixed. By, this rope one of the ſeamen aſcended to the top, and in leſs than an hour a kind of ſhroud was conſtructed, by which the whole company went up, and drank their punch amid the ſhouts of the aſtoniſhed multitude.</p>
                     <p>To the eye below, the capital of the pillar does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear capaple of holding more than one man upon it—
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:031692_0297_0FEF2A1F754F4B08"/>
but our ſeamen found it could contain no leſs than eight perſons very conveniently. It is aſtoniſhing that no accident befel theſe mad-caps, in a ſituation ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, as would have turned a landman giddy in his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſenſes. The only detriment which the pillar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was the loſs of the volute before mentioned, which came down with a thundering ſound, and was carried to England by one of the captains, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a lady who commiſſioned him for a piece of the pillar. The diſcovery which they made amply compenſated for this miſchief; as without their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the world would not have known at this hour, that there was originally a ſtatue on this pillar, one foot and ancle of which are ſtill remaining. The ſtatue was probably of Pompey himſelf; and muſt have been of a gigantic ſize, to have appeared of a man's proportion at ſo great a heighth.</p>
                     <p>There are circumſtances in this ſtory which might give it an air of fiction, were it not demonſtrated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt. Beſides the teſtimonies of many eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes, the adventurers themſelves have left us a token of the fact, by the initials of their names, which are very legible in black paint, juſt beneath the capital.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XLVI. OF THE MODERN PERSIANS.</head>
                     <p>THE modern Perſians are robuſt, warlike, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and are now become all ſoldiers. They are natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inclined to temperance; and with regard to diet, ſeem to be more in a ſtate of nature than the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. By way of amuſement they uſe opiates, but not near ſo much as the Turks. They drink coffee in ſmall quantities with the lees, alſo ſherbets, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of cinnamon with ſugar. Their ſimplicity of life generally renders their domeſtic expence eaſy. The Perſians, however, underſtand very little of what we call prudence and oeconomical government.</p>
                     <p>In their common diſcourſes they often introduce moral ſentences, and poetical narrations, extracted from their poets and other writers. It was formerly their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cuſtom to entertain their gueſts with favourite paſſages out of their poets. Reflection and repetition are the only means of ſtrengthening or ſupporting the memory. Cuſtom has made it a kind of pedantry in Europe to be frequent in the repetition of the wiſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings either of the ancient or modern divines, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or poets. But if, from the nature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, we ever ſtand in need of a monitor, what
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:031692_0299_0FEF2A29955405A0"/>
office is more conſiſtent than to render the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome rules of life familiar, by making them a part of our ordinary converſation? It might be wiſhed, that this practice were introduced among the Europeans, rather than the barrenneſs of diſcourſe we often find, or the irkſome and pernicious amuſement of cards.</p>
                     <p>Now I have mentioned a circumſtance ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the great world in Europe, I muſt acknowledge that cards, in the original uſe of them, are confeſſedly as innocent as any other inſtrument of diverſion, to thoſe who are at a loſs for ſomething more rational<note n="§" place="bottom">I have ſomewhere heard, that cards were invented by a French courtier, to amuſe one of the kings of that nation, who was remarkably weak.</note>; yet in the manner now in faſhion, they cannot but diſſipate the thoughts in ſome, and enervate the mind in almoſt every one who is cloſely attached to them. They muſt be a great mean of feeding thoſe paſſions which corrode the heart, and warping the affections from their proper bias, oppoſe the eſtabliſhment of virtue in the mind. We often ſee this verified, though few will confeſs it. Is it poſſible, in the nature of the thing, that thoſe who give a conſtant application to this entertainment, eſpecially if they play high, can ſupport tranquility of mind? And in proportion as the mind is diſturbed, is it not diſqualified for the eſſential duties of life? This matter is beſt underſtood by thoſe
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:031692_0300_0FEE1C109DCE8DE0"/>
very perſons who play high, and conſume their time in this polite idleneſs. The Perſians ſeem to fall into the contrary extreme. They delight in ſitting ſtill and muſing. I never obſerved any of them walk in their apartments as the Europeans, and particularly the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, are uſed to do. I remember to have heard of a Turk, who being on board an Engliſh man of war, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired very ſeriouſly if the people were troubled with an evil ſpirit? becauſe, ſays he, "they are never at reſt."</p>
                     <p>The perſians are polite, but extravagantly hyperbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical in their compliments. This indeed is peculiar to the Eaſtern nations; and the ſcripture, which partakes ſo much of that ſtyle, is known to be derived from that quarter. The perſians were celebrated for a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular genius to poetry, but war which has deſtroyed their morals and learning, ſeems alſo to have damped their poetic fire; though they have ſtill many traces of that fertility and ſtrength of imagination, for which in paſt times they were deſervedly famous. The ancient Perſians are recorded to have taught their children a moſt exact reverence for truth; but the preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are as notorious for falſehood. They poiſon with a ſweet meat, in always ſaying what is pleaſing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the truth. In their diſpoſitions they are chearful, but rather inclined to ſeriouſneſs than loud mirth. In this they are not ſo much the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as in their politeneſs and civility to ſtrangers. Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:031692_0301_0FEE1BD26A3F71E8"/>
is a part of their religion. On occaſions of the leaſt intercourſe, men of any diſtinction invite ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as well as their friends, to their table; and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable how they pride themſelves in other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of reſpect.</p>
                     <p>The Perſians, as well as the Turks, believe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic to have been the true religion before Chriſt, whom alſo they acknowledge to be a true prophet, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſent from God; but that the religion he taught was contained in a book, which, at Mahomet's coming, was taken by the angel Gabriel into heaven, and the Koran brought down in its ſtead. This however they do not attempt to prove. They ſay alſo, that Jeſus Chriſt did not die upon the croſs, but that another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was miraculouſly brought there in his place; thus confeſſing the truth of our Saviour's miſſion, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding it with abſurd fables.</p>
                     <p>The common people pray at break of day, noon, and ſun-ſet. The MULLAH, or High-Prieſt, when he goes to prayers, mounts a turret appointed for that purpoſe, which over tops the houſes; from whence at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, mid-day, and evening, he invokes the Supreme Being, by ſaying, "O <hi>God,</hi> there is but one <hi>God, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is his prophet, and <hi>Ali</hi> his friend." After repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe words three times, he makes a prayer to this effect: "Glory be to the Sovereign of the Univerſe, and to the Judge of the Laſt Day. We glorify thee.
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:031692_0302_0FEE1BD3F4336F10"/>
We beſeech thee to aſſiſt us in our neceſſities, to lead us in thy ways, and in the paths of righteouſneſs, and to prevent our falling into the ſnares of perdition."</p>
                     <p>I never obſerved that the Perſians have any marks of that falſe modeſty which prevails among Chriſtians of the beſt ſort, who, to avoid the imputation of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or hypocriſy, are as jealous to be ſeen on their knees, as afraid to commit any criminal action. If a bold maſculine piety, and a ſincere awful ſenſe of the Deity are very conſiſtent things, this falſe modeſty muſt be owing to an error in education.</p>
                     <p>The Perſians have ſome of the Jewiſh rites among them; and alſo this peculiarity, that when they pray, they never permit the image of any ſenſible object to lie before them; nor is it permitted to pray with any thing of gold about them, as if it was eſteemed an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of idolatry. They invoke the interceſſion of the departed ſouls of ſome of their prophets and pious men. They give one proof of religion vaſtly ſuperior to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; for I never could obſerve, that they mentioned the name of the Supreme Being except upon ſolemn occaſion; or at leaſt in a reſpectful manner.</p>
                     <p>The Turkiſh language is the moſt common in Perſia. In matters of learning they uſe the Arabian language, in which is depoſited the greateſt part of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for which the Perſians, were once diſtinguiſhed. The learned languages, familliar to Europeans, are not known amongſt them. As time ſeems to have made
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:031692_0303_0FEE1BD5801E51B8"/>
no change in the cuſtoms of Aſia, but the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners remain as we read of two thouſand years ago, ſo the language, particularly of the Perſian, has the ſame idiom and ſublimity of expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>They write as the Hebrews, from the right to the left, and often range their lines in an arbitrary manner; ſo that upon one leaf of paper they ſometimes write in ten different directions, and this only to ſhow the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's ability in obſerving the proportion of words and lines in each.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XLVII. OF THE MANNERS OF ORDERING SILK WORMS AT GHILAN IN PERSIA.</head>
                     <p>THE ſilk worm, as it is well known, takes its birth from an egg no bigger than a ſmall pin's head. In the month of March, when the ſun is already very warm, I obſerved the peaſants in Ghilan prepare to give life to the eggs, which they had preſerved during the winter, carrying them for the moſt part about them, in the warmeſt part of their bodies, and particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their arms. In ten or more days, according to the heat it receives, it becomes a maggot, and begins to ſeed. The ſhrub mulberry-trees, which are annually
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:031692_0304_0FEE1BDC95BB7A00"/>
produce the moſt tender and proper leaves for their food. In about forty days the worm arrives to its maturity, and winds itſelf by daily gradations into a pod of ſilk as big as a pigeon's egg.</p>
                     <p>When this egg is completely formed, which is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by the ſilence of the worm within, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focate it by covering it with blankets, or by the heat of the ſun; unleſs they wind off the ſilk immediately, for then warm water anſwers the ſame purpoſe. Some of them, however, muſt be permitted to live and perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the pod; for when it breaks from its encloſure, it caſts its ſeed or eggs, by means of which the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is preſerved. From the pods thus perforated, the ſilk cannot be wound off as from the others, but being prepared by pounding, it is ſpun off like cotton yarn. This ſilk we call <hi>kedge,</hi> the remains or refuſe of which is ſo inferior, as to admit only of being milled and made into ſilk wadding.</p>

                     <p>SOPHIA is one of the moſt beautiful towns in the Turkiſh empire, and famous for its hot baths, that are reſorted to both for diverſion and health. I ſtopped
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:031692_0305_0FEE1BDE1DBD1150"/>
there one day on purpoſe to ſee them, and deſigning to go incognito, I hired a Turkiſh coach. Theſe <hi>voitures</hi> are not at all like ours, but much more covenient for the country, the heat being ſo great that glaſſes would be very troubleſome. They are made a good deal in the manner of the Dutch ſtage-coaches, having wooden lattices painted and gilded, the inſide being alſo painted with baſkets and noſegays of flowers, intermixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with little poetical mottos. They are covered all over with ſcarlet cloth, lined with ſilk, and very often richly embroidered and fringed. This covering entirely hides the perſons in them, but may be thrown back at pleaſure, and thus permits the ladies to peep through the lattices. They hold four people very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, ſeated on cuſhions, but not raiſed.</p>
                     <p>In one of thoſe covered waggons I went to the bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe about ten o'clock. It was already full of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It is built of ſtone, in the ſhape of a dome, with no windows but in the roof, which gives light enough. There were five of theſe domes joined together, the outmoſt being leſs than the reſt, and ſerving only as a hall, where the portreſs ſtood at the door. Ladies of quality generally give this woman a crown or ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and I did not forget that ceremony. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling firſt into marble baſons, and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpoſe, which carried
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:031692_0306_0FEE1BE18C0AC768"/>
the ſtreams into the next room, ſomething leſs than this, with the ſame ſort of marble ſofas, but ſo hot with ſtreams of ſulphur proceeding from the baths joined to it, that it was impoſſible to ſtay there with one's clothes on. The two other domes were the hot baths, one of which had cocks of cold water turning into it, to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it to what degree of warmth the bather pleaſed to have.</p>
                     <p>I was in my travelling habit, which is a riding dreſs, and certainly appeared very extraordinary to them. Yet there was not one of them that ſhowed the leaſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe or impertinent, curioſity, but received me with all the obliging civility poſſible. I know no European court where the ladies would have behaved themſelves in ſo polite a manner to ſuch a ſtranger. I believe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, there were two hundred women, and yet none of thoſe diſdainful ſmiles, and ſatirical whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that never fail in our aſſemblies, when any body appears that is not dreſſed exactly in the faſhion.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſofas were covered with cuſhions and rich carpets, on which ſat the ladies; and on the ſecond their ſlaves behind them, but without any diſtinction of rank by their dreſs, all being in the ſtate of nature. Yet there was not the leaſt wanton ſmile or immodeſt geſture amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>They generally take this diverſion once a weak, and ſtay there at leaſt four or five hours, without getting
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:031692_0307_0FEE1BE4E859B258"/>
cold by immediatly coming out of the hot bath into the cool room, which was very ſurpriſing to me.</p>
                     <p>The lady that ſeemed the moſt conſiderable amongſt, them intreated me to ſit by her, and would fain have undreſſed me for the bath. I excuſed myſelf with ſome difficulty. They being, however, all ſo earneſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading me, I was at laſt forced to open my ſhirt and ſhow them my ſtays; which ſatisfied them very well; for I ſaw they believed I was locked up in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, and that it was not in my own power to open it; which contrivance they attributed to my huſband. I was charmed with their civility and beauty, and ſhould have been very glad to paſs more time with them, if I could have conveniently done it.</p>

<pb n="309" facs="unknown:031692_0309_0FEE1BEB9BC63AC0"/>
janizaries, with vaſt white feathers on-their heads, as alſo by the foot and horſe guards, and the royal garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are a very conſiderable body of men, dreſſed in different habits of fine lively colours, ſo that at a diſtance they appeared like a parterre of tulips. After them the aga of the janizaries, in a robe of purple vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, lined with ſilver tiſſue, his horſe led by two ſlaves richly dreſſed. Next to him the chief guardian of the ſeraglio ladies, in a deep yallow cloth (which ſuited very well to his black face) lined with fables. Laſt of all came his ſublimity himſelf, arrayed in green, lined with the ſur of a black Muſcovite fox, which is ſuppoſed worth a thouſand pounds ſterling, and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a fine horſe, with furniture embroidered with jewels. Six more horſes richly capariſoned were led with him, and two of his principal courtiers bore, one his gold, and the other his ſilver coffee-pot on a ſtaff.

                     <p>IN this country it is ſurpriſing to ſee a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is not very handſome. They have naturally the moſt beautiful complexion in the world, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally large black eyes: I can with great truth aſſert, that the court of England (though I believe it the faireſt in Chriſtendom) does not contain ſo many beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are under our protection here. They generally ſhape their eye-brows, and both Greeks and Turks have the cuſtom of putting round their eyes a black tincture, that at a diſtance, or by candle-light, adds very much to the blackneſs of them. I fancy many of our ladies would be over-joyed to know this ſecret; but it is too viſible by day. They dye their nails a roſe colour: but I own I cannot enough accuſtom myſelf to this faſhion to find any beauty in it.</p>
                     <p>Their hair hangs at its full length behind, divided into treſſes, braided with pearl or ribbon, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:031692_0311_0FEE1BF4241EBC10"/>
in great quantity. I never ſaw in my life ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fine heads of hair. In one lady's I have counted one hundred and ten of the treſſes all natural; but it muſt be owned that every kind of beauty is more common here than with us.</p>
                     <p>The head-dreſs is compoſed of a cap called <hi>talpock,</hi> which is in winter of fine velvet embroidered with pearls or diamonds, and in ſummer, of a light ſhining ſilver ſtuff. This is fixed on one ſide of the head, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little way down, with a gold taſſel, and bound on either ſide with a circle of diamonds, or a rich embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered handkerchief. On the other ſide of the head the hair is laid flat; and here the ladies are at liberty to ſhow their fancies, ſome putting flowers, others a plume of heron's feathers, and, in ſhort, what they pleaſe; but the moſt general faſhion is a large bouquet of jewels, made like natural flowers, that is, the buds of pearl, the roſes of different coloured rubies, the jeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins of diamonds, and the jonquils of topazes, ſo well let and enamelled, that it is hard to imagine any thing of the kind ſo beautiful.</p>
                     <p>As to their morality, or good conduct, I can ſay, like Harlequin, that it is juſt as it is with you; and the Turkiſh ladies do not commit one ſin the leſs for not being Chriſtians. Now, that I am a little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their ways, I cannot forbear admiring either the examplary diſcretion, or extreme ſtupidity, of all
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:031692_0312_0FEE1BF5AC7F1148"/>
the writers that have given accounts of them. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſy to ſee they have in reality more liberty than we have. No woman, of what rank ſoever, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go into the ſtreets without two <hi>murlins,</hi> one that covers her face all but her eyes, and another that hides the whole dreſs of her head, and hangs half way down her back. Their ſhapes are alſo wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by a thing they call a <hi>ferigee,</hi> which no woman of any ſort appears without. This has ſtrait ſleeves that reach to their finger-ends, and it laps all round them, not unlike a riding-hood. In winter it is of cloth, and in ſummer, of plain ſtuff or ſilk. You may gueſs then how effectually this diſguiſes them; ſo that there is no diſtinguiſhing the great lady from her ſlave. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the moſt jealous huſband to know his wife when he meets her, and no man dare touch or follow a woman in the ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>This perpetual maſquerade gives them entire liberty of following their inclinations without danger of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. The great ladies ſeldom let their gallants know who they are! and it is ſo difficult to find it out that they can very ſeldom gueſs at her name, whom they have correſponded with for above half a year together. You may eaſily imagine the number of faithful wives very ſmall in a country, where they have nothing to fear from a lover's indiſcretion, ſince we ſee ſo many have the courage to expoſe themſelves to that in this
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:031692_0313_0FEE1BF733FCB740"/>
world, and all the threatened puniſhment in the next, which is never preached to the Turkiſh damſels. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they much to apprehend from the reſentment of their huſbands; thoſe ladies that are rich having all the money in their own hands.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, I look upon the Turkiſh women as the only free people in the empire. The very divan pays reſpect to them; and the Grand Signior himſelf, when a baſſa is executed, never violates the privileges of the harem, or women's apartment, which remains unſearched and entire to the widow. They are queens of their ſlaves, whom the huſband has no permiſſion ſo much as to look upon, except it be an old woman or two that his lady chuſes. It is true, their law permits them four wives; but there is no inſtance of a man of quality that makes uſe of this liberty, or of a woman of rank that would ſuffer it.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee the manners of mankind do not differ ſo widely as our voyage writers would make us believe. Perhaps it would be more entertaining to add a few ſurpriſing cuſtoms of my own invention; but nothing ſeems to me ſo agreeable as truth, and I believe nothing ſo acceptable to you.</p>

Every twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paces you may ſee one of theſe little companies liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to the daſhing of the river; and this taſte is ſo univerſal, that the very gardeners are not without it.

It is not that they ever read romances; but theſe are the ancient amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here, and as natural to them, as cudgel-playing and foot-ball to our Britiſh ſwains, the ſoftneſs and warmth of the climate forbidding all rough exerciſes, which were never ſo much as heard of amongſt them, and naturally inſpiring a lazineſs and averſion for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which the great plenty indulges. Theſe garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are the only happy race of country people in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key. They furniſh all the city with fruits and herbs, and ſeem to live very eaſily. They are moſt of them Greeks, and have little houſes in the midſt of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, where their wives and daughters take a liberty not permitted in the town, I mean, to go unveiled. Theſe girls are very neat and handſome, and paſs the time at their looms under the ſhade of the trees.</p>
                     <p>I no longer look upon Theocritus as a romantic wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:031692_0317_0FEE1C085AB7EF70"/>
He has only given a plain image of the way of life among the peaſants of his country, who, before oppreſſion had reduced them to want, were, I ſuppoſe, all employed as the better ſort of them are now. I do not doubt, had he been born a Briton, but his Idyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liums had been filled with deſcriptions of threſhing, and churning, both which are unknown here, the corn being all trod out by oxen; and butter (I ſpeak it with ſorrow) unheard of.</p>

                     <head>SECT. LII. OF THE ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY THE GRAND VIZIER'S LADY.</head>
                     <p>AT Adrianople I was invited to dine with the Grand Vizier's lady, and it was with a great deal of pleaſure I prepared myſelf for an entertainment, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before given to any Chriſtian. I thought I ſhould very little ſatisfy her curioſity, (which I did not doubt was a conſiderable motive to the invitation,) by going in a dreſs ſhe was uſed to ſee, and therefore dreſſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the court-habit of Vienna, which is much more magnificent than ours. However, I choſe to go <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> to avoid any diſputes about ceremony, and went in a Turkiſh coach, attended only by my woman that held up my train, and the Greek lady who was my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="318" facs="unknown:031692_0318_0FEE1C09E32DD430"/>
I was met at the court-door by her black eunuch, who helped me out of the coach with great reſpect, and conducted me through ſeveral rooms, where her female ſlaves, finely dreſſed, were ranged on each ſide. In the innermoſt I found the lady ſitting on her ſofa, in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble veſt. She advanced to meet me, and introduced me to half a dozen of her friends with great civility. She ſeemed a very good woman, near fifty years old. I was ſurpriſed to obſerve ſo little magnificence in her houſe, the furniture being all very moderate, and except the habits and number of her ſlaves nothing about her appeared expenſive. She gueſſed at my thoughts, and told me ſhe was no longer of an age to ſpend either her time or money in ſuperfluities; that her whole expenſe was in charity, and her whole employment praying to God. There was no affectation in this ſpeech. Both ſhe and her huſband are entirely given up to devotion. He never looks upon any other woman, and what is much more extraordinary, touches no bribes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the example of all his predeceſſors. He is ſo ſcrupulous on this point, he would not except Mr. W—'s preſent, till he had been aſſured over and over, that it was a ſettled perquiſite of his place at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of every ambaſſador. She entertained me with all kind of civility till dinner came in, which was ſerved one diſh at a time, to a vaſt number, all finely dreſſed after their manner, which I do not think ſo bad, as it has been ſometimes repreſented.</p>

                        <pb n="319" facs="unknown:031692_0319_0FEE1C0B6A88A048"/>
I am a very good judge of their eating, having lived three weeks in the houſe of an <hi>effendi</hi> at Belgrade who gave us very magnificent dinners, dreſſed by his own cooks. The firſt week they pleaſed me extremely; but I own I then began to grow weary of their table, and deſired our own cook might add a diſh or two after our manner. But I attribute this to cuſtom, and am very much inclined to believe, that an Indian, who had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er taſted of either, would prefer their cookery to ours. Their ſauces are very high, and all the roaſt very much done. They uſe a great deal of very rich ſpice. The ſoup is ſerved for the laſt diſh, and they have at leaſt as great a variety of ragouts as we have. I was very ſorry I could not eat of as many as the good lady would have had me, who was very earneſt in ſerving me of every thing. The treat concluded with coffee and perfumes, which is a high mark of reſpect; two ſlaves kneeling, perfumed my hair, clothes, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief. After this ceremony ſhe commanded her ſlaves to play and dance, which they did with their guitars in their hands; and ſhe excuſed to me their want of ſkill, ſaying ſhe took no care to accompliſh them in that art, I returned her thanks, and ſoon after took my leave.</p>

                     <head>SECT. LIII. OF CONSTANTINOPLE.</head>
                     <p>I HAD the advantage of very fine weather all my journey from Adrianople to this city. The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior furniſhed us with thirty covered waggons for our baggage, and five coaches of the country for my women. We found the road full of the great ſaphis, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipages, coming out of Aſia to the war. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways travel with tents; but I choſe to lie in houſes all the way. I will not trouble you with the names of the villages we paſſed, in which there was nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but at Ciorlei, where there was a little ſeraglio, built for the uſe of the Grand Signior when he goes this road. I had the curioſity to view all the apartments deſtined for the ladies of his court. They were in the midſt of a thick grove of trees made freſh by fountains. But I was moſt ſurpriſed to ſee the walls almoſt cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with little diſtichs of Turkiſh verſe, written with pencils. I made my interpreter explain them to me, and I found ſeveral of them very well turned; though I eaſily believed him, that they had loſt much of their beauty in the tranſlation. One was literally thus in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh:

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reſt of our journey was through fine painted
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:031692_0321_0FEE1C15D060F670"/>
meadows, by the ſide of the ſea of Marmora, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Propontis.</p>
                     <p>A certain French author ſays, Conſtantinople is twice as big as Paris. It does not appear to me to be much bigger than London; I am apt to think it is not ſo populous. The burying-fields about it are certainly much larger than the whole city. It is ſurpriſing what a vaſt deal of land is loſt this way in Turkey. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have ſeen burying-places of ſeveral miles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to very inconſiderable villages, which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly great towns, and retain no other mark of their ancient grandeur than this diſmal one.</p>
                     <p>On no occaſion do they ever remove a ſtone that ſerves for a monument. Some of them are coſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, being of very fine marble. They ſet up a pillar, with a carved turbant on the top of it, to the memory of a man; and as the turbants, by their different ſhapes, ſhow the quality or profeſſion, it is in a manner putting up the arms of the deceaſed. Beſides, the pillar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bears an inſcription in gold letters. The ladies have a ſimple pillar without other ornaments, except thoſe that die unmarried, who have a roſe on the top of their monument. The ſepulchres of particular fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are railed in, and planted round with trees. Thoſe of the ſultans, and ſome great men, have lamps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly burning in them.</p>
                     <p>The exchanges are all noble buildings, full of fine
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:031692_0322_0FEE1C1758B97BA8"/>
alleys, the greateſt part ſupported with pillars, and kept wonderfully neat. Every trade has its diſtinct alley, where the merchandiſe is diſpoſed in the ſame order, as in the New Exchange at London. The jeweller's quarter ſhows ſo much riches, ſuch a vaſt quantity of diamonds, and all kinds of precious ſtones, that they dazzle the ſight. The embroiderer's is alſo very glittering, and people walk here as much for diverſion as buſineſs. The markets are moſt of them handſome ſquares, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well provided, perhaps better than in any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the world.</p>
                     <p>I have taken care to ſee as much of the ſeraglio here as is to be ſeen. It is on a point of land running into the ſea; a palace of prodigious extent, but very irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The gardens take in a large compaſs of ground, full of high cypreſs-trees, which is all I know of them. The buildings are all of white ſtone, leaded on the top, with gilded turrets and ſpires, which look very magnificent; and, indeed, I believe there is no Chriſtian king's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace half ſo large. There are ſix large courts in it, all built round, and ſet with trees, having galleries of ſtone; one of theſe for the guard, another for the ſlaves, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the officers of the kitchen, another for the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the fifth for the divan, and the ſixth for the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſtined for audiences. On the ladies ſide there are at leaſt as many more, with diſtinct courts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their eunuchs and attendants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="323" facs="unknown:031692_0323_0FEE1C18E049A000"/>
The climate about Conſtantinople, is delightful in the higheſt degree. I am now ſitting, on the fourth of January, with the windows open, enjoying the warm ſun-ſhine, while you are freezing over a ſad ſea-coal fire; and my chamber is ſet out with carnations, roſes, and jonquils, freſh from my garden.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſure of going in a barge to Chelſea is not comparable to that of rowing upon the canal of the ſea here, where, for twenty miles together down the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus, the moſt beautiful variety of proſpects preſent themſelves. The Aſiatic ſide is covered with fruit-trees, villages, and the moſt delightful landſcapes in nature. On the European ſtands Conſtantinople, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on ſeven hills. The unequal heights make it ſeem twice as large at it is, (though one of the largeſt cities in the world,) ſhowing an agreeable mixture of gardens, pine and cipreſs trees, palaces, moſques, and public buildings, raiſed one above another with as much beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and appearance of ſymmetry, as any perſon ever ſaw in a cabinet adorned by the moſt ſkilful hands, where jars ſhew themſelves above jars, mixed with canniſters, babies, and candleſticks. This is a very odd compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but it gives me an exact ideal of the thing.</p>

                     <p>HAVING often heard Venice repreſented as one of the moſt defenſible cities in the world, I took care to inform myſelf of the particulars in which its ſtrength conſiſts. And theſe I find are chiefly owing to its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſituation; for it has neither rocks nor fortifications near it, and yet is, perhaps, the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable town in Europe. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> about it ever frozen hard enough to bring over an army from the land-ſide; the conſtant flux and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the ſea, or the natural mildneſs of the climate, hindering the ice from gathering to any thickneſs; which is an advantage the Hollanders want; when they have laid all their country under water.</p>
                     <p>On the ſide that is expoſed to the Adriatic, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is ſo difficult to hit, that they have marked it out with ſeveral ſtakes driven into the ground, which they would not fail to cut, upon the firſt approach of an enemy's fleet. For this reaſon they have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the little iſlands, that lie at the entrance, to the beſt advantage, which might otherwiſe very eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the paſſes that lead to the city from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatic. Nor could an ordinary fleet with bomb-veſſels, hope to ſucceed againſt a place that has always in its arſenal a conſiderable number of gallies and men of war ready to put to ſea on a very ſhort warning. If we could therefore ſuppoſe them blocked up on all ſides, by a power too ſtrong for them, both by ſea and land, they would be able to defend themſelves againſt every thing but famine: and this would not be a little mitigated by the great quantities of fiſh that their ſeas abound with, and that may be taken up in the midſt of their very ſtreets; which is ſuch a natural magazine as few other places can boaſt of.</p>
                     <p>The city ſtands very convenient for commerce. It
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031692_0332_0FEE1C2EFB1CA8F0"/>
has ſeveral navigable rivers that run up into the body of Italy, by which they might ſupply a great many countries with fiſh and other commodities; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their opportunities for the Levant, and each ſide of the Adriatic. But notwithſtanding theſe conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, their trade is far from being in a flouriſhing condition for many reaſons. The duties are great that are laid on merchandiſes. Their nobles think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their quality to engage in traffic. Their merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who are grown rich, and able to manage great dealings, buy their nobility, and generally give over trade. Their manufactures of cloth, glaſs, and ſilk, formerly the beſt in Europe, are now excelled by thoſe of other countries. They are tenacious of old laws and cuſtoms to their great prejudice; whereas a trading nation muſt be ſtill for new changes and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, as different junctures and emergencies ariſe. The ſtate is at preſent very ſenſible of this decay in their trade, and as a noble Venetian, who is ſtill a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, told me, they will ſpeedily find out ſome meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to redreſs it: poſſibly by making a free port, for they look with an evil eye upon Leghorn, which draws to it moſt of the veſſels bound for Italy. They have hitherto been ſo negligent in this particular, that many think the Great Duke's gold has had no ſmall influence in their councils.</p>
                     <p>Venice has ſeveral particulars, which are not to be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031692_0333_0FEE1C325B241308"/>
found in other cities, and is therefore very entertaining to a traveller. It looks at a diſtance, like a great town half-floated by a deluge. There are canals èvery where croſſing it, ſo that one may go to moſt houſes either by land or by water. This is a very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to the inhabitants; for a gondola with two oars at Venice, is as magnificent as a coach and ſix horſes with a large equipage, in another country; beſides that it makes all other carriages extremely cheap. The ſtreets are generally paved with brick or freeſtone, and always kept very neat; for there is no carriage, not ſo much as a chair that paſſes through them. There is an innumerable multitude of very handſome—bridges, all of a ſingle arch, and without any fence on either ſide, which would be a great inconvenience to a city leſs ſober than Venice. One would indeed wonder that drinking is ſo little in vogue among the Venetians, who are in a moiſt air and a moderate climate, and have no ſuch diverſions as bowling, hunting, walking, riding, and the like exerciſes to employ them without doors. But as the nobles are not to converſe too much with ſtrangers, they are in no danger of learning it; and they are generally too diſtruſtful of one another for the freedoms that are uſed in ſuch kind of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>There are many noble palaces in Venice. Their furniture is not commonly very rich, if we except the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031692_0334_0FEE1C35B6FB7850"/>
pictures, which are here in greater plenty than in any other place in Europe, from the hands of the beſt maſters of the Lombard ſchool; as Titian, Paul Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſe, and Tintoret. The laſt of theſe is in greater eſteem at Venice than in other parts of Italy.</p>
                     <p>The rooms are generally hung with gilt leather, which they cover on extraordinary occaſions with ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry, and hangings of greater value. The flooring is a kind of red plaiſter made of brick ground to powder, and afterwards worked into mortar. It is rubbed with oil, and makes a ſmooth, ſhining, and beautiful ſurface. Theſe particulars are chiefly owing to the moiſture of the air, which would have an ill effect on other kinds of furniture, as it ſhows itſelf too viſibly in many of their fineſt pictures.</p>
                     <p>Though the Venetians are extremely jealous of any great fame or merit in a living member of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, they never fail of giving a man his due praiſes, when they are in no danger or ſuffering from his ambition. For this reaſon; though there are a great many monuments erected to ſuch as have been bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to the republic, they are generally put up after their deaths.

                     <p>The particular palaces, churches, and pictures of Venice, are enumerated in ſeveral little books that may be bought in the place, and have been faithfully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by many voyage-writers. When I was at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, they were putting out very curious ſtamps of the ſeveral edifices, which are moſt famous for their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or magnificence.</p>
                     <p>The arſenal of Venice is an iſland of about three miles round. It contains all the ſtores and proviſions for war that are not actually employed. There are clocks for their gallies and men of war, moſt of them full, as well as work-houſes for all land and naval pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. That part of it, where the arms are laid, makes a great ſhow, and was indeed very extraordinary about a hundred years ago; but at preſent a great part of its furniture is grown uſeleſs. There ſeem to be almoſt as many ſuits of armour as there are guns. The ſwords are old-faſhioned and unweildy, and the fire-arms fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with locks of little convenience, in compariſon of thoſe that are now in uſe. The Venetians pretend they could ſet out, in caſe of great neceſſity, thirty men of war, a hundred gallies, and ten galeaſſes, though I cannot conceive how they could man a fleet of half the number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:031692_0336_0FEE1C3E4FF6E230"/>
It was certainly a mighty error in this ſtate to effect ſo many conqueſts on the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> which has only ſerved to raiſe the jealouſy of the Chriſtian princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> and, about three hundred years ago, had like to have ended in the utter extirpation of the commonwealth; whereas had they applied themſelves, with the ſame politics and induſtry, to the increaſe of their ſtrength by ſea, they might perhaps have had all the iſlands of the Archipelago in their hands, and, by conſequence, the greateſt fleet, and the moſt ſeamen of any other ſtate in Europe. Beſides, that this would have given no jealouſy to the princes their neighbours, who would have enjoyed their own dominions in peace, and have been very well contented to have ſeen ſo ſtrong a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark againſt all the forces and invaſions of the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire.</p>
                     <p>The republic, however, will ſtill maintain itſelf, if policy can prevail upon force; for it is certain the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian ſenate is one of the wiſeſt councils in the world, though at the ſame time, if we believe the reports of ſeveral that have been well verſed in their conſtitution, a great part of their politics is founded on maxims, which others do not think conſiſtent with their hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to put in practice. The preſervation of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic is that to which all other conſiderations ſubmit. To encourge idleneſs and luxury in the nobility, to cheriſh ignorance and licentiouſneſs in the clergy, to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031692_0337_0FEE1C3FD97190A8"/>
keep alive a continual faction in the common people, to connive at the viciouſneſs and debauchery of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, to breed diſſenſions among the nobles of the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Firma,</hi> to treat a brave man with ſcorn and infamy; in ſhort, to ſtick at nothing for the public intereſt, are repreſented as the refined parts of the Venetian wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>Among all the inſtances of their politics, there is none more admirable than the great ſecrecy which reigns in their public councils. The ſenate is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as numerous as our houſe of commons, if we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon the ſitting members, and yet carries its reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions ſo privately, that they are ſeldom known till they diſcover themſelves in the execution. It is not many years ſince they had before them a great debate concerning the puniſhment of one of their admirals, which laſted a month together, and concluded in his condemnation; yet was there none of his friends, nor of thoſe who had engaged warmly in his defence, that gave him the leaſt intimation of what was paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, until he was actually ſeized, and in the hands of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>The carnival of Venice is every where talked of. The great diverſion of the place at that time, as well as on all other high occaſions, is maſking. The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who are naturally grave, love to give into the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and entertainments of ſuch ſeaſons, when diſguiſed in a falſe perſonage. They are, indeed, under a neceſſity
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031692_0338_0FEE1C4161CF22D8"/>
of finding out diverſions that may agree with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the place, and make ſome amends for the loſs of ſeveral pleaſures, which may be met with on the continent. Theſe diſguiſes give occaſion to abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of love-adventures; for there is ſomething more intriguing in the amours of Venice, than in thoſe of other countries; and I queſtion not but the ſecret hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of a carnival would make a collection of very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting novels.</p>
                     <p>Operas are another great entertainment of this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: the Italian poets, beſides the celebrated ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their tongue, have a particular advantage above the writers of other nations, in the difference of their poetical and proſe language. There are indeed ſets of phraſes which in all countries are peculiar to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; but among the Italians there are not only ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but a multitude of particular words, that never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into common diſcourſe. They have ſuch a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent turn and poliſhing for poetical uſe, that they drop ſeveral of their letters, and appear in another form, when they come to be ranged in verſe. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Italian Opera ſeldom ſinks into poorneſs of language, but, amidſt all the meanneſs and familiarity of the thoughts, has ſomething beautiful and ſonorous in the expreſſion. Without this natural advantage of the tongue, their preſent poetry would appear wretchedly low and vulgar, notwithſtanding the many
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031692_0339_0FEE1C42EA427B40"/>
ſtrained allegories that are ſo much in uſe among the writers of this nation. The Engliſh and French, who always uſe the ſame words in verſe as in ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, are forced to raiſe their language with meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors and figures, or by the pompouſneſs of the whole phraſe, to wear off any littleneſs that appears in the particular parts which compoſe it. This makes our blank verſe where there is no rhyme to ſupport the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, extremely difficult to ſuch as are not maſters in the tongue, eſpecially when they write on low ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and it is probably for this reaſon that Milton has made uſe of ſuch frequent tranſpoſitions, latiniſms, antiquated words and phraſes, that he might the better deviate from vulgar and ordinary expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>There is a cuſtom at Venice, which they tell me is particular to the common people of this country, of ſinging ſtanzas out of Taſſo. They are ſet to a pretty ſolemn time, and when one begins in any part of the poet, it is odd, but he will be anſwered by ſomebody elſe that overhears him. So that ſometimes you have ten or a dozen in the neighbourhood of one another, taking verſe after veſe and running on with the poem as far as their memories will carry them.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Holy Thurſday,</hi> among the ſeveral ſhows that are yearly exhibited, I ſaw one that is odd enough, and particular to the Venetians. There is a ſet of artiſans, who, by the help of ſeveral poles, which they lay acroſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031692_0340_0FEE1C4BC9CD5A88"/>
each others ſhoulders, build themſelves up into a kind of pyramid; ſo that you ſee a pile of men in the air of four or five rows riſing one above another. The weight is ſo equally diſtributed, that every man is very able to bear his part of it, the ſtories, if I may ſo call them, growing leſs and leſs as they advance higher and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. A little boy repreſents the point of the pyramid, who, after a ſhort ſpace, leaps off, with a great deal of dexterity, into the arms of one that catches him at the bottom. In the ſame manner the whole building falls to pieces. I have been the more particular on this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it explains the following verſes of Claudian, which ſhow that the Venetians are not the inventors of this trick.</p>

                     <p>YOU wiſh to have a juſt and circumſtantial account of the late calamity we have ſuſtained. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the accounts you have ſeen ſhould be incoherent and imperfect; for while the misfortune was recent, our minds were diſtracted with a thouſand fears and apprehenſions for the conſequences: indeed, people leſs alarmed and leſs gloomy than ourſelves might have admitted the apprehenſion of peſtilence and famine; the former, from the air being tainted from ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of putrid carcaſes both of men and cattle; and the latter from the country around us being deſtroyed, as well as our ſtock of proviſions and the fruit of the earth.</p>
                     <p>From the 17th of May, it blew hard from the N. E. but as bad weather is unuſual at ſuch a ſeaſon, we did not apprehend that it would become more ſerióus; but on the 19th at night it encreaſed to a hard gale; and on the 20th, in the morning, it blew a perfect hurricane, inſomuch that our houſes were preſently untiled, our
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031692_0342_0FEE1C4EDB34DBE8"/>
doors and windows beat in, and the railing and part of the wall of our incloſures blown down. A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eleven it came with violence from the ſea, and I preſently perceived a multitude of the inhabitants crowding toward my houſe, crying out that the ſea was coming in upon us. I caſt my eyes in that direction, and ſaw it approaching with great rapidity, bearing much the ſame appearance as the bar in Bengal river. As my houſe was ſituated very low I did not heſitate to abandon it, directing my ſteps towards the old Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in order to avail myſelf of the Terrace; for in that dreadful moment I could not ſo far reflect upon cauſes or effects, as to account for the phaenomenon, or to ſet bounds to its increaſe. I had indeed heard of a tradition among the natives, that about a century ago the ſea ran as high as the talleſt Palmira trees, which I have ever diſregarded as fabulous, till the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual appearance called it more forcibly to my mind. In my way to the old Factory, I ſtopped at the door of Mr. Boures' houſe, to appriſe the reſt of the gentlemen of their danger, and the meaſures I had concerted for my ſafety. They accordingly joined me; but before we attained the place of our deſtination, we were nearly intercepted by the torrent of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>. As the houſe is built on a high ſpot, and pretty well elevated from the ground, the water ran above a foot on the firſt floor, ſo we had no occaſion to have recourſe to the Terrace.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031692_0343_0FEE1C5405ACA300"/>
Between one and two o'clock the water began to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide a little, and continued gradually decreaſing till the body of it had retired; leaving all the low places, tanks, and wells, full of ſalt water. I think the ſea muſt have riſen fifteen feet above its natural level. About the time of the water ſubſiding, the wind favoured it by coming round to the ſouthward, from which point it blew the hardeſt. As the Factory-houſe was in a very ruinous ſtate, and ſhook exceedingly at every guſt, we were very anxious to get back to Mr. Boures' houſe. I attempted it twice, but found I had neither power nor ſtrength to combat the force of the wind, getting back with the greateſt difficulty to my former ſtation. About five o'clock during a ſhort lull, we happily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected our remove. It blew very hard the greateſt part of the night; at midnight it veered to the weſtward, and was ſo cold, that I thought we ſhould have periſhed as we reclined in our chairs.</p>
                     <p>The gale broke up towards the morning. I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe to you the ſcene that preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to our view, when day-light appeared: it was drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and horrid beyond deſcription. The trees were all blighted by the ſalt water, and the face of the country covered with ſalt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; yet it had more the appearance of having ſuffered by a blaſt of wind, or by the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of volcanos, than by an inundation of water, ſuch an effect had it in deſtroying the herbage and foilage of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031692_0344_0FEE1C592F8F0898"/>
every deſcription. Our houſes were found full of the inhabitants who had taken refuge therein, ſtripped of doors and windows, and quite open to the weather at top; the go-downs<note n="*" place="bottom">Stairs at the backs of the houſes to deſcend, in order to take water.</note> moſtly carried away and ſeveral ſubſtantial tiled houſes ſo complately leveled, as ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to afford a mark of their ever exiſting; but our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were light, when compared with thoſe of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringa,</hi> and the reſt of the villages nearer the ſea. At <hi>Coringa,</hi> out of four thouſand inhabitants, it is ſaid not more than twenty were ſaved, and thoſe moſtly on Mrs. Corſar's Terrace, and on the beams of Captain Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's houſe. Mr. Gideon Firth; Mr. George Day, and the Portugueſe Padré were, I believe, the only Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that were drowned. At firſt the ſea roſe gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it came in with the tide the people were not much alarmed; but when they found it ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſo as to render their ſituation dangerous, they mounted on the top of their Cadjan-houſes, till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> impelled by a ſtrong Eaſterly wind ruſhed in upon them moſt furiouſly, when all the houſes at the ſame awful moment gave way, and nearly four thouſand ſouls were launched into eternity. This tremendous ſcene was viſible from Mrs. Corſar's Terrace, over which the ſea ſometimes broke, and they were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in great danger from the drifting of veſſels and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031692_0345_0FEE1C5AB8151DE0"/>
heavy bodies, which muſt inevitably have brought down the houſe, had they come to contact. At the Dutch village of <hi>Jaggernaickporan,</hi> I hear the diſtreſs was very great, and that about a thouſand lives were loſt; many of the villages in the low country between <hi>Coringa</hi> and <hi>Jaggernaickporan</hi> were totally deſtroyed, and the inundation carried its dreadful effects as far to the northward as <hi>Apparah;</hi> but I do not hear that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lives were loſt at that place. The inundation pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated inland about ten coſs from the ſea in a direct line; but did little more damage to the weſtward of us than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the vegetation. It would be very difficult to aſcertain with any preciſion, the number of lives loſt in this dreadful viſitation; the moſt intelligent people I have conferred with on the ſubject, ſtate the loſs at from ten to twenty thouſand ſouls. This is rather an indefinite computation; but I think, if the medium be taken, it will then rather exceed than fall ſhort of the real loſs. They compute that a lack of cattle were drowned, and from the vaſt numbers I ſaw dead at <hi>Nellapilla,</hi> I can eaſily credit their aſſertion. For two or three days after the calimity, ſuch was the languor of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, not a Cooley or workman was to be procured at any price; it required our utmoſt exertion to get the dead bodies and the dead cattle buried with all poſſible ſpeed, to prevent the air being impregnated with putrid effluvia. This, to be ſure, was a taſk we could not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031692_0346_0FEE1C5C44C3AA60"/>
execute, except juſt in the villages. However, no bad effects have enſued, which I impute to the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual land winds that have blown ſtrongly for ſome time paſt. Theſe have the property of drying up the juices of dead bodies and preventing putrefaction, which muſt neceſſarily have been the conſequence in a damp air. It is extraordinary, that the vaſt track of low ground on the ſouth-ſide <hi>Guadavery,</hi> from <hi>Gotendy</hi> to <hi>Bundar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malanka,</hi> ſuffered very little from the inundation, and ſcarcely a perſon periſhed. This country lies ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly low, as to be flooded in many places by the common ſpring-tides, and a great deal of it is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence covered with ſalt jungle. It is probable they owe their ſafety to thoſe ſmall iſlands at the mouth of the <hi>Guadavery,</hi> as well as <hi>Point Guadavery</hi> itſelf which muſt have both contributed to break the force of the ſea.</p>
                     <p>When we had recovered from our conſternation on the 21ſt, we began to conſider how we ſhould be able to exiſt in ſuch a field of deſolation, as our wells were filled with ſalt water, our proviſions deſtroyed, and we found by digging in different places that no ſweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was to be procured; when it was diſcovered that Providence had ſo far interfered in our favour, as to bring down the freſhes at a very early and unuſual ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. From what accounts we could haſtily gather, we were appehenſive that the ſtores of rice were either
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031692_0347_0FEE1C5DCC4C7FA0"/>
much damaged or totally deſtroyed, as the rice go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downs and go marks are generally ſecured aginſt an accident leſs formidablé than this. However, the event has happily falſified our ſurmiſes, and proved our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation fallacious, for rice has hitherto been plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and not dear. The generous ſupplies that have been ſent us from the Preſidency, will, I truſt, ſecure us from ſerious want. Our markets have not yet been attended by a perſon with an article for ſale; but this is not to be wondered at, as our ſupplies were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed by the villages at no great diſtance inland; and theſe countries have been drenched ſufficiently in ſalt water to deſtroy their produce. The fiſher-men, a moſt uſeful body of people, inhabiting chiefly by the ſea-ſide, have been, almoſt totally extirpated; and we are thereby deprived of a very material part of our ſubſiſtance. Time alone can reſtore us to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts we have loſt, and we have reaſon to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that things have not turned out ſo bad as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. I have tired myſelf in attempting this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and I fear I have almoſt tired you in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of it. A great deal more might be ſaid upon the ſubject in a flowery garb; if it yields a moment's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement to my friend, my end is fully anſwered. The greateſt part of this intelligence you have already had in detail, but it is your deſire I ſhould bring it to one point of view. It is haſtily written, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurate;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031692_0348_0FEE1C6312B01E60"/>
but you will remember I was in a good deal of pain at the time of writing it, from an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in my legs, ſo had not ſufficient eaſe or leiſure to correct or tranſcribe it.</p>

                     <p>I AM very ſenſible, that it requires a longer reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at Venice, and better opportunities than I have had, to enable me to give a character of the Venetians. But were I to form an idea of them from what I have ſeen, I ſhould paint them as a lively ingenious people, extravagantly fond of public amuſements, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common reliſh for humour, and yet more attached to the real enjoyments of a life, than to thoſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on oſtentation, and proceed from vanity.</p>
                     <p>The common people of Venice diſplay ſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties very rarely to be found in that ſphere of life, being remarkably ſober, obliging to ſtrangers, and gentle in their intercourſe with each other. The Venetians in general are tall and well made. Though equally ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031692_0349_0FEE1C6A0B312490"/>
they are not ſo corpulent as the Germans. The latter alſo are of fair complexions, with light grey, or blue eyes; whereas the Venetians are for the moſt part of a ruddy brown colour, with dark eyes. You meet in the ſtreets of Venice many fine manly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, reſembling thoſe tranſmitted to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s by the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Paul Veroneſe and Titian. The women are of a fine ſtile of countenance, with expreſſive features, and a ſkin of rich carnation. They dreſs their hair in a fanciful manner, which becomes them very much. They are of an eaſy addreſs, and have no averſion to cultivating an acquaintance with thoſe ſtrangers who are preſented to them by their relations, or have been properly recommended.</p>
                     <p>Strangers are under leſs reſtraint here, in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, than the native inhabitants. I have known ſome, who, after having tried moſt of the capitals of Europe, have prefered to live at Venice on account of the variety of amuſements, the gentle manners of the inhabitants, and the perfect freedom allowed in every thing, except in blaming the meaſures of government. When a ſtranger is ſo imprudent as to declaim againſt the form or the meaſures of government, he will either receive a meſſage to leave the territories of the ſtate, or one of the Sbirri will be ſent to accompany him to the Pope's or the Emperor's dominions.</p>
                     <p>The houſes are thought inconvenient by many of

the Engliſh. They are better calculated, however, for the climate of Italy, than if they were built according to the London model, which, I ſuppoſe, is the plan thoſe critics approve. The floors are of a red plaiſter, with a brilliant gloſſy ſurface, much more beautiful than wood, and far preferable in caſe of fire, whoſe progreſs they are calculated to che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The principal apartments are on the ſecond floor. The Venetians ſeldom inhabit the firſt, which is often entirely filled with lumber. Perhaps they prefer the ſecond, becauſe it is fartheſt removed from the moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the lakes; or perhaps they prefer it becauſe it is better lighted and more cheerful: or they may have ſome better reaſon for this preference than I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, or can imagine.</p>
                     <p>Though the inhabitants of Great Britain make uſe of the firſt floors for their chief apartments, this does not form a complete demonſtration that the Venetians are in the wrong for prefering the ſecond. When an acute ſenſible people univerſally follow one cuſtom, in a mere matter of conveniency, however abſurd that cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom may appear in the eyes of a ſtranger at firſt ſight, it will generally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

circumſtance, they often ſee reaſon to approve what they had formerly condemned. Cuſtom and faſhion have the greateſt influence on our taſte of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or excellence of every kind. What from a variety of cauſes has become the ſtandard in one country, is ſometimes juſt the contrary in another. The ſame thing that makes a low-brimmed hat appear genteel at one time, and ridiculous at another, has made a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpecies of verſification be accounted the model of perfection in old Rome and modern Italy, at Paris, or at London. In matters of taſte, particularly in drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic poetry, the prejudices which each particular nation acquires in favour of its own, are difficult to be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. People ſeldom obtain ſuch a perfect knowledge of a foreign language and foreign manners, as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all the niceties of the one and the alluſions to the other. In conſequence of this, many things are inſipid to them, for which a native may have a high reliſh.</p>
                     <p>The dialogues in rhime of the French plays, appear unnatural and abſurd to Engliſhmen, when they firſt attend the French theatre; yet thoſe who have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long in France, and acquired a more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the language, aſſure us, that without rhime the dignity of the tragic muſe cannot be ſupported and that, even in comedy, they produce an addition: elegance, which overbalances every objection. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

French language being more ſtudied and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Engliſh, than our languag is by the French nation, we find many of our countrymen who reliſh the beauties and pay the juſt tribute of admiration to the genius of Corneille, while there is ſcarcely a ſingle Frenchman to be found, who has any idea of the merit of Shakeſpeare.</p>
                     <p>Without being juſtly accuſed of partiallity, I may aſſert, that in this inſtance the Engliſh diſplay a fairneſs and liberality of ſentiment ſuperior to the French. The irregularities of Shakeſpeare's drama are obvious to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery eye, and would, in the preſent age, be avoided by a poet not poſſeſſed of an hundredth part of his genius. His peculiar beauties on the other hand, are of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence which has not, perhaps, been attained by any poet of any age or country. Yet the French critics, from Voltaire down to the pooreſt ſcribbler in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erary journals, all ſtop at the former, declaim on the barbarous taſte of the Engliſh nation, inſiſt on the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque abſurdity of the poet's imagination, and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate both by partial extracts of the moſt exceptionable ſcenes of Shakeſpeare's plays.</p>

that there poſſibly was ſome excellence in the works of this poet, though they could not ſee it; and a very moderate ſhare of candour might have taught them, that it would be more becoming to ſpare their ridicule till they acquired little more knowledge of the author againſt whom it is pointed.</p>
                     <p>An accident which occured ſince my arrival at Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, though founded on a prejudice much more excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the conduct of the critics abovementioned, has brought home to my conviction the raſhneſs of thoſe who form opinions, without the knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to direct their judgment.</p>
                     <p>I had got, I don't know how, the moſt contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion of the Italian drama. I had been told, there was not a tolerable actor at preſent in Italy; and I had been long taught to conſider their comedy as the moſt deſpicable ſtuff in the world, which could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe, or even draw a ſmile from any perſon of taſte, being quite deſtitute of true humour, full of ribaldry, and only proper for the meaneſt of the vulgar. Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with theſe ſentiments, I went with a party to the ſtage-box of one of the playhouſes the very day of our arrival at Venice.</p>
                     <p>The piece was a comedy, and the moſt entertaining character in it was that of a man who ſtuttered. In this defect, and in the ſingular grimaces with which the actor accompanied it, conſiſted a great part of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement.</p>

                     <p>While we inwardly indulged ſentiments of ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, on account of the refinement and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of our own taſte, and ſupported the dignity of thoſe ſentiments by a diſdainful gravity of countenance, the ſtutterer was giving a piece of information to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequin, which greatly intereſted him, and to which he liſtened with every mark of eagerneſs. This unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſpeaker had juſt arrived at the moſt important part of his narrative, which was, to acquaint the impatient liſtener where his miſtreſs was concealed, when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily ſtumbled on a word of ſix or ſeven ſyllables which completely obſtructed the progreſs of his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He attempted it again and again, but always without ſucceſs. Though many other words might explain the meaning equally well, it is as eaſy to make a ſaint change his religion, as prevail on a ſtutterer to accept of another word in place of that at which he has ſtumbled. He adheres to his firſt word to the laſt, and will ſooner expire with it in his throat, than give it up for any other you may offer. Harlequin, on the preſent occaſion, preſented his friend with a dozen, but he rejected them all with diſdain, and perſiſted in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031692_0355_0FEE1C9DF21EB040"/>
his unſucceſsful attempts on that which had firſt come in his way. At length, making a deſperate effort, when all the ſpectators were gaping in expectation of his ſafe delivery, the cruel word came up with its broad-ſide foremoſt, and ſtuck directly acroſs the unhappy man's wind-pipe. He gaped, and panted, and croaked; his face fluſhed, and his eyes ſeemed ready to ſtart from his head. Harlequin unbuttoned the Stutterer's waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, and the neck of his ſhirt; he fanned his face with his cap, and held a bottle of hartſhorn to his noſe. At length, fearing his patient would expire before he could give the deſired intelligence, in a fit of deſpair he pitched his head full in the dying man's ſtomach, and the word bolted out of his mouth to the moſt diſtant part of the houſe.</p>
                     <p>This was performed in a manner ſo perfectly droll, and the humorous abſurdity of the expedient came ſo unexpectedly upon me, that I immediately burſt into a moſt exceſſive fit of laughter, in which I was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by my friends; and our laughter continued in ſuch loud, violent, and repeated fits, that the attention of the audience being turned from the ſtage to our box, occaſioned a renewal of the mirth all over the playhouſe with greater vociferation than at firſt.</p>
                     <p>When we returned to the inn, I was aſked, if I were as much convinced as ever, that a man muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly devoid of taſte who could condeſcend to laugh at an Italian comedy?</p>

                     <p>THE view of Venice, at ſome little diſtance from the town, is mentioned by many travellers in terms of the higheſt admiration. I had been ſo often forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the amazement with which I ſhould be ſtruct at the firſt ſight of this city, that when I actually did ſee it, I felt little or no amazement at all. You will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſaid thoſe anticipators, a magnificent town; or more frequently, to make the deeper impreſſion, they gave it in detail;—You will behold, ſaid they, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent palaces, churches, towers and ſteeples, all ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the middle of the ſea. Well, this unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is an uncommon ſcene; and there is no manner of doubt that a town, ſurrounded by water, is a very fine ſight; but all the travellers that have exiſted ſince the days of Cain, will not convince me, that a town, ſurrounded by land, is not a much finer. Can there be any compariſon, in point of beauty, between the dull monotony of a watery ſurface and the delightful variety of gardens, meadows, hills and woods?</p>
                     <p>If the ſituation of Venice renders it leſs agreeable than another city, to behold at a diſtance, it muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, in a much ſtronger degree, leſs agreeable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031692_0357_0FEE1C84DF912958"/>
For you will pleaſe to recollect, that, inſtead of walking or riding in the fields, and enjoying the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance of herbs, and the melody of birds; when you wiſh to take the air here, you muſt ſubmit to be pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled about from morning to night, in a narrow boat, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long dirty canals; or, if you don't like this, you have one reſource more, which is, that of walking in St. Mark's Place.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the diſadvantages which Venice labours under, with regard to ſituation; but it has other pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities, which, in the opinion of many, overbalances them, and render it, on the whole, an agreeable town.</p>
                     <p>Venice is ſaid to be built in the ſea: that is, it is built in the midſt of ſhallows which ſtretch ſome miles from the ſhore, at the bottom of the Adriatic Gulph. Though thoſe ſhallows, being now all covered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have the appearance of one great lake, yet they are called Laguna, or lakes, becauſe formerly, as it is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, they were ſeveral. On ſailing on the Laguna, and looking to the bottom, many large hollows are to be ſeen, which, at ſome former period have, very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly been diſtinct lakes, though now, being all covered with a common ſurface of water, they form one large lake, of unequal depth. The intervals between thoſe hollows, it is ſuppoſed, were little iſlands, and are now ſhallows, which, at ebb, are all within reach of a pole.</p>
                     <p>When you approach the city, you come along a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031692_0358_0FEE1C866706B130"/>
road, marked by rows of ſtakes on each ſide, which direct veſſels, of a certain burthen, to avoid the ſhollows, and keep in deeper water. Theſe ſhallows are a better defence to the city than the ſtrongeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. On the approach of an enemy's fleet, the Venetians have only to pull up their ſtakes, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy can advance no farther. They are equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the inſult of a land army, even in the midſt of winter; for the flux and reflux of the ſea, and the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the climate, prevent ſuch a ſtrength of ice as could admit the approach of an army that way.</p>
                     <p>The lake in which Venice ſtands, is a kind of ſmall inner gulph, ſeparated from the large one by ſome iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands, at a few miles diſtance. Theſe iſlands, in a great meaſure, break the force of the Adriatic ſtorms, before they reach the Laguna; yet, in very high winds, the navigation of the lake is dangerous to gondolas, and ſometimes the gondoleers do not truſt themſelves, even on the canals within the city. This is not ſo great an inconveniency to the inhabitants, as you may imagine; becauſe moſt of the houſes have one door opening up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a canal, and another communicating with the ſtreet; by means of which, and of the bridges, you can go to almoſt any part of the town by land, as well as by water.</p>
                     <p>The number of inhabitants are computed at 150,000; the ſtreets in general are narrow; ſo are the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031692_0359_0FEE1C87F04DF398"/>
except the grand canal, which is very broad, and has a ſerpentine courſe through the middle of the city. They tell you, there are ſeveral hundred bridges in Venice. What paſs under this name, however, are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle arches thrown over the canals; moſt of them pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try enough.</p>
                     <p>The Rialto conſiſts alſo of a ſingle arch, but a very noble one, and of marble. It is built acroſs the grand canal, near the middle, where it is narroweſt. This celebrated arch is ninety feet wide on the level of the canal, and twenty-four feet high. Its beauty is impaired by two rows of booths, or ſhops, which are erected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and divide its upper ſurface into three narrow ſtreets. The view from the Rialto is equally lively and magnificent. The objects under your eye are the grand canal, covered with boats and gondolas, and flanked of each ſide with magnificent palaces, churches, and ſpires; but this fine proſpect is almoſt the only one in Venice; for except the grand canal, and the canal Regio, all the others are narrow and mean; ſome of them have no keys; the water literally waſhes the walls of the houſes. When you ſail along thoſe wretched canals, you have no one agreeable object to cheer the ſight; and the ſmell is overwhelmed with the ſtench which, at certain ſeaſons, exhales from the water.</p>

                     <p>ON our journey we paſſed through Ludlow, a fine, handſome town, which has an old caſtle, now in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected and ruinous ſtate; but which, by its remains, appears to have been once a very ſtrong fortreſs, and an habitation very ſuitable to the power and dignity of the Lord Preſident of Wales, who reſided there. Not far from this town is Okely park, belonging to Lord Powis, and part of that foreſt which Milton, in his maſque, ſuppoſed to have been inhabited by Comus and his rout. The god is now vanquiſhed; but, at the revolution of every ſeven years, his rout does not fail to keep up orgies there, and in the neighbouring town, as Lord Powis knows to his coſt, for he has ſpent twenty or thirty thouſand pounds in entertaining them at theſe ſeaſons, which is the reaſon that he has no houſe at this place fit for him to live in. He talks of building one in the park, and the ſituation deſerves it; for there are many ſcenes, which not only Comus, but the lady of Milton's maſque, would have taken delight in, if they had received the improvements they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable from a man of good taſte; but they are as yet very rude and neglected. In our way from hence to Montgomery, we paſſed through a country very roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031692_0361_0FEE1C90712D0510"/>
and pleaſant, in many ſpots; in which we ſaw farms ſo well ſituated, that they appeared to us more delightful ſituations than Clermont or Burleigh. At laſt we came by a gentleman's houſe, on the ſide of a hill opening to a ſweet valley; which ſeemed to be built in a taſte much ſuperior to that of a mere coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try eſquire. We therefore ſtopt and deſired to ſee it, which curioſity was well paid for. We found it the neateſt and beſt houſe of a moderate ſize that we ever ſaw. The maſter, it ſeems, was bred to law, quitted the profeſſion about fifteen years ago, and retired into the country upon an eſtate of five hundred pounds per annum, with a wife and four children; notwithſtanding which incumbrances, he found means to fit up the houſe in the manner we ſaw it, with remarkable ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and to plant all the hill about him with groves and clumps of trees, that, together with an admirable proſpect ſeen from it, render it a place which a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch might envy. But, to let you ſee how vulgar minds value ſuch improvement, I muſt tell you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer made by our guide, who was ſervant to Lord Powis's ſteward, and ſpoke, I preſume, the ſenſe of his maſter, upon our expreſſing ſome wonder that this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had been able to do ſo much with ſo ſmall a fortune; "I do not, ſaid he, know how it is, but he is always doing ſome nonſenſe or other." I apprehend, moſt of my neighbours will give the ſame account of my improvements at Hagley.</p>

Montgomery town is no better than a village; and all that remains of an old caſtle there, is about a third part of a ruinous tower: but nothing can be finer than the ſituation of it and the proſpect. It muſt have been exceedingly ſtrong in ancient times, and able to reſiſt all the forces of the Welſh: to bridle them it was built in the reign of William Rufus; three ſides of it are a precipice quit inacceſſible, guarded with a deep and broad ditch! I was ſorry that more of ſo noble a caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did not remain, but glad to think, that, by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating union with the Welſh, this and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which have been erected to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>From hence we travelled with infinite pleaſure (through the moſt charming country my eyes ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, or my imagination can paint) to Powis caſtle, part of which was burnt down about thirty years ago; but there are ſtill remains of a great houſe, ſituated ſo finely, and ſo nobly, that, were I in the place of Lord Powis, I ſhould forſake Okely park, with all its beauties, and fix my ſeat as near there, as the moſt el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igible in every reſpect. About three thouſand pounds laid out upon it, would make it the moſt auguſt place in the kingdom. It ſtands upon the ſide of a very high hill; below lies a vale of incomparable beauty,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031692_0363_0FEE1C97338FCC70"/>
with the Severn winding thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gh it, and the town of Welſh-Pool, terminated with high mountains. The oppoſite ſide is beautifully cultivated half way up, and green to the top, except in one or two hills, whoſe ſummits are rocky, and of groteſque ſhapes, that give variety and ſpirit to the proſpect. Above the caſtle is a long ridge of hills finely ſhaded, part of which is the park; and ſtill higher is a terrace, up to which you are led through very fine lawns, from whence you have a view that exceeds all deſcription.</p>
                     <p>The county of Montgomery, which lies within this view, is to my eyes the moſt beautiful in South Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and though I have not been in Scotland, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe I ſhall find any place there ſuperior, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, to it; becauſe the highlands are all uncultivated, and the lowlands want wood; whereas this country is admirably ſhaded with hedge-rows. It has a lovely mixture of corn fields and meadows, though more of the latter. The vales and bottoms are large, and the mountains, that riſe like a rampart all around, add a magnificence and grandeur to the ſcene, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you any horror or dreadful ideas, becauſe at Powis caſtle they appear at ſuch a diſtance as not to deſtroy the beauty and ſoftneſs of the country between them. There are indeed ſome high hills within that incloſure, but being woody and green, they make a more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variety, and take off nothing from the proſpect.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031692_0364_0FEE1C9C69AEFD70"/>
The caſtle has an old-faſhioned garden juſt under it, which a few alterations might make very pretty; for there is a command of water and wood in it, which may be ſo managed as to produce all the beauties that art can add to what liberal nature has ſo laviſhly done for this place.</p>
                     <p>We went from thence to ſee Peſtill Rhaider, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous caſcade; but it did not quite anſwer my expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, for though the fall is ſo high, the ſtream is but narrow, and it wants the complement of wood, the water falling like a ſpout on an even deſcent, down the middle of a wide naked rock, without any breaks to ſcatter the water. Upon the whole, it gave me but little pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>After having ſeen the Velino, we lay that night at the houſe of a gentleman, who had the care of Lord Powis's lead mines; it ſtands in a valley, which ſeems the abode of quiet and ſecurity, ſurrounded with very high mountains on all ſides; but in itſelf airy, ſoft, and agreeable. If a man was diſpoſed to forget the world, and be forgotten by it, he could not find a more proper place. In ſome of thoſe mountains are veins of lead ore, which have been ſo rich as to produce in time paſt, twenty thouſand pounds per annum, to the old Duke of Powis, but they are not near ſo valuable now. Perhaps you will object, that the idea of wealth dug up in this place does not conſiſt with that of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I agree it does not; but, all the wealth being
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031692_0365_0FEE1C9DF21EB040"/>
hid under ground, the eye ſees nothing there but peace and tranquilty.</p>
                     <p>The next morning we aſcended the mountain of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win, one of the higheſt in Wales; and when we came to the top of it, a proſpect opened to us, which ſtruck the mind with awful aſtoniſhment. Nature is in all her majeſty there; but it is the majeſty of a tyrant, frowning over the ruins and deſolation of a country. The enormous mountains, or rather rocks, of Merion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethſhire incloſed us all round. There is not upon theſe mountains a tree or ſhrub, or a blade of graſs; nor did we ſee any marks of habitations or culture in the whole place. Between them is a ſolitude fit for Deſpair to inhabit; whereas all we had ſeen before in Wales ſeemed formed to inſpire the meditations of love. We were ſome hours in croſſing this deſart, and then had the view of a fine woody vale, but narrow and deep through which a rivulet ran as clear and rapid as the Scotch burns, winding in very agreeable forms, with a very pretty caſcade. On the edge of this valley we travelled on foot, for the ſteepneſs of the road would not allow us to ride without ſome danger; and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour we came to a more open country, though ſtill incloſed with hills, in which we ſaw the town of Bala with its beautiful lake. The town is ſmall and ill-built; but the lake is a fine object. It is about three miles in length, and one in breadth;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031692_0366_0FEE1C9F7A7725D8"/>
the water of it is clear, and of a bright ſilver colour. The river Dee runs through very rich meadows; at the other end are towering high mountains; on the ſides are graſſy hills, but not ſo well wooded as I could wiſh them to be. There is alſo a bridge of ſtone built over the river, and a gentleman's houſe which embeliſhes the proſpect. But what Bala is moſt famous for is the beauty of its women; and indeed I there ſaw ſome of the prettieſt girls I ever beheld. The lake produces ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine trout, and a fiſh called <hi>whiting,</hi> peculiar to itſelf, and of a very delicate taſte.</p>
                     <p>After we left the banks of the lake, where we had an agreeable day, we got again into the deſart; but leſs horrid than I have already deſcribed, the vale being more fertile, and feeding ſome cattle. Nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occurred in our ride, until we came to Feſtiniog, a village in Merionethſhire, the vale before which is the moſt perfectly beautiful of all we had ſeen. From the heighth of this village you have a view of the ſea. The hills are green, and well ſhaded with wood. There is a lovely rivulet, which winds through the bottom; on each ſide are meadows, and above are corn fields a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſides of the hills; at each end are high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which ſeemed placed there to guard this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retreat againſt any invaders. With the women one loves, with the friend of one's heart, and a good ſtudy of books, one might paſs an age there, and think
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031692_0367_0FEE1CA106697EA8"/>
it a day. If one has a mind to live long and renew his youth, let him come and ſettle at Feſtiniog. Not long ago there died in that neighbour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When we had ſkirted this happy vale an hour or two, we came to a narrow branch of the ſea, which is dry at low water. As we paſſed over the ſands we were ſurpriſed to ſee that all the cattle preferred that barren place to the meadows. The guide ſaid it was to avoid a fly, which in the heat of the day came out of the woods, and infeſted them in the valleys. The view of the ſaid ſands is terrible, as they are hemmed in on each ſide with very high hills, but broken into a thouſand irregular ſhapes. At one end is the ocean, at the other the formidable mountains of Snowdon, black and naked rocks, which ſeemed to be piled one above another. The ſummits of ſome of them are covered with clouds, and cannot be aſcended. They do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtrongly excite the idea of Burnet, of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fragment of a demoliſhed world.</p>
                     <p>In the evening we rode along the ſea coaſt, which is here very cold. The grandeur of the ocean, correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that of the mountains, formed a majeſtic and

ſolemn ſcene; ideas of immenſity ſwelled and exalted our minds at the ſight; all leſſer objects appeared mean and trifling, ſo that we could hardly do juſtice to the ruins of an old caſtle, ſituated upon the top of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical hill, the foot of which is waſhed by the ſea, and which has every feature that can give a romantic ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                     <p>Next morning being fair, we ventured to climb up to the top of the mountain, not indeed ſo high as Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which is here called <hi>Moel Guidon,</hi> that is, the neſt of the eagle; but one degree lower than that called <hi>Moel Happock,</hi> the neſt of the hawk; from whence we ſaw a Phaenomenon, new to our eyes, but common in Wales; on the one ſide was midnight, on the other bright day. The whole extent of the mountain of Snowdon, on our left hand, was wrapped in clouds, from top to bottom; but on the right the ſun ſhone moſt gloriouſly over the ſea-coaſt of Carnarvon. The hill we ſtood upon was perfectly clear, and the way we came up a pretty eaſy aſcent; but before us was a precipice of many hundred yards, and below, a vale, which though not cultivated, has much ſavage beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the ſides were ſteep, and fringed with low wood.</p>
                     <p>There were two little lakes, or rather large pools, that ſtood in the bottom, from which iſſued a rivulet, that ſerpentined in view for two or three miles, and was a pleaſing relief to the eyes.</p>

                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:031692_0369_0FEE1CAB622ACBB0"/>
But the moutains of Snowdon, covered with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and thick clouds, called to my memory the fall of Mount Sinai, with the laws delivered from it, and filled my mind with religious awe.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I arrived at Carnarvon, I had a very fine view of the ſea, and one of the fineſt towns I had ſeen in England or Wales; the old walls of which, with the towers and bulwarks, are almoſt entire; they are high and ſtrongly built. The towers are round, and rather more of the Roman than the Gothic form of architecture. At one end they join to the wall of the caſtle, which is a vaſt and noble building, of which the outſide is likewiſe well preſerved, but the inſide is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed. The people here ſhow the remains of a chamber, where King Edward II. was born, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſubmiſſion of all the nobility in Wales in his cradle. The caſtle itſelf was built by his father, and is indeed a noble work.</p>
                     <p>As we rode from Carnarvon, the country about was

                        </gap>ence of the moſt pleaſing kind, and was rendered more ſo by the contraſt with that from which we came. We travelled along the ſhore of Menai, an arm of the ſea, as broad as the Thames, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Lord Duncannon's. Our road led us over fine ſhady lawns, perfumed ſo with honey ſuckles, that they were a <hi>Paradiſſetto;</hi> and over gentle hills, from whence we had a lovely view of the Menai and the iſle of Angleſea, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies on the oppoſite ſide of it, and then loſt them again in agreeable valleys, like thoſe of Reading, or the Hertfordſhire vales. We enjoyed theſe ſcenes for ſome miles, till we came to a ferry, by which we paſſed into Angleſea, and landed at the ſeat of Sir Nicholas Bayley, which is the pleaſanteſt ſpot in the iſland. He has Gotheriſed an old houſe with good judgment and taſte. The view from it is charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He ſees the ſweet country, through which we had travelled, from Carnarvon to Snowdon above it, which ennobles the proſpect; the Menai winds in a moſt beautiful manner, juſt under his windows; his woods ſhade the banks of it on each ſide, quite down to the water; above which, intermixed with them, are ever-green lawns, which, if helped with a very little art, would, together with his wood, make a garden or park, of the moſt perfect beauty; but all is yet in a rude and neglected ſtate. From thence we went to Baronhill, the ſeat of Lord Bulkeley, above the town
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031692_0371_0FEE1CB223A365D8"/>
of Beaumaris, in the ſame iſland, it has a view of the ſea, and coaſt of Carnarvon, which is indeed very fine, but I think inferior to that of Lord Edgecomb's, with which I have heard it compared. The houſe is a bad one; the gardens are, made in a very fine taſte; but upon the whole, I like it much leſs than Sir N. Bailey's, though the reputation of the former is greater in Wales.</p>
                     <p>All the reſt of the iſle of Angleſea is a naked and unpleaſant country, without a tree or hedge to be ſeen in it, uncultivated ſtill, from the obſtinacy of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in adhering to the ignorance of their forefathers; ſo that I am told it does not produce the tenth part of what the land is capable if improved by the agriculture of England. From Beaumaris we rode over the lands, at low water to Penman Mawr, a high and rocky moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the paſſage over which muſt have been very fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, before they built a wall along the edge of the wood, which ſecures you from the danger of falling down the precipice that is below it into the ſea; but with this guard it is very agreeable, the proſpect of the ſea and country being very fine.</p>
                     <p>I never ſaw any thing that ſtruck me more than the firſt view of Conway caſtle, to which we ſoon came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſing this mountain. It was built by Edward the Firſt, in much the ſame ſtyle with that of Carnarvon; but ſtronger and more regular. The ſituation is noble, and it ſtands upon a rock of conſiderable heighth; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031692_0372_0FEE1CB758DC3E18"/>
of a ditch, three ſides of it are defended by an arm of the ſea, and four turrets that riſe above the towers, beſides two others at one end ſtanding below the others, about the middle of the rock that over-hangs the ſea. The walls between are battlements, and look ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong; they are, in ſome places, fourteen or fifteen feet thick, in none leſs than twelve. The whole to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether hath the grandeſt appearance of any building I ever beheld, eſpecially as the walls of the town, which are built like thoſe of Carnarvon, but with bolder and handſomer towers, appear right in one view to the eye with the caſtle, when firſt you approach it. All the outſide remains, except one tower, as in the time of Edward the firſt; and that was not demoliſhed either with battering engines or with cannons, but by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the place taking ſtones from the foundation, for their own uſe, whenever they pleaſed; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which was, that the greateſt part of the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfell into the ſea. But the upper part more ſurpriſingly continues ſtill firm in the form of an arch; and Lord Hertford, the preſent proprietor, hath forbid any dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appidation for the future. We were told his grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have lived in this caſtle, could he have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed any lands in the country about; but finding none to be fold, he dropt the deſign.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh he had purſued it, for then we might have ſeen the inſide entire; a ſight which would have given,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031692_0373_0FEE1CB8E2267650"/>
me a great deal of pleaſure: But now the floors, ciel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and roofs, are all taken away, ſo that we can hardly gueſs at its ancient magnificence. The ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> muſt have been a noble room; it is 100 feet long, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wide, and thirty high. The roof was ſupported by very beautiful arches, which ſtill remain. There are two chimneys in it, and it was well lighted. The ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the windows is exceeding handſome. Had our friend Milla (the builder of Hagley houſe) been with us, he would have fallen down and adored the architect. The eight towers ſeem to have contained three very good bed-chambers each, placed one above another, beſides ſome upper rooms. The chambers are eighteen feet diameter, except one called the king's chamber, which has a bow window, gained out of the thickneſs of the wall; and the room is by that means extended about thirty feet. Over the arch of that win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow are the arms of Edward the Firſt.</p>
                     <p>From Conway caſtle, we travelled half a day's jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney through a very romantic country, to Rudland, or rather Land caſtle, the remains of which are leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than Carnarvon or Conway; nor was it ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to them, either in extent or beauty, which I am ſorry for, as it was built by Henry the Second.</p>
                     <p>Not far from hence, at a place called Bodrudan, we paſſed a rainy day in a very comfortable manner, with an old acquaintance of mine, who is the lady of the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031692_0374_0FEE1CBA698380A0"/>
caſtle, and hath forbid all depredations, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the neighbourhood uſed to make, by taking it down to build and repair their houſes and pigſties, which would have demoliſhed it like the tower of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>The next morning we went to the top of the hill, from whence we had a view of the whole vaſe of Clwydd, from one end to the other, which is equalled by none in England for fertility and beauty. There is neither mountain nor rock to be ſeen in any part of it. After you turn your back upon Rudland, the hills on one ſide of it riſe very gradually by gentle aſcents. Moſt of them are cultivated quite to their ſummits, oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers half way up; and when the tops are not encloſed, they are a fine graſſy down, like Clent-hill, and ſhaded and enlivened with wood, like the ſlopes in my park. But yet I prefer the ſcenes in Montgomery ſhire to this lively vale. There is a great beauty in this, but there is no majeſty. Whereas there, as in the mind of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lady, with whom I have the honour to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted, the ſoft and the agreeable is mixed with the noble, the great, and the ſublime.</p>
                     <p>About the middle of this vale, upon the brow of a hill, ſtands Denbigh caſtle, a very fine ruin; it enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as much ground as Conway or Carnarvon, but hath not ſo much building. The towers of it are ſtanding at a very conſiderable diſtance from one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031692_0375_0FEE1CBBF1F375D8"/>
fewer in number; but they are in the ſame ſtyle of architecture, having been built in the reign of the ſame king, who by theſe ſtrong fortreſſes ſecured to himſelf and his poſtery the dominion of North Wales. The hall is ſtill pretty entire, and rivals that of Conway, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that the roof doth not appear to have been arched.</p>
                     <p>The towers are all in a ruinous ſtate. I think it a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſhame to the owner, that more care is not taken to preſerve ſuch reſpectable remains of antiquity. When we left the vale of Clwydd, we went into a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and mountainous country which continued from Rythin as far as Wrexham.</p>
                     <p>From Wrexham we went to Wynſtay, the ſeat of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. Part of the houſe is old; but he had begun building a new one before his death, in a very good taſte. One wing is finiſhed, and that alone makes a very agreeable houſe. The view from it is the moſt chearful I ever beheld. It ſtands in the middle of a very pretty park, and looks over that to a moſt delightful country. But if the park was extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little farther, it would take in a hill, with the view of a valley, moſt beautifully wooded; and the river Dee winding in ſo romantic and charming a manner, that I think it exceeds that of Feſtiniog, or any confined proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I ever beheld.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the country, for five or ſix miles, is of anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er temper, exceedingly fertile, and very romantic.
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031692_0376_0FEE1CC4CFBA13C8"/>
While I was looking at it; I aſked one of my friends, "Whether he thought it poſſible for the eyes to behold a more pleaſing ſight." He ſaid, "Yes; the ſight of a woman one loves." My anſwer was, "When I was in love I thought ſo."</p>

                     <head>SECT. LX. A TRAVELLING ANECDOTE AT MACHYN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LLETH IN WALES.</head>
                     <p>MACHYNLLETH lies in a ſmall verdant plain, ſurrounded with mountains. It ſtands in the extreme weſt angle of Montgomery ſhire, and the bridge from the town carried us into Merioneth.</p>
                     <p>I cannot omit a ridiculous circumſtance which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to us at the inn of Machynlleth.</p>
                     <p>A gentleman of the neighbourhood politely introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf to us, and hearing we travelled to ſatisfy our curioſity, civilly offered to gratify it, as far as he could. It was natural for me, among other things, to enquire about the roads, and the inns. I therefore aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, if there was a good houſe at our next ſtage? He anſwered there were many, Mr. Lloyd's Mr. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell's, Mr. Edwards's, &amp;c. I ſtill enquired which was the beſt. He replied, they were all very good. But to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031692_0377_0FEE1CC658B5CE40"/>
make him explicit, I perſiſted in aſking him, whether either of them was as proper, as that in which we were? "Sir!" ſaid he, with a peeviſh ſurpriſe, "ſhould you take this houſe for a Gentleman's?"</p>
                     <p>I quickly explained myſelf, and begged his pardon. We might indeed have travelled through the whole country with a conſtant ſuite of recommendations; and this gentleman preſſed us to accept of his invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his hoſpitable friends; but it did not agree with our plan, nor had we reſolution enough to ſacrifice our time to a daily ſucceſſion of jolly company.</p>
                     <p>Leaving Machynlleth we ſoon found ourſelves in a truly Alpine valley; the rapid torrent roaring over a bed of broken rocks, and now and then interrupted by immenſe fragments, from which it fell in conſiderable cataracts; the woody and exalted precipices on each ſide of the river, and the mountain brooks continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rattling about us formed a romantic picture of the romantic road between Aigues Belles and mount Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. Towards the extremity of this beautiful ſcene, the huge mountain of Cader Idris preſented its naked, craggy, and prominent cliff, full to our front. I never ſaw an object more awfully ſublime; it extends more than half a mile in length, and is at leaſt a thouſand feet high.</p>
                     <p>The road paſſes under part of this gloomy and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendrous precipice, on the right hand, within ſight of
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031692_0378_0FEE1CC7E21BD790"/>
a large lake on the left, and cloſe to the brink of a ſmaller. It then croſſes an arm of Cader Idris, and with a quick deſcent of two rocky miles, ends at Dolgelley. Part of this latter path leads through a thin oak wood, which hangs over an impetuous torrent, foaming down a rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged declivity, as ſteep as the road.</p>
                     <p>The wretched town of Dolgelley is finely ſituated upon the Avon's bank. The vallies around are rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interſperſed with woods and decent houſes, while the mountains bound every proſpect from the town at ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular diſtances.</p>
                     <p>Cader Idris, from the quickneſs of its aſcent, and the nearneſs of its ſummit, appears much higher than it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is; many people, on this account, have conſidered it as the higheſt mountain in Wales, but Snowdon is indiſputably higher.</p>
                     <p>I could learn no intelligence of its real perpendicular elevation; but I ſhould think it muſt be more than half a mile above the level of the river at Dolgelley, which receives the tide at a ſmall diſtance below the town.</p>
                     <p>There appears ſome ſpirit in the flannel trade in this neighbourhood, which extends its buſy influence for many miles round the country.</p>
                     <p>About five miles from Dolgelly, (a few large Scotch firs on each ſide of the rode marking the ſpot) we turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upwards on our left, to ſee a water-fall behind a
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031692_0379_0FEE1CCD15B61EE8"/>
ſmall houſè of a widow Vaugham. This cataract is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into two broad parts; the upper deſcends about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five feet, upon a ſmall craggy ridge, and the lower about twenty feet, into a romantic bafon, encircled with perpendicular or impending rocks. A fine wood ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds it, and ſome of the largeſt trees project their ſhady branches over the precipices of the caſcade.</p>
                     <p>Returning to the high road, we ſoon croſſed a bridge, under which the torrent rattled from the above caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, down a ſteep declivity, and through large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed fragments towards the river.</p>
                     <p>We quitted the valley two miles farther, and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a barren and diſmal mountain. The road continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loneſome and melancholy for ſeveral miles, but at length conducted us to a comfortable little inn.</p>
                     <p>My companion's curioſity led him to turn to the right hand from nearly the ſummit of the mountain, which is called Pen-maen, towards the falls of the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Mothvaye and Cayne. He found the road exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bad, but his troubleſome ride was amply repaid by the object in purſuit. The cataracts were very deep, and fell in broad ſheets of water, through a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcenery of woods and rocks.</p>
                     <p>Theſe remarkable cataracts are each of them the fall of a whole river, and ſituated within a quarter of a mile of one another. That of the Mothvaye forms two very broad ſheets of water, divided about half way
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031692_0380_0FEE1CD072F75D00"/>
down by a ridge in the rock, each part being alſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully broken by frequent crags projecting through it. This whole fall may be about ſeventy or eighty feet in depth.</p>
                     <p>That of the Cayne is a continued ſteep fall from rock to rock, not near ſo wide as the former but much higher. I ſhould imagine it muſt be from an hundred and fifty or two hundred feet high, but the bottom is of very difficult acceſs. The ſcenery, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſurrounds them both, is noble beyond deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, producing a fine contraſt to the naked hills in their neighbourhood.</p>

The bar of this harbour, is very incommodious; but the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031692_0381_0FEE1CD3D2187240"/>
entrance into the harbour, being at leaſt eight miles from Dublin city, is extremely beautiful and pictur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſque, diverſified with hills and promontories on either hand, exhibiting a very ſpacious amphitheatre, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a high ſhore, and ſaid to be exceeded in grandeur by none, except the bay of Naples, to whoſe ſuperior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of view, Mount Veſuvius does not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. The country all round is ſprinkled with white villas. From the entrance, the light-houſe on the ſouth ſide of the harbour appears to great advantage. At a little diſtance from it is Iriſh town (two miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from Dublin) to which place the dyke from that city reaches; and which, when carried on to the extent propoſed, will conſiderably increaſe the quantity of marſh ground already retrieved from the bay, at the bottom of which the river Liffy diſcharges itſelf.</p>
                     <p>The city of Dublin is not ſeen to advantage from the water; yet the landſcape upon the whole is highly rich and beautiful, being horizoned in ſome places by mountains, exactly conical, called the Sugar-loaf hills. I am perſuaded there are many who would not regret a journey thither for this ſingle proſpect, to render which complete, a number of circumſtances are neceſſary, but which can ſeldom concur, ſuch as the ſeaſon of the year, the time of the day, and the clearneſs of the atmoſphere when you enter the bay.</p>
                     <p>The magnitude of the city of Dublin is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

than in general imagined, being nearer a fourth than a fifth of that of London. If you view it from any of the towers, it ſeems more; but from walking the ſtreets, you would ſuppoſe it to be leſs. In 1754, there were 12,857 houſes in this city; but in 1766, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to 13,194; and are now further augmented to 13,500, which indeed is far ſhort of one fourth of the number of houſes in London; yet there is not ſo great a diſproportion in the number of inhabitants who are ſuppoſed, at a moderate computation, to amount to 160,000. It is nearly circular, about eight miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. We ſee it to great advantage from any of its ſteeples, the blue ſlate having a very good effect.</p>
                     <p>The beſt view is from the Phoenix Park, (the Hyde Park of Dublin) but much more extenſive than ours, and would be exquiſitely beautiful i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In one part of this park his Lordſhip raiſed a handſome col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umn of free-ſtone, fluted, with a phoenix on the top, iſſuing out of a flame; it has an inſcription on the baſe, importing that he embelliſhed the park at his own expence, for the recreation of the citizens of Dublin; and his name is ſtill held in veneration among them.

the new ſtreets are as elegant as the modern ſtreets of Weſtminſter. Lately has been added to it an elegant ſquare, called Merryon's ſquare, built in a ſuperb ſtile. Near that is the ſquare called St. Stephen's Green, each ſide being near a quarter of a mile, probably the largeſt in Europe, round which is a gravel-walk of near a mile, where genteel company walk in the evenings, and on Sunday's after two o'clock. This ſquare has ſome grand houſes, and is in general well built; and although there is a great inequality in the houſes, yet this in ſome reſpect adds to its beauty. In the midſt of it is an equeſtrian ſtatue of George II. in braſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in 1758. The ſituation is chearful, and the buildings around it multiply very faſt. A new ſquare has lately been begun, called Palatine ſquare, near the barracks, a regular fine range of buildings, which when completed, will conſiderably add to the growing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of this city.</p>
                     <p>The quays of Dublin are its principal beauty. They lie on each ſide the river Liffy, which is banked and walled in the whole length of the city; and at the breadth of a wide ſtreet from the river on each ſide, the houſes are built fronting each other, which has a good effect. This embarkment, when paved, will be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to any part of London.</p>
                     <p>The Liffy runs for about two miles almoſt in a ſtraight line through the city. It has five bridges over
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031692_0384_0FEE1CDC1213A3C8"/>
it; of which Eſſex bridge is the moſt worthy of notice. It conſiſts of five arches of ſtone. The chord of the middle one is forty-eight feet. It was begun in 1753, finiſhed in about a year and a half, and coſt 20,000 gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas. It has raiſed foot-paths, alcoves, and balluſtrades like Weſtminſter-bridge, of a white ſtone, coarſe but hard. It fronts Chapel-ſtreet to the north, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſtreet to the ſouth. The length is two hundred and fifty feet, and the breadth much the ſame as that of Weſtminſter. Queen's bridge was rebuilt in 1764, is exceedingly neat, and conſiſts of three elegant arches. The other bridges are not worth mentioning, as they are merely conveniences to ſave the trouble of ferrying acroſs the river, and defy every order of architecture.</p>
                     <p>At the end of Eſſex-bridge is the elegant new build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Exchange, which does honour to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who conducted it, the expence being moſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed by lotteries. The whole is of white ſtone, richly embelliſhed with ſemi-columns of the Corinthian order, a cupola, and other ornaments, with a ſtatue of his preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Majeſty George III: erected in 1779.</p>
                     <p>Near this, on a little eminence, is ſituated the caſtle, the reſidence of the Lord Lieutenant, which conſiſts of two large courts, called the upper and lower caſtle-yard; in the latter of which are the Treaſury, and ſome other public offices. Though there is little grandeur in the outward appearance of either, yet, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031692_0385_0FEE1CE3188D1860"/>
on the whole, this caſtle is far ſuperior to the palace of St. James's, as well in the exterior, as the ſize and the elegance of the apartments within.</p>
                     <p>Here are two cathedrals, eighteen pariſh churches, beſides ſeveral chapels and meeting houſes. Neither of the cathedrals are remarkable for their architecture; and as to the pariſh-churches, except on the front of 3 or 4 of their ſteeples, external embelliſhments have been lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtudied, all that ſeems to have been attended to was neatneſs and convenience within; but they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſtitute of every monumental decoration. In the cathedrals only, can be ſeen whatever of the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental kind is worthy of obſervation.</p>
                     <p>From the general badneſs of the ſtreets of Dublin, hackney coaches are more frequent in proportion than in London, and ſedan chairs are every where as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as about St. James's.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1749, it was computed, that in the city and liberties there were two thouſand ale-houſes, three hundred taverns, and twelve thouſand brandy-ſhops. At preſent, in this extenſive place, there are but 7 or 8 coffee houſes, and they are reſorted to for tea and cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee only, not like thoſe in London, where dinners and ſuppers make a very convenient addition; nor are there above half a dozen chop-houſes; ſuch accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, being novel in Dublin.</p>
                     <p>It is very extraordinary, that in this large and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031692_0386_0FEE1CE4A241DDF0"/>
city, there ſhould be ſuch an almoſt total want of ſtrangers and travellers. This defect obliges every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who is acquainted with the place, to get into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate lodgings as ſoon as he arrives, or to uſe the hotels lately ſet up; ſome of which are elegant.</p>
                     <p>During my ſtay here, I was frequently preſented with the picture of a late Touriſt, at the bottom of the chamber-veſſels, with his mouth and eyes open, ready to receive the libation; and on enquiry found, that even the utenſil now is more frequently called by the name of a Twiſs than any other, in contempt of the illiberal reflections of that gentleman, who was ſo hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitably received here; Indeed, hoſpitality holds its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence here; for it is cuſtomary for almoſt every gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who dines with your friend, to aſk you for a day; nay, they will ſometimes invite the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to be of your party. This ſocial cuſtom is ſtill very prevalent, though not ſo much, I am told, as it has been.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to drinking, I have been happily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. The bottle is circulated freely but not to the exceſs we have heard it was, and I of courſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find. Common ſenſe is reſuming her empire. The practice of cramming gueſts is already exploded, and that of gorging them is daily loſing ground. Wherever I have yet been, I was always deſired to do juſt as I would chuſe; nay, I have been at ſome tables
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031692_0387_0FEE1CE631B66CD8"/>
where the practice of drinking healths at dinner was entirely laid aſide. Let the cuſtom originate whence it may, it is now unneceſſary; in many caſes it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, and in all ſuperfluous.</p>
                     <p>The tables of the firſt faſhion are covered juſt as in London; I can ſcarcely ſee any difference, unleſs it be that there is more variety here. Well bred people of different countries approach much nearer to each other in their manners, than thoſe who have not ſeen the world. This is viſible in the living of the merchants of London and Dublin. With theſe you never ſee a ſtinted dinner at two o'clock, with a glaſs of port af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; but you find a table, not only plentifully, but luxuriouſly ſpread, with choice wines, both at dinner and after it; and, which gives the higheſt zeſt to the entertainment, your hoſt receives you with ſuch an appearance of liberality and indeed urbanity, as is very pleaſing. Here they betray no attention to the counter, diſcover no ſombrous gloom of computation, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play an open frankneſs and ſocial vivacity of ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>If you prefer the men of this country for their hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, and the women for their beauty, you are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to live well with them.</p>
                     <p>In general, the outſkirts of Dublin conſiſt chiefly of huts, or cabins, conſtructed of mud dried, and moſtly without either chimney or window; and in theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable kind of dwellings, far the greater part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

of Ireland linger out a wretched exiſtence. A ſmall piece of ground is generally annexed to each, whoſe chief produce is potatoes; and on theſe roots and milk the common Iriſh ſubſiſt all the year round, without taſting either bread or meat, except perhaps at Chriſtmas once or twice. What little the men can earn by their labour, or the women by their ſpinning, is generally conſumed in whiſky, a ſpirituous liquor reſembling Geneva. Shoes and ſtockings are ſeldom worn by theſe beings, who ſeem to form a different race from the reſt of mankind. Their poverty is far greater than that of the Spaniſh Portugeſe, or even the Scotch Peaſants, notwithſtanding which, they wear the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of content.</p>
                     <p>The indigence of the middling claſs of people is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible even in Dublin; yet from the moſt attentive and minute enquries, I am confident that the produce of this kingdom, either of corn or cattle is not above two thirds, at moſt, of what by good cultivation it might yield; notwithſtanding which, the landed gentlemen, I believe, make as much, or more of their eſtates, than any in the three kingdoms, while the lands, for equal goodneſt produce the leaſt. The conſequences of this, with reſpect to the different claſſes are obvious;—the landlords firſt get all that is made of the land, and the tenants, for their labour, get poverty and potatoes.</p>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, their oats for the moſt part are tolerably good, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting two or three countries in the Eaſt of Leinſter, and one or two in Ulſter. Almoſt all the ſtraw pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the country is put upon their houſes and cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins. The furniture of the ſaddle-horſes alſo, ſuch as ſaddle, bridle, ſtirrups, and crupper, are frequently made all of ſtraw. Sometimes the bridle and ſtirrups are of cord.</p>
                     <p>The high roads throughout the ſouthern and weſtern parts are lined with beggars, who live in huts or cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, of ſuch ſhocking materials and conſtruction, that in hundreds of them you may ſee the ſmoak aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through almoſt every inch of their defenceleſs cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering, for ſcarce one in twenty of them has any win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or chimney; and through thoſe chaſms, of courſe, the rain muſt make its way to drip upon the half-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſhivering, and almoſt half-ſtarved inhabitants within. Notwithſtanding their ill appearance, a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is frequently preſented with boards at the ſide of the

As a ſymbol where milk is ſold, they hang out a white rag on a ſtick. Indeed theſe huts ſpoil the figure and appearance of the much greater number of even their largeſt towns in the whole kingdom, whoſe entrances are generally dirty, with long ſtrings of theſe deſpicable hovels, with which moſt of them are prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Into the inland towns eſpecially, you are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally introduced through a line of fifty or an hundred of theſe habitations of poverty and oppreſſion on either hand. Even the metropolis itſelf is not without this diſgraceful deformity, which exhibits the penury and wretchedneſs of the tenants, and the mean ſpiritedneſs of the landlords, who, too generally for their own, or the reputation of their country, impoſe the building houſes on their lands, upon a ſet of people, whoſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities will not enable them to build with materials ſo good as thoſe of a ſwallow's neſt; and to the infamy of the proprietors may it be ſaid, that moſt of the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes in Ireland are conſtructed in this miſerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                     <head>SECT. LXII. OF THE COMPARATIVE MERIT OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH.</head>
                     <p>"A FRENCHMAN," ſays the Earl of Cheſterfield, "who, with a fund of learning, virtue, and good ſenſe, has the manners and good-breeding of his country, is the perfection of human nature." I am not an enemy to the French; but I do not think this aſſertion true. In my opinion, the following would have been juſter: "An Engliſhman, who joins manners and good-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſolidity, energy, and greatneſs of mind which characteriſe his country, is the perfection of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture." I do not mean to compliment. But ſentiments and actions are upon a more elevated ſcale here than they can be found in any other nation in the world. There are no effects without cauſes; and the cauſes of this are very obvious. We paſs our youth with the Greeks and Romans. Their great examples expand our ſouls; the brightneſs of their actions, and the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of their principles, kindle the moſt noble paſſions in our minds; and, when we come to be men, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our government feeds this flame, and we glow with a certain internal ardour, which occaſionally breaks out into action, and which is neither known nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended but in the dominions of Britain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:031692_0392_0FEE1CF6F241D458"/>
I do juſtice here to my country; and my ſoul feels happy, that I am able to give her, with truth, a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over the univerſe in genius and magnanimity. But if from this I ſhall be underſtood to think meanly of the French, becauſe they are the rivals and enemies of this nation, it would indeed be to miſinterpret me much. Though I do not think that people <hi>equal</hi> to this in <hi>greatneſs,</hi> I think them a very great people. And if the Engliſh are ſuperior to the French in all the more elevated qualities which dignify and ennoble humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo the French ſurpaſs the Engliſh in all the milder and gentler virtues, which grace can adorn it.</p>
                     <p>In England the French have few friends. But they have one; and that one am I They could not, I acknowledge, have a feebler advocate; but while I have a tongue to ſpeak, or a pen to write, wherever I go I'll do them juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Let every man who knows that nation ſpeak of it as he found it. If he lived in their intimacy for years (as I did,) and if he found them ill-natured, ill-mannered, treacherous, and cowardly, let him ſpeak his mind. I quarrel with no man who judges for himſelf, and who ſpeaks the truth. But let the indulgence I grant be granted to me again; and let me be permitted to tell the world, that however other men may have found them, I found them good-humoured, good-natured, brave, poliſhed, frank, and friendly.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <pb n="70" facs="unknown:031692_0393_0FEE1CFDF3904588"/>
                        <l>" They were my friends, faithful and juſt to me;</l>
                        <l>" But Brutus ſays they are perfidious;</l>
                        <l>" And Brutus is an honourable man.</l>
                        <l>" I ſpeak not to diſprove what Brutus ſpoke;</l>
                        <l>" But here I am to ſpeak what I do know."</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>I found them all animated with a deſire to pleaſe, and always ready to do me every ſervice in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I owe them a thouſand obligations. I had faults; they corrected them. I wanted knowledge; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me. I was rough; they ſoftened me. I was ſick; they viſited me. I was vain; they flattered me. I had need of counſel; they gave me the beſt advice. Every man has need of agreeable company, and every man may be ſure to find it in France.</p>
                     <p>I could be laviſh in praiſe of this nation; but I am ſorry to ſay, that too many people here have prejudices againſt them, as ridiculous as they are ill-founded. They deſpiſe the French as if they were beings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either ſenſe or ſentiment; though their writings and actions ſhow they are full of both. Becauſe two ſtates have different intereſts, is that a reaſon that every individual belonging to thoſe ſtates ſhould promote, to the utmoſt of his abilities, the intereſt and glory of the country to which he belongs? It certainly is. And therefore, every Frenchman has the ſame merit in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with all his might for the deſtruction of the Britiſh fleet, that every Engliſhman has in exerting all
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031692_0394_0FEE1CFF801BA620"/>
his powers to annihilate the navy of France. If a blaſt of my breath could ſend all the ſhips ſhe has to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſea—puff—they were ſunk before you could finiſh this period. But is it a reaſon I ſhould hate or deſpiſe the French, becauſe I am naturally and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily the enemy of France?</p>
                     <p>The beſt way I think to judge this matter is, to take two other rival nations; Auſtria and Pruſſia; Athens and Sparta. Here you are diſpaſſionate; your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be juſt. Do you think it the duty of a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al-minded Pruſſian to deſpiſe an Auſtrian? Or, ſhould a well-born Athenian deteſt a Laced aemonian, becauſe he is equally animated by the ſame noble flame that warms himſelf—the love of his country? The nation which is able to rival another, proves herſelf worthy the admiration of that nation, even by her rivalry; and had I no other reaſon to conſider the French as a great people, beſide their being able to contend with England, that proof for me would be ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>But the French are perfidious <hi>in politics.</hi> I deny that they <hi>can</hi> be perfidious with the Engliſh. They may be treacherous, for aught I know, with the Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians and the Spaniards. There they profeſs friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. They are of the ſame religion, frequently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry, and have frequent alliances. With England France has no connection. She may over reach her in politics, but ſhe never can deceive her by perfidy;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031692_0395_0FEE1D0108ADB9B8"/>
becauſe ſhe is her uniform enemy. There is not an infant that does not know, that France ever was, and ever will be, the enemy of England. The making a peace is not making a friendſhip; and the French will not be more the friends of England when this peace is made, than they were five years before the war began, or than they are now. The rivalry between the two nations will laſt while the nations laſt. They are <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tora littoribus contraria,</hi> oppoſite in every thing. It is the duty of France to depreſs England as much as ſhe can. It is the duty of England to keep down France as much as is in her power. It is the duty of both to do juſtice to the other. This juſtice the French <hi>do</hi> render the Engliſh. I am ſorry I cannot ſay the Engliſh do the ſame by them. Every claſs of men in France praiſe the people of this country: ſome the ſolidity of their underſtanding, and the extent of their genius; others the energy and vigour of their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; many their magnanimity and benevolence; and all, their courage and good faith. While here—but I bluſh for numbers, and am aſhamed to finiſh my period.</p>

                     <p>WOMEN are a ſubject upon which ſo much has been ſaid and written by ſo many men of abilities, that it is not eaſy to imagine a new light, in which they have not been already placed. But, talking of a nation, if one did not ſay ſomething about ſo conſiderable a part of it, the ſubject muſt appear mutilated and imperfect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As brevity is the ſoul of wit, I ſhall be brief;</hi> and I ſhall only touch on the principal points in which the women of France differ from thoſe of other countries.</p>
                     <p>When a French lady comes into a room, the firſt thing that ſtrikes you is, that ſhe walks better, holds herſelf better, has her head and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> better fancied, and better put on, than any woman you have ever ſeen.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe talks, ſhe is the part of pleaſing perſonifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Her eyes, her lips, her words, her geſtures, are all prepoſſeſſing. Her language is the language of amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs; her accents are the accents of grace. She embelliſhes a trifle; ſhe intereſts upon a nothing; ſhe ſoftens a contradiction; ſhe takes off the inſipidneſs of a compliment, by turning it elegantly; and when ſhe has a mind, ſhe ſharpens and poliſhes the point of an epigram better than all the women in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:031692_0397_0FEE1D0B6D3AE738"/>
Her eyes ſparkle with ſpirit; the moſt delightful ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies flaſh from her fancy; in telling a ſtory, ſhe is inim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable; the motions of her body, and the accents of her tongue, are equally genteel and eaſy; an equal flow of ſoftened ſprightlineſs keeps her conſtantly good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured and cheerful; and the only objects of her life are to pleaſe, and to be pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>Her vivacity may <hi>ſometimes</hi> approach to folly; but perhaps it is not in her moments of folly ſhe is leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and agreeable. Engliſh women have many points of ſuperiority over the French; the French are ſuperior to them in many others. I have mentioned ſome of thoſe points in other places. Here I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, there is a particular idea in which no woman in the world can compare with a French woman; it is in the power of <hi>intellectual irritation.</hi> She will draw wit out of a fool. She ſtrikes with addreſs the cords of ſelf-love, that ſhe gives unexpected vigour and agility to fancy; and electrifies a body that appeared non-electric.</p>
                     <p>I have mentioned here the women of England; and I have done wrong. I did not intend it when I began the letter. They came into my mind as the only wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the wolrd worthy of being compared with thoſe of France. To ſettle the reſpective claims of the fair ſex in theſe two countries, requires an abler pen than mine. I ſhall not dare to examine it even in a ſingle point; nor preſume to determine whether, in the important ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle

                     <p>MONTPELIER is a delightful place of reſidence. I ſtaid there four days, and left it with exceſſive regret. The town itſelf is by no means beautiful, the ſtreets being almoſt all narrow, winding, and badly laid out; but nature ſeems to have choſen the hills on which it ſtands, to enrich with her choiceſt favours. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is eaſy and gradual on every ſide; and the ſtates of Languedoc have ornamented the ſummit of it at a vaſt expence, in a manner where taſte and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence are equally blended.</p>
                     <p>The proſpect from this happy ſpot I cannot deſcribe, though I ſtudied it every day with an enthuſiaſtic plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Raphael's pencil, or that of Lorraine, might paint it, but not even Shakeſpear's powers of deſcription could do juſtice to its beauties. The vales of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc, covered with olives or laid out in vineyards, are finely contraſted with rude rocks to the north, and melt away into the ſea of the ſouth. Though winter has almoſt ſtripped the trees of their verdure, there is nothing melancholy or deſart which preſents itſelf to the eye. A ſky ſerene and unclouded, an invigorating ſun, a keen and wholeſome air ſpread a gaiety over

November itſelf, which here is neither accompanied with fogs or rain. Montpelier has, notwithſtanding, loſt, within theſe laſt thirty years, that reputation for ſalubrity which conduces more to the ſupport of a place, than any real advantages it may poſſeſs; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtrangers who viſit it from motives of health di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes annually. Some trade is ſtill carried on from thence by a ſmall river called the Les, which emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties itſelf into the ſea at the diſtance of a league; but the Mediterranean has been retiring theſe three centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from the whole coaſt of Languedoc and Provence. Frejus, which is ſituated between Toulon and Antibes, where the Emperor Auguſtus laid up his gallies after the battle of Actium, is now become an inland city.</p>
                     <p>The country from Montpelier to Niſmes, is a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, level, and every where cultivated. The peaſants are juſt beginning to gather olives, which are very numerous, and the trees are planted with the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity as our orchards in England. I cannot but envy the inhabitants this genial climate and theſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile plains, and am ready to accuſe Nature of partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the infinite difference which ſhe has placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the peaſants of Languedoc and of Sweden. In vain will you tell me that the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031692_0401_0FEE1D18EE91F770"/>
I feel and cultivate it with the greateſt ardour—but it cannot blind me to the infinite ſuperiority with which certain countries of the earth are endowed; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other leſs favoured latitudes and regions.</p>
                     <p>I paſſed three days at Niſmes in the ſurvey of thoſe magnificent and beautiful remains of Roman great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which yet ſubſiſt there. They have been deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thouſand times, and it is not my intention to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue you with a repetition of them. The Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and the "maiſon quarrée," are known throughout every kingdom of Europe. The firſt of theſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the beholder with the deepeſt veneration; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excites the moſt elegant and refined delight. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt the barbarians who could violate and deface theſe glorious monuments of antiquity, will mix with the ſenſations of every ſpectator.</p>
                     <p>One can ſcarce believe that Charles Martel, from hatred to the Roman name, had the ſavage fury to fill the corridores of the amphitheatre with wood, to which he ſet fire with an intent to injure, though it ſurpaſſed his power to demoliſh ſo vaſt an edifice. Yet notwithſtanding theſe attempts of the barbarous nations, notwithſtanding the lapſe of ſo many ages, and the effects of time, its appearance at preſent is the moſt auguſt and majeſtic which can be preſented to the mind, or to the ſenſes. The prodigious circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the amphitheatre, the ſolidity and ſtrength of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031692_0402_0FEE1D1A77D0CD98"/>
its conſtruction, the awful majeſty of ſo vaſt a pile, half perfect, half in ruin, impreſs one with a tumult of ſentiments which it is difficult to convey to you by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſcription.</p>
                     <p>The "maiſon quarrée," is in the moſt complete preſervation, and appears to me to be the moſt perfect piece of architecture in the world. The order is the Corinthian, and all the beauties of that elegant ſtyle ſeem to be exhauſted in its conſtruction. This ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb temple is now converted into a chapel dedicated to the Virgin, ornamented with gilding and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finery, ſuitable to ſuch an alteration.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I left Bourdeaux I took the road to Agen, along the ſouthern bank of the Garonne. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try through which I paſſed from Langon, where I croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Garonne, to the gates of that city, is fertile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any I have ſeen in Europe.

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031692_0403_0FEE1D1C03A3B788"/>
The climate at this ſeaſon is delicious; and no marks of winter appear in any of the productions of nature. Cherry-trees, figs, acacias, poplars, and elms, are in full verdure. In many places, where they border on the ſide of the road, the vines have run up, and mixed their cluſters among the boughs. This is truly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and pictureſque. Milton, in his divine flights of imagination, could employ our firſt parents in no more delightful occupation, even in Paradiſe.</p>

                     <p>In the midſt of this charming country, in a plain, cloſe to the Garonne, ſtands the city of Agen. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, to the north, riſes a very high hill, called "Le Bocher de la belle Vue." I went up to the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, on which there is a convent. The chapel and ſome of the adjoining cells are hallowed out of the rock. It is ſaid that theſe apartments are very ancient, and were made many centuries ago by hermits, who retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither from motives of devotion and auſterity. The proſpect is beautiful. Beneath lies the city of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, and through the meadows which ſurround it rolls the Garonne.</p>
                     <p>One of the monks ſhowed me the apartments of the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031692_0404_0FEE1D1F6619E418"/>
convent; and in the receſſes of the rock heled me to a ſpring which is never dry, and which he aſſured me had been opened by miracle, at the interceſſion of ſome holy recluſe in ages paſt. Their little refectory was hung with portraits of the ſame monaſtic heroes, among which was St. William, duke of Aquitaine; and at the upper end, in golden letters, was written, "Silentium."</p>
                     <p>Agen is a very mean and diſagreeable place, the houſes are ill built, the ſtreets narrow, crooked, and dirty. I ſaw only one building in it which appeared to me deſerving of notice. It is a chapel belonging to a nunery of Carmelites. The walls are exquiſitely painted in chiaro oſcuro, and the deception of the roof, which is executed in the ſame manner, is admirable. The high altar is magnificent, and adorned with a piece of painting, the ſubject of which is very inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting. It is a nun, ſinking under the tranſports of holy contemplation. She appears as if incapable of ſupporting the divine effulgence of her celeſtial lover, with eyes half cloſed, and arms expanded. Above, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends a radiant figure, with looks of tenderneſs and pleaſure, ſurrounded with the glories of the ſkies, too ſtrong for motal ſight. If it had not been a religious edifice, I ſhould have ſuppoſed it to be the ſtory of Jupiter and Semelé, to which it bears the moſt apt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance.

                     <head>SECT. LXVI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT LEAD INTO ITALY.</head>
                     <p>IF you enter Italy by the way of France, you will probably go to Lyon. From thence you have your choice, either to go by land through Savoy, and acroſs Mount Cenis to Turin; or paſſing through Provence, to embark at Antibes or Nice, for Genoa or Leghorn. From Swiſſerland you may paſs Mount S. Gothard; from the Valais, Mount S. Bernard; and from Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many you may go through the Tyrol. Carriages can paſs only by the firſt and laſt of theſe routes. In croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Mount Cenis they muſt be taken to pieces; but the whole road through the Tyrol is not merely practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, but even excellent for a carriage.</p>
                     <p>From Lyon to Turin they reckon thirty-five poſts, ſixty-four leagues, or one hundred and ninety-three Engliſh miles; the time, fifty-ſix hours. The road paſſes through the Lyonnois, Savoy, and Peidmont, by Pont-Beauvoiſin and Chambery over Mount Cenis.</p>
                     <p>Pont-Beauvoiſin, which is fifteen leagues or nine poſts from Lyon, is on the frontier; a little river ſeparates it into two parts, one of which belongs to France, and the other to Savoy:</p>
                     <p>No ſooner have you paſſed the frontiers of France,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031692_0407_0FEE1D2975E77FE0"/>
than you perceive a change of country, climate, and people. The mountains of Savoy afford a new ſcene. Woods, rocks, precipices, caſcades and torrents, form views that charm an eye fond of rude nature. Others find this journey dreary and diſagreeable. The road, however, is ſafe and good, and in many places even beautiful. From Pont-Beauvoiſin you go to Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, which, though the capital of Savoy, affords no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth ſeeing. The ſituation indeed is fine, in a wide delightful valley, where there is the greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of objects that a fine country and mountains can produce: but it is a poor dirty town; the houſes dark, the ſtreets narrow, the convents and other public buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings miſerable. The remainder of the ducal palace is a caſtle; over the gate-way are the governor's lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, commanding the town and adjacent country. During the carnival they have plays and maſked balls.</p>
                     <p>If inſtead of taking the direct route you go by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, you will find it nineteen poſts, or ninety-five miles three furlongs from Lyon to that place, the time twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one or twenty-two hours. From Geneva to Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery it is ſeven poſts, or forty-ſix miles and a half; and the time thirteen or fourteen hours. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſeventy-two miles out of the way, and will take ſixteen or ſeventeen hours more in time. But if you have already ſeen Paris and Lyon, there is a road from Calais to Dijon, by S. Omer, Arras, Cambray, Laon,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031692_0408_0FEE1D30768175F0"/>
Rheims, Chalon ſur Marne, Joinville, and Langres, which is ſixty-ſix poſts, or three hundred and fifty-one Engliſh miles; and from Dijon to Geneva, by Auxone, Dole, Poligny, and from Morey acroſs Mount Jura to Nyon, twenty-one poſts: the time of the whole route about eighty-one hours. Whereas by Paris and Lyon, it will coſt you one hundred and two hours; but dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four or five months Mount Jura is impracticable.</p>
                     <p>From Geneva, your beſt way is to hire horſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey you to Chambery, there being very few horſes on the road till you come into the direct way fram France. It is ſeven poſts from Geneva to Chambery, and the voiturier will be at leaſt twelve hours in going them, unleſs your carriage is light. If you think this too much for one day, you may ſet out in the afternoon from Geneva, lay at Frangy, and arrive eaſily at Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery the next day, time enough to ſee that place.</p>
                     <p>Montmelian, which is only a poſt and a half, or nine miles from Chambery, is alſo moſt delightfully ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the head of three vallies. The inn is not in the town, but half a league on this ſide of it, and the aſcent from it is very ſteep. Having paſſed the mountain, the road lies in a very narrow valley which winds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly. The wine made about Montmelian is much eſteemed. After this you meet with nothing but wretched towns and villages, and a country of terrible poverty and filth. The honeſt, plain, and thrifty Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031692_0409_0FEE1D32029F91E0"/>
have very little land to cultivate, and look ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unhealthy. Aiguebelle lies in a bottom cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurrounded by mountains. It is but a poor ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling village. The water is clear, light, and ſparkling.</p>
                     <p>After you have paſſed Aiguebelle, <hi>goitres</hi> or ſwelled necks become frequent. St. Jean de Maurienne was formerly the reſidence of the counts of this country. It is ſituated in the middle of the higheſt Alps, in a valley tolerable wide. The roads are pretty good, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept through the towns, where they are ill paved, and barely wide enough for a carriage to paſs. Indeed they are in general narrow, which is no wonder, where there is ſo little land to ſpare. Frequently you find no more than room for this confined way between the ſteep mountain and the torrent; and in ſome places they are obliged to hew it out of the rock itſelf. Whenever the valley widens a little, you find a miſerable village; and ſome of theſe, as if it were to ſpare their uſeful land for cultivation, are placed in the very bed of the torrent, which occupies ſo large a portion of all that is not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren rock. The road is almoſt a continued aſcent and deſcent by the ſide of the Arche, a river which riſes in Mount Iſerau, and joins the Iſere near Montmelian. As you advance, the mountains grow higher and more ſteep, till at length the road cloſes in a narrow gorge, and a very long and heavy aſcent to Lannebourg, which is at the foot of Mount Cenis. There are about
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031692_0410_0FEE1D338AF8F9A8"/>
two hundred and twenty houſes in this village, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hundred porters on the Syndic's liſt, who are employed in their turns.</p>
                     <p>The inns on this road are very bad; it is therefore adviſeable, if you can bear the fatigue, to go through without ſtopping. You ſhould by all means have the whole day before you to croſs Mount Cenis, that you may not be hurried in the double operation of taking your carriage to pieces, and putting it together again; and that you may have time in the evening to arrive at Suze; in which caſe the next day you will eaſily reach Turin to dinner. The whole paſſage of the mountain from Lannebourg to Novalize may eaſily be accompliſhed in four or at moſt five hours; and has nothing terrible in it; at leaſt from May to October. In a deep ſnow, in a violent tempeſt, and eſpecially in a great thaw, there is certainly ſome danger; at all oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er times there is nothing but the inconvenience of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the carriage in pieces, to ſend it over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on mules; but the people are ſo adroit in this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, and reſtore it to its primitive ſtate ſo eaſily, that the whole rather furniſhes amuſement than gives pain to the traveller.</p>
                     <p>You have it in your option to paſs over on muſes or in <hi>chaiſes-a-porteurs,</hi> which is ruſh-bottomed elbow chairs, without legs. Two men carry them by means of two poles, and they have a foot-board. Theſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031692_0411_0FEE1D38C736A248"/>
are very ſtrong and nimble, never miſſing a ſtep, but treading firm in the rougheſt ways with the agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of goats. They relieve each other at proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals. In deſcending, they ſhow great dexterity in the frequent windings of the mountain. From ſix to ten of theſe men are aſſigned to each perſon, in proportion to his ſize. Their pay is fifty ſols of Savoy each, that is about two ſhillings and ſeven-pence halfpennny. The price of a mule to carry the baggage is the ſame: of a mule to ride, forty ſols, or two ſhillings and a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. A mule is not obliged to carry above 350lb. ſo that if the body of your carriage exceeds that weight, they may demand what they pleaſe. There is alſo one ſedan chair at Suze, which may generally be had by ſending notice before hand to the other ſide of the mountain; and lately they have provided other cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chairs. The aſcent is not bad, and is eaſily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an hour and a half. At the top is a plain, about five miles in length; it is a fine turf, and may be gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped over, not only with perfect ſafety, but with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. There is a beautiful lake on this plain, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent trout in it.</p>
                     <p>It is often related, as a wonderful circumſtance, that there ſhould be a lake on the top of Mount Cenis; but the truth is, that this plain is no more than a very high valley or gorge of the mountain; and though it be indeed the higheſt part which travellers paſs over,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031692_0412_0FEE1D3C283EDB40"/>
yet there are lofty pikes which riſe at leaſt three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand feet above it. The lake is ſupplied from the ſnow that melts on theſe, and trickles through the crevices. It gives riſe to the river Dora, and therefore may be looked upon as one of the ſources of the Po. You may ſtop at a public houſe by the hoſpital to refreſh the men; and having traverſed the plain, you begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into Piedmont. The proſpect on each ſide of tall firs, larches, and cheſnuts, of natural water-falls and roaring mountain rivers, affords a variety at once awful and pleaſing. From the plain of S. Nicholas you have a view of a beautiful caſcade; and half way between the great croſs and Novaleze you paſs a wretched village, called La Ferriere. You will be two hours at leaſt in getting to Novaleze. The deſcent is ſteep, but no where dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Some adventurous people, who return from Italy by the way of Mount Cenis in winter, when the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is covered with ſnow, ſlide down on ſledges. The deſcent towards Lannebourg is very ſteep, and it takes almoſt an hour to go down it, on account of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turnings and windings you are obliged to make; but the whole ſide of the mountain being then covered with one ſolid ſmooth cruſt of ſnow, at the proper place you may put yourſelf on a ſledge, with a guide on the fore part of it, who will conduct it, and change the direction of it with his foot, whenever it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031692_0413_0FEE1D3F881F6FF0"/>
and thus bring you to the bottom in ten or twelve minutes very ſafe; or if the ſledge now and then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, they ſay it is without any bad conſequence. This is called in French, "ſe faire ramaſſer," and the place whence you ſet out, "les ramaſſes." Novaleze is a poor place, with an indifferent inn, where is the firſt cuſtom-houſe for Piedmont; and a ſtranger muſt take care not to have ſnuff, or any new foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
                     <p>You will quit this place if you had not time to reach Suze the evening before, by nine or ten in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you may have the day before you, and be ſure to arrive at Turin before ten o'clock, after which hour the gates are not opened. The road to Suze is rough and bad, with a ſteep aſcent and deſcent, and the town is not conſiderable. You will paſs the formidable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the Brunetta, along a narrow gorge of the mountain. This is the barrier of Italy, and the key of Piedmont. The fortifications are ſaid to be well worth ſeeing, but it is difficult to obtain the permiſſion. At Suze, in the gardens of the caſtle, is a triumphal arch, erected in the time of Auguſtus.</p>
                     <p>At Rivoli, which is only two leagues from Turin, the King of Sardinia has a country houſe. From hence to the capital is a handſome broad ſtraight road, bordered by double rows of fine elms. There are ſome wild and magnificent views between Mount Cenis and Turin;
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031692_0414_0FEE1D4110A8ADD0"/>
and the meadows in ſome ſeaſons are equal in point of verdure to any in England. They are watered by the Dora, which deſcends with vaſt impetuoſity from the Alps.</p>

                     <p>MEDIOCRITY is rare here; everything is in extremes. No where is ſo fine muſic to be heard; no where (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept at the opera of Paris) are the ears ſo cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. The eyes are charmed and tormented alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the moſt ſuperb and moſt deteſtable pictures and ſtatues. No citizens; and exceſſive luxury amongſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals; and the people in the moſt abject miſery.</p>
                     <p>It is the ſame with regard to religion; you will ſee nothing but a blind ſuperſtition, or determined atheiſts. But of all the extremes, the moſt ſtriking are thoſe which are obſerved in the character of the nation. The Italian, in general, is exceedingly good or wicked to a degree. There are excellent hearts in this country; but like the great pictures they are ſcarce. Men are born there with ſtrong paſſions, and not receiving any education, it is not aſtoniſhing that they often commit great crimes. Under a cold exterior they conceal burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031692_0415_0FEE1D481730FB30"/>
hearts; and the exterior is cold only to conceal their hearts. Love, jealouſy, and revenge are their ruling paſſions. As they think only of the ſenſual part of love, and know well the conſtitutions of their women, and the wiles of their rivals, their jealouſy is always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and their revenge is implacable.</p>
                     <p>As to underſtanding, it is nearly the ſame; men of talants form the large claſs; there are few fools; and middling men are very rare. "Why then, you will aſk, do not theſe men produce nothing excellent?" Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ungoverned imaginations, and no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; and becauſe good taſte has not yet penetrated into their country. And why has not good taſte enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Italy? Becauſe Italy has neither a London nor a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and becauſe ſhe never had a Lewis the Fourteenth.</p>
                     <p>Travellers are often miſtaken in judging of the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, eſpecially the Neapolitan. They think he has no ſenſe, becauſe he wants ideas. A man can have but few ideas when he has never been out of his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and when he has read nothing; but examine the Neapolitan on all the ſubjects with which he is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you will ſee whether he wants natural capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. He reſembles the ſoil of his own country. A field well tilled in Naples produces the moſt plentiful crops; neglected, it yields but briars and thiſtles. It is the ſame with the genius of the inhabitants; cultivated, it is capable of every thing; untilled produces only folly and vice.</p>

                     <head>SECT. LXVIII. TWO CURIOUS REMARKS.</head>
                     <p>I MADE two obſervations in my travels; one that the people of every country make ſomething well; the other, that every nation has a peculiar manner of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf. The Engliſh ruin themſelves by play; the French, by women; the Iriſh by a hoſpitality; the Swiſs, by drinking; and the Germans, by a multitude of ſervants. I ſhould not have ſaid <hi>every</hi> I ſhould have ſad <hi>almoſt</hi> every. The Italians don't ruin themſelves, becauſe they are ruined already. However, individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als among them <hi>do;</hi> ſome Milaneſe, for example, by eating; ſome Venetians, by gallantry and gaming; ſome Neapolitans by equipages and embroidery; and ſeveral Romans, by every ſpecies of impurity. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the Dutch ruin themſelves; it is not, however, becauſe they are already ruined, but becauſe they are too phlegmatic to ruin themſelves any way. The few who <hi>do</hi> deſtroy themſelves, do it by avarice, by lending money at exorbitant intereſt on bad ſecurities.</p>
                     <p>There are Dutchmen too who ruin themſelves by flowers. I do not guaranty the truth of this anecdote, though I heard it from perſons of veracity in Holland. A man, whoſe paſſion was for flowers, and who had an uncommon fine tulip-root of a very particular kind,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031692_0417_0FEE1D4B28A80138"/>
heard that another floriſt had one as fine as his. He purchaſed it from him for a ſum of money ſo large, I dare not mention it; and when he had got it into his poſſeſſion, he broke it to pieces with his heel, ſaying, "Now there is not in the world another tulip-root equal to mine."</p>
                     <p>Every nation excells too in making ſomething. The French make gold and ſilver ſtuffs, and political lies better than any people in the world. The Italians make ices, maccaroni, and religious lies to admiration. The Saxons make excellent porcelaine. The Dutch are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for making ſea-landſcapes. The Flemiſh for making lace. And the Engliſh—why the Engliſh, I, think, make men and women better than any nation I know.</p>
                     <p>There is a better race of men and women in England then I have ever ſeen in any other country. If any one aſks me <hi>why</hi> it is ſo? I anſwer, I can't tell. If he aſks me how I <hi>know</hi> that it is ſo? I anſwer, by looking at them. There is alſo a better race of dogs<note n="*" place="bottom">Not to ſpeak of a great many promiſing puppies.</note> and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here than in any other country I have ſeen; but there are too a great many garrons and curs.</p>

                     <head>SECT. LXIX. THE REASONS WHY THE FRENCH HAVE MORE WIT AND BETTER SPIRITS THAN THE ENGLISH.</head>
                     <p>SIR, ſays a man to Swift, I have a mind to ſet up for a Wit. Sir, ſays Swift, I adviſe you to ſit down again. This was very good advice, particularly in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where that ſame author has obſerved, not one man in ten thouſand has wit. Almoſt every body is witty in France. Why then there, and not here? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are purely phyſical; for Engliſhmen ought to have twenty times more wit than Frenchmen.</p>
                     <p>Ideas are the matter of which wit is made, and the Engliſh have infinitely more ideas than the French. This ariſes from their early education, from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more reading people, &amp;c. You ſee this is a very ſtrong reaſon why the Engliſh ought to be ſuperior to the French in this point.</p>
                     <p>But if ideas are the materials, fancy is the inſtrument which operates on thoſe materials; and here comes in the ſuperiority of the French. Their fancies are liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, brighter, and quicker.</p>
                     <p>The force of the imagination depends a great deal on the influence of the animal ſpirits; its brightneſs
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031692_0419_0FEE1D559FFA2070"/>
on the refinement of thoſe ſpirits: and its quickneſs on the celerity of their movement. Now, in point of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſneſs of ſpirits, the Engliſh, I believe, have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the French. A bull has more ſpirits in him than an ape; but the ape's ſpirits are always in motion, and it is very difficult to move the bull's. This, you ſee, is a caſe in point: and John Bull, I am perſuaded, has a greater quantity of ſpirits than <hi>Jack Singe.</hi> But the Frenchman's ſpirits are more refined and quicker in their motions than ours, and this for a number of reaſons. I ſhall here mention ſome of the principal.</p>
                     <p>A Frenchman never taſtes malt liquor, he eats no butter, and his bread is light. The meat in France is not near ſo fat as it is here, and it is much better dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The ſauces are poignant and not greaſy. He eats a great deal of ſoup and light vegetables. He drinks in moderation as much wine and water as is necſſary to dilute his dinner, and then he takes as much <hi>good</hi> wine, coffee, and <hi>liqueurs,</hi> as is neceſſary to heat his ſtomach, and quicken the circulation of his blood, <hi>and no more.</hi> Add to this, the pureneſs of the air, and the light ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the moſt amiable women in the world, in which he paſſes ſo much of his time; and you will ſee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons enough why his ſpirits ſhould be quicker in their motion, and more refined than ours.</p>
                     <p>I need not mention how oppoſite our manner of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is; the quantities of blood-food we eat, the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:031692_0420_0FEE1D57288CAD20"/>
of bad wine we drink, the groſſneſs of our atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, nor many other cauſes that hinder the celerity of our fancies, and conſequently impede conſiderably the vivacity of our wit.</p>
                     <p>However, the Engliſh do not think much of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of the French in this article. They pique themſelves on having better ſenſe and more learning than their neighbours; and they have more ſenſe and learning. The French allow this, and it does not give them any uneaſineſs. They value themſelves on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wittier and more amiable than the Engliſh. When a Frenchman has knowledge, and is grown a little ſteady, his company is delightful; when an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has fancy and good manners, his ſociety is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting. I always thought that thoſe two nations, blended together, would produce perfection in every thing.</p>

                     <p>THE ſituation of Edinburgh is probably as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary an one as can well be imagined for a metropolis. The immenſe hills, on which great part of it is built, though they make the views uncommonly magnificent,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031692_0421_0FEE1D5A8B352FB8"/>
not only in many places render it impaſſable for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, but very fatiguing for walking. The principal or great ſtreet runs along the ridge of a very high hill, which, taking its riſe from the palace of Holyrood houſe, aſcends, and not very gradually, for the length of a mile and a quarter, and after opening a ſpacious area, terminates in the caſtle. On one ſide, far as the eye can reach, you view the ſea, the port of Leith, its harbour and various veſſels, the river of Forth, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe hills around, ſome of which aſcend above even the caſtle; and on the other ſide you look over a rich and cultivated country, terminated by the dark, abrupt, and barren hills of the Highlands.</p>
                     <p>The famous ſtreet at Liſle, la Rue Royale, leading to the port of Tourney, which is ſaid to be the fineſt in Europe, is not to be compared, either in length or breadth, to the High-ſtreet at Edinburgh; and would they be at the expence of removing ſome buildings which obſtruct the view, by being placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the ſtreet, nothing could be conceived more magnificent. Not content, however, with this, they ſuffer a weekly market to be held, in which ſtalls are erected nearly the whole length of it, and make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion almoſt impoſſible to be conceived. All ſorts of iron and copper ware are expoſed to ſale; here likewiſe the herb market is held, and the herb women, who are in no country either the moſt peaceable or the moſt
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031692_0422_0FEE1D5E0C9B0918"/>
cleanly beings upon earth, throw about the roots, ſtalks, &amp;c. of the bad vegetables, to the great nuiſance of the paſſengers.</p>
                     <p>The ſtyle of building here is much like the French. The houſes, however, in general are higher, as ſome riſe to twelve, and one in particular to thirteen ſtories in heighth. But to the front of the ſtreet nine or ten ſtories is the common run. It is the back part of the edifice, which, by being built on the ſlope of an hill, ſinks to that amazing debth, ſo as to form the above number. This mode of dwelling, though very proper for the turbulent times to which it was adapted, has now loſt its convenience. As they no longer ſtand in need of defence from the caſtle, they no more find the benefit of being crowded together ſo near it. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtaircaſe, which leads to the apartments of the different inhabitants, muſt always be dirty, and is in general very dark and narrow. It has this advantage, however, that as they are all of ſtone they have little to apprehend from fire, which in the opinion of ſome, would more than compenſate for every other diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In general, however, the higheſt and loweſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ements are poſſeſſed by the artificers, while the gentry and better ſort of people dwell in fifth and ſixth ſtories.</p>
                     <p>In London ſuch an habitation would not be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt elegible, and many a man in ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not be ſorry to deſcend a little lower. The
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031692_0423_0FEE22580521FAE8"/>
ſtyle of building here has given riſe to different ideas. Some years ago, a Scotch gentleman, who went to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the firſt time, took the uppermoſt ſtory of a lodging-houſe, and was very much ſurpriſed to find what he thought the genteeleſt place in the whole at the loweſt price. His friends who came to ſee him, in vain acquainted him with the miſtake he had ben guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of: "He ken'd very weel," he ſaid, what gentility was, and when he had livéd all his life in a ſixth ſtory, he was not come to London to live upon the ground."</p>
                     <p>From the right of the High-ſtreet you paſs over a very long bridge to the New Town. Before this bridge was built, you had a very ſteep hill to deſcend and to aſcend, which was found extremely inconvenient. A ſubſcription therefore was entered into to build one: and a moſt ſtupendous work it is indeed. It is thrown over this immenſe valley; and as no water runs under it, you have the whole effect of its heighth. From it you have a fine view up and down the vale, and the proſpect through the middle arch is inconceivably beautiful. Not long ago a part of this bridge gave way and many people who were upon it ſunk into the chaſm, and were buried in the ruins. Many others, who were likewiſe upon the bridge, ſaw the fate of their unfortunate companions, without being able to aſſiſt them. All was terror and conſternation. Every one fled from this ſcene of death as faſt as poſſible, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031692_0424_0FEE211D09D735F8"/>
the bridge to ſink under them at every ſtep, and themſelves to be cruſhed to pieces. When the bridge was cleared, and the general conſternation had a little ſubſided, it was found that only a ſmall part had given way, which they are now repairing, and making ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ever. But ſo great was the fear it occaſioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all ranks of people, that many of them look upon it with terror even to this day, and make it an objection to reſiding in the New Town, that they muſt neceſſarily paſs over it.</p>
                     <p>The New Town has been built upon one uniform plan, which is the only means of making a city beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Great part of this plan as yet remains to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, though they proceed as faſt as their ſupplies of money will allow them: The rent of the houſes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral amounts to an hundred pounds per annum, or upwards, and are moſt of them let to the inhabitants by builders, who buy the ground, and make what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they can of it. The greateſt part of the New Town is built after the manner of the Engliſh, and the houſes are what they call here "houſes to themſelves." Though this mode of living, one would imagine, is much preferable to the former, yet ſuch is the force of prejudice, that there are many people who prefer a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dark confined tenement on a ſixth ſtory, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of a whole houſe. One old lady fancies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſhould be loſt if ſhe was to get into ſuch an habitation,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031692_0425_0FEE211E922D6588"/>
another, that ſhe ſhould be blown away in going over the new bridge; and a third lives in the old ſtyle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is ſure that theſe new faſhions can come to "nae gude." But different as theſe ſentiments are in regard to living, they are not more different than the buildings themſelves. In no town that I ever ſaw can ſuch a contraſt be found betwixt the modern and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent architecture, or any thing that better merits the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>The pavement of the whole town is excellent. The granite, which long ſupplied London, till Jerſey and Guernſey robbed them of thoſe advantages, is dug from the hills cloſe to the town, and brought at very ſmall expence. Maitland, in his hiſtory of this town, calls it "grey marble;" but without diſputing about the propriety of the name, every one muſt allow it the very beſt ſtone poſſible for the purpoſe. They finiſh it with an exactneſs which the London workmen are indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent about, and which indeed London would not admit of, from the number of weighty carriages that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally go over it.</p>
                     <p>From the left of the High-ſtreet you paſs down by a number of different allies, or as they call them here, wynds and cloſſes, to the different parts of the old town: They are many of them ſo very ſteep, that it requires great attention to the feet to prevent falling; but ſo well accuſtomed are the Scotch to that poſition
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031692_0426_0FEE21259A71DA08"/>
of body required in deſcending theſe declivities, that I have ſeen a Scotch girl run down them with great ſwiftneſs in pattens.</p>
                     <p>This town has long been reproached with many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanly cuſtoms. A gentleman, who lately publiſhed his travels through Spain, ſays, "that Madrid, ſome years ago, might have vied with Edinburgh in filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs." It may probably be ſome pleaſure to this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and to thoſe who read him, to learn that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks are now very erroneous.</p>
                     <p>But if a ſtranger may be allowed to complain, it would be, that in theſe wynds, which are very numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the dirt is ſometimes ſuffered to remain two or three days without removal, and becomes offenſive to more ſenſes than one. The magiſtrates by impoſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>es and other puniſhments, have long put a ſtop to the throwing any thing from the windows into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſtreet. But as theſe alleys are unlighted, narrow, and removed from public view, they ſtill continue theſe practices with impunity. Many an elegant ſuit of clothes has been ſpoiled: many a powdered well-dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed maccaroni ſent home for the evening; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this period in Dr. Johſon's own ſimple words, "Many a full-flowing periwig moiſtened into flacidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty."</p>
                     <p>Such particulars, however, as theſe, ſcarce merit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. They are circumſtances reſulting from the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031692_0427_0FEE212721F21428"/>
peculiar inconveniency of the buildings, and not from the natural diſpoſition of the Scotch, who love cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and practice it. They lament the impropriety of theſe cuſtoms, and join in the laugh at the accidents they occaſion.</p>
                     <p>It has been the misfortune of almoſt every nation to be prejudged at a diſtance, or to be viſited by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men whoſe reſolutions are too ſtrong for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. They come with a fixed idea, that the Scotch are a dirty people. They probably meet with ſome perſon who is ſo, and would be ſo in any country; and away they hurry back and give, as they think, the juſt character of the whole nation. It has been the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar fortune of the Scotch to have been thus treated, but they are a ſenſible and ingenious people, and look upon theſe haſty cenſures in the manner they deſerve. But to every man, who is "Nullius addict us jurare in verba magiſtri," and who is biggoted to no particular cuſtoms, I make no ſcruple of declaring, that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis is not, as ſome of our countrymen pleaſe to ſay, dirty and diſagreeable; but adorned with many elegant and beautiful ſtructures, the ſeat of ſeveral of the moſt ingenious men in Europe; and who are an honour to the age they live in abounding in many of the politer embelliſhments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     <head>SECT. LXXI. A SINGULAR ANECDOTE.</head>
                     <p>ON our firſt arrival at Edinburgh, my companion and ſelf, after the fatigue of a long day's journey, upon enquiring for an inn, were taken to a houſe, where we were conducted by a girl without ſhoes or ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and with only a ſingle linſey-woollen petticoat, which juſt reached half-way to her ancles, into a room where about twenty Scotch drovers had been regaling themſelves with whiſky and potatoes. You may gueſs our amazement, when we were informed, "that this was the beſt inn in the metropolis—that we could have no beds, unleſs we had an inclination to ſleep together; and in the ſame room with the company, which a ſtage, coach had that moment diſcharged." Well, ſaid I to my friend, (for I have more patience on theſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than wit on any other) there is nothing like ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men and manners; perhaps we may be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ourſelves at ſome coffee houſe. Accordingly, on enquiry, we diſcovered that there was a good dame by the Croſs, who acted in the double capacity of pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out coffee, or letting lodgings to ſtrangers as we were. She was eaſily to be found out; and with all the conciliating complaiſance of a Maitreſſe d'Hotel,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031692_0429_0FEE212DE9AA1B70"/>
conducted us to our deſtined apartments, which were indeed ſix ſtories high; but ſo infernal to appearance, that you would have thought yourſelf in the regions of Erebus. The truth of this, I will venture to ſay, you will make no ſcruple to believe, when I tell you, that in the whole we had only two windows, which looked into an alley five feet wide, where the houſes were at leaſt ten ſtories high, and the alley itſelf was ſo ſombre in the brighteſt ſun-ſhine, that it was impoſſible to ſee any object diſtinctly.</p>
                     <p>And now I am in the ſtory-telling humour, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit giving an account of an adventure which happened here very lately to a friend of mine; as it tallies in ſome meaſure with what I have already rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſerves to confirm the wretchedneſs of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation which muſt be put up within this city. A gentleman from London, who had been appointed to ſome duty in a public office, came to Edinburgh, and having no friends to furniſh him with a bed, and few acquaintances to give him any aſſiſtance, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to conceal himſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> in one of theſe dark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodes, in order to be nigh the centre of the town, where his employment compelled him to paſs moſt part of the day. As he perceived his lodgings as good as his neighbours, it induced him to continue there until he diſcovered himſelf extremely weak and emaciated, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by conſtant violent perſpirations, in which be
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031692_0430_0FEE21314C72E7A8"/>
waked every morning. The obſervation which ſome of his aſſociates made on the alteration of his <hi>embonpoint,</hi> and the ſituation to which he was reduced, (for from a ſtout and luſty man he was now become a mere ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow) perſuaded him to think himſelf really ill, and in a conſumption. Accordingly he ſent for the Profeſſor, and another or two of the learned fraternity, who, with all the ſignificancy of pompous phyſic, pronounced him to be in a very declining ſtate, and adminiſtered every reſtorative which the AEſculapian art could ſuggeſt or ſupply. But all without effect. He ſtill continued to grow worſe; and at length, almoſt totally exhauſted, and giving himſelf a prey to deſpair, he ſent up for his landlady to be a witneſs to his will; who, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the melancholy event, and with tears in her eyes, ſaid, "How unfortunate ſhe had been ſince ſhe kept houſe; that her two former lodges had died with her; that ſhe was ſure ſhe did every thing to ſerve them all; that for her part, ſhe always took care that their linen was well aired; and as for her rooms, nothing could be drier or more free from dampneſs; that her neighbour, good man, was a baker, and his oven was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under them; that ſhe was ſure; therefore, they muſt be warm, and it was impoſſible to catch cold in her houſe."—"Good God," cried the gentleman, "an oven under my room! no wonder I am in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption

                        </gap> months." Upon which he ſent for the baker, and found what ſhe ſaid was really true; that the oven was immediately under his bed, and that the decreaſe of his health had been in proportion to the increaſe of the baker's buſineſs. The diſcovery, therefore, being a much better medicine than any the profeſſors could preſcribe, he quitted this <hi>enfer,</hi> by degrees recovered his ſtrength and conſtitution, and lives now to ridicule the oddity of the accident.</p>
                     <p>After all this, I am ſure every one will agree with me, that it is extremely ſtrange, that a city, which is a thorough fare into all Scotland, and now little inferior in politeneſs to London in many reſpects, ſhould not be better furniſhed with conveniences for ſtrangers, or have a public lodging-houſe where you can find toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able entertainment. But it really has not; and I am the more ſurpriſed at it, as, in their manner of living, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cuſtoms, I think the inhabitants much reſemble the French. But in this particular, what a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this place and Paris! where in a minute you may be provided with a houſe equal to one of the greateſt nobility, with ſervants, equipage, and all the luxuries of elegance and taſte; whilſt at Edinburgh, without an inn to put your head into, and without a lodging that you can breath in, you are obliged to bleſs your ſtars to get any place to repoſe yourſelf, till better

fortune, or better acquaintance, have intereſt enough to procure it in ſome private houſe.—It is a pity,—it is a diſgrace to the country; and I ſhould hope, ere long, the pride or good ſenſe of Scotland will ſo far prevail, as to eſtabliſh an hotel<note n="*" place="bottom">There are now two elegant hotels in the New Town, and a tavern on the new bridge.

                     <p>THIS country has long been celebrated for its hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality to ſtrangers; and I am ſure I can with great truth add my humble ſuffrage to this general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They do not think they have paid you all the attention that is neceſſary, when they have invited you once to dinner, and then take no more notice of you. They are eager to ſhow you repeated civilities. They
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031692_0433_0FEE213D422F8E18"/>
are happy to explain, to inform you of what is really curious in their country. They give you a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to their houſes. They beg of you to viſit them familiarly, and are ſorry if you do not do ſo. I am aſhamed to ſay that many of my countrymen ſeem to have forgot all their kindneſs the moment they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Tweed. I truſt thoſe waters will never waſh away my remembrance, but that I ſhall always be proud to own the hoſpitality of the Scotch, and the civilities I received in Scotland.</p>
                     <p>I know of no quality more conſpicuous in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this country, than complaiſance; which is common to every age and ſex, but more particularly to the women, who ſeem to make it a ſtudy to oblige, and endeavour to emulate each other in good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which, I think, is the art of ſhowing people, by external ſigns, the inward regard which we have for them. As nothing indicates the judgment of a nation more than good breeding, ſo it likewiſe diſcovers their good nature. For politeneſs is, in my opinion, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not only of good nature, but of good ſenſe. It gives a luſtre to every other charm, and conceals, in a great degree, every diſadvantage which women may lie under in their perſons. But I aſſure you, the Scotch ladies have no need of this enchanting accompliſhment on the laſt account. Nature has been as liberal to them in decorating their external parts, as in orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031692_0434_0FEE213EC9983CE0"/>
their minds; and I believe as few nations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel them in beauty, as in advantages derived from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and education. No women underſtand better the rules of decorum, nor are they rivalled by the French in the talent of agreeable converſation; for which they ſeem to be better calculated, as well from their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or knowledge of the world, as from their more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive acquaintance with books and literature.</p>
                     <p>When you are told, that on the firſt introduction to a lady in this country, you are favoured with a ſalute, which immediately diſcovers the fragrance of her breath, the downy velvet of her ſkin, and pearly enamel of her teeth; that the firſt words ſhe utters to you is either <hi>My good friend,</hi> or <hi>My dear ſir,</hi> which ſoftened by the ſweetneſs of her voice, and affability of her manner, muſt receive an additional degree of warmth and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; can you wonder that I am ſo enamoured with their company? or rather, do you not wonder that I can think of leaving them? But alas! alas! the time approaches for my departure; and if it was not for one dear object, who attracts me, like the faithful ſteel, to the magic circle of her arms, it would be with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt regret I ſhould bid farewell to a country, which is the land of pleaſure, rapture, and delight.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe you ſhould ſay, that theſe words, though very pleaſing at firſt on account of their novelty, muſt ſoon loſe their charm, when we come to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031692_0435_0FEE214225880840"/>
that they are mere words of cuſtom, and ceremony, and uttered without any intention of good-will or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; and that expreſſions of kindneſs, when they are not known to be the marks and effects of kindneſs, are empty ſounds; I muſt grant, that by degrees they become habitual, and do not operate ſo ſtrongly by uſe, as on a ſtranger. But ſurely, at any time they are the higheſt ſigns of complaiſance; and giving the appearance of truth to actions, and a ſtrong deſire to pleaſe and oblige, certainly produce a partiality for the ſpeaker: not by the words, which in common ſpeech ſignify ſcarce any thing; but becauſe by theſe words he ſhows that he thinks you worth notice. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of this nature are ingenious flattery. It makes thoſe, to whom it is paid, flatter themſelves, whilſt they look on it as a declaration of merit in themſelves: and pray, what mortal man does not love to be flattered by a lady; For my own part, if it is a fault, I muſt plead guilty; and though I deteſt it as much as hypocriſy in the male part of our ſpecies, I am not proof againſt it when aſſiſted by the fire of ſparkling eyes, and deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by female eloquence. A ſtaunch philoſopher would derive this credulity from the orig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031692_0436_0FEE214585BD3530"/>
flattery of the fair ſex, and ſure to give it credit, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we are conſcious of its untruth and inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
                     <p>The Scotch language has one beauty, in which it greatly excels the Engliſh, and in which alſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms to the Italian; that of diminutives, which are created at pleaſure, and expreſſed in one word, by the addition of a letter or ſyllable. Thus, they ſay, "man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, doggy, catty," for a little man, dog, or cat: "wifey" for a little wife; and if it was neceſſary to ſpeak of an inanimate thing, they do it in the ſame manner; as "a buckley, knifey, booky, houſey," for a little buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, knife, book, and a houſe. I need not tell you how emphatical this makes their tongue, and what an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement it is on ours. But their pronunciation and accent is far from being agreeable. It gives an air of gravity, ſedateneſs, and importance to their words; which though of uſe ſometimes in an harrangue or public diſcourſe, in common converſation ſeems dull, heavy, ſtupid, and unharmonious. On which account I ſcarcely ever heard a Scotchman tell a good ſtory in all my life: for notwithſtanding he might put in all the circumſtances to work it to a point, he would be ſure to ſpoil it by his deficiency in manner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſting, which ought to tickle the imagination of the hearer, by appearing not to feel it himſelf. The inhabitants of this place, who are acquainted with the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031692_0437_0FEE214AB13601D8"/>
Engliſh, are ſenſible of this, and endeavour to ſpeak like them, eſpecially the politer ſort of people, and the Profeſſors of the College, who, in their lectures, ſtrive to ſhake off the Scotch pronunciation as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The literary productions of this country being well known, it is unneceſſary for me to make any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on their ſtyle. I ſhall only ſay, that they appear to me, from their converſation, to write En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh as a foreign tongue; their mode of talking, phraſe, and expreſſion, but little reſembling the language of their works; though I cannot but add, that even ſome of them, in their converſation are fond of ſhowing their learning, by making uſe of words derived from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient languages. Amenity is a favourite word of a celebrated hiſtorian, who is truly the boaſt of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; who, in private reputation has as few equals, as in public, ſuperiors; and whoſe works may be juſtly ſaid to be "non ludicra cantilena ad momentum tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris, ſed monumentum ad aeternitatem."</p>

                     <p>A MAN who viſits this country, after having been in France, will find, in a thouſand inſtances, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:031692_0438_0FEE214C3AE9C598"/>
which there is betwixt theſe two nations. That air of mirth and vivacity, that quick and penetrating look, that ſpirit of gaiety which diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the French, is equally viſible in the Scotch. It is the character of the nation; and it is a very happy one, as it makes them diſregard even their poverty. Where there is any material difference, I believe, it may be attributed to the difference of their religion; for that ſame catholic religion, to ſay the truth of it, is a moſt comfortable one. The article of abſolution is certainly a bleſſed invention, and renders the ſpirits free and unclouded, by placing all the burthen of our ſins upon another man's back. A poor Engliſhman goes fretting and groaning, and carrying his miſerable face into all companies, as contagious as an epidemic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſorder, without one ſoul to take compaſſion on him, or pity his weakneſs: and ſhould he not have a wife or family at home who cannot avoid him, he finds no perſon who will bear his infirmities, or look as ſad as he does; but is conſtrained to wander about an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable being, till the month of November, and the <hi>maladie Angloiſe</hi> relieve him from his diſtreſſes.</p>
                     <p>But though the Scotch have no abſolution, they have ſomething very like it—a ſuperſtitious reliance on the efficacy of going conſtantly to church. Many of them may be ſaid to paſs half their lives there; for they go almoſt without ceaſing, and look as ſorrowful
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031692_0439_0FEE214F9A4762F0"/>
at the time as if they were going, not only to bury their ſins, but themſelves. At other hours, they are as cheerful and as gay as poſſible; and probably, from hence ariſes that eaſe, that ſpirit in their converſation, which charms in every company, and which is the life of every ſociety. They ſee no harm in innocent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity. They think a frank and unreſtrained beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the beſt ſign of a good heart; and agree with Lord Shafteſbury, "that gravity is the very eſſence of impoſture."</p>
                     <p>Whenever the Scotch of both Sexes meet, they do not appear as if they had never ſeen each other before, or wiſhed never to ſee each other again. They do not ſit in ſullen ſilence, looking on the ground, biting their nails, and at a loſs what to do with themſelves; and if ſome one ſhould be hardy enough to break ſilence, ſtart, as if they were ſhot through the ear with a piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol. But they addreſs each other at firſt ſight, and with an <hi>impreſſement</hi> that is highly pleaſing. They appear to be ſatisfied with one another, or at leaſt, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are not ſo, they have the prudence to conceal their diſlike. To ſee them in perfection, is to ſee them at their entertainments.</p>
                     <p>When dinners are given here, they are invitations of form. The entertainment of pleaſure is their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which reſemble the petit ſoupers of France. Of theſe they are very fond; and it is a mark of their
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031692_0440_0FEE2152F66CB570"/>
friendſhip to be admitted to be of the party. It is in theſe meetings that the pleaſures of ſociety and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation reign, when the reſtraints of ceremony are ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, and you ſee people really as they are: and I muſt ſay, in honour of the Scotch, that I never met with a more agreeable people, with more pleaſing or more inſinuating manners, in my life. Theſe little parties generally conſiſt of about ſeven or eight perſons, which prevents the converſation from being particular, and which it always muſt be in larger companies.</p>
                     <p>During the ſupper, which continues ſome time, the Scotch ladies drink more wine than an Engliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could well bear; but the climate requires it and probably in ſome meaſure it may enliven their natural vivacity. Without quoting foreign authorities, you will allow that a certain degree of wine adds great life to converſation. An Engliſhman, we know, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eſteemed the beſt companion in the world after the ſecond bottle; and who, before that, would not have opened his lips for the univerſe. After ſupper is removed, and they are tired of converſing, they vary the ſcene by ſinging, in which many of the Scotch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. There is a plaintive ſimplicity in the generality of their ſongs, to which the words are extremely well adapted, and which, from the mouth of a pretty Scotch girl, inconceivably attracting. You frequently feel the force of thoſe very expreſſions, that at another time you
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031692_0441_0FEE21584EFD8640"/>
would not underſtand, when they are ſung by a young perſon, whoſe inclinations and affections are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in the terms made uſe of, and which the heart claims as its own. The eye, the whole counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſpeak frequently as much as the voice; for I have ſometimes found that I had a very juſt idea of the tenor of a ſong, though I did not comprehend three words in the whole. Formerly it was the cuſtom for the bagpipe to play during their entertainments, and every family had their bard. In theſe ſongs were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed the martial and heroic deeds of their anceſtors, as incentives to their own courage; but in theſe pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times of peace, "our ſtern alarms are changed to merry meetings," and tales of love and gentleneſs have ſucceeded to thoſe of war. Inſtead of the drowſy hum of a bagpipe, which would certainly have laid my noble courage aſleep, the voice of ſome pretty girl claims your attention, which in my opinion, is no bad change. I muſt confeſs, I have not much opinion of thoſe feaſts "of other times," where your ears were continually ſtunned with the murders ſuch a man had committed, and where he was continually told of what he had already done, that he might perform the ſame again. His modeſty muſt certainly be put out of the queſtion, otherwiſe he could never have ſat to hear a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of his own deeds.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved of a Welch hero, "that he was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout man, a great warrior, and an excellent piper;
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031692_0442_0FEE2159D58D45E0"/>
and that he could play with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, the ſongs of all his actions." This is ſtill better—With ſuch authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ought any man to be blamed for talking of himſelf, and being the hero of his own tale? While every one is railing at the preſent times, it is ſome conſolation to find, that in many inſtances our forefathers were as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as we are; and that if we poſſeſs little, we have at leaſt the negative merit of not boaſting of what we have. I own I feel a pleaſure in reconciling us to ourſelves; for as ſome ingenious writers have proved that we are every way inferior to our anceſtors, ſince we cannot riſe to them, the only way left is to bring them down to us.</p>

                     <p>In a ſhort tour that I lately made to the highlands, an opportunity preſented itſelf of making my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the minds of this people; ſince I mixed with them, converſed on variety of ſubjects, lived in their families, and paſſed with them many a happy hour. As I frequently wandered over the mountains with my gun, I often found a ſequeſtered village, which had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle communication with the reſt of mankind, that had received ſcarce any form or faſhion from art and human invention; and, conſequently, not far remote from its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſimplicity. One day a ſtorm drove me to ſeek ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a ſmall cottage, which I by chance eſpied in a deep valley at the foot of one of their mountains; and on entering, I ſaw a venerable old woman, with another about thirty, and five or ſix pretty infants, which, by their reſemblance, I eaſily diſcovered to be her children, all employed in ſome domeſtic concer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and waiting the return of the maſter of the family, who, I afterwards found, was gone to provide fiſh and other neceſſaries, from a ſmall town on the banks of the neighbouring lake. When they perceived me at the door, the moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the little ones came immediately to meet me, and, with a countenance full of benevolence and hoſpitality, ſaluted me in the Earſe language; which, though I did not underſtand it, ſeemed to welcome to whatever
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031692_0445_0FEE2163EFA2BF78"/>
they could afford, or I could expect to find there. She then reached me a ſtool, which was made of ruſhes, ſeeing I did not comprehend her tongue, and was pointing to me to ſit down by the fire, when I addreſſed myſelf to the old lady in the corner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether ſhe could ſpeak Engliſh; but they all ſhook their heads and were ſilent. I then unloaded my game-bag, which contained a white hare, and ſome ptarmigan, and began to court their good opinion, by preſenting them to the children, and endeavouring to divert them, by ſhowing them my ſhooting implements and other things which I had in my pocket, and which ſeemed to give them much delight: the woman in the mean time, making ſigns to me to pull off my wet clothes, and holding out a plaid which they had warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fire. On my ſeeming to refuſe their kind offices, they ſhook themſelves and looked ſorrowful, which meant as I ſince learned, if I did not change my dreſs, I ſhould catch an ague: a diſorder to which they were extremely ſubject.</p>
                     <p>As the weather continued to threaten, and night was not far off, I ſat myſelf down by the hearth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed myſelf by pulling off the feathers of one of the birds, which I made them comprehend would be very acceptable, as I had eat nothing almoſt the whole day; and juſt as I was preparing to broil it, the highlander opened the door, and, expreſſing his ſurpriſe at finding
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031692_0446_0FEE216576371EB0"/>
a ſtranger had taken poſſeſſion of his houſhold goods, in a free and good-natured tone of voice, in the Scotch language, begged of me to proceed in my employ, and enquired the reaſon of this viſit; adding, with a ſmile, "that I muſt have entertained his wife and mother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well during his abſence, to become ſo familiar with them; eſpecially as they did not underſtand me, and had never in their lives beheld the face of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perſon, except a few of their own Clan, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited the other ſide of the hill."</p>
                     <p>When I had told him my ſtory, and intreated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the freedom I had taken, he embraced me with the higheſt degree of rapture, and ordering the others to do the ſame, told me, "the gentleman with whom I had been, and to whoſe houſe I wiſhed to return the next day, was the head of his Clan; that he reſpected him, and would die for him; and ſince I was a viſitor to the Laird, I claimed from him every kind of hoſpital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and convenience, which his poor pittance could ſupply; though he added, as a ſtranger, who had loſt my way, I had a right to civility and aſſiſtance from every man."</p>
                     <p>When I had finiſhed my ptarmigan, of which they would none of them partake, he produced on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſome dried fiſh, cheeſe, and oat-cake, of which they all eat with an appetite that diſcovered their pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, and that brought to my remembrance the ſaying
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:031692_0447_0FEE216C9EBD4EF8"/>
of the philoſopher, that "He that eats with an empty ſtomach needs no variety of food; he that drinks only for thirſt deſires leaſt change of liquor; and he that wants leaſt, comes neareſt to the gods." On our being ſatisfied, he gave ſome to the infants, and ſaid a grace in the preſbyterian form, praiſing God with more fervent devotion than ever I met with in an Engliſh biſhop at the adminiſtration of the ſacrament.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of the night we ſpent in converſation, whilſt they plied me heartily with whiſkey; and I anſwered a number of queſtions which were demanded of me by the women, thro' him as interpreter; till at length, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powered by fatigue, I repoſed myſelf in a plaid by the fire, and enjoyed as ſound a ſlumber, as if my head had been pillowed on down,

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The morning aroſe, and I took farewell of my kind hoſteſſes, who parted with me, with many expreſſions of friendſhip; and, if I may judge from their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, wiſhed that the ſtormy weather had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I might have been detained longer. The highlander accompanied me acroſs the mountains in my progreſs homeward, cheating the drearineſs of the way by his entertaining diſcourſe, concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of his family, and the anceſtors of his Laird, whom he had followed in the rebellion, and under
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:031692_0448_0FEE216E271EE480"/>
whoſe banners he had ventured his life and fortune. We had now arrived within ſight of the houſe of my friend, when he wiſhed me health and ſucceſs through life, and that I might never go further out of my right way than when I wandered to his habitation. I paid this kindneſs with all the coin I was then maſter of, and parted with a thouſand thanks and gratitude for his civilities.</p>
                     <p>I have detained you all this while with this length of ſtory, in order to paint to you the true character of a Scotch peaſant; and I dare ſay you will be aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find ſo many virtues in a family in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, where the inhabitants are thought by us to be in a ſtate of barbariſm. But ſuch, I aſſure you, they all are,

                           <l>Extrema per illos,</l>

                        </q>
Even in Edinburgh, the ſame ſpirit runs through the common people, who are infinitely more civil, human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, and hoſpitable, than I ever met with. Every one is ready to ſerve and aſſiſt a ſtranger; they ſhow the greateſt reſpect to a perſon ſuperior to them, and you never receive an impertinent anſwer. As to their country, it is beautiful and grand to a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and though far from being temperate, is ſo healthy, that you hear of fewer diſorders than amongſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people; and I declare, in every part that
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031692_0449_0FEE2173136AB018"/>
I have been, I never ſaw either an exceedingly deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon, or an aged, toothleſs, paralytic highlander. They eat a great quantity of fiſh dried in the ſun, and a cake made of oatmeal, baked hard and flat. Their conſtant liquor is whiſky, which is alſo made from oats, has a quick taſte, extremely heady, but comfortable to the ſtomach; unpalatable to ſtrangers, though hot and nouriſhing to thoſe who are uſed to it.</p>

                     <head>SECT. LXXV. OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DIVERSIONS OF THE INHABITANTS OF EDINBURGH; AND MANNER OF EDUCATING THE YOUNG LADIES.</head>
                     <p>THEY have at Edinburgh an elegant play-houſe, and tolerable performers: aſſemblies, concerts, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic gardens, and walks, card parties, and a hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diverſions, which in ſome degree keep me from pining for your Feſtino, Bach's concert, or Almack's.</p>
                     <p>As the genius of any people is not more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in their ſerious moments, than when they give a looſe to freedom and pleaſure; ſo the Scotch nation is peculiarly characterized by the mode of their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. A ſober ſedate elegance pervades them all,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:031692_0450_0FEE217A253131C8"/>
blended with an eaſe and propriety which delights, and is ſure to meet with approbation. A Scotchman does not relax himſelf for amuſements, as if to paſs away the hour. He ſeems even in the heighth of pleaſure, buſy and intent, and as he would do, were he about to gain ſome advantage. His diverſions are not calculated to ſeduce the unwary, or recreate the idle, but to unbend the mind, without corrupting it. He ſeems as if in his infancy he had been taught to make learning his diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and was now reverſing it, and making his diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion his ſtudy.</p>
                     <p>But beſides the public entertainments of this city, which are derived from company, the inhabitants have more reſources of pleaſure within themſelves than in many other places. The young people paint, draw, are fond of muſic, or employ their hours in reading, and acquiring the accompliſhments of the mind. Every boarding-ſchool Miſs has ſomething of this kind to recommend her, and make her an agreeable compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; and inſtead of a little ſmattering of French, which is the higheſt ambition to attain in Queen's Square, you find them in Edinburgh entertaining in converſation, ſentimental, and well-informed. The mode of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the young ladies, is here highly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and admirably calculated to make them good wives. Beſides needle-work, and thoſe trifling arts, which are the principal part of their inſtruction in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:031692_0451_0FEE217BABBE68F8"/>
the precepts of morality, virtue, and honour, are taught them from their earlieſt infancy, whilſt they are inſtructed to conſider themſelves as beings born for ſociety, for more than outſide appearance, and tranſitory pleaſure, and to attend to the knowledge of what is uſeful, rather than the oeconomy of a tambour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frame.</p>
                     <p>The ladies alſo who undertake this arduous taſk of inſtruction, are perſons much better qualified in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than in other countries. They likewiſe introduce them into the politeſt company, and give them a taſte for elegant and proper amuſements; ſo that when they leave ſchool, they are not only miſtreſſes of thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments which are neceſſary to command a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but have the deportment and behaviour of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced women of faſhion.</p>
                     <p>No ladies in Scotland ever murder the precious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in what is called "work," which is neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment nor profit, merely becauſe they muſt have the appearance of doing ſomething, whilſt they ſee ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one employed around them. They let no minute eſcape without its reſpective office, which may be of utility to themſelves or others; and after a proper ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to reading and literature, gain inſtruction from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and converſation.</p>
                     <p>I have often thought it a principal defect in the ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:031692_0452_0FEE217D340B8C20"/>
of the Engliſh ladies, that they are taught to pay ſo much attention to the practice of ſewing work, and other needle operations, whilſt they neglect learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greater importance and pleaſure. Since they have minds equally capable of inſtruction with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſex, why ſhould they not be enlightened with the ſame kind of knowledge? eſpecially as they ſeem more ſuited to it, as well from their ſuperior ſenſibility, as their greater leiſure and domeſtic life. Why ſhould the charactereſtic which diſtinguiſhes us from brutes, be ſo ſtrongly cultivated in the male, and have ſo little attention paid to it in the female ſpecies? Wiſdom and ſcience are not perfections in us merely becauſe we are men; but as reaſonable creatures, who have the pre-eminence over the reſt of the creation. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neceſſary for the ladies to know theſe things, in order to qualify them for domeſtic oeconomy; but I have no idea of any woman, except her whoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances cannot afford the expence of paying a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, making them her employ, or putting them in practice.</p>
                     <p>The married ladies of this city ſeldom entertain large ſets of company, or have routs as in London. They give the preference to private parties, and <hi>converſaziones,</hi> where they play at cards for ſmall ſums, and never run the riſk of being obliged to diſcharge a debt of honour at the expence of their virtue and innocence. They
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031692_0453_0FEE2184491881A8"/>
often frequent the theatre, and ſhow great taſte and judgment in the choice of plays, where Mr. Digges performs a principal character.</p>
                     <p>As to exerciſe, they ſeldom ride on horſeback; but find much pleaſure in walking, to which the ſoil and country is peculiarly adapted, being dry, pleaſant, and abounding in proſpects and romantic ſcenes. It is likewiſe cuſtomary for them to drive in their carriages to the ſands at Leith and Muſſelburgh, and parade backwards and forwards, after the manner of Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough; and other public places of ſea-bathing reſort. For vivacity and agility in dancing, none excel the Scotch ladies. Their execution in reels and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-dances is amazing; and the variety of ſteps which they introduce, and the juſtneſs of their ear is beyond deſcription. They are very fond alſo of minuets, but fall greatly ſhort in the performance of them, as they are deficient in grace and elegance in their motions. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them play on the harpſicord and guitar, and ſome have muſic in their voices, though they rather love to hear others perform than play themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I do not think the Scotch ladies are great proficient in the languages. They rarely attempt any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the French; which, indeed, they ſpeak with great propriety, fluency, and good accent; but they make up for it by their accurate and juſt knowledge
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031692_0454_0FEE2185D0A087E0"/>
of their own. They talk very grammatically, are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly attentive to the conformity of their words to their ideas, and are great critics in the Engliſh tongue. They chiefly read hiſtory and plaintive poetry; but elegies and paſtorals are their favourites. Novels and romances they feel and admire; and thoſe chiefly which are tender, ſympathetic, ſoothing, or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.—Their hearts are ſoft, and full of paſſion, and a well told ſtory makes a deep impreſſion on them. Like virgin wax, a gentle heat mollifies their minds, which reflects the fineſt touches of art and ſentiment.</p>
                     <p>Nor are the gentleman in Edinburgh leſs rational in their diverſions than the ladies. There is only one in which I can cenſure their conduct. They rather pay too much reſpect to the divinity of Bacchus, and offer too copious libations at the ſhrine of that jovial deity. Their wines, indeed, of all kinds are excellent, and their climate not the moſt comfortable; ſo that ſome allowance ought to be made them in that reſpect. But as they are, they are by no means ſo intemperate as the Germans; and, perhaps, their appearing to me in the leaſt intemperate, may be occaſioned by my peculiar averſion to, and abſtinence from all intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting liquors. I have neither taſte to reliſh, nor head to bear them. I have no idea of a man extending the pleaſure of drinking beyond thirſt, or forcing, in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, an appetite artificial, and againſt nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="unknown:031692_0455_0FEE218758157760"/>
The youths in this country are very manly in their exerciſes and amuſements. Strength and agility ſeem to be moſt their attention. The inſignificant paſtimes of marbles, tops, &amp;c. they are totally unacquainted with. The diverſion which is peculiar to Scotland, and in which all ages find great pleaſure, is golf. They play at it with a ſmall leathern ball, like a fives ball, and a piece of wood, flat on one ſide, in the ſhape of a ſmall bat, which is faſtened at the end of a ſtick, of three or four feet long, at right angles to it. The art conſiſts in ſtriking the ball with this inſtrument, into a hole in the ground, in a ſmaller number of ſtrokes than your adverſary. This game has the ſuperiority of cricket, and tennis, in being leſs violent and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but in point of dexterity and amuſement, by no means to be compared with them. However, I am informed that ſome ſkill and nicety are neceſſary to ſtrike the ball to the propoſed diſtance and no further, and that in this there is a conſiderable difference in players. It requires no great exertion and ſtrength, and all ranks and ages play at it. They inſtruct their children in it, as ſoon as they can run alone, and grey hairs boaſt their execution. As to their other diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they dance, play at cards, love ſhooting, hunting, the pleaſures of the field; but are proficients in none of them. When they are young, indeed, they dance, in the manner of their country, extremely well; but afterwards (to ſpeak in the language of the turf) they train off, and are too robuſt and muſcular to poſſeſs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace or agility.</p>

                     <p>NOTHING can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland. The whole country appears a large gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; the roads are well paved, ſhaded on each ſide with rows of trees, and bordered with large canals, full of boats paſſing and repaſſing. Every twenty paces gives you the proſpect of ſome villa, and every four hours that of a large town, ſo ſurpriſingly neat, I am ſure you would be charmed with them. The Hague is certainly one of the fineſt villages in the world. Here are ſeveral ſquares finely built, and (what I think a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular beauty) the whole ſet with thick large trees. The <hi>Voor-hout</hi> is, at the ſame time, the Hyde-Park and Mall of the people of quality: for they take the air in it both on foot and in coaches.</p>
                     <p>The appearance of Rotterdam gives one very great pleaſure. All the ſtreets are paved with broad ſtones, and before many of the meaneſt artificers doors are placed ſeats of various coloured marbles, ſo neatly kept, that I aſſure you I walked almoſt over the town yeſterday, <hi>incognito,</hi> in my ſlippers, without receiving one ſpot of dirt; and you may ſee the Dutch maids waſhing the pavement of the ſtreets with more application than ours do our bed chambers.</p>

                        <pb n="134" facs="unknown:031692_0457_0FEE2190039603B8"/>
The town ſeems ſo full of people, with ſuch buſy faces, all in motion, that I can hardly fancy it is not ſome celebrated fair; but I ſee it is every day the ſame. It is certain no town can be more advantageouſly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for commerce. Here are ſeven large canals, on which the merchants ſhips come up to the very doors of their houſes. The ſhops and wharehouſes are of a ſurprizing neatneſs and magnificence, filled with an incredible quantity of fine merchandize, and ſo much cheaper than what we ſee in England, that I have much ado to perſuade myſelf I am ſtill ſo near it. Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be ſeen. One is not ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe loathſome cripples ſo common in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, nor teazed with the importunity of idle perſons that chuſe to be naſty and lazy. The common ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and little ſhop-women here are more nicely clean than ſome of our Ladies; and the great variety of neat dreſſes (every woman dreſſing her head after her own faſhion) is an additional pleaſure in ſeeing the town.</p>

                     <p>ROTTERDAM lies on the north ſide of the Maeſe, about fifteen miles from the ſea, is of a triangular form, and, in point of trade, inferior only to Amſterdam; in

the ſpaciouſneſs of the ſtreets, and elegance of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, infinitely beyond it. The canals are ſo large as to admit ſhips of two or three hundred tons, even to the very doors of the merchants; and I know not ſo ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic a ſight, as to ſee from the environs, the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, maſts of ſhips, and the tops of trees, ſo promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly huddled together, that it would acquire a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of divination to tell whether it is a town, a fleet, or a foreſt.</p>
                     <p>The grandeſt, as well as moſt agreeable ſtreet in Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, is the Bomb Quay, which lies parallel with the Maeſe. On one ſide it is open to the river, and the other is ornamented with a grand facade of the beſt houſes in the city, inhabited chiefly by the Engliſh. They are five or ſix ſtories high, maſſy, and very clum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. Wherever there is any attempt at ornament, it is the worſt that can be conceived. One ſees no Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian architecture, except Doric entablatures, ſtuck up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of the upper ſtory, without pilaſters; Ionic volutes, turned often the wrong way, and an attempt at Corinthian capitals, without any other part of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The doors are large, and ſtuck with great knobs and clumſy carving. You aſcend to them, not in front, but by three or four ſteps going up on each ſide, and you are aſſiſted by iron rails of a moſt immenſe thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Theſe houſes are almoſt all window, and the window ſhutters and frames being painted green, the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031692_0459_0FEE2198A7DCBA28"/>
glaſs has all a green caſt, which is helped by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection from the trees that over-ſhadow their houſes, which, were it not for this circumſtance, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably hot, from their vicinity to the canals. Moſt of the houſes have looking-glaſſes placed on the outſides, of the windows, on both ſides, in order that they may ſee every thing which paſſes up and down the ſtreet. The ſtair-caſes are narrow, ſteep, and come down al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the door. The Bomb Quay is ſo broad, that there are diſtinct walks for carriages and foot paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, lined and ſhaded with a double row of trees. You look over the river on ſome beautiful meadows, and a fine avenue of trees, which leads to the Peſt-houſe. It ſeems to be an elegant building, and the trees round it are ſo diſpoſed as to appear a thick wood.</p>
                     <p>This ſtreet is at leaſt half a mile in length, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends from the Old to the New Head, the two places where the water enters to fill the canals of this extenſive city. I muſt obſerve, that when water runs through a ſtreet, it then aſſumes the name of a canal, of which kind the Heerenfleet has the pre-eminence. The houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are of free-ſtone, and very lofty; the canal is ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and covered with ſhips. At one end ſtands the Engliſh church, a neat pretty building, of which the biſhop of London is Ordinary.</p>

bigger than the life, in braſs, and clad in a Doctor's gown. He was born in 1467, and died at Friburg in Alſace, in the year 1536.</p>
                     <p>Near to the market place is the great church of St. Laurence. From the tower I had as extenſive a view as my eye could command, there being neither hill nor wood to interrupt my ſight. I ſaw Delft and the Hague to the north; Dort, to the ſouth; Brill, to the weſt; Amſterdam, to the eaſt, and Utrecht lies off to the ſouth-eaſt.</p>
                     <p>There are four churches in Rotterdam of the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed religion, which is Calviniſm, and twelve clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to attend them, whoſe ſtipends are one hundred and ſeventy pounds per au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>um each, which is paid out of the revenues of the city. St. Laurence is like all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dutch churches, diveſted of ornament; gloomy and dark, by reaſon of the numberleſs atchievements; which are hung every where round the walls, and which are in general of black velvet, with the arms blazon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, encompaſſed in a heavy black frame.</p>
                     <p>I look on the exchange, which was finiſhed in 1736, to be the fineſt building in Rotterdam. It is a quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangle of free-ſtone, with a light cloiſter. It is much neater, though not ſo large as our Royal Exchange. There is, however, no merit in the architecture.</p>
                     <p>We laſt night hired a coach, which is fixed at a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an hour, to take us to Delfts-Hagen, a little village
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031692_0461_0FEE219BB53BD690"/>
about half an hour's diſtance. The road was very pleaſant, being planted on each ſide with trees. There was nothing ſufficiently curious in the place itſelf to drag us from Rotterdam; but it being a public fair, we wiſhed to ſee the humours of a Dutch Wake. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's toys and womens ſlippers ſeemed to make the chief figure, there being little elſe to be fold.</p>
                     <p>We followed the ſound of a fiddle into a little ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and walked up ſtairs into a room full of peaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and tobacco. There were four girls jumping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which they called dancing, and thirty or forty men ſitting round with their pipes and tabacco, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the activity of the nymphs, and rolling out ſuch clouds of ſmoke, that we were ſoon obliged to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw to avoid ſuffocation. From thence we went to a barn to ſee a Dutch tragedy and farce. Two of the actreſſes were tolerably pretty. But Dutch, even from the mouth of beauty, would be an antidote to love.</p>
                     <p>Leaving Rotterdam, we went to Delft in the treck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchuyte, and walked through the town to the Hague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, where we found the boat juſt ready to puſh off. The canal from thence to Ryſwick is ſkirted with rows of elms. Inſtead of going on to the Hague, we got out at the bridge, and walked down to the village, at about half a mile's diſtance. The palace is old, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired and unfurniſhed; famous only for the peace
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031692_0462_0FEE21A2CDAE3A50"/>
made there, ſo advantageous to the Dutch, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate powers of Europe, with Lewis XIV. in 1697. The Prince now and then comes there for half an hour, and amuſes himſelf with courſing hares in the court yard, which is within a wall about fifty yards ſquare. A very princely recreation!</p>
                     <p>We dined at the Strack-huis, and met with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable repaſt, which we little expected in ſuch a place. In the cool of the evening we walked to the Hague, at the diſtance of two ſhort miles, under the ſhade of a row of elms.</p>
                     <p>The Hague in French, <hi>la Haye, the Hedge,</hi> is only a village, not being walled, nor ſending deputies to the ſtates. Nevertheleſs, it is the reſidence of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign ambaſſadors, the ſeat of government, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſpute, the moſt beautiful place on earth. On the ſouth ſide lies Delft, on the north the houſe in the Wood, Scheveling, and the ſea to the weſt, and the great canal to Leyden on the eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The Hague is totally ſurrounded with a canal, over which are many bridges, and a row of lofty trees bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the water's edge. The ſtreets are ſo ſpacious, and ſo much adorned with trees and water, that you can ſcarce conceive yourſelf in a town; and there are ſo many ſquares and public places laid out in ſhady walks, and ſurrounded with ſuch magnificent buildings, that it beggars all deſcription.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="unknown:031692_0463_0FEE21A4551E5388"/>
I will mention two or three of the moſt ſtriking parts of the Hague, among which I think the Vyverburg has the pre-eminence. It is a kind of ſquare, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeveral ſhady walks; on one ſide, a row of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent houſes; on the other, the Vyver, which is a large baſon of water faced with ſtone, two hundred yards in length, and near one hundred in breadth. In the centre of it is an iſland planted with trees. One end of the Vyverburg opens to the Voor-hout, which is a large plantation of trees, in the Middle of which is the Mall, railed in on both ſides. It is ſtrewed with ſhells, as are all the walks in Holland, there being neither ſtone nor gravel in the whole country. The walks are conſequently unpleaſant, as the ſhells never bind, but crumble into duſt, and feel like looſe ſand under your feet.</p>
                     <p>The New Princeſs Graft is a row of palaces, rather than of houſes, which front the wood, from which they are divided by a broad pavement and a canal. Caſuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet is adjoining, in which is the French Play-houſe, a neat little theatre. We were at the Comedy on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening. The actors were tolerably good.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not omit mentioning the Prince Graft, which is half a mile in length, proportionably broad, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſtraight, with a canal ſhaded with trees, running through the midſt of it, over which are thrown many fine ſtone bridges, with iron rails on them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="unknown:031692_0464_0FEE21A5DC92E930"/>
One of the greateſt curioſities in the Hague, is the Prince's cabinet, which is open at twelve o'clock on Fridays, and acceſſible to all ſtrangers, who previouſly ſend their names. This houſe was purchaſed of the Counteſs of Albemarle, faces the Vyver, and is ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the corner of the Outer Court, where the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards parade.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt room you ſee a ſmall, but moſt excellent collection of Chineſe ſwords, knives, and other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in gold, richly inlaid with precious ſtones; and ear-rings, bracelets, and much female ornament and apparel. In the next apartment is a good collection of ſhells, among which the Concha Veneris did not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape my notice; the ſhape being entirely analagous to the name.</p>
                     <p>In the third room is a brilliant ſhow of precious ſtones, foſſils, minerals, and petrifactions. The fourth apartment is filled with various kinds of ſerpents and ſmall animals; and the laſt room is ornamented with a large collection of birds extremely well preſerved.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the beſt part of the Cabinet, and there are many rare ſpecies among them; but the collection is now eclipſed by that which has been ſince collected by Sir Aſhton Lever, and is now exhibited at London by Mr. Parkinſon.</p>
                     <p>The diſpoſition and neatneſs of the whole is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and well worthy of a ſtranger's attention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="unknown:031692_0465_0FEE21A94E49E1F8"/>
The palace of the ſtadtholder is ſituated in the center of the town, ſurrounded by a moat. Its external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is not very ſtriking, being an old irregular building; but a finer collection of pictures by the Dutch and Flemiſh maſters I have never ſeen; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a little room called the Study, filled by the moſt capital painters.</p>
                     <p>The Virgin, with the bleſſed Infant in her arms, by Raphael; Adam and Eve in Paradiſe, ſurrounded with birds and beaſts, by Brughel; Portraits, by Rembrandt, Vandyke, and Hans Holbein. A Dutch kitchen full of game, fiſh, and fleſh, moſt admirably done, by Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers. Many landſcapes and fancy pieces, by Gabriel Metzu, Jan-Steen, Potter, and Wouvermans. I look on this room to be complete. There is not a picture, but may be dwelt on with delight.</p>
                     <p>In the other apartments among many fine pieces, you will find a very large one by Potter, painted in 1647. The deſign is a peaſant looking at his cattle. The flies on the cows ſeem alive, and a toad ſitting on the graſs has equal excellence.</p>
                     <p>Abraham ſacrificing Iſaac, in ivory, is inimitably carved.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome fruit and game pieces by Weeninx, well done; and ſome excellent pieces on copper, by Rothenamer.</p>
                     <p>At a church near the Hague we ſaw many ſtorks walking about as tame as our turkies. They are ſome.
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031692_0466_0FEE21B06B6E31D0"/>
what in ſhape like a heron. Their colour is white, and their wings are tipped with black. They live upon the offal of the fiſh-market, which is near the church. I have ſeen numbers of them in the meadows, though they are eſteemed birds of paſſage, and in autumn they are not very common. The vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar error is, that theſe birds are ſo fond of liberty, that they will live only in a republic. I am ſure, in point of policy, they cannot live in a more deſirable country, as they have fiſh and frogs in abundance for their food, and the utmoſt ſecurity for themſelves, it being deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a crime to mal-treat or kill them.</p>

                     <p>WE went in the treckſchuyte to Leyden with a Dutch General we had lived with at the Table d'Hote at the Hague. The diſtance was only ten miles; but the whole canal being edged with ſummer-houſes and gardens belonging to the inhabitants of thoſe towns, who in the ſummer retire to theſe little boxes, made the ſcene appear moſt beautiful, and the diſtance nothing.</p>

When we arrived at the inn we were recommended to, we found it filled by the French Ambaſſador and his train; and for want of an interpreter we wandered about the town till it was dark, and met with two or three diſagreeable circumſtances, which made me la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my ignorance of the Dutch language; but at length we found the <hi>Golden Ball,</hi> an Engliſh houſe, and with my wants vaniſhed my deſire of talking Dutch.</p>
                     <p>Leyden is eſteemed, in point of ſize, the ſecond ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Holland, but its trade is now inconſiderable, which in the woollen manufactory was formerly very extenſive. The city is ſurrounded with a rampart and a wide canal. The moſt elegant ſtreet is the Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, which runs from the Hague-gate to the Utrecht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. It is a little on the curve, which adds, I think, much to its beauty. The pavement is extremely fine, and the ſtreet riſes in the center like the new paved ſtreets in London. It is very ſpacious, as indeed are moſt of the ſtreets in Leyden.</p>
                     <p>Among the canals the Rapinbury is the moſt beautiful. The houſes are magnificent; the bridges ſtone, with iron rails; and there are trees on each ſide of the canal. It is ſaid that there are 145 bridges, and 180 ſtreets in the city of Leyden. The Old Rhine runs through this town, and loſes itſelf in the little village of Catwick, which lies in the neighbourhood.</p>

It is there that the learned Scaliger, Lipſius, Salmaſius, and Boerhaave gained ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by their lectures, and brought ſtudents from all parts of Europe to attend them.</p>
                     <p>The Botanic Garden has always been one of the moſt reſpectable in Europe, both on account of the famous profeſſors who have preſided over it, and the number of curious exotics growing in it as may be ſeen in Boerhaave's and Van Royen's catalogues. It is nicely arranged, and kept in excellent order.</p>
                     <p>On one ſide of theſe gardens is a very curious col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of antique marbles, given by Gerard Papen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brochius, a burgo-maſter of Amſterdam. I cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

mentioning the ſtatues of Hercules, of Bacchus leaning on a fawn, attended by a tyger, of an Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantia as big as the life, and of a naked Apollo; all which have eſpecial merit.</p>
                     <p>Adjoining to the ſtatues is the Natural Philoſophy School, in which lectures are read. You will find in it a good collection of natural curioſities; ſome very fine petrifactions; in particular, a piece of oak, one ſide of which has been poliſhed, and vies both in hardneſs and colour with an agate. Some curious pieces of cryſtal, formed by nature to an apex, with ſix angles, as exact and as finely poliſhed as if the production of art. A fiſh called the Meduſa's Head, from a thouſand little fibres darting out from its body in a circle like twiſted rays. This, in itſelf, is very curious; but the exact repreſentation of it in a natural agate, is much more ſo.</p>
                     <p>But I think one of the greateſt curioſities is the aſbeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos from Tranſylvania. It is a ſtone with a ſoft down on it like velvet, of a dove colour. Of this is made both paper and linen; we ſaw ſamples of both. The very peculiar property of it is, that fire has no effect on it, for it ſtill continues its form unchanged and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſumed.</p>
                     <p>Among the beaſts was an ermine, about the ſize and ſhape of a weaſel. This little animal is ſo fearful of
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031692_0470_0FEE21BC22178DE8"/>
dirtying its ſkin, that it would ſooner loſe its liberty than its cleanlineſs.</p>
                     <p>There was a kind of toad which brings forth its young from its back. On obſerving it, we perceived infinite numbers of young toads adhering to the back, which appeared like the broken ſcales of a fiſh.</p>
                     <p>The toad-fiſh from America is an extraordinary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is for the firſt ſix months a toad, then changes by degrees into a fiſh. This had half completed its transformation, having the tail of a fiſh, with the head and fore parts of a toad.</p>
                     <p>The Penna Marina belongs to the animal ſpecies. It is the production of the ocean, looks like a plant, and is nothing more than a ſtem of about two inches long with a kind of feather at the end of it, not unlike a quill with part of the feathers cut off.</p>
                     <p>Among the feathered race, the moſt curious was the Hydracorax Indicus; the only one in Europe; larger than a turkey—black—"Roſtro unicorni, cornu, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curvo,"—if I may expreſs myſelf in the technical terms of Ornithology.</p>
                     <p>There was an immenſe beaſt, called the Hippopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, as large as an elephant, its colour black, with a row of grinders in the interior part of its mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a good number in front.</p>

                     <p>AMSTERDAM is ſituated on the river Amſtel, and an arm of the ſea called the Y, at the mouth of the Zuyder Sea, and is built in the form of a creſcent. It is fortified with a foſſe of great depth and width, with a rampart of earth faced with brick, ſtrengthened with twenty-ſix baſtions, in each of which ſtands a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill, ornamented with eight magnificent gates of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, built either in a ſemi-circular or octagonal ſhape. In all the chief ſtreets are canals ſhaded with trees, the grandeſt of which is the Heere-graſt, or canal of Lords. This is the place of reſidence for the bankers and chief merchants; for here every one is in trade. The few nobles of Holland reſide always at the Hague. Thoſe ſtreets in which there are no canals, are vilely narrow. The Neſs, in which we live, I had the curioſity to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and it is only ſixteen feet wide. The houſes are lofty, and the bridges are chiefly of ſtone.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031692_0472_0FEE21C2EC999A40"/>
and is ſuppoſed, according to the beſt calculation, to contain at preſent 250,000 inhabitants, though it was at the beginning of the thirteenth century, an inconſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable fiſhing village on the edge of a moraſs, which is now covered with buildings, erected upon piles of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, driven into the earth, at immenſe labour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. For the foundation only of one tower, 6000 trees were rammed into the ground. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe precautions, the magiſtrates are ſo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the foundations, that very few coaches are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed. The carriages in general are fixed on ſledges, drown by one horſe, the driver attending on foot.</p>
                     <p>There are fifteen churches of the eſtabliſhed, that is, the Calviniſtic religion, which are ſerved by thirty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, equal in authority and revenue. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed two hundred and forty pounds per annum each, which is paid by the city.</p>
                     <p>The moſt ſtupendous undertaking in this city is the Stadt houſe, which you enter by ſeven ſmall gates par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel to each other, inſtead of one magnificent portal, equal to a front, which extends itſelf 282 feet, whoſe heighth is 116, and the breadth 232 feet. The build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of ſtone, with pillars of the Corinthian order. It is erected on 13,659 piles of timber, and was finiſhed in 1655. On the top is a ſtatue of Alas in braſs, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his ſhoulders a copper globe, ſaid to be larger than that of St. Peter's at Rome; and on the center is a cupola, from whence is an extenſive view of the city
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031692_0473_0FEE21C82DF0D958"/>
and its environs. The piles coſt 100,000l. The whole expence was computed at two millions. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles coſt only 800,000l; the Eſcurial, one million; and St. Paul's, one million five hundred thouſand pounds. It is upon record, that St. Peter's at Rome, with all that is contained in it, has coſt near thirteen millions ſterling.</p>
                     <p>The cornices of the rooms are finely carved, the floors laid with marble, and the ſides of the apartments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ined either with marble or valuable paintings. Over the doors and chimney-pieces are ſeveral hiſtorical pieces in baſſo relievo, inimitably executed in Italian marble. And there are ſome deceptions in a kind of grey painting, to imitate baſſo relievo, (eſpecially of ſome children) by De-Wit, ſo finely touched, that the moſt critical eye at half the diſtance of the room would be deceived.</p>
                     <p>A large piece, by Vanderhelſt, is deſervedly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is a feaſt given to the Spaniſh Ambaſſador by the burgo-maſters of Amſterdam, on the making peace between the two countries in 1648. But the beſt piece is by Vandyke, which repreſents an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, where you ſee the portraits of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable perſons of the city. An old grey haired man is ſo much admired in this wonderful picture, that ſeven thouſand guilders were offered to cut out the head.</p>
                     <p>

The Stadt-houſe is admirably contrived for public utility. Here is the bank, ſuppoſed to be the richeſt in Europe; here are the courts of juſtice, the priſons for criminals and debtors, the chambers of the Senate, the Treaſury, the magazine of arms, and in ſhort, all the public offices, with eight large ciſterns of water on the top, with pipes to every room to extinguiſh fires. The citizens hall is the grandeſt, being one hundred and twenty feet by fifty-ſeven, and ninety feet high: It is paved with marble, in which are ſtained the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial and celeſtial globes. The ſides, the roof, and the pillars, are all of marble; but there always is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting;—there is not light enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire with accuracy the wonderful magnificence of this apartment.</p>
                     <p>From the Stadt-houſe you croſs the Dam to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, which is not to be compared with that of Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam in beauty, nor to our Royal Exchange in ſize. The building is of brick, and at full change, if appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances may be relied on, was crowded with the moſt blackguard fellows on the face of the earth. In the afternoon I paid a ſecond viſit to the Exchange, to ſee the city militia perform their exerciſe; to which every man is ſubject, unleſs he makes a pecuniary compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thoſe, therefore, who from their poverty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or from their avarice, will not pay the fine, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſerve. Here penury and parſimony were
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031692_0475_0FEE21CB44283968"/>
collected together in ſuch various habits (for they have no regular uniform) as to make the moſt ludicrous group imagination can ſuggeſt. A giant and a dwarf, a Falſtaff and a ſlender, a bob wig and ſhock head of hair, in coats of all the colours of the rainbow, joined moſt heterogeneouſly together to form a rank, in which every man followed his own invention, in as many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent attitudes and manoeuvres, as there were men to make them.</p>
                     <p>In the evening we went to the theatre, which, like all playhouſes, our own excepted, is dark, long, and ſmall. The pit is excellent, having ſeats with low backs, and marked with numbers, to diſtinguiſh the ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of each perſon, by which, both crowding and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes are prevented. This is the only houſe I ever ſaw abroad, in which there are ſeats in the pit, or <hi>parterre,</hi> as it is called. It is under the contro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l and direction of the city. The magiſtrates receive the money, defray the charges, and pay the actors. The reſidue is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the maintenance of the poor, and to the ſupport of the different hoſpitals.</p>
                     <p>Every rope dancer, puppet-player, as well as all oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who pretend to entertain the public, are obliged to contribute one third of their profits towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the poor.</p>
                     <p>On Friday we looked into the Raſp houſe, which is a priſon for criminals, as well as for children who
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:031692_0476_0FEE21D08C0024C0"/>
are profligate or diſobedient. The former are confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſmall room, chained to a block, and ſpend their whole time in fawing or <hi>raſping</hi> Brazil wood, or in other work equally laborious. I was ſhocked at the ſight of ſo many of my ſpecies, naked to the waiſt, worn out with labour, pale with confinement, and emaciated by want. Yet how much wiſer this method than the Engliſh law, which, for thirteen pence deprives a man of his life, and the king of a ſubject, whom the Dutch ſhow us may be made uſeful to the public.</p>
                     <p>From thence we went to the Spin-houſe, for the correction, but not, I think, for the amendment of looſe women, as every one is permitted to ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them through the rails, which can only har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them in impudence. We walked into the New Church to ſee a burial. In this nation of induſtry, time is too precious to be complimented away on the dead, who can make them no return; therefore the ceremony of prayers is laid aſide as ſuperfluous. The coffin is inſtantly put into the grave, which is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately filled up. The relations bow, and return to their avocations. The organ in this church is inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or only to the organ at Harlem. The partition which divides the chancel from the nave, is of Corinthian braſs. The ſounding board over the pulpit is juſtly admired for the inimitable carving with which it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented. From thence we proceeded to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031692_0477_0FEE21D3EEF2D450"/>
and Dock-yard, which are ſituated at the extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the quay. The Admiralty forms three ſides of a ſquare, in the middle of which is the yard for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the men of war; the fourth ſide is open to the water. Here is not an appearance to be feared by the Engliſh, though much to be admired for the excellent order in which the arms and ſtores are diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>Among the number of hoſpitals in this city, the Gaſt-houſe for the ſick is the moſt worthy a ſtranger's viſiting. It is an elegant ſtone quadrangle, at the end of which are ſome neat little ſhops for toys, lace, &amp;c. The revenue of this hoſpital is computed at eight thouſand pounds ſterling a year, which is a large ſum; but the General hoſpital for men at Madrid, contains one thouſand five hundred iron beds, and its revenue amounts to forty thouſand doubloons; about thirty thouſand pounds ſterling.</p>
                     <p>There is an hoſpital where all poor travellers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction are lodged and entertained for three nights and no longer.</p>
                     <p>It is computed that twenty thouſand ſouls are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the different hoſpitals, which are either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed or ſupported out of the public revenue, aſſiſted by the contributions of the charitable: for which purpoſe, men belonging to the hoſpitals go twice a week to every houſe begging for alms.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday morning we went to the Portugueſe
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031692_0478_0FEE21D754D8EDE8"/>

                     <p>There are ſome regulations in the police of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, which would be well worthy of imitation in London. You never meet a watchman alone; two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways walk together, by which means they add ſtrength as well as give courage to each other. Many a houſe is broke open in London, and many a ſober citizen is knocked down in the preſence of a watchman, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from fear or knavery ſuffers the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>There is another admirable cuſtom to prevent the ſpreading of fire, by giving almoſt an immediate alarm. On the tops of four churches, ſituated at four dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent quarters of the city, watchmen are fixed during the night, who are obliged to ſound a trumpet every half hour, as a ſignal of their being awake and on their duty. On the breaking out of a fire they ring the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm bell, which calls their brethren to the ſpot in a moment. Of what ſervice would a plan ſomething ſimilar to this be in our metropolis!</p>

There are few general conveniences which carry not a miſchief along with them. Canals, for inſtance, are great ornaments to the ſtreets, and of infinite uſe to the inhabitants; but the miſchief is, that many an honeſt man looſes his life in Amſterdam, who in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don would only loſe his money; for the villains firſt rob him, and then puſh him into the canal, to prevent his telling tales; thus charitably eaſing him of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, leſt the weight of it ſhould ſink him.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not omit mentioning the neatneſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but in this they have no merit: for the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their houſes and cleanlineſs of their towns pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from neceſſity. Such is the moiſture of the air, that were it not for theſe cuſtoms, peſtilential diſeaſes would be the conſequence, which, careful as they are, now often happen. This perpetual dampneſs in the atmoſphere ruſts metals and moulds wood, which obliges the inhabitants, not from a principle of neatneſs, but of oeconomy, by ſcouring the one and painting the other, to ſeek a prevention or a cure. Hence ariſes the neatneſs, which by people who judge only by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances is called <hi>natural;</hi> but indeed moſt national cuſtoms are the effects of unobſerved cauſes and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. In this country the mind is perpetually ſtruck with wonder and admiration. If mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are to be credited, on the meaſure of the two ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they found the ſea even in a calm, above half
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031692_0480_0FEE21DFF51E2118"/>
a foot higher than the land. The waves are checked by an infinity of ſand-hills, which lie along the coaſt. Add to this natural defence, a dyke of twenty feet high, twenty-five feet broad at the bottom, and about ten at top, running parallel to the high-water mark. This is made of clay, ſtrengthened towards the land with planks and ſtone, towards the water with ruſhes, ſea-weeds, and flags ſtaked down, which give way to the force of the waves, and reſume their place again, when they retire. Goldſmith has drawn a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant picture of this country in his admirable poem of the Traveller.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>" While the pent ocean riſing o'er the pile,</l>

Without foreſts, or an oak-tree (two little woods excepted) the Dutch navy is the ſecond in the world. Without arable land, they ſupply half Europe with corn; and with a tract of country, ſcarce larger than an Engliſh county, they can raiſe men and money to make themſelves of importance in the eyes of the firſt power in Chriſtendom.</p>

Facts ſo extraordinary require explanation. Let it then be remembered, that this ſtate was founded on Liberty and Religion; was reared by Induſtry and OEconomy, and has flouriſhed by its ſituation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. The bigotted maxims of Philip II, the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the inquiſition, and the erecting of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen new biſhopricks in the Low Countries, the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting rigour of the Cardinal Granville, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cruelty of the Duke of Alvah, together with the Council of Twelve, called the council of Blood, and the execution of Count Egmont and Horn, were the cauſes which drove the people to ſhake off the yoke, and gave riſe to the union of Utrecht. Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering valour, joined to the political aſſiſtance of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers, has been the means of their preſerving their independence, while the decline of the Venetian navy has made them the common carriers of Europe, and the wars in Flanders and ſituation of Holland have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to render Amſterdam the ſeat of univerſal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
                     <p>Till the beginning of the ſixteenth century, Venice by its ſhipping, and Florence by its manufactories, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the whole trade of Europe, Perſia, and the Indies; but the diſcovery of a paſſage to the Eaſt, by the Cape of Good-Hope, and the ſettlements of the Portugueſe in India, proved fatal to the republic of Venice. Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon then became the ſtaple of the trade to the Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031692_0482_0FEE21E4E1EF7830"/>
and the Eaſterlings who inhabited the Hans Towns were the great merchants of the North.—They brought commerce firſt to Bruges, and from thence to Antwerp, which the revolt of the Netherlands drew afterwards to Holland. The Dutch likewiſe, by their ſucceſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Portugueſe in India, and by their treaties with the natives, in proceſs of time drew the whole trade of India from Liſbon.</p>
                     <p>Their country is moſt admirably ſituated for the trade of the Baltic, which includes Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Ruſſia, Poland, and the North coaſt of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, while they ſend merchandize into the interior parts of the Empire and the Auſtrian Netherlands, by the Rhine, Maeſe, and Scheld. It muſt likewiſe be conſidered, that each town values itſelf upon ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular branch of trade, by which it is improved to the utmoſt: as for inſtance, Delft, for the Dutch porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, Sardam for ſhip building; Rotterdam for the Scotch and Engliſh trade; Amſterdam for that of the Streights, Spain, and the Eaſt-Indies; and the whole province for the Herring Fiſhery, which ſupplies the ſouthern parts of Europe. Thus the greatneſs of this country has ariſen from a wonderful concurrence of circumſtances; from a long courſe of time; from the confluence of ſtrangers, driven either by perſecution, or invited by the credit of their government; from the cheapneſs of carriage by the convenience of the
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031692_0483_0FEE21E84BBC4D90"/>
canals; from the low intereſt of money and dearneſs of land, which conſequently turn ſpecie into trade; from particular traffic carried on at particular places; from their intenſe application to their navy; from the vaſt nurſeries for their ſailors, and from their amazing acquiſitions in the Eaſt-Indies. All theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have conſpired to make this little republic the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and admiration of the world.</p>

                     <p>THE head-dreſs of the women in North Holland is very extraordinary. They have a little hair cut ſhort and thin, which is combed down on the forehead and powdered. The cap ſticks cloſe to their ears, under which are two little pieces of ſilver or gold which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at each temple, and a large piece like a broad rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon is under the cap on the back part of the head.</p>
                     <p>A ſingular cuſtom is likewiſe retained in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of having a door in every houſe, which is never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened but when a corpſe is carried out, which muſt be

brought through that door, and no other. I think there is ſomething uncommonly ſolemn in it; and ſuch a door in every houſe would be an admirable memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to the family.</p>
                     <p>Having made the tour of the whole Province of Holland, and ſuffered nothing curious to eſcape me, my head, at preſent, is a confuſed medley of dykes and pictures, churches and canals, bridges and ſtadthouſes, but a void in reſpect to the cuſtoms, police, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people, the only uſeful knowledge to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by travelling.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen enough to confirm me in the juſtneſs of Sir William Temple's opinion, who, in ſpeaking of Holland, if my memory miſleads me not, ſays, "That it is a country where the earth is better than the air, and profit more in requeſt than honour; where there is more ſenſe than wit, more good-nature than good-humour, and more wealth than pleaſure; where a man would chuſe rather to travel than to live; ſhall find more things to obſerve than deſire; and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to eſteem than to love."</p>

                     <p>THE approach to the city of Antwerp is noble, by a ſtraight paved road bordered with oaks. It is the capital of the province whoſe name it bears, belonging to the Auſtrian Netherlands, and under the dominion of the Emperor. It is ſituated on the eaſtern ſhore of the Scheld, a noble river, twenty feet deep at low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that ſhips of great burden may unload upon the quays, or enter the town by eight canals, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the river, ſome of which are large enough to contain an hundred ſhips at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>The city is much decayed from its ancient grandeur though it ſtill remains a beautiful place. It is built in the form of a creſent, about ſeven miles in circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſurrounded with a wall and baſtions faced with ſtone. The top of the wall is an hundred feet broad, with a double row of trees, between which is a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable walk. The ſtreets are well paved, very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and uniform. The houſes in general are ſeven or eight ſtories high, but old, and in that miſerable ſtyle of building which diſgraces the towns in Holland. At the diſtance of a quarter of a mile is the citadel, built by the Duke of Alva, to keep the city in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. It ſtands on the banks of the Scheld, and
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:031692_0486_0FEE21F26D14C580"/>
commands at once the river, the city, and the adjacent country. It is built in a pentagonal form, with five baſtions, which defend each other, ſurrounded with double ditches.</p>
                     <p>To this citadel is only one entrance, which is over a draw-bridge. It is about a mile in circumference, and well ſupplied with arms, amunition, and all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtores, with barracks for three thouſand men. This fortreſs has been of ſuch repute for ſtrength and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, that it has been a model for ſubſequent engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers; notwithſtanding which the French in 1746 took it in ſeven days.</p>
                     <p>The trade of Antwerp is now confined to very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits, though ſo late as the middle of the ſixteenth century, there were two hundred thouſand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> two thouſand five hundred ſhips lying often in the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at a time; and it was far from unfrequent for five hundred veſſels to come in or go out of the harbour in a day.</p>
                     <p>The trade of Antwerp in the year 1550, if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of their city can be relied on, amounted to one hundred and thirty-three millions of gold, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the bank.</p>
                     <p>As an inſtance of the amazing opulence of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, there is a ſtory upon record, of John Daens, a merchant, who lent a million of gold to Charles V. to carry on his wars in Hungary. The Emperor on his
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031692_0487_0FEE21F5CE9BF998"/>
return dined with the merchant, who gave him a moſt ſumptuous entertainment, and at the cloſe of it burnt the contract by which the emperor was bound to pay him a million of gold, in a fire of cinnamon, which was the only fire during the repaſt.</p>
                     <p>The riſe of their trade was as rapid as the decline, and both proceeded from the ſame cauſes. At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſixteenth century Bruges was the mart of Europe; but the war at that time breaking out in Flanders, the merchants with-drew from Bruges, and were invited to Antwerp, as a place of greater ſafety, whoſe ſituation was happily calculated for commerce. But this did not laſt long, for the civil wars breaking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> in the Low Countries, and Antwerp having twice been ſacked, drove trade to ſeek a more peaceful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in Amſterdam.</p>
                     <p>The eſtabliſhed religion is the Catholic; the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage Low Dutch! but a baſtard kind of French is ſpoken by moſt of the inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>We have been ſo fortunate as to ſee a grand proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in honour of St. Rocque. The whole Mer, the moſt magnificent ſtreet in Antwerp, was illuminated with torches, and many hundred people in proceſſion with flambeaux, followed by the Virgin Mary, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious relicks, the Hoſt, and an infinity of ſuch kind of

                     <p>The whole road from Antwerp to Bruſſels is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Bruſſels is the capital of Brabant and of all the Auſtrian Netherlands. It is the reſidence of the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor-General of the Low Countries. It is twenty-four miles ſouth of Antwerp, and thirty ſouth-eaſt of Ghent, ſituated on the Senne, an inconſiderable river. The ſcite of this city reſembles Guildford, being built on the brow of a hill. Its figure is oval, about four miles in circumference, ſurrounded with a wall and tolerably fortified. The Low Town has the benefit of canals, which admit boats of coſiderable burden.</p>
                     <p>The upper town is magnificent, and has lately been much improved by new buildings, and by incloſing a piece of waiſt ground, planting it, and laying it out in walks.</p>
                     <p>The arſenal ſtands on the top of the ſtreet called <hi>Montagne à la Cour.</hi> There is ſome old armour in it of neither curioſity nor uſe; except an iron ſhield, which no ſword can pierce, and a ſteel ſhield ſo finely engraved that the figures ſeem reflected from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, not to be etched in the ſteel. The niceſt touch
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031692_0489_0FEE21FE7884FA98"/>
cannot perceive the leaſt ſcratch; notwithſtanding which the figures appear to be ſtrongly marked, when the ſhield is held obliquely.</p>
                     <p>Juſt below the arſenal is the Palace of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Auſtrian Netherlands. The preſent palace is not more than half finiſhed. There was upon this ſpot an old one, which was bought of the Prince of Orange, at the time the grand palace was burnt, in which was a moſt capital collection of pictures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Rubens's, which with many valuable curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities periſhed in the flames.</p>
                     <p>The ſtaircaſe of the preſent palace is very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. The ſteps are of marble, and the baluſtrade of iron, gilt, and adorned with compartments of birds and beaſts, nicely executed in poliſhed ſteel by Trieſte. The ceiling is painted of Freſco.</p>
                     <p>The apartment of the Princeſs is hung with the Bruſſels tapeſtry, which is brought to great perfection. The floors are all inlaid with mahogany and box. The Princeſs's cabinet is much admired, being covered throughout with the fineſt Japan. The late Prince was a great mechanic, and had a cabinet of curioſities tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling enough, among which were two boxes, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the common trades in miniature.</p>

                     <head>SECT. LXXXII. OF BARCELONA IN SPAIN.</head>
                     <p>THIS city is a ſweet ſpot. The air equals in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and much excels in mildneſs, the boaſted climate of Montpelier. Except in the dog-days, you may have green peaſe all the year round. The ſituation is beautiful, appearance both from land and ſea remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably pictureſque. A Great extent of fruitful plains, bounded by an amphitheatre of hills, backs it on the weſt ſide; the mountain of Montjuich defends it on the ſouth from the unwholeſome winds that blow over the maſhes at the mouth of the Llobregat; to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the coaſt projecting into the ſea forms a noble bay; it has the Mediterranean to cloſe the proſpect to the eaſt. The environs are in a ſtate of high culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſtudded with villages, country houſes, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</p>
                     <p>The form of Barcelona is almoſt circular, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man town being on the higheſt ground in the center of the new one. The ancient walls are ſtill viſible in ſeveral places; but the ſea has retired many hundreds of yards from the portgates. One of the principal Gothic churches, and a whole quarter of the city, ſtand upon the ſands that were once the bottom of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The immenſe loads of ſand hurried down into
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031692_0491_0FEE22018C3941D8"/>
the ſea by the rivers, and thrown back by wind and current into this haven, will in all probability, choak it quite up, unleſs greater diligence be uſed in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gathering of the ſhoals. A ſoutherly wind brings in the ſand, and already a deep-loaded veſſel finds its dangerous to paſs over the bar. Some years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a company of Dutch and Engliſh adventurers offered to bring the river into the port by means of a canal, if government would allow them a free importation for ten years. This project might have cleared away the ſand-banks, but might alſo have given a fatal check to the infant manufactures of the country; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the propoſal was rejected. The port is handſome; the mole is all of hewn ſtone, a maſter-piece of ſolidity and convenience. Above is a platform for carriages; below, vaſt magazines, with a broad key reaching from the city gates to the light houſe. This was done by the orders of the late Marquis de La Mina, captain-general of the principality, where his memory is held in greater veneration than at the court of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid. He governed Catalonia many years, more like an independant ſovereign, than like a ſubject inveſted with a delegated authority. Great are the obligations Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona has to him. He cleanſed and beautified its ſtreets, built uſeful edifices, and forwarded its trade and manufactures, without much extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to the province; for he had more reſources, and
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:031692_0492_0FEE2208A0031950"/>
made money go father than moſt other governors can do, or indeed wiſh to do.</p>
                     <p>The citadel has ſix ſtrong baſtions, calculated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verawe the inhabitants, at leaſt as much as to defend them from a foreign enemy. The lowneſs of its ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation renders it damp, unwholeſome, and ſwarming with muſquitos. The major of this fortreſs owes his promotion to a ſingular circumſtance. When the preſent king arrived at Madrid in 1759, a magnificent bull-feaſt was given in honour of that event. As it is neceſſary, upon ſuch occaſions, that thoſe who fight on horſeback ſhould be gentlemen born, the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the exhibition were greatly at a loſs; till this man, who was a poor, ſtarving officer, preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though utterly ignorant both of bull-fighting and horſemanſhip. By dint of reſolution, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour of fortune, he kept his ſeat, and performed his part ſo much to the public ſatisfaction that he was rewarded with a penſion and a majority.</p>
                     <p>The ſtreets of Barcelona are narrow but well paved. A covered drain in the middle of each ſtreet carries off the filth and rain water. At night they are tolerably well lighted up, but long before day-break every lamp is out. The houſes are lofty and plain. To each kind of trade a particular diſtrict is allotted.</p>
                     <p>Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt throughout extremely mountainous. The nature
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031692_0493_0FEE220A28216830"/>
of the country appears to have great influence on that of the inhabitants, who are a hardy, active, and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious race, of a middle ſize, brown complexion, and ſtrong features; their limbs well knit together, and by education and practice well inured to the greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues. There are few lame or diſtorted perſons, or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, to be met with among them. Their <hi>mocos</hi> or mule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys are ſtout walkers. Some of them have been known to go from Barcelona to Madrid and back again, in nine days, which by the high road is ſix hundred miles.</p>
                     <p>The loſs of all the immunities, the ignominious prohibition of every weapon, even a knife, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous load of taxes, have not been able to ſtifle their independent ſpirit, which brakes out upon the leaſt ſtretch of arbitrary power. Within theſe few years, many of their ancient privileges have been gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; and this is at preſent one of the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provinces of Spain. Their taxation is ſtill very high. All trade is aſſeſſed according to the buſineſs you are ſuppoſed to tranſact in the courſe of the year; without regard to your loſs or gain.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt other reſtrictions, the uſe of ſlouched hats, white ſhoes, and large brown cloaks is forbidden. Till of late, they durſt not carry any kind of knife; but in each public houſe there was one chained to the table for the uſe of all comers. The good order maintained
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031692_0494_0FEE220D8ABCC780"/>
by the police, and the vigilance of the thief-takers, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of defenſive weapons, robberies and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being ſeldom heard of. You may walk the ſtreets of Barcelona at all hours unarmed, without the leaſt apprehenſion, provided you have light; without it you are liable to be carried to priſon by the patrol.</p>
                     <p>The Catalonians cannot brook the thought of being menial ſervants in their own country, but will rather trudge it all over with a pedlar's pack on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or run about upon errands, than be the head do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic in a Catalonian family. Far from home they make excellent ſervants, and moſt of the principal houſes of Madrid have Catalonians at the head of their affairs.</p>
                     <p>They are the general muleteers and caleſſieros of Spain. You meet with them in every part of the kingdom. Their honeſty, ſteadineſs and ſobriety, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to the confidence of travellers, and their thirſt after lucre makes them bear with any hardſhips. With good words you will always find them docile, but they cannot bear hard uſuage or approbrious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that remain at home for the labours of the field, are exceedingly induſtrious. Their corn-harveſt is in May or early in June; but, as theſe crops are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to frequent burſtings and mildews, they have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their attention more to the vine, which they plant
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031692_0495_0FEE2210EFA353E8"/>
even to the ſummits of their moſt rugged mountains. In many places they carry up earth to fix the young ſet in; and in others have been known to let one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother down from the brow of the rock by ropes, rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ſuffer a good patch of ſoil to remain uſeleſs. Their vintages are commonly very plentiful. This au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, there was ſuch a ſuper abundance of grapes in the valley of Talarn, in the neighbourhood of Pallas, that whole vineyards were left untouched for want of veſſels to make or hold the wine in. Notice was paſted upon the church-doors, that any one was at liberty to take away any quantity he pleaſed, on paying a ſmall acknowledgement to the proprietors. The beſt red wine of Catalonia is made at Mataro, north of Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona, and the beſt white at Sitges, between that city and Tarragona.</p>
                     <p>The ſcarcity of corn is ſometimes very great, the principality not producing above five months proviſion. Without the importation from America, Sicily, and the north of Europe, it would run the riſk of being famiſhed. From four hundred thouſand to ſix hundred thouſand quarters of wheat are annually imported. Canada a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſent this year about eighty thouſand quarters. There are public ovens, where the bakers are bound by contract to bake every day into bread one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand buſhels of flour, or more, at a ſtated price, and in caſe the other bakers ſhould refuſe to work, they are
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031692_0496_0FEE22162B7C1098"/>
under the obligation of furniſhing the city with bread.</p>
                     <p>The number of the inhabitants of Barcelona, is made to amount to one hundred and fifty thouſand ſouls, and thoſe of Barceloneta to ten thouſand. But although trade and population have increaſed ſurpriſingly in the courſe of a few years, I doubt there is ſome exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this reckoning.</p>
                     <p>The great export commerce conſiſts in wine, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Salt, and oil, which are moſtly taken in by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign ſhips at the little ports and roads along the coaſt, and not brought to be ſhipped off at the capital.</p>
                     <p>There are mines of lead, iron, and coal, in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, but they are ill wrought, and turn to poor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The manufactures are of more importance. Barcelona ſupplies Spain with moſt of the cloathing and arms for the troops. This branch of buſineſs is carried on with much intelligence. They can equip a battalion of ſix hundred men completely in a week.</p>
                     <p>A great trade is driven in ſilk handkerchiefs and ſtockings; in woollens of various qualities: in ſilk and thread lace; in fire arms. The gun-barrels of Barcelona are much eſteemed, and coſt from four to twenty guineas; but about five is the real value; all above is paid for fancy and ornament. They are made out of the old ſhoes of mules. Several manufactures of printed linens are eſtabliſhed here, but have not yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031692_0497_0FEE2217B241E010"/>
at any great elegance of deſign or livelineſs of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>The imports are, beſides corn, about eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hundred weight of Newfoundland cod, which pays three perſettas per hundred-weight duty, and ſells upon an average at a guinea; beans from Holland for the poor people, and an inferior ſort from Africa for the mules; Engliſh bale goods, and many foreign arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of neceſſity or luxury. Houſe-rent and living are dear; proviſions but indifferent. The fiſh is flabby and inſipid; the meat poor, but the vegetables are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, eſpecially brocoli and cauliflower. I believe their meet and fiſh are much better in ſummer than at this ſeaſon of the year.</p>
                     <p>The devotion of the Catalonians ſeems to be pretty much upon a par with that of their neighbours in the ſouthern provinces of France, and, I am told, much leſs ardent than we ſhall find it as we advance into Spain; but they ſtill abound with ſtrange practices of religion and local worſhip. One very odd idea of theirs is, that on the firſt of November, the eve of All-Souls, they run about from houſe to houſe to eat cheſnuts, believing that for every cheſnut they ſwallow, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per faith and unction, they ſhall deliver a Soul out of purgatory.</p>
                     <p>The influx of foreigners, increaſe of commerce, and protection granted to the liberal arts begin to open the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031692_0498_0FEE22193A7FEBF0"/>
underſtanding of this people, who have made great ſtrides of late towards ſenſe and philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>There are now but one or two churches at moſt in each city, that are allowed the privilege of protecting offenders; and murderers are excluded from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the ſanctuary. The proceedings of the inquiſition are grown very mild. If any perſon leads a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous life, or allows his tongue unwarrantable liberties, he is ſummoned by the holy office and privately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed; in caſe of non-amendment, he is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to priſon. Once a year you muſt anſwer to that tribunal for the orthodoxy of your family, even of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſervant, or they muſt quit the country. But the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Proteſtant houſes are paſſed over unnoticed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void talking on religion, and with a little diſcretion you may live here in what manner you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Every Jew that lands in Spain muſt declare himſelf to be ſuch at the Inquiſition; which immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a familiar to attend him all the time he ſtays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, to whom he pays a piſtole a day: Were he to neglect giving this information, he would be liable to be ſeized. Yet I have been aſſured by perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted credit, that a Jew may travel incognito from Perpignan to Liſbon, and ſleep every night at the houſe of a Jew, being recommended from one to another; and that you may take it for granted, that wherever you ſee a houſe remarkably decked out with images,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:031692_0499_0FEE22204F31F420"/>
relics, and lamps, and the owner noted for being the moſt enthuſiaſtic devotee of the pariſh, there it is ten to one but the family are Iſraelites at heart.</p>

                     <p>ON the 10th of July, 1787, we left Bagnere de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon, and croſſed the mountains to Vielle, the firſt town on the Spaniſh ſide. The Pyrenees are ſo great an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of examination, in whatever light they are conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, but eſpecially in that of agriculture, that it would be adding a great deal too much to the length of this paper to ſpeak of them here; I ſhall on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be particular in deſcribing the huſbandry practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, and at preſent ſtop no longer than to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the paſturage of Catalonian ſheep in them. By a little detour out of our direct road, and by paſſing Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, which is the name of a ſolitary wretched inn, we gained the hights, but free from ſnow, which the Spaniards hire of the French for the paſturage of their flocks. I muſt obſerve, that a conſiderable part of the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031692_0500_0FEE2221D544DEB8"/>
mountains belong in property to the communities of the reſpective pariſhes, and are diſpoſed of by what we ſhould call the Veſtry. They hire a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble range of many miles. The French mountains, on which they paſture, are four hours diſtant from Bagnere de Luchon, and belong to that town. Thoſe hours are more than twenty Engliſh miles, and are the moſt diſtant part of the pariſh. To arrive at them we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the river Pique, which upon the maps is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the Neſte. The whole way it runs in a torrent, and falls in caſcades of many ſtories, formed either by large pieces of rock, or by trees carried down and ſtopped by ſtones. The current, in proceſs of ages, has worn itſelf deep glens to paſs through, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of which the tumbling of the water is heard, but can be ſeen only at breaks in the wood, which hang over and darken the ſcene. The road, as it is called, paſſes generally by the river, but hangs, if I may uſe the expreſſion, like a ſhelf on the mountain ſide, and is truly dreadful to the inhabitants of plains, from being broken by gullies, and ſloping on the edges of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices. It is, however, paſſable by mules, and by the horſes of the mountains. The vale grows ſo narrow at laſt, that it is not above an hundred yards wide in ſome places. The general ſcene at laſt has little wood.</p>
                     <p>The mountains on the ſouth ſide finiſh in a pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midical
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031692_0501_0FEE22235BD0C9E0"/>
rock of micaceous ſchiſtus, which is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tumbling into the plain, from the attacks of the froſt, and the melting of the ſnows, the ſlope to the river being ſpread with fragments. We met here with pieces of lead ore and manganeſe.</p>
                     <p>On the nothern ridge, bearing to the Weſt, are the paſtures of the Spaniſh flocks. This ridge is not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the whole. There are two other mountains, quite in a different ſituation, and the ſheep travel from one to another, as the paſturage is ſhort or plentiful. I examined the ſoil of theſe mountain paſtures, and found it in general ſtony; what in the Weſt of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland would be called a <hi>ſtone braſh,</hi> with ſome mixture of loam, and in a few places a little peaty. The plants are many of them untouched by the ſheep. Many ferns, narciſſus, violets, and the narrow-leaved plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, were eaten, as may be ſuppoſed, cloſe. I looked for trefoils, but found ſcarcely any. It was very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that ſoil and peculiarity of herbage had little to do in rendering theſe heights proper for ſheep. In the nothern parts of Europe, the tops of mountains half the height of theſe, (for we were above ſnow in July) are bogs. All are ſo which I have ſeen in our iſlands: or at leaſt, the proportion of dry land is very trifl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſheep. The flock is brought every night to one ſpot, which is ſituated at the end of the valley on the river I have mentioned, and near the port or paſſage of Pica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. It is a level ſpot ſheltered from all winds. The ſoil is eight or nine inches deep of old dung, not at all incloſed; and from the freedom from wood all around it, ſeems to be choſen partly for ſafety againſt wolves and bears. Near it is a very large ſtone, or rather rock, fallen from the mountain. This the ſhephards have taken for a ſhelter, and have built a hut againſt it. Their beds are ſheep-ſkins, and their doors ſo ſmall that they crawl in. I ſaw no place for fire, but they have it, ſince they dreſs here the fleſh of their ſheep, and in the night ſometimes keep off the bears, by whirling fire-brands. Four of them, belonging to the flock mentioned above, lie here. We viewed their flock very carefully, and by means of our guide and interpreter, made ſome inquiries of the ſhepherds, which they anſwered readily, and very civily. A Spaniard at Venaſque, a city in the Pyrenees, gives ſix hundred livres French (the livre is ten pence halfpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Engliſh) a year, for the paſturage of this flock of two thouſand ſheep. In the winter he ſends them into the lower parts of Catalonia, a journey of twelve or thirteen days, and when the ſnow is melted enough in the ſpring, they are conducted back again. They are the whole year kept in motion, and moving from ſpot
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031692_0503_0FEE222C088D83A0"/>
to ſpot, which is owing to the great range they every where have of paſture. They are always in the open air, never houſed or under cover, and never taſte of any food, but what they can find on the hills.</p>
                     <p>Four ſhepherds, and from four to ſix large Spaniſh dogs have the care of this flock. The latter are in France called of the Pyrenees breed. They are black and white, of the ſize of a large wolf, a large head and neck, armed with collars ſtuck with iron ſpikes. No wolf can ſtand againſt them; but bears are more potent adverſaries. If a bear can reach a tree he is ſafe. He riſes on his hind legs, with his back to the tree, and ſets the dogs at defiance. In the night the ſhepherds rely entirely on their dogs, but on hearing them bark are ready with fire-arms, as the dogs rarely bark if a bear is not at hand. I was ſurpriſed to find that they are fed only with bread and milk. The head ſhepherd is paid one hundred and twenty livers a year wages and bread; the others eighty livers and bread. But they are allowed to keep goats, of which they have many, which they milk every day. Their food is milk and bread, except the fleſh of ſuch ſheep or lambs as accidents give them. The head ſhepherd keeps on the mountain top, on an elevated ſpot, from whence he can the better ſee around, while the flock tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes the declivities. In doing this the ſheep are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to great danger in places that are ſtony; for ſome
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:031692_0504_0FEE222D8FBB9680"/>
of them, eſpecially the goats, by walking among the rocks, move the ſtones, which rolling down the hills, acquire an accelerated force enough to nock a man down; and ſheep are often killed by them. Yet we ſaw how alert they were to avoid ſuch ſtones, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly on their guard againſt them. We examined the ſheep attentively. They are in general polled, but ſome have horns; which in the rams turns backward behind the ears, and project half a circle farwards; the ewes horns turn alſo behind the ears, but do not project: the legs white or reddiſh; ſpeckled faces, ſome white, ſome reddiſh: they would weigh, fat, I rekon, on an average, from fifteen to eighteen pounds a quarter. There are a few black ſheep among them; and ſome with a very little tuft of wool on their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads. On the whole they reſemble thoſe on the South Downs. Their legs are as ſhort as thoſe of that breed; a point which merits obſervation, as they travel ſo much and ſo well.</p>
                     <p>Having ſatisfied ourſelves with our examination of this flock, we returned to the direct road for Vielle, which alſo leads to one of the moſt woody regions of the Pyrenees, and at the ſame time the moſt romantic. The road is ſo bad that no horſe but thoſe of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains could paſs it; but our mules trod ſecurely amidſt rolling ſtones on the edges of precipices of a tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous depth; but ſure-footed as they are, they are not
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031692_0505_0FEE2230F7BD4598"/>
free from ſtumbling; and when they happen to trip a little in thoſe ſituations, they electrify their riders in a manner not altogether ſo pleaſant as Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. Theſe mountains are chiefly rocks of micace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchiſtus, but there are large detached fragments of granite.</p>
                     <p>We paſs the frontier line which divides France and Spain; and riſing on the mountains, we ſee the Spaniſh valley of Aran, with the river Garonne winding through it in a beautiful manner. The town of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſte is at the foot of the mountains, where is the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh cuſtom-houſe. Mules imported into Spain pay here ſixteen livers. A four year old horſe the ſame. A ſix year old one thirteen ditto. An ox five; and a ſheep one and a half ſol. This vale of Aran is richly cultivated, and without any fallows. Nothing ſcarcely can be finer than the view of the valley from heights ſo great as to render the moſt common objects intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The road leads under trees, whoſe arching boughs preſent at every ten paces new landſcapes. The woods here are thick, and preſent fine maſſes of ſhade; the rocks large, and every outline bold: and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant vale that is ſpread far below at your feet, has all the features of beauty, in contraſt with the ſublimity of the ſurrounding mountains.</p>
                     <p>We deſcend into this vale, and bait at our firſt Spaniſh inn. No hay, no corn, no meat, no windows;
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:031692_0506_0FEE2238081F21D0"/>
but cheap eggs and bread, and ſome trout for fifteen ſous. (Seven pence halfpenny Engliſh.)</p>
                     <p>We followed from hence the Garonne, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a fine river, but very rapid. On it they float many trees to their ſaw-mills, to cut into boards. We ſaw many at work. The vale is narrow, but the Hills to the left are cultivated high up. There are no fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. They have little wheat, but a great deal of rye; and much better barley than in the French mountains. Inſtead of fallows they have maize and millet, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more potatoes than in the French mountains. They have alſo French beans, and a little hemp. We ſaw two fields of vetches and ſquare peaſe. The ſmall potatoes they give to their pigs, which do very well with them; and the leaves to their cows, but aſſert that they refuſe the roots. Buck-wheat alſo takes the place of fallow. Many crops of it were good, and ſome as fine as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>The whole valley of Aran is well cultivated and highly peopled. It is eight hours long, or about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles Engliſh, and has in it thirty-two villages. Theſe villages, or rather little towns, have a very pretty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the walls being well built, and the houſes are well ſlated. But on entering theſe towns the ſpectacle changes at once. We found them the abodes of pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and wretchedneſs; not one window of glaſs to be ſeen in a whole town; ſcarcely any chimnies, both
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031692_0507_0FEE22398F8F98C8"/>
ground floor and the chimnies vomiting the ſmoke out of the windows.</p>
                     <p>We arrive at Vielle, the capitol of this valley, and the paſſage from this part of France to Barcelona; a circumſtance which has given ſome trifling reſources to it. We were informed here, that we could not go into Spain without a paſſport; we therefore waited on the governor, who preſides over the whole valley and its thirty-two towns. His houſe was the only one we had ſeen with glaſs windows. He is a lieutenant colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and knight of Calatrava. In his ante-room was the king's picture, with a canopy of ſtate over it. The governor received us with the Spaniſh formality, and aſſured us that a few months ago, there was an order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o ſend every foreigner, found without a paſſport, to the troops. Such orders ſhow pretty well the number of foreigners here. On each ſide of his bed was a brace of piſtols, and a crucifix in the middle. We did not aſk in which he put the moſt confidence.</p>
                     <p>We made enquiries concerning the agriculture. They have no farmers. Every one cultivates his own land, which is never fallowed. They have no ſpecies of manufactures, but ſpinning and weaving for the private uſe of every family.</p>
                     <p>The mountains belong, as in the French Pyrenees, to the pariſhes. Each inhabitant has a right to cut what wood he pleaſes for fuel and repairs, in the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:031692_0508_0FEE223B162C9320"/>
woods aſſigned for that purpoſe. Others are let by leaſe at public auction for the benefit of the pariſh, the trees to be cut being marked; and in general, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their woods is better than on the French ſide. When woods are cut they are preſerved. Their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſtures not uſed by themſelves, they let to the owners of large flocks, who bring them from the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of Catalonia. Theſe flocks riſe to four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſheep, the rent, in general, being from five to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſous a head for the ſummer food. Every inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant poſſeſſes cattle, which he keeps in the common mountains in what quantity he pleaſes; but others, who do not belong to the pariſh, pay five to ſeven ſous a head for the ſheep, and ten ſous for a cow; which diſproportion they explain, by ſaying, that ſheep muſt have a much greater range. In ſummer they make cheeſe, which we taſted and found good. In winter their cattle are kept at home, and their cows fed on buck-wheat ſtraw, which they aſſert to be good food; alſo that of maize and millet, and a little hay; moſt of it being aſſigned to their mules. They have good ſheep, but all are ſent to Saragoſa or Barcelona. They have ſcarce any oxen; what few they kill, they ſalt for winter.</p>
                     <p>Taxes are light; the whole which the town is aſſeſſed at being only two thouſand ſeven-hundred livers, which they pay by the rent of their woods and paſtures
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:031692_0509_0FEE224236B68010"/>
let. When the principles of a government tend to deſpotiſm and the very pictures of kings are treated with reverence, the conſequence is light taxation. The only effectual means of inſuring a great revenue, is to extend the principles and the exerciſe of liberty. The change is, and ever will be, as much for the benefit of the prince as of the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>At Bagnere de Luchon we were told that the inn at Vielle was good. We found the lower floor a ſtable, from which we mounted to a black kitchen, and through that to a baking-room with a large batch of loaves making for an oven which was heating to receive them. In this room were two beds for all the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that might come. If too numerous, ſtraw is ſpread on the floor, and you may reſt as you can. There was no glaſs in the windows. One of the beds was occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that my companion ſlept on a table. The houſe, however, afforded eggs for an omelet, good bread, thick wine, brandy, and fowls, killed after we arrived. The people were very dirty, but civil.</p>
                     <p>On the eleventh of July we reached Scullo. The inn was ſo bad, that our guide would not permit us to enter it, but conducted us to the houſe of the Cúre. A ſcene followed ſo new to Engliſh eyes, that we could not refrain from laughing very heartily. Not a pane of glaſs in the whole town, but our reverend hoſt had a chimney in his kitchen. He ran to the river to catch
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031692_0510_0FEE2243C27A6A28"/>
trout. A man brought us ſome chickings, which were put to death on the ſpot. For light they kindled ſplinters of pitch-pine, and two merry wenches, with three or four men collected to ſtare at us, as well as we at them, were preſently buſy in ſatisfying our hunger. They gave us red wine ſo dreadfully putrid from the borachio, that I could not touch it; and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but poiſoned with aniſeed. Then a bottle of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent rich white wine was produced, reſembling good mountain, and all was well. But when we came to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our beds there was only one. My friend would again do the honours, and inſiſted on my taking it. He made his on a table; and what with bugs, fleas, rats, and mice, ſlept not. I was not attacked; and though the bed and a pavement might be ranked in the ſame claſs of ſoftneſs, fatigue converted it to down. This town and its inhabitants are, to the eye, equally wretched. The ſmoke-holes inſtead of chimneys; the total want of glaſs windows, the chearfulneſs of which, to the eye, is known only by the want; the dreſs of the women, all in black, with cloth of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour about their heads, and hanging half down their backs; no ſhoes; no ſtockings; the effect upon the whole diſmal; ſavage as the rocks and mountains.</p>

                     <head>SECT. LXXXIV. OF MADRID. A. D. 1778.</head>
                     <p>IN the afternoons, we ſpent our time in viſiting the moſt remarkable edifices of this city. If you except the royal palaces, there are few buildings worthy of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor do I believe there is in Europe a capital that has ſo little to ſhow as Madrid. Having never been the ſee of a biſhop, it has of courſe no cathedral, nor indeed any church, that diſtinguiſhes itſelf much from the common herd of pariſhes and convents. Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome few exceptions, I think I may ſafely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the outward artchitecture of them all to be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and their manner of ornamenting the inſide as bad as that of the worſt ages. Moſt of them were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected or retouched during the term of years that elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the middle of the ſeventeeth century and the year 1759, a period in the hiſtory of Spain when all arts and ſciences were fallen to the loweſt ebb; the effects of the degeneracy of manners, the want of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit, and the diſorder and weakneſs of a decaying monarchy. Theſe vices in the political ſyſtem under the three laſt princes of the Auſtrian line, could not be removed immediately on the acceſſion of another family. The wars that ſhook the very foundations
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031692_0512_0FEE224C62EEF288"/>
of their throne for the firſt ten years of this century, kept all polite arts groveling in the duſt; and when they ventured to raiſe their heads again, and court the favour of the ſovereign, there ſeems to have been a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal want of able profeſſors to ſecond their efforts, and aſſiſt them in returning to the paths of good ſenſe and true taſte.</p>
                     <p>No mad architect ever dreamed of a diſtortion of members ſo capricious, of a twiſt of pillars, cornices, or pediments, ſo wild and fantaſtic, but what a real ſample of it may be produced in ſome or other of the churches of Madrid. They are all ſmall, and poor in marbles as well as pictures. Their alters are piles of wooden ornaments, heaped up to the ceiling, and ſtuck full of wax lights, which more than once have ſet fire to the whole church.</p>
                     <p>The convents, which may be ſaid to poſſeſs a good collection of pictures, are thoſe of Saint Paſqual, and of the bare-footed Carmelite nuns. The former has a fine Titian, a capital Guerchino, and many other pieces by eſteemed Italian maſters. In the ſacriſty of the latter, is a numerous collection of paintings by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hands, many of which are of ſuperior merit. The tombs of Ferdinand the Sixth, and of his queen Babara, in the church of the Viſitation, are almoſt the only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchral monuments of any conſequence.</p>
                     <p>The royal palace is all of white ſtone. Each of the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:031692_0513_0FEE224DEA7CCCF0"/>
fronts being four hundred and ſeventy feet in length, by one hundred high, this pile towers over all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where nothing intercepts the view for many miles. The entrances and ground-floor appear more like thoſe of ſome mighty fortreſs, than of the peaceable habitation of a powerful monarch, an hundred leagues removed from his frontiers. The range of large glazed arches round the inner court, reſembles the inſide of a manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. This is the more unpardonable, as they had at no great diſtance, in the Alcazar of Toledo, as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a colonnade as the niceſt critic could deſire. The beautiful circular court of Granada might have ſuggeſted noble ideas to the architect; but perhaps at that time the very exiſtence of ſuch a thing was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret at Madrid.</p>
                     <p>The ſtair-caſe was meant to be double, but it was afterwards judged more convenient to ſhut up one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ight, as the remaining half anſwered every purpoſe. At the foot of the ſtairs I ſhall leave all my ſpleen, and prepare myſelf with unfeigned ſatisfaction to deſcribe to you the beauty and grandeur of the upper apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>I know no place in Europe fitted up with ſo much true royal magnificence. The richeſt marbles are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with great taſte in forming the cornices and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ocles of the rooms, and the frames of the doors and windows. What enhances the value of theſe marbles,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:031692_0514_0FEE224F71EAC730"/>
is the circumſtance of their being all produced in the quarries of Spain, from whence it is the opinion of a learned writer, that ancient Rome was ſupplied with many of the precious m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>terials that enriched her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoes and temples. At leaſt, there is no preſumption in aſſerting, that the bowels of the earth in Spain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moſt of thoſe ſpecies of marbles, that are to be ſeen in the ruins of the miſtreſs of the world, whatever might be the countries from which they were drawn. Porphyry is found near Cordova; the fineſt jaſper near Aracena; the mountains of Granada furniſh a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful green, thoſe of Tortoſa a variety of brown marbles. Leon and Malaga ſend alabaſter; Toledo, Talavera, Badajoz, and Murviedro, abound in marbles of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colours, and moſt parts of the kingdom afford ſome ſpecimen or other of jaſper, beſides the amethyſt and its radix, for which Spain is celebrated above moſt oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er countries.</p>
                     <p>The great audience chamber is one of the richeſt I know. The ceiling, painted by Tiepolo, repreſents the triumph of Spain. Round the cornice the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt has placed allegorical figures of its different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces diſtinguiſhed by their productions, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral of their inhabitants in the provincial ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. Theſe form a moſt uncommon picture, and a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſet of <hi>Coſtumi.</hi> The walls are incruſtated with beautiful marble, and all around hung with large plates
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:031692_0515_0FEE22567A3F02C0"/>
of looking glaſs in rich frames. The manufactory of glaſs is at Saint Ildefonſo, where they caſt them of a very great ſize; but I am told they are apt to turn out much rougher, and fuller of flaws, than thoſe made in France.</p>
                     <p>A collection of pictures, by the greateſt maſters of the art, adorns the walls of the inner apartments; but even this vaſt fabric does not afford room for all the riches his Catholic Majeſty poſſeſſes in this branch. The detail and catalogue of a number of paintings, is ſure to fatigue a reader who has never ſeen, nor can ever rationally expect to ſee them; therefore it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on me to ſelect only a few of my favourites from my memorandums.</p>
                     <p>Of the works of Titian, the moſt remarkable are, a bacchanalian woman lying on her back aſleep. The liquor has diffuſed a glow over her beautiful face, and her body is divinely handſome. One of the greateſt painters of the age has often declared, he never paſſed before this picture without being ſtruck with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſome boys playing, full of grace, and a charming variety of attitudes.</p>
                     <p>Rubens—Chriſt and St. John Baptiſt, lovely chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. A prieſt on horſeback, carrying the viaticum to a ſick perſon, accompanied by Rodolph earl of Hapſburgh, one of the maſter-pieces of his pencil.</p>
                     <p>Murillo—A vintager, wine-ſeller, holy family, two
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031692_0516_0FEE211B8278F328"/>
boys; all in their different characters, excellently painted with a rich mellow colour.</p>
                     <p>Vandyke—The ſeizing of Chriſt in the garden, a ſtrong compoſition; ſeveral portraits abſolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
                     <p>Spagnolet—Iſaac feeling Jacob's hands; very capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
                     <p>In the ſhallow vale between the Retiro and the town, which has not the leaſt ſuburb of any kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, the preſent King has finiſhed the Prado, which in a few years, provided they manage the trees properly, will be one of the fineſt walks in the world. Its length and breadth are great, the avenues drawn in an intelligent, noble ſtyle, the foot-paths wide and neat, the iron railing and ſtone ſeats done in a grand expenſive manner. All the coaches of Madrid drive in the ring here; and though the abſence of the court leſſens the appearance more than two thirds, yet laſt night I counted two hundred carriages following each other. On the declivity of the Retiro, they mean to plant a botanical garden.</p>
                     <p>The view from this walk is, as it ſhould be, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for the winds are ſo ſharp and boiſterous, and the landſcape ſo horrid all round the city, that no place of public reſort could be comfortable, unleſs it were, like this, ſhut in from all diſtant views, and
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:031692_0517_0FEE225D335B8D70"/>
ſheltered by the hills from the blaſts that ſweep over the highlands of Caſtile.</p>
                     <p>To the weſt, it has the town, the three principal ſtreets of which terminate in the Prado. Theſe are three noble openings, excellently paved, and clean e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a nicety; indeed ſo are moſt of the ſtreets of Madrid ſince the edict for paving and cleaning them. The foreigners that reſided here before that time, ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the very recollection of its former filth.</p>
                     <p>Some of the natives regret the old ſtinks and naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as they pretend that the air of Madrid is ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as to require a proper mixture of groſſer effluvia, to prevent its pernicious effects upon the conſtitution. The extremes of cold and heat are aſtoniſhing in this place, and the winds ſo ſearching, that all the Spaniards wear leathern under waiſtcoats, to preſerve their cheſts; for they pervade every other kind of clothing. In ſummer the duſt is intolerable.</p>

                     <p>WE have juſt finiſhed our round of preſentations, which in ſo numerous a royal family, is a work of more days than one. As I know you expect a minute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of each of thoſe that compoſe it, I am ſorry I am incapable of ſatisfying your curioſity, in as ample a manner as I could wiſh. You ſhall have a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their perſons, and as much of their characters as I have learned from well-informed people, in whoſe judgment I can confide. I beg you will conſider how hard it is to diſcern the true character of the great, as your intelligence can only flow to you through the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious channel of many jarring paſſions and intereſts. It is impoſſible for a ſtranger to ſeize a good likeneſs in ſo ſhort a time, and to tranſmit to others a faithful repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a prince that does not admit him to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar intercourſe.</p>
                     <p>I don't know but ſovereigns are the moſt difficult characters to define in a whoe nation; for all princes appear pretty nearly alike. Their mode of life is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. By ſeeing none but inferiors about them, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> a great indifference in their manner, and ſeldom
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:031692_0519_0FEE2260451E39F8"/>
betray in their countenance any of thoſe ſtrong emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that mark the various feelings of men obliged to buſtle through the world. Their paſſions lack the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh which ariſes from delays and difficulties. What the French call <hi>Ennui,</hi> weariſomeneſs is, methinks, the grand malady of princes, and therefore amuſement is their main purſuit in life.</p>
                     <p>In the princeſs of the houſe of Bourbon, the paſſion of fowling predominates: yet in the Spaniſh royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, there are ſome who toil at the gun with more reluctance than the farmer's boy does at the plough; have a taſte for arts and ſciences, and wiſh for nothing more than to be freed from the obligation of following the diverſion.</p>
                     <p>The ceremony of preſentation is performed as the king riſes from table. Charles the Third is a much better looking man than moſt of his pictures make him. He has a good natured laughing eye. The lower part of his face, by being expoſed to all weathers, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a deep copper colour. What his hat covers is fair, as he naturally has a good ſkin. In ſtature he is rather ſhort, thickly built about the legs and thighs, and narrow in the ſhoulders. His dreſs ſeldom varies from a large hat, a plain grey Segovia frock, a buff waiſtcoat, a ſmall dagger, black breeches, and worſted ſtockings. His pockets are always ſtuffed with knives, gloves, and ſhooting tackle. On Gala days a fine ſuit
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:031692_0520_0FEE2267539590A8"/>
is hung upon his ſhoulders, but as he has an eye to his afternoon ſport, and is a great oeconomiſt of his time, the black breeches are worn to all coats. I believe there are but three days in the whole year that he ſpends without going out a-ſhooting, and thoſe are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the blackeſt mark in the callender. Were they to occur often, his health would be in danger, and an accident that was to confine him to the houſe, would infallibly bring on a fit of illneſs. No ſtorm, heat, cold, or wet, can keep him at home; and when he hears of a wolf being ſeen, diſtance is counted for nothing. He would drive over half the kingdom rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than miſs an opportunity of firing upon that favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite game.</p>
                     <p>Beſides a moſt numerous retinue of perſons belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the hunting eſtabliſhment, ſeveral times a year, all the idle fellows in and about Madrid are hired to beat the country, and drive the wild boars, deer, and hares, into a ring, where they paſs before the royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. A very large annual ſum is diſtributed among the proprietors of land about the capital, and near the country palaces, by way of indemnification for the damage done to the corn. I was aſſured that it coſt ſeventy thouſand pounds ſterling for the environs of Madrid, and thirty thouſand for thoſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Saint Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo. In order to be entitled to this reimburſement, the farmers ſcatter juſt as much ſeed-corn over their
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:031692_0521_0FEE2268D988E938"/>
grounds, as will grow up into ſomething like a crop; but they do not always give themſelves the trouble of getting in the ſcanty harveſt, being ſufficiently paid for their labour by the royal bounty.</p>
                     <p>Being naturally of an even phlegmatic temper, the king is ſure to ſee events on their favourable ſide only; and whenever he has determined in his own mind, that a meaſure is proper to be perſued, he is an utter enemy to alteration. As far as I can judge, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the different accounts I have had, he is a man of the ſtricteſt probity, incapable of adopting any ſcheme, unleſs he is perfectly ſatisfied in his conſcience that it is juſt and honourable;—of ſuch immovable features, that the moſt fortunate or the moſt diſaſtrious occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are alike unable to create the ſmalleſt variation in them;—rigid in his morals, and ſtrenuouſly attached to his religion; but he does not ſuffer his devotion to lay him open to the enterprizes of the court of Rome, or the encroachments of his own clergy; on the contrary, they have frequently met with rougher uſage at his hands than they might have expected from a freethinker.</p>
                     <p>The regularity of his own life renders him very ſtrict about the conduct of his children, whom he obliges to be out fiſhing or ſhooting as long as he is abſent on the ſame buſineſs. This he does to prevent their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time or opportunity to harbour bad thoughts; and truly I believe he goes out ſo conſtantly himſelf, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031692_0522_0FEE226A60FF24C0"/>
to keep down the vigour of his own conſtitution. He ſeldom addreſſes himſelf to any young men of his court; but delights in converſing and joking with el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly perſons, and ſuch as are of his own age, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly monks and friars. He is very partial to Naples, and always ſpeaks of that country with great feeling.</p>
                     <p>Since his acceſſion, many great works have been completed; noble roads made to all the palaces round the metropolis; ſeveral others undertaken in more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote provinces. He has finiſhed the palace at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, and added conſiderably to thoſe of the Prado and Aranjuez; built new towns at Aranjuez, and Eſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and St. Ildefonſo; and planted a great deal at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranjuez. The Marquis of Grimaldi has the merit of having ſuggeſted and conducted moſt of theſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of having urged on the king, who although he has naturally no great reliſh for the arts, thinks it the duty of a ſovereign to encourage them.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of Aſturias is of an athletic make, his countenance rather ſevere, and his voice harſh. He ſeemed in a great hurry to get away from us; but the princeſs ſtayed chatting a great while, She is not handſome, being very ſickly, but ſeems lively and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly ſhaped, with a very fine hand and arm. If ſhe lives to be a queen, I dare ſay ſhe will render this court a very gay one; for ſhe appears to like to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and converſe with ſtrangers. When ſhe walks
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:031692_0523_0FEE7616F0B062D0"/>
out, all perſons that have been preſented, and chance to be in the way, are expected to join her company, and eſcort her as long as ſhe thinks proper. Her mildneſs and good-nature have ſoftened much of her huſband's roughneſs of manner; and of late he ſeems to have more pleaſure in ſitting with her in a domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic way, than in trudging over the heath in queſt of game.</p>
                     <p>Don Gabriel is a tall well looking man, but timid to exceſs. He poſſeſſes many talents, but his conſtant avocations out of doors prevent his applying to ſtudy as much as he could wiſh. I have ſeen ſome good pictures done by him, and have heard much of his claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical learning, and turn for mathematics.</p>
                     <p>Don Antonio appears to be very well pleaſed with the active life of a ſportſman.</p>
                     <p>The Infanta Maria Joſepha has reaſon to envy every country wench ſhe ſees roaming at liberty; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, etiquette, and celibacy, are likely to be her lot during life.</p>
                     <p>Don Lewis, the king's brother, after having been a cardinal and an archbiſhop, is now on the eve of matrimony with a pretty Arragoneſe girl, whom he took a fancy to laſt year, as ſhe was running acroſs the fields after a butterfly. As he has made a collection of natural hiſtory, the ſimilarity of taſte made a great impreſſion upon him. This wedding, which the king
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031692_0524_0FED3840B6DA5FA8"/>
has conſented to with reluctance, has produced a total revolution in the marriage-laws of Spain. A new pragmatica or edict is publiſhed, to prevent all match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es betwixt perſons of unequal rank and quality. By this decree the old cuſtom is abrogated. Heretofore it was out of the power of parents to hinder their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from marrying whom they liked, and the church interpoſed to oblige them to make a ſuitable ſettlement upon the young couple.</p>
                     <p>Don Lewis's bride is not to be allowed the title or rank of a princeſs of the blood, nor are her children to be deemed qualified to ſucceed to the crown. He is to reſide near Talavera, where I make no doubt but he will lead a happy life, as he has a great taſte for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic and natural hiſtory. His cabinet already contains a very valuable collection of rarities, eſpecially ſuch as are found in the Spaniſh dominions. This prince is chearful, humane, affable, and full of pleaſantry: good qualities that render him the darling of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The king and all the males of his family wear the enſigns of a great variety of military orders. On their left breaſt is a row of ſtars like the belt of the conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Orion. They are alſo decorated with the blue ribband of the French order of the Holy Ghoſt, and the inſignia of the Burgundian golden fleece. They have beſides the Neapolitan red ſaſh of St. Januarius,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:031692_0525_0FED3843ADA827F8"/>
the red croſſes of Calatrava, founded in 1158, of St. Jago, dated from 1175, and of Monteſa, inſtituted in 1317, and the green croſs of Alcantaria, invented in 1176. After all theſe badges, comes the blue and white ribband of the Conception of Carlos Tercero, eſtabliſhed by the preſent king, on the birth of the late ſon of the Prince of Aſturias.</p>

                     <p>IT has been my conſtant ſtudy, during our tour round Spain, to note down and tranſmit to you every peculiarity that might throw light upon the diſtinctive turn and genius of the nation. Experience has taught me to look upon this method as the beſt, and indeed the only ſure guide to the knowledge of a people; but at the ſame time has made me ſenſible how imperfect an idea is to be acquired by a tranſitory view, in a progreſs of a few months. Cuſtoms that ſtruck me at firſt as unaccountable, from my ignorance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and ſituations, have frequently ſince appeared to
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:031692_0526_0FED3846A22A9CD0"/>
me not only proper and rational, but abſolutely ſo much in the common courſe of things, that I have wondered how I came to put them down as extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
                     <p>The miſtakes I have found myſelf guilty of in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral little remarks made, in the firſt part of my journey, have rendered me very cautious of deciding upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where I could not come at a knowledge of their cauſes. I therefore very early learned to miſtruſt my ſenſes, and applied where I expected to have my doubts reſolved, and the reaſons of modes and uſages explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly I omitted no opportunity of drawing information from the natives of all ranks; from ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers long eſtabliſhed in Spain, and from thoſe who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſided but a few years there, were more likely to be ſenſible of the ſingularities of the national diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. I cannot ſay my endeavours have been crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Were I to draw the picture of the Spaniards from the manifold ſketches traced by their countrymen, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry province in the kingdom would in its turn appear a Paradiſe, and a Pandoemonium, a ſeat of holy ſpirits, and a receptacle of malicious devils. The moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory accounts, enforced by the moſt poſitive aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, have been repeatedly given me of the ſame places. I have often found the virtue one province
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:031692_0527_0FEE75D400E69B28"/>
prides itſelf in, as being the ſpecific mark of its inhabitants, not only refuſed them by a neighbouring country, but the very oppoſite vice impoſed upon them as their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic. The Engliſh, French, and other foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, living in Spain, are in general but indifferently qualified to decide upon theſe matters. As long as they retain the prejudices they brought from home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every thing that claſhes with their native cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, they are but partial judges; and when once they fall into the ways of the place where commerce has fixed their lot, they become ſuch thorough paced Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards, that they can neither perceive the particularities you ſpeak to them of, nor aſſign reaſons for uſes that are grown habitual to them.</p>
                     <p>As I am not aſhamed to acknowledge my inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, I frankly confeſs it is not in my power to give what you may think a ſatisfactory character of the Spaniards. Were I inclined to flatter my ſelf-love, I might add, that I do not eſteem any of thoſe who have already written on the ſubject, much better qualified than myſelf. What I can venture to ſay amounts to very little.</p>
                     <p>The Catalonians appear to be the moſt active, ſtirring ſet of men, the beſt calculated for buſineſs, travelling and manufactories. The Valencians are a more ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſedate race, better adapted to the occupations of huſbandmen, leſs eager to change place, and of a much
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:031692_0528_0FEE75D6CFB2EBC0"/>
more timid, ſuſpicious caſt of mind than the former. The Andaluſians ſeem to me the great talkers and rhodomontadoes of Spain. The Caſtillians have a manly frankneſs, and leſs appearance of cunning and deceit. The new Caſtillians are perhaps the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious of the whole nation; the old Caſtillians are laborious, and retain more of an ancient ſimplicity of manners; both are of a firm, determined ſpirit. I take the Arragoneſe to be a mixture of the Caſtillians and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonians, rather inclining to the former. The Biſcay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are acute and diligent, fiery and impatient of controul; more reſembling a colony of republicans, than a province of an abſolute monarchy. The Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licians are a plodding, pains-taking race of mortals, that roam over Spain in ſearch of an hardly-earned ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The liſtleſs indolence equally dear to the unciviliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſavage, and to the degenerate ſlave of deſpotiſm, is no where more indulged than in Spain. Thouſands of men in all parts of the realm are ſeen to paſs their whole day, wrapped up in a cloak, ſtanding in rows againſt a wall, or dozing under a tree. In total want of every excitement to action, the ſprings of their intellectual faculties forget to play, their views grow confined within the wretched ſphere of mere exiſtence, and they ſcarce ſeem to hope or foreſee any thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their preſent ſtate of vegetation. They feel
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:031692_0529_0FEE75D855386368"/>
little or no concern for the welfare or glory of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the ſurface of the earth is engroſſed by a few over-grown families, who ſeldom beſtow a thought on the condition of their vaſſals. The poor Spaniard does not work, unleſs urged by irreſiſtable want, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he perceives no advantage accrue from induſtry. As his food and raiment are purchaſed at a ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, he ſpends no more time in labour, than is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for procuring the ſcanty proviſion his abſtemiouſneſs requires. I have heard a peaſant refuſe to run an arrand becauſe he had that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earned as much already as would laſt him the day, without putting himſelf to any further trouble.</p>
                     <p>Yet I am convinced that this lazineſs is not eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inherent in the Spaniſh compoſition. For it is impoſſible, without ſeeing them, to conceive with what eagerneſs they perſue any favourite ſcheme, with what violence their paſſions work upon them, and what vigour and exertion of powers they diſplay when awakened by a bull-feaſt, or the moſt conſtant agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gaming, a vice to which they are ſuperlatively addicted. Were it again poſſible, by an intelligent ſpirited adminiſtration, to ſet before their eyes, in a clear and forcible manner proper incitements to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and induſtry, the Spaniards might yet be rouſed from their lethargy, and led to riches and reputation; but I confeſs the taſk is ſo difficult, that I look upon
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:031692_0530_0FEE75D9DCF36468"/>
it rather as an Utopian idea, than as a revolution like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever to take place.</p>
                     <p>Their ſoldiers are brave, and patient of hardſhips. Wherever their officers lead them, they will follow without flinching, though it be up to the mouth of a battery of cannon; but unleſs the example be given them by their commander, not a ſtep will they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the Spaniards are hardy; and when once engaged, go through difficulties without murmuring, bear the inclemancies of the ſeaſons with firmneſs, and ſupport fatigue with amazing perſeverance. They ſleep every night in their cloaks on the ground; are ſparing in diet, perhaps more from a ſenſe of habitual indigence, than from any averſion to gluttony. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they can riot in the plenty of another man's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they will gormandize to acceſs, and, not content with eating their fill, will carry off whatever they can ſtuff into their pockets. I have more than once been a witneſs to the pillage of a ſupper, by the numerous beaux and admirers which the ladies lead after them in triumph, wherever they are invited. They are fond of ſpices, and ſcarce eat any thing without ſaffron, pimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or garlic. They delight in wine that taſtes ſtrong of the pitched ſkin, and of oil that has a rank ſmell and taſte. Indeed, the ſame oil feeds their lamp, ſwims in their pottage, and dreſſes their ſallad. In inns the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:031692_0531_0FEE75DCACBCE950"/>
lamp is frequently handed down to the table, that each man may take the quantity he chuſes. Much tobacco is uſed by them in ſmoaking and chewing. All the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e hot, drying kinds of food, co-operating with the parching qualities of the atmoſphere, are aſſigned as cauſes of the ſpare make of the common people in Spain, where the prieſts and the inn keepers are almoſt the only well-fed, portly figures to be met with.</p>
                     <p>The Spaniſh is by no means naturally a ſerious mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy nation. Miſery and diſcontent have caſt a gloom over them, increaſed no doubt, by the long habit of diſtruſt and terror inſpired by the inquiſition; yet every village ſtill reſounds with the muſic of voices and guitars; and their fairs and Sunday wakes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable noiſy and riotous. They talk louder, and argue with more vehemence than even the French or Italians, and geſticulate with equal, if not ſuperior ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs. In Catalonia the young men are expert at ball; and every village has its <hi>pelota,</hi> or ground for play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at fives; but in the South of Spain I never percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the inhabitants uſed any particular exerciſe. I am told, that in the iſland of Majorca they ſtill wield the ſling, for which their anceſtors, the Baleares, were ſo much renowned.</p>
                     <p>Like moſt people of Southern climates, they are dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their perſons, and overrun with vermin.</p>
                     <p>As their conſtitution may be ſaid to be made up of
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:031692_0532_0FEE75DF71B41F00"/>
the moſt combuſtible ingredients, and prone to love in a degree that natives of more northen latitudes can have no idea of, the cuſtom of embracing perſons of the other ſex, which is uſed on many occaſions by foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſets the Spaniards all on fire. They would as ſoon allow a man to paſs the night in bed with their wives or daughters, as ſuffer him to give them a kiſs.</p>
                     <p>I was ſurprized to find them ſo much more luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm in their devotion than I expected; but I will not take upon me to aſſert, though I have great reaſon to believe it, that there is in Spain as little true moral religion as in any country I ever travelled through, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though none abounds more with provincial protectors, local Madonnas, and altars celebrated for particular cures and indulgencies. Religion is a topic not to be touched, much leſs handled with any dgree of curioſity, in the dominions of ſo tremendous a tribunal as the Inquiſition. From what little I ſaw, I am apt to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that the people here trouble themſelves with very few ſerious thoughts on the ſubject; and that, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they can bring themſelves to believe that their favourite Saint looks upon them with an eye of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they take it for granted, that under his benign influence, they are freed from all apprehenſions of damnation in a future ſtate; and indeed, from any great concern about the moral duties of this life. The burning zeal which diſtinguiſhed their
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:031692_0533_0FEE75E236BC0DF0"/>
anceſtors above the reſt of the Catholic world, appears to have loſt much of its activity, and really ſeems nearly extinguiſhed. It is hard to aſcribe bounds to the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a crafty, ſteady, and popular monarch might make in eccleſiaſtical matters. The unconcern betrayed by the whole nation at the fall of the Jeſuits, is a ſtrong proof of their preſent indifference. Thoſe fathers, the moſt powerful body politic in the kingdom, the rulers of the palace, and the deſpots of the cottage, the directors of the conſcience, and diſpoſers of the fortune of every rank of men, were all ſeized in one night, by detachments of ſoldiers, hurried like malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the ſea-ports, and baniſhed forever from the realm, without the leaſt reſiſtance to the royal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date being made, or even threatened. Their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry memory ſeems to be annihilated with ther power.</p>
                     <p>We found the common people inoffenſive, if not civil; and having never had an opportunity of being witneſſes to any of their exceſſes, can ſay nothing of their violent jealouſy or revenge, which are points moſt writers on Spain have expatiated upon with great pleaſure. I believe in this line, as well as in many others, their bad as well as good qualities have been magnified many degrees above the truth.</p>
                     <p>The national qualities, good and bad, conſpicuous in the lower claſſes of men, are eaſily traced, and very diſcernible in thoſe of higher rank; for their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <p>A VERY furious example of paſſion and cruelty happened while I was in Spain. A Carmelite friar fell deſperately in love with a young woman to whom he was confeſſor. He tried every art of ſeduction his deſires could ſuggeſt to him: but to his unſpeakable vexation, found her virtue or indifference proof againſt all his machinations. His deſpair was heightened to a pitch of madneſs, upon hearing that ſhe was ſoon to be married to a perſon of her own rank in life. The furies of jealouſy ſeized his ſoul, and worked him up to the moſt barbarous of all determinations, that of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving his rival of the prize, by putting an end to her exiſtence.

He gave her abſolution and the ſacrament with his own hands, as his love deterred him from murdering her before he tho't ſhe was purified from all ſtain of ſin, and her ſoul fit to take its flight to the tribunal of its Creator; but his jealouſy and revenge urged him to purſue her down the church, and plunge his dagger in her heart, as ſhe turned round to make a genuflection to the altar. He was immediately ſeized, and ſoon condemned to die; but leſt his ignominious execution ſhould reflect diſhonor on a religious order, which boaſts of having an aunt of the king of France among its members, his ſentence was changed into perpetual labour among the galley-ſlaves of Porto Rico.</p>

                     <p>BAGNERES derives its name from the mineral baths which were known and frequented by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Romans, as many inſcriptions and monuments ſtill exiſting on the ſpot, ſatisfactorily demonſtrate.</p>
                     <p>The peaſants of the neighbourhood are a lively race, and often aſſemble in a ſhady walk near the gates to dance. One of the queens of Navarre remitted all fines upon alienation of property at Bagneres, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that a ſmall ſum ſhould be levied upon each perſon admitted to his freedom, and ſpent in bonfires and other merry expences at Midſummer.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of this place is happily calculated for all exerciſes that tend to the recovery of health. It is built on a flat and very dry ſoil. Every part of it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys an eaſy communication with the fields, the banks of the river, or the high-roads, where the weaker ſort of viſitants may breathe the freſh air, and regain ſtrength by moderate exertions; while the more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, who repair to Bagneres for the ſake of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may climb delightful hills, and wander among
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:031692_0540_0FEE75F0E4DA0948"/>
ſhady groves, through a variety of landſcapes. The plains and eminences are traverſed by innumerable paths acceſſible to horſemen as well as foot-paſſengers. The high grounds are not like thoſe in the Alps, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and precipitous, but eaſily ſloped, and clothed with ſoft and pleaſant verdure. The timber that crowns their ſummits is of the nobleſt ſize. In the heart of cultivation, and near the foot of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Spaniſh cheſnut predominates, intermingled with cherry, walnut, and other fruit trees, round which the vine entwines its tendrils. Higher up the extent of paſture becomes more conſiderable. The middle regions of the mountains are darkened with woods of beech overhung by foreſts of ſilver fir, and above all, black pinnacles of rocks ſhoot up to a frightful height, with here and there a wreath of ſnow preſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melted through the ſummer by the protection of their ſhade.</p>
                     <p>That ſide of the mountains which faces the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide ſun is richly covered with wood; but the opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The greateſt part of theſe foreſts is the common property of the neighbouring villages, and as high as carriage can be eaſily contrived, is cut after a regular but careleſs manner, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of fuel, and the purpoſes of huſbandry.</p>
                     <p>The medicinal waters at Bagneres have alone reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:031692_0541_0FEE75F6629A17E0"/>
this valley from the obſcurity which involves ſo many neighbouring beautiful diſtricts. A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of boiling, lukewarm, and cold ſtreams iſſue out of the ſides of the mountain that covers the town on the weſtern aſpect. All of them poſſeſs, or are ſuppoſed to poſſeſs, very ſtrong healing qualities, which each pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient applies with great confidence to his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſorder, under the directions of the phyſicians of the place. The ſummit of this mountain is indent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a large hollow, ſimilar to the crater of a volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, and I have no doubt but fire has been emitted from this cup at ſome period beyond the reach of hiſtory. The fire which was then ſufficient to produce explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to caſt forth torrents of lava, ſtill retains the power in its weaker ſtate, of imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rting virtue in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degrees to the mineral ſprings that flow from the mountain where its focus is eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>The number of wells and baths amount to thirty. Some are covered in for the uſe of patients, who can afford to pay for their cures. Others are open pools where the poorer claſs gargle their ulcerous throats, or lave their ſores, gratis. The heat of ſome ſpouts is at firſt almoſt inſupportable, but gradually grows leſs painful. I have ſeen people expoſe their deceaſed limbs to the boiling ſtream for more than a quarter of an hour at a time. The hotteſt ſpring raiſes the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver in Farrenheit's thermometer to 123 degrees, while
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:031692_0542_0FEE75F966C402E0"/>
the cooleſt cauſes it to aſcend no higher than 86. Out of the thirty different ſources two are exactly equal in heat to that of the human body, ten below, and eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen above it. Their medicinal qualities differ no leſs eſſentially than their degrees of heat; for the waters of the Queen's bath are ſtrongly purgative, thoſe of Salut and Le Pré<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>diuretic and cooling.</p>
                     <p>The bath of Salut is ſituated about a mile from the town, among the mountains. A pleaſant winding road leads to it, through beautiful fields planted with clumps of cheſnut trees. The houſes and groves on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding hills cheer the proſpect; but in ſo hot a ſeaſon, and in this latitude, an avenue would be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter improvement and relief to the patients.</p>
                     <p>The ſpring is copious, and equal to the demands of the crowds that flock round it on hollidays, when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon may drink his fill for the value of three far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things Engliſh. The vogue is ſo great, that two gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas have been taken in one morning, at this low price.</p>
                     <p>From the drinking place the waters are conveyed into two marble troughs, which are in conſtant uſe during the whole ſeaſon. Seniority of reſidence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitues the right of bathing, and therefore many late comers, who foreſee but a diſtant proſpect of being accommodated with an hour of Salut, take up with the other baths of inferior reputation, but perhaps equal

                     <p>I ſet out on the ſixth of Auguſt with ſome friends, and travelled up the valley. The low grounds are fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cultivated. Numberleſs ſtreams pour acroſs the

road, and hurry to blend their waters with thoſe of the Adour, which is here confined to a narrow bed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it eaſtward, the mountains are covered with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful verdure. At their foot ſtands Aſté, a village be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the family of Crammont.</p>
                     <p>A peaſant who reſides here, earns a livelihood by ſupplying the apothecaries with medicinal plants, which he gathers on the adjacent mountains, particularly that of Lieris, juſtly celebrated for the immenſe and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated ſhow of flowers, that cover its elevated paſtures, before ſheep and cattle are let in to graze.</p>
                     <p>The convent of capuchins, at Medous, oppoſite to Aſté, is placed ſo cloſely under a mountain, that in winter it enjoys but two hours ſun ſhine in the whole day. Its garden is remarkable for a large volume of water, that iſſues out of the rocks. Trouts are often ſeen ſwimming down the ſtream, but if diſturbed, they retire into the bowels of the mountain, to ſome ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous lake.</p>
                     <p>The populouſneſs of this vale is ſcarce credible. In the extent of three miles I reckoned near five hundred houſes or barns. The burgh of Campan gives name to the upper diſtrict, and is famous for the excellency of its butter. It acknowledges no lord but the king, and has conſiderable woods and cultivated lands, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to its community.</p>

to a celebrated grotto, in the ſide of a bare mountain. The entrance is narrow and ſloping, but at the depth of ten feet, the floor of the cavern lies nearly on a level. The vault ſeldom exceeds nine feet in height. Its length is an hundred and four yards. The path is wet and rugged. The walls and roof are incruſtated with chryſtaliſations; but all that were curious for ſize, ſhape, or beauty of colour, had been broken off and carried away by pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ceeding travellers. At the end of the grotto we found a marble ſlab, fixed up by order of the counteſs of Brionne, to commemorate that after infinite labour, ſhe, with her family and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whoſe names are all conſigned to immortality on this ſubterraneous monument, penetrated thus far into the bowels of the earth, in the year 1766.</p>
                     <p>Above Campan the valley grew more confined. The hills on the right hand were ſtudded with trees and barns, and covered with lively verdure; thoſe on the left, were rocky, barren, and ſavage. At the chapel of St. Mary, two branches of the Adour flow from different glens and join their waters. We rode up the more weſtern ſtream to Grip, where all level ground terminates. Noble groves of fir overhang the river, which daſhes ſucceſſively down three romantic falls. Having taken ſome refreſhment we proceeded up the mountain by a winding, ſteep, and rugged path,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:031692_0546_0FEE76079900B608"/>
through a foreſt of ſilver and ſpruce firs. We occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally caught views of the river foaming among the rocks and trees, and in one ſpot darting over a vaſt precipice in a full, magnificent ſheet.</p>
                     <p>Upon leaving the woods we croſſed a large naked plain, at the foot of the Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> du midi, the higheſt mountain on the Pyrenees. The Adour iſſues out of a pyramidical hill, a few miles farther up, and winds in a ſmall ſtream through the ruſhy paſtures. Abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of flowers animate the face of this otherwiſe dull ſcene of nature. We were now arrived in the higheſt point of land we had to ſurmount, when we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by a very heavy fall of ſnow, that whitened all the ſurrounding eminences, but ſoon melted into rain and wetted us thoroughly</p>
                     <p>When the ſtorm abated, and the atmoſphere grew clear, a horrible view opened down the valley of Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Rude and barren mountains ſhade it on both ſides, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a foaming torrent, fills the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hollow. We deſcended by the edge of the blackeſt and moſt deſolute places in nature, where not a tree was to be ſeen: but the heights were ſeamed with yawning crevices, and the paſſages block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with quarries of ſtone, tumbled from the cliffs by the irreſiſtable force of the waters.</p>
                     <p>In this frightful chaſm ſtands the village of Bareges, conſiſting of a ſingle ſtreet built along the ſouth ſide of
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:031692_0547_0FEE760A5B3AA460"/>
the torrent. The ſituation is ſo dangerous and horrid; that the inhabitants dare not abide here in winter. They remove all their furniture, even doors and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, to ſuch houſes as are ſuppoſed moſt out of the way of miſchief. A few invalid ſoldiers alone remain, to preſerve the ſprings from being buried under the earth that ſlides down from the mountains. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a large volume of water buſts out of its ſide, the overplus of a lake on the ſummit, and ſweeps off all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. Every year ſome houſes are waſhed away by the floods, or cruſhed under the weight of ſnow. The <hi>avelanches,</hi> or heaps of ſnow that are detached from the mountains, are often ſo prodigious as to fill up the whole bottom of the glen; and the river has been known to roll for ſeveral weeks through an arch of its own forming under this immeaſurable maſs.</p>
                     <p>The mineral waters, for which Bareges is famed, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of the hill in the center of the village, and are diſtributed into three baths. They are very fetid, but clear in the glaſs. Their degrees of heat riſe from 89 to 112¾ They are greaſy to the touch, tinge ſilver black, and are eſteemed ſovereign in the cure of ulcers, wounds, and ſcrophulous humours. The baths belong to the king, and are entirely under the direction of his ſurgeons.</p>
                     <p>The poor have the uſe of a large bath covered with boards, and are fed by a tax of ſix livres impoſed upon

all new comers. With this fund a comfortable dinner is provided for them, and diſtributed in preſence of the governor, a worthy veteran, who ſolicited this command from a motive of gratitude, having been cured of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wound by bathing it with theſe waters.</p>
                     <p>No company reſorts hither merely for amuſement. Diſorders only, and thoſe ſevere and inveterate ones, can induce people to inhabit theſe wild regions. There is an aſſembly-room and regular bath, when it is, I know not whether a melancholy or a ludicrous ſight, to behold ſeveral couples dancing together, ſome with a leg bound up, others with an arm in a ſling, and all with a feeble body and a ſickly aſpect.</p>
                     <p>In theſe mountainous ſcenes nature exhibits her bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt features.

rock, without any parapet, laid open the deep gloomy bed of the river almoſt under our feet, and a ſhivery mountain preſſed ſo cloſe upon us on the other, as to leave no room for a retreat. The turns in the road, where torrents have heaped ſtones, and choaked the paſs with rubbiſh, are particularly diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but our horſes were ſo unconcerned and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, that they ſoon inſpired their riders with equal indifference fot the ſurrounding perils.</p>
                     <p>The whole valley is occupied by the river and the road, with vaſt piles of mountains riſing on each ſide, and almoſt cloſing together. Now and then level ſpots occur at the angles of the river. We croſſed a bridge romantically clothed with ivy, which hid the tremendous chaſm from our eyes. Huge rocks rear up their perpendicular points, and torrents ruſh over them on all ſides. The mountain-aſh, and ſervice-tree, bluſhing with cluſtered berries, bend over the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, and ſoften the harſhneſs of the wild proſpect. After this the valley rather ſwells out, and more room is allowed for the indefatigable induſtry of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to exert itſelf; but great part of the level, and all the lower regions of the mountains, are overgrown with wood, interſperſed with a charming variety of flowering ſhrubs. Many of the favourite denizons of our Engliſh gardens flouriſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This dale terminates at Gecres, a rambling village on the ſide of the mountain. The road is afterwards cut through the rock, and leads to a ſituation that gave us an idea of confuſion and deſolation, the effects of ſome violent earthquake. The mountain is ſplit and torn to pieces. Its ſides and foot are ſtrewed with innumerable huge blocks of ſtone, detached from the impending ridge that forms its bare ſummit. The paſſage through this rocky labyrinth opened to a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent amphitheatre. On the top waved thick for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of firs, through which ſeveral ſtreams forcing their way, daſhed down the lofty precipice, but almoſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away in miſt before they could reach the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. The field below was beautifully overſpread with purple monkſhood.</p>
                     <p>Our morning's expedition ended at Gabarnie, where we found good accommodations prepared for us by a meſſenger we had diſpatched the preceding day. This is a village conſiſting of a church and thirty houſes, in the midſt of bare hills, ſhaded by very high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and traverſed in ſeveral directions, by foaming torrents. The curate partook of our dinner, after we had removed the table to the door of the inn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he durſt neither eat nor drink within the walls of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic houſe. We found him a modeſt converſable man, worthy of a richer ſettlement.</p>
                     <p>After dinner we travelled towards the head of the
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:031692_0551_0FEE76142E43F6B0"/>
Gave, the object of our journey. We had long had in view the ſnow-capped-cliffs from which its waters iſſue, but were ſurpriſed to find them ſtill ſo diſtant from us. We ſpent an hour and a half in riding acroſs a bare tract of paſture, cloſed in with immenſe foreſts of evergreens on the French ſide along the Spaniſh frontier, which lies on the right hand confined by bare rocky mountains. This plain is called the <hi>Prade.</hi> The river follows a ſerpentine courſe through it. In winter it is generally covered with ſnow forty feet deep.</p>
                     <p>Our guide having now brought us to his <hi>ne plus ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> preſſed us earneſtly to alight, as no horſe had ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advanced beyond this paſs. But as we were not contented with ſo diſtant a view, we rejected his timid advice, and clambering over ſeveral rocky eminences, plunged into the river, which by its limpidity deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our eye, both as to the debth of water, and the ſize of the rocks at the bottom. It required our utmoſt exertions to extricate out houſes, and bear them ſafe through to the oppoſite bank. This difficulty being overcome, all others appeared contemptable, and we ſoon reached the center of a moſt ſtupendous amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre. Three ſides of it are formed by a range of perpendicular rocks: the fourth is ſhaded with wood. Above the upright wall, which is of a horrible height, riſe ſeveral ſtages of broken maſſes, each covered with
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:031692_0552_0FED383A6CF57DB0"/>
a layer of everlaſting ſnow. The mountain eaſtward ends in ſharp pinnacles, and runs off to the weſt in one immenſe bank of ſnow. From theſe concealed heaps the Gave derives its excellence. Thirteen ſtreams ruſh down the mighty precipice, and unite their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at its foot.</p>
                     <p>The whole weſtern corner of the area below is fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a bed of ſnow, which being ſtruck by few rays of the ſun at any ſeaſon, receives a ſufficient vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume of freſh ſnow every winter to balance the loſs occaſioned by the warmth of the atmoſphere in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Two of the torrents fell upon this extenſive frozen ſurface. They have worn a huge chaſm, and extending from it, a vaulted paſſage five hundred yards in length, through which their waters roll. We bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rode over this extraordinary bridge, and alighting at the foot of the rocks, walked down the paſſage. The ſnow lies above it near twenty feet thick. The roof is about ſix feet above the ground, and finely turned in an arch, which appears as if it had been cut and chiſſeled by the hand of man. In ſome places there are columns and collateral galleries. The whole glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a diamond, and was beautifully pervaded by the light. The only inconvenience we felt, aroſe from the dripping occaſioned by the extreme heat of the day by which even this great body of ſnow was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected.</p>
                     <p>

As we emerged with the river from this ſingular grotto, we unharboured three chamoy goats, that had taken refuge in the mouth of the cave, againſt the burning rays of noon. They darted acroſs the plain, and aſcended the ſteepeſt parts of the rocks, where we ſoon loſt ſight of them. Theſe animals are called <hi>Yſards</hi> in this country. They are rather ſmaller than the fallow deer, of a muddy reddiſh yellow colour, with ſnubbed noſe, and ſhort black horns. In ſhape they reſemble a deer, walking with their heads upright, and ſkipping away with admirable ſwiftneſs. But they do not bound; they run when at full ſtretch. No beaſt of the foreſt is of more difficult acceſs. They ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom quit the higheſt and moſt inacceſſible parts of the mountains. During the wintry ſtorms they have been ſeen fixed on the brow of a precipice, with their faces towards the wind, probably to prevent the rain and ſnow from lodging under their hair.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding their ſuſpicious, wild nature, and their extreme velocity, the hardy mountaineers find means to deſtroy them. They lie out whole days and nights watching their opportunity, and making good uſe of it when it offers; for they are excellent markſmen. They have frequently as much difficulty in reaching the dead prey, as in approaching it while living. The fleſh of the <hi>Yſard</hi> is much eſteemed. Its ſkin makes ſoft and uſeful gloves.</p>

The ſetting of the ſun rouſed us from the ecſtacy in which the contemplation of theſe awful ſcenes had enwrapped every ſenſe, and warned us to retire before the want of light ſhould render thoſe paſſages doubly dangerous, which we had found very difficult even in the glare of day. The ſun ſunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſnowy cliffs in admirable beauty, tinging the mountains with a rich variety of fiery hues, which died away into the moſt tender tints of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>The mountains abound with game, the rivers with fiſh. Here are no lords of manorial rights, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore game is the property of every member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity that can catch it. Except ſome tracts of wood reſerved for the uſe of the navy, all the foreſts are held in common.</p>

                     <p>THE kingdom of Portugal is ſituated to the weſt of Spain, from which it is ſeparated on the north and the eaſt by the river Minho, and ſome ſmall rivers and hills: on the ſouth and weſt it is waſhed by the ſea. Its whole extent from north to ſouth is three hundred miles, and its breadth from eaſt to weſt, where broadeſt, is about one hundred and twenty. It is in the ſame climate with Spain, and as well as that country, is very mountainous; but the ſoil is in general worſe, and never produces corn enough for the ſupport of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. As to wheat, it has always produced leſs of that valuable grain, than what the people require. In the ſouthern parts paſture is always ſcarce, and the cattle ſmall and lean, though the fleſh is generally well taſted. But to make amends for this want of corn and paſture, here are made vaſt quantities of wine, which is indeed the beſt commodity of this kingdom. Oil is alſo made here in great abundance, but it is far
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:031692_0556_0FEE761E754C1E88"/>
inferior to that of Spain and Italy. Lemons and oranges likewiſe grow here; and are exported in great quantities, though the acidity of the latter is not near ſo pleaſant, as thoſe that come from Seville; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are their raiſins, figs, almonds, and cheſnuts either ſo large, or ſo well taſted as thoſe of Spain. However, their ſweet oranges, which they have introduced from China, and are thence called China oranges, are the beſt of the kind in Europe. Herbs and flowers of all ſorts are here commonly very good, and abundance of perfumed waters are diſtilled from thoſe of the odorif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous kind, which are here in great requeſt, they being uſed in almoſt every thing that is eat, drank or worn.</p>
                     <p>The wollen manufactures of this country are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and coarſe, that they are only worn by the meaner ſort; and though their ſilks are in ſome places much better, they are far inferior in beauty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe made in Spain.</p>
                     <p>The modern Portugueſe retain nothing of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous enterprizing ſpirit that rendered their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ſo illuſtrious three hundred years ago. They have, ever ſince the houſe of Braganza mounted the throne, degenerated in all their virtues; though ſome noble exceptions are ſtill remaining among them, and no people are ſo little obliged as the Portugueſe are to the reports of hiſtorians and travellers. The degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is evidently owing to the weakneſs of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:031692_0557_0FEE761FFA0034A0"/>
which renders them inactive; and that inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity has proved the ſource of pride, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly vices. Treachery has been laid to their charge, as well as ingratitude, and above all, an intemperate paſſion for revenge. They are, if poſſible, more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and, both in high and common life, affect more ſtate than the Spaniards themſelves. Among the lower people, thieving is commonly practiſed; and all ranks are accuſed of being unfair in their dealings, eſpecially with ſtrangers. It is hard, however, to ſay what alteration may be made in the character of the Portugueſe, by the expulſion of the Jeſuits, and the diminution of the papal influence among them, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, by that ſpirit of independency, with regard to commercial affairs, upon Great Britian, which, not much to the honour of their gratitude, though to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their own country is now ſo much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their court and miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>The Portugueſe are neither ſo tall nor ſo well made as the Spaniards, whoſe habits and cuſtoms they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; only the quality affect to be more gaily and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreſſed.</p>
                     <p>The women are moſtly beautiful when young, though their complexion is inclinable to the olive; but the indiſcreet uſe of paint renders their ſkins ſhrivel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as with old age, before they are turned of thirty. Their eyes, however, which are generally black and
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:031692_0558_0FEE7622C6B168D0"/>
ſparkling, retain their luſtre after their other charms are withered. The quick decay of beauty is in ſome meaſure recompenced by the vivacity of their wit, in which they are ſaid to excel the women of all other nations. They are extremely charitable and generous, and remarkable for their modeſty.</p>
                     <p>Spectacles are commonly worn here as well as in Spain, as a mark of age and gravity; for it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of theſe two nations, that old age, with a grave and ſolemn behaviour, procure ſuch reſpect, that the young affect to imitate the ſolemnity of the old.</p>
                     <p>Liſbon, the capital of Portugal, is built upon ſeven hills, and is thought to contain 200,000 inhabitants. Some of the hills riſe up above the reſt: and ſome again are ſo interwoven and contraſted, that they form an agreeable diverſity of hills and vales; ſo that, from the oppoſite ſides of the Tagus, it looks like an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe amphitheatre, which has all the charms that can be produced by a variety of the moſt ſumptuous edifices, reflecting uncommon beauties upon each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the happineſs of their ſituation. Nor do the fine proſpects of the country give leſs pleaſure when they are viewed from the eminences in the city; for what can be a finer ſight than a beautiful country, and ſuch a river as the Tagus, covered with foreſts of ſhips from all nations? Its ſituation certainly, renders its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at once delightful and ſuperb, and it is deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:031692_0559_0FEE76244C42EE68"/>
accounted the greateſt port in Europe, next to London and Amſterdam.</p>
                     <p>The city, before the great earthquake, afforded ſtill a nobler proſpect when viewed from the river, than it does at preſent, on account of the gradual aſcent of the buildings. But this dreadful earthquake, which began on the firſt of November, 1775, at about ten in the morning, laid the fineſt buildings of Liſbon in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, and reduced that city to a ſcene of the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſolation. To complete the publick diſtreſs, a fire ſoon after broke out and ſpread among the ruins; and by theſe diſaſters the King's Palace, the Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, St. Dominic's church, St. Nicholas's, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, were either thrown down or conſumed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a great number of private houſes. But happily ſome whole ſtreets eſcaped the general calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and were left ſtanding entire.</p>
                     <p>All that part of the city which was demoliſhed by the earthquake, is now planned out in the moſt regular and commodious form. Some large ſquares and many ſtreets are already built. The ſtreets form right angles, and are broad and ſpacious. The houſes are lofty, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and uniform; and being built of white ſtone, make a beautiful appearance.</p>
                     <p>The air here is ſo ſoft, and the ſky ſo clear, that it is quite delicious; which joined to the excellence of the water, makes the inhabitants ſo extremely healthy,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:031692_0560_0FEE76284AA69000"/>
that they have the happineſs of living to a very great age, without being oppreſſed with infirmities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually attacked by freſh diſorders, as is uſual in oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er climates. The climate is ſo temperate, that they have roſes and many other ſorts of flowers, even in the winter.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond city in this kingdom is Oporto, which is computed to contain 30,000 inhabitants. The chief article of commerce in this city is wine; and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of half the ſhops in the city are coopers. The merchants aſſemble daily in the chief ſtreet, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act buſineſs, and are protected from the ſun by ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths hung acroſs from the oppoſite houſes. About thirty Engliſh families reſide here, who are chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the wine trade.</p>

                     <p>THE climate of Norway is much more various than in moſt other European countries. In the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-nights, the horizon when unclouded, is ſo clear and luminous, that at midnight one may read, write, and do all kinds of work as in the day; and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of this country, towards the iſlands of Finmark, the ſun is continually in view in the midſt of ſummer, and is obſerved to circulate day and night round the north pole, contracting its orbit, and then gradually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging it, till at length it leaves the horizon. On the other hand, in the depth of winter, the ſun is inviſible for ſome weeks; all the light perceived at noon being a faint glimmering of about an hour and a half's contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance; which, as the ſun never appears above the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, chiefly proceeds from the reflection of the rays on the higheſt mountains, whoſe ſummits are ſeen more clearly than any other objects. But the wiſe and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Creator has granted the inhabitants all poſſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; for beſides the moon-ſhine, which by reflection from the mountains is exceedingly bright in valleys, the people receive conſiderable relief from the <hi>Auror<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Borealis,</hi> or nothern lights, which often afford them all the light neceſſary to their ordinary labours.</p>
                     <p>On the eaſt ſide of Norway, the cold of winter gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally ſets in about the middle of October, and laſts till the middle of April. The waters are congealed to a thick ice, and the mountains and valleys covered with ſnow. However, this is of ſuch importance to the welfare of the country, that in a mild winter, the peaſants who live among the mountains are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſufferers; for without this ſevere froſt and ſnow, they can neither convey the timber they have felled, to the rivers, nor carry their corn, butter, furs and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er commodities, in their ſledges, to the market towns; and after the ſale of them carry back the neceſſaries they are ſupplied with. For the largeſt rivers, with their roaring cataracts are arreſted in their courſe by the froſt, and the very ſpittle is no ſooner out of the mouth than it is congealed, and rolls along the ground like hail. But the wiſe Creator has given the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this cold climate a greater variety of preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt the weather than moſt other countries afford. Extenſive foreſts ſupply them with plenty of timber for building, and for fuel. The wool of the ſheep, and the furs and ſkins of wild beaſts, furniſh them with warm lining for their cloaths, and covering for their beds. Innumerable flights of wild fowl ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with down and feathers. The mountains
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:031692_0563_0FEE7634E95DEB88"/>
themſelves ſerve them for fences againſt the north and eaſt winds, and their caverns afford them ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>In the ſummer months, the weather is not only warm but very hot. Theſe violent heats, which are, however, of ſhort duration, may be partly derived from the valleys being incloſed within high mountains, where the reverberation of the rays of the ſun on all ſides heat the hair; and as there is almoſt no night, neither the atmoſphere nor the mountains have time to cool. Indeed there cannot be a more deciſive proof of the ſummer's heat in Norway, than that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vegetables, (and particularly barley) grow up and ripen within ſix weeks or two months.</p>
                     <p>The air is pure and ſalubrious, eſpecially in the middle of the country about the mountains where the inhabitants know little of ſickneſs. Phyſicians are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in the chief towns, where they are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with a public ſalary, but have generally very little employment.</p>
                     <p>Norway contains a vaſt number of mountains, ſome of which extend themſelves in a long chain fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> north to ſouth, while others are ſcattered about and ſurrounded by a level country.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of a mountainous country may be ſaid to labour under more inconveniences than others. Thus the arable ground is here but little in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:031692_0564_0FEE763A5A1448E8"/>
of the waſtes and deſarts, which obliges the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to procure half their ſubſiſtence from the ſea. The villages are ſmall, and the houſes ſcattered among the valleys. But in ſome places the peaſant's houſes ſtand ſo high, and on the edge of ſteep precipices, that ladders are fixed to climb up to them; ſo that when a cleryman is ſent for, who is unpractiſed in the road, he riſks his life in aſcending them, eſpecially in winter, when the ways are ſlippery. In ſuch places the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the dead muſt be let down with ropes, or be brought on people's backs before they are laid in a coffin; and, at ſome diſtance from Bergen, the mail muſt likewiſe in winter be drawn over the ſteepeſt mountains.</p>
                     <p>Another evil reſulting from the mountains, is the ſhelter they afford in their caverns and clefts to the wild beaſts, which render it difficult to extirpate them. It is not eaſy to deſcribe the havock made by the lynxes, foxes, bears, and eſpecially wolves, among the cattle, goats, hares, and other uſeful animals.</p>
                     <p>Another evil is, that the cows, ſheep, and goats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the peaſants, often fall down the precipices and are deſtroyed. Sometimes they make a falſe ſtep into a projection, called a mountain-hammer, where they can neither aſcend nor deſcend. On this occaſion a peaſant chearfully ventures his life for a ſheep or a goat; and deſcending from the top of a mountain by a

                     <p>The country produces wheat, rye, barley, white, grey and green peaſe; vetches, uſed as provender for horſes; hops, flax, and hemp; many kinds of roots and greens for the kitchen, with a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of hardy flowers. In Norway, as well as in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, are ſeveral kinds of cherries, of which the peaſants ſell great quantities dried. There are alſo many ſorts of wholeſome and well-taſted berries, as red and white currants, ſunberries, raſpberries, red and white gooſeberries, barberries, bilberries, cramber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:031692_0566_0FEE7643D57F6EE8"/>
ſtrawberries, blackberries, and many other kinds. Several ſorts of plums attain to a tolerable ripeneſs, which can very ſeldom be ſaid of peaches, apricots, or grapes. However, apples and pears of ſeveral kinds are found all over the country; but the greateſt part of theſe are ſummer-fruits, which ripen early; for the winter-fruit ſeldom comes to perfection, unleſs the ſummer proves hotter, and the winter ſets in later than uſual.</p>
                     <p>But though, with reſpect to fruit-trees, Norway muſt be acknowledged inferior to moſt countries in Europe, yet this deficiency is liberally compenſated in the bleſſings of inexhauſtible foreſts; ſo that in moſt provinces immenſe ſums are received from foreigners for maſts, beams, planks, boards, &amp;c. not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the home conſumption for houſes built entirely of beams of wood, ſhips, bridges, and an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of founderies, which require an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Bergen, the capital of Norway, has one of the fineſt ports in Europe, and is divided into the upper and lower town, the one built on the rocks, and the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the ſea ſhore. It is a large trading town, full
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:031692_0567_0FEE76455BCF6E38"/>
of merchants, and was formerly an archbiſhopric; but has not been acknowledged ſuch ſince the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The Archbiſhop's palace was given to the <hi>Hans Towns,</hi> for their ancient merchants to live in, and the greateſt part of the houſes were turned into warehouſes, which ſtill bear the name of cloiſters, and the merchants are called monks, though they do not wear a cowl, nor obſerve the rules of any order. The king has, however, obliged them ſo far to keep up the form of a religious houſe, that none of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who live in it are allowed to marry without removing. The principal branch of trade carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on at Bergen, are herrings, cod, and ſtock-fiſh, for which there is a great vent in Muſcovy, Sweden, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Denmark, Germany, Holland, and other parts of Europe.</p>

                     <p>THE Norwegians are generally tall, well made, and lively; yet thoſe on the coaſt are neither ſo tall nor ſo robuſt as thoſe who inhabit the mountains; but are remarkable for being fatter, and having rounder faces. The people in general are briſk and ingenious; which appears from the peaſants not employing any hatters, ſhoemakers, taylors, tanners, weavers, carpenters, ſmiths, or joiners; for all theſe trades are exerciſed in every farmhouſe; and they think a boy can never be a uſeful member of ſociety, nor a good man, without making himſelf maſter of all theſe arts. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their civility and willingneſs to ſerve ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one, and a traveller is ſeldom ſuffered to pay for his lodging; for they think it their duty to treat the ſtranger as well as it is in their power, and look upon it as an honour done them, if he accepts of their civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. The peaſant, however, never gives the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the table to the greateſt gueſt that ever
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031692_0569_0FEE7648671B3718"/>
comes under his roof; for he thinks that place belongs only to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>They keep open houſe for three weeks at Chriſtmas, during which their tables are ſpread and loaded with the beſt proviſions they can afford. At Chriſtmas-eve their hoſpitality extends to the very birds; and, for their uſe, they hang on a pole at the barn-door, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threſhed ſheaf of corn, which draws thither the ſparrows and other ſmall birds.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of the trading towns live, with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to proviſions, much in the ſame manner as the Danes; but the peaſants keep cloſe to the manners of their fore-fathers. Thin oat-cakes are their common bread; but upon particular occaſions, as weddings or entertainments, they have rye-bread. If grain be ſcarce, which generally happens after a ſevere winter, the peaſants have recourſe to a diſagreeable method of preſerving life, by boiling and drying the bark of fir-trees, mixing it with a little oatmeal, and making it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of bread. Even in times of plenty they eat a little of it, that they may think it leſs diſagreeable in a time of ſcarcity.</p>
                     <p>The lakes and rivers furniſh the people with plenty of freſh water fiſh, and the mountains with game. For their winter ſtock they kill cows, ſheep, and goats; part of which they pickle and ſmoak, and ſome of it they cut in thin ſlices, ſprinkle it with ſalt, then dry it
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:031692_0570_0FED380A77930148"/>
in the wind, and eat it like hung beef. They are fond of brandy, and of ſmoaking and chewing tobacco.</p>
                     <p>The Norwegians who live in towns, have nothing remarkable in their dreſs; but the peaſants do not trouble themſelves about faſhions. Thoſe called ſtrile-farmers have their breeches and ſtockings of one piece. They have a wide looſe jacket, made of coarſe wollen cloth, as are alſo their waiſtcoats: and thoſe who would appear fine, have the ſeams covered with cloth of a different colour. The peaſants of one pariſh are remarkable for wearing black cloths edged with red; another for wearing all black. The dreſs of another pariſh is white edged with black. Others wear black and yellow. And thus the inhabitants of almoſt every pariſh vary in the colour of their cloaths. They wear a flapped hat, or a little brown, grey, or black cap, made quite round, and the ſeams ornamented with black ribbons. They have ſhoes of a peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction without heels, conſiſting of two pieces; the upper leather fits cloſe to the foot, to which the ſole is joined by a great many plaits and folds. When they trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and in the winter, they wear a ſort of half boots that reach up to the calf of the leg, and are laced on one ſide; and when they go on the rocks in the ſnow, they put on ſnow ſhoes. But as theſe are troubleſome when they have a great way to travel, they put on ſkaits about as broad as the foot, but ſix or eight feet
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:031692_0571_0FEE764B2DE02FB8"/>
long, and pointed before. They are covered under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath with ſeal-ſkin, to that the ſmooth grain of the hair turns backward to the heel. With theſe ſnow ſkaits they ſlide about on the ſnow as well as they can upon the ice, and faſter than any horſe.</p>
                     <p>The peaſant never wears a neck cloth, or any thing of that kind, except when he is dreſſed; for his neck and breaſt are always open, and he lets the ſnow beat into his boſom. On the contrary, he covers his veins, binding a woollen fillet round his wriſts. About their body they wear a broad leathern belt, ornamented with convex braſs plates; to this hangs a braſs chain, which holds their large knife, gimblet, and other tackle.</p>
                     <p>The women at church, and in genteel aſſemblies, dreſs themſelves in jackets laced cloſe, and have leath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern girdles, with ſilver ornaments about them. They alſo wear a ſilver chain three or four times round the neck, with a gilt medal hanging at the end of it. Their handerchiefs and caps are almoſt covered with ſmall ſilver, braſs, and tin-plates, buttons, and large rings, ſuch as they wear on their fingers, to which they hang again a percel of ſmall ones, which make a jing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling noiſe when they move. A maiden-bride has her hair plaited and hung as full as poſſible with ſuch kind of trinkets, as alſo her clothes. For this purpoſe they get all the ornaments they can.</p>
                     <p>The peaſants are generally buſied in cutting wood,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:031692_0572_0FEE7650B95181F8"/>
felling and floating timber, burning charcoal, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricating tar. Great numbers are employed in the mines, and at the furnaces and ſtamping mills; and alſo in navigation and fiſhing, beſides hunting and ſhooting; for every body is at liberty to purſue the game, eſpecially in the mountains, where every peaſant may make uſe of what arms he pleaſes.</p>

                     <p>THEIR houſes are, in general, built of fir and pine-trees, the whole trunks of which are only chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped even to make them lie cloſe, and then laid one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, and faſtened with mortices at the corners. Theſe trunks are left round as they grew, both on the inſide and outſide of the houſes, and are frequently boarded over and painted, eſpecially in the trading towns, which gives them a genteel appearance.</p>
                     <p>In the country villages the houſes are built at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from each other, with their fields and grounds
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:031692_0573_0FEE765243AF2550"/>
about them. The ſtore-houſe for the proviſions is generally at a diſtance from the dwelling-houſe, for fear of fire, and placed high upon poles, to keep the proviſions dry and preſerve them from mice and all kinds of vermin. The kitchen ſtands alſo ſeparate, as do the barns, hay-loft, cow-houſes, ſtables, and the like. A farm has likewiſe commonly a mill belonging to it, ſituated by ſome rivulet, beſides a ſmith's forge; for every farmer, as hath been obſerved, is his own ſmith. Up the country, where timber for building is but of little value, there is many a farm-houſe as large as a nobleman's ſeat. It is frequently two ſtories high, and has a raiſed balcony in the front. The additional building reſemble a little village. The common farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes have, however, only the ground-floor, and no other window but a ſquare hole in the wall, which is left open in ſummer; but in winter, or in wet weather, is filled up with a wooden frame, covered with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward membrane of ſome animal. This is very ſtrong, and as tranſparent as a bladder. This hole, which is as high as it can be placed, alſo anſwers the purpoſe of a chimney, by ſerving to let out the ſmoke.</p>
                     <p>Under the light hole generally ſtands a long thick table, with benches of the ſame wood, and at the upper end is the high ſeat which belongs to the maſter only.

                     <p>AMONG the animals we ſhall begin with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which are better for riding than drawing. Their walk is eaſy, they are full of ſpirit, and are very ſure footed. When they mount or deſcend a ſteep cliff, on ſtones like ſteps, they firſt tread gently with one foot, to try if the ſtone they touch be faſt; and in this they muſt be left to themſelves, or the beſt rider will run the riſk of his neck. But when they are to go down a very ſteep and ſlippery place, they, in a ſurpriſing manner draw their hind legs together under them, and ſlide down. They ſhew a great deal of courage in fighting with the wolves and bears, which they are often oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do; for when the horſe perceives any of them near him, and has a mare or gelding with him, he places them behind him, attacks his antagoniſt by ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:031692_0575_0FEE7657CCD078C8"/>
at him with his fore-legs, and uſually comes off conqueror.</p>
                     <p>The Norway cows are generally of a yallow colour, as are alſo the horſes. They are ſmall, but their fleſh is fine grained, juicy, and well taſted.</p>
                     <p>The ſheep here are ſmall, and reſemble thoſe of Denmark. The goats, in many places, run wild, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſummer, in the fields, till they are ten or twelve years old; and when the peaſant, who owns them, is to catch them, he muſt either do it by ſome ſnare or ſhoot them. They are ſo bold, that if a wolf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches them, they ſtay to receive him, and if they have dogs with them, they will reſiſt a whole herd. They frequently attack the ſnakes, and when they are bit by them, not only kill their antagoniſts, but eat them: after which they are never known to die of the bite, though they are ill for ſeveral days. The own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er warms their own milk, and waſhes the ſore with it.</p>
                     <p>Near Roſtad, is a flat and naked field on which no vegetable will grow. The ſoil is almoſt white, with grey ſtripes, and has ſomewhat of ſo peculiarly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous nature, that though all other animals may ſafely paſs over it, a goat or a kid no ſooner ſets its foot upon it, than it drops down, ſtretches out its leg, its, tongue hangs out of its mouth, and it expires if it has not inſtant help.</p>
                     <p>There are a few hogs in Norway, and not many
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:031692_0576_0FEE7659537C0598"/>
of the common deer; but the hares, which in the cold ſeaſon change from brown or grey to a ſnow white are very cheap in winter.</p>
                     <p>The hurtful beaſts are the bears and wolves, the lynx, vaſt numbers of white, red and black foxes, and the glutton, a creature which few other countries know any otherwiſe than by report. This animal receives its name from its voracious appetite. In ſize and ſhape <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e has ſome reſemblance to a long-bodied dog, with thick legs, ſharp claws and teeth. His colour is black, variegated with brown and yallowiſh ſtreaks. He has the boldneſs to attack every beaſt he can poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; and if he finds a carcaſe ſix times as big as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he does not leave off eating as long as there is a mouthful left. When thus gorged, he preſſes and ſqueezes himſelf between two trees that ſtand near to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and thus empties himſelf of what he has not time to digeſt. As his ſkin ſhines like damaſk, and is covered with ſoft hair, it is very precious. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well worth the huntſman's while to kill him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding his ſkin, which is done by ſhooting him with a bow and blunt arrows.</p>
                     <p>The marten is alſo hunted on account of its ſkin, as are likewiſe the ſquirrel and the ermine, both of which are therefore ſhot with blunt arrows. I am in doubt whether the ermine be different in kind from the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh weaſel. Its valuable ſkin is of a beautiful white,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:031692_0577_0FEE765AD9C8F7A8"/>
and it has a black ſpot on the tail. The ermines run after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As to the reptiles, there are neither land-ſnakes nor toads beyond the temperate zone; and even thoſe ſnakes on the extremities of the temperate climate, are leſs poiſonous than in more ſouthern countries. Lizards are here of various colours, as brown, green, and ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thoſe that are green are found in the fields, and the others in the cracks and holes of rocks.</p>
                     <p>Among the fowls are moſt of thoſe ſeen in the weſt of Europe, and ſome that ſeem peculiar to this country; of which laſt, the moſt remarkable is the farncolin, an excellent land bird, which ſerves the Norwegians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the pheaſant, its fleſh being white, firm, and of a delicious taſte.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, there are here ſuch incredible numbers of ſea and land fowls near the rocks on the ſea-ſhore, that they ſometimes obſcure the ſight of the heavens for many miles out at ſea; ſo that one would imagine all the fowls of the univerſe were gathered together in one flock.</p>

Setting out early in the morning, we took with us ſome cloth and tobacco to trade with, and ſalt beef and pork for our proviſions. We engaged three of the inhabitants of Varanger to attend us, both to ſhew us the way, and to help to carry our goods and proviſions to the next village. We followed them through woods, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and valleys, without meeting any living creature, till about four o'clock in the afternoon, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two white bears of a prodigious ſize approach, as we thought, to devour us; but our guides obſerving the terror we were in, bid us not be afraid, but only to have our arms ready for defence, in caſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached too near us.

As we were deſcending a mountain about an hour before night, we perceived at the foot of it a dozen houſes at a conſiderable diſtance from each other, and a little beyond them a heard of beaſts like ſtags, which our guides told us were rein-deer. On our arrival at the village, our guides conducted us to a hut, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very weary, we were glad to reſt ourſelves; for we had made a long journey in a very bad way, with our luggage on our backs, which tired and encumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.</p>
                     <p>We preſented our hoſt with a piece of roll tobacco, and he received it with extraordinary joy, aſſuring us, he had not had ſo valuable a preſent in nine months before; and in return he brought out his brandy bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſome rein-deer's fleſh dreſſed without ſalting, and ſome dried fiſh, which we gave to our guides, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ourſelves upon the proviſions we had brought with us.

                     <p>In the morning we aſked our hoſt if he had nothing to barter with us for cloth and tobacco. To which he anſwered, that he had ſome ſkins of wolves, foxes, and white ſqurrils, and that his neighbours had ſome of the ſame commodities, which they would gladly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with us. We bid him, by our interpreters, bring out his ſkins; and if he had any clothes made of

after having firſt paid them in tobacco for their trouble. We then put on our Lapland clothes, and each of us lying down in his ſledge, was covered with a bear's ſkin. At the back of the ſledge were two girths made of rein-deer's ſkin leather, in which we thruſt our arms up to the ſhoulders to keep ourſelves ſteady; and we had each a ſtick with a ſtrong ferrel, in order to ſupport the ſledge, if it ſhould be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of overturning againſt the ſtumps of trees, or ſtones lying in the way.</p>
                     <p>We were no ſooner ready to ſet out, than our hoſt muttered ſome words in the ear of the rein-deer; and when I afterwards enquired of the guide what he ment by it, he gravely replied with the utmoſt ſimplicity, that it was to tell them whither they ſhould carry us. Cuſtom, however, had made this muttering ſo familiar to them, that when our hoſt had gone to all the ſix, they ſet off with amazing ſwiftneſs, and continued their pace over hills and dales without keeping any beaten path, till ſeven o'clock in the evening; when they brought us to a lage village ſituated between two mountains, on the borders of a great lake. Stopping at the fourth houſe in the place, and beating the ground with their feet, the maſter of the houſe came with ſome of his ſervants to take us out of the ſledges, and unhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs our cattle, one of them bringing out a little juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per can filled with brandy, of which he gave each of us
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:031692_0582_0FEE766792D29698"/>
a brimmer out of a larger veſſel that was alſo made of juniper wood. This it ſeems was to revive our ſpirits, our guide having informed him, that we were frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened at our being drawn ſo ſwiftly by theſe animals, having never been uſed to that way of travelling.</p>
                     <p>The rein-deer is of the colour of the ſtag, and is not much bigger. The horns of this animal are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher than thoſe of the ſtag, but more crooked, hairy, and not ſo well furniſhed with branches. Of the milk of the females they make good butter and cheeſe. Theſe animals, indeed, conſtitute the greateſt, and almoſt the only riches of the Finlaplanders. In Finmark, thare are vaſt numbers of them both wild and tame, and many a man there has from ſix or eight hundred to a thouſand of theſe uſeful creatures which never come under cover. They follow him wherever he is pleaſed to ramble, and, when they are put to a ſledge, tranſport his goods from one place to another. They provide for themſelves, and live chiefly on moſs, and on the buds and leaves of trees. They ſupport themſelves on very little nouriſhment, and are neat, clean, and entertaining creatures.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that when the rein-deer ſheds his horns, and others riſe in their ſtead, they appear at firſt covered with a ſkin; and till they are of a finger's length, are ſo ſoft, that they may be cut with a knife like a ſauſage, and are delicate eating even raw; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:031692_0583_0FEE766D1E5814E8"/>
the huntſmen, when far outin the country, and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of food, eat them, and find that they ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy both their hunger and thirſt. When the horn grows bigger, there breeds within the ſkin a worm which eats away the root.</p>
                     <p>The rein-deer has over his eye-lids a kind of ſkin, through which he peeps, when otherwiſe, in the hard ſhows, he would be obliged to ſhut his eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; a ſingular inſtance of the benevolence of the great Creator, in providing for the wants of each crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to its deſtined manner of living.</p>
                     <p>When we got out of our ſledges, our hoſt conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us into his hut, which, like the reſt of the cottages in the place, was very ſmall, low, and covered with the bark of trees, the light entering in at a hole at the top. The people here were clothed much like thoſe of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranger, their apparel being of the ſame materials and make, but longer. The women were alſo dreſſed in rein-deer ſkins, with the hair outwards.</p>
                     <p>We gave our hoſt a piece of our roll tobacco, about two inches long, with which he was highly pleaſed, and in the moſt hearty manner returned us his thanks. We alſo gave a piece, not quite ſo long, to each of the inhabitants of the place to make them our friends, and the better to ſecure ourſelves againſt their attempts; for they ſeemed more uncivilized than thoſe we laſt dealt with. We again ſupped on the proviſions we had
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:031692_0584_0FEE76702B923490"/>
brought with us, and our guide ate ſome of our hoſt's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>OUR landlord aſked us whether we would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him to the funeral of one of his neighbours who had been dead about four hours. We were glad of this opportunity of ſeeing their funeral ceremony, and therefore went with him to the houſe of the deceaſed; when we ſaw the corpſe taken from the bear's ſkins on which it lay, and removed into a wooden coffin, by ſix of his moſt intimate friends, the body being firſt wrapped in linen, and the face and hands only left bare. In one hand they put a purſe with money in it, to pay the fee of the porter of the gate of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

St. Peter, to certify that he was a good Chriſtian, and ought to be admitted into heaven. At the head of the coffin was placed a picture of St. Nicholas, who was one of the ſeven deacons mentioned in the Acts of the Apoſtles, a Saint greatly reverenced in all parts of Muſcovy, where he is ſuppoſed to be a particular friend of the dead. On which account his picture is always fixed near a corpſe, inſtead of a crucifix. He is repreſented in a pilgrim's habit, with a long robe, a broad girdle about his waiſt, and a ſtaff in his hand.</p>
                     <p>They alſo put into the coffin a rundlet of brandy, ſome dried fiſh and rein-deer veniſon to ſupport the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed on his journey. They then lighted ſome fir-tree roots, piled up at a convenient diſtance from the coffin, wept, howled, and made a variety of ſtrange geſtures, aſſuming a thouſand different attitudes to ſhew the extravagance of their ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>When this noiſe and theſe geſticulations were over, they marched round the corpſe ſeveral times in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, aſking the deceaſed why he died? Whether he was angry with his wife? Whether he ſtood in need of meat, drink, or clothes? Whether he had not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when fiſhing, or had loſt his game when hunting? They then reſumed their howling, and ſtampted with all the ſigns of diſtraction.</p>

ſprinkled holy water upon the corpſe, as did all the mourners.</p>
                     <p>Being now almoſt deafened with noiſe, and wearied with looking on theſe barbarous rites, we left our landlord behind us, and returned to his cottage, where we found his wife at home. She had made a ſally from the place in which her huſband had confined her on our arrival, and no ſooner ſaw us, than ſuppoſing he was in our company, would have retired to her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but our interpreter letting her know that the goodman was at the funeral, and would not return for ſome time, ſhe ſtaid and viewed us all round, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, drew her ſeat near us, and ſhewed us a bonnet of her own embroidering, very curiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with tinſel thread. The wives of the Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Laplanders make clothes for themſelves, their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and their children, and at the edges they are all embroidered with that thread. She was handſome, well ſhaped, and appeared to be good-humoured, and well pleaſed with us.</p>
                     <p>While our hoſt was buſied about the funeral, we pulled out ſome of our proviſions, and gave our landlady ſome of every ſort to taſte. She liked them all, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the gingerbread; but having drank two or three glaſſes of brandy, withdrew to her place of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for fear of her huſband's return.

When he came home, he obliged us to take a cup or two more, to ſmoke a pipe, and to ſup with him; for he brought ſuch proviſions as he thought would be moſt grateful to our palates, particularly ſalt but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we eat with bread; and as our guide would not taſte any thing that was ſalt, he got him ſome dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fiſh, and ſome bear's fleſh, which he broiled on the coals.</p>
                     <p>All the cottages in this village were, like thoſe we had obſerved in other places, built of wood and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with turf, but they were handſomer than any we had yet ſeen, being both within and without adorned with fiſh bones, curiouſly inlaid.</p>

                     <head>SECT. XCIX. ON THE INTENSE COLD EXPERIENCED BY SOME GENTLEMEN, SENT BY THE KING OF FRANCE, TO DETERMINE THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH AT THE POLAR CIRCLE.</head>
                     <p>IN order to aſcertain the diſtance between the two ſignals we had erected laſt ſummer, we were under the neceſſity of being upon the ice of a river in Lapland, at the diſtance of above three leagues in a country where the cold was growing every day more intenſe. On the twenty-firſt of December this work was begun. In this ſeaſon the ſun but juſt ſhewed itſelf above the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon towards noon; but the long twilights, the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſnow, and the meteors continually blazing in the ſky, furniſhed us light enough to work four or five hours every day.</p>
                     <p>We lodged at the houſe of the Curate of Oſwer-Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, and at eleven in the forenoon began our ſurvey, attended by ſo great an equipage, that the Laplanders, drawn by the novelty of the ſight, came down from the neighbouring mountains. We ſeparated into two
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:031692_0589_0FEE768549E72418"/>
bands, each of which carried our rods of fir, each thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feet long. I ſhall ſay nothing of the fatigues and dangers of this operation. Judge what it muſt be to walk in ſnow two feet deep, with heavy poles in our hands which we were obliged to be continually laying on the ſnow, and lifting again,—in a cold ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, that whenever we would taſte a little brandy, the only thing that could be kept liquid, our tongues and lips froze to the cup, and came away bloody;—in a cold that congealed the fingers of ſome of us, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with ſtill more diſmal accidents. While the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of our bodies were thus freezing, the reſt, through exceſſive toil, was bathed in ſweat. Brandy did not quench our thirſt; we muſt have recourſe to deep wells dug through the ice, which were ſhut almoſt as ſoon as opened, and from which the water could ſcarcely be conveyed unfrozen to our lips. Thus were we forced to run the hazard of the dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt which ice-water might produce in our heated bodies.</p>
                     <p>Our work however advanced apace; for ſix days labour brought it to within about five hundred toiſes, where we had not been able to plant our ſtakes ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Three of the Gentlemen therefore undertook this office, while the Abb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Outhier and I went upon a pretty extraordinary adventure.</p>
                     <p>We had laſt ſummer omitted an obſervation of ſmall
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:031692_0590_0FEE7688112B5708"/>
moment. This was taking the height of an object that we made uſe of in meaſuring the top of Avaſaxa: and to perform this, I undertook to go with a quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the top of the mountain, ſo ſcrupulouſly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful were we that nothing ſhould be wanting to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the work. Imagine a very high mountain, full of rocks, that lie hid in a prodigious quantity of ſnow, as well as their cavities, wherein you may ſink into a cruſt of ſnow as into an abyſs, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking will ſcarce appear poſſible. Yet there are two ways of performing it; one by walking, or rather ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding along upon two ſtrait boards, eight feet in length, which the Finlanders and Laplanders uſe to keep them from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inking into the ſnow. But this way of walking requires long practice. The other is by truſting your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a rein-deer uſed to ſuch journeys.</p>
                     <p>This firſt part of our journey was performed in a moment; for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>light over the plain beaten road from the curate's houſe to the foot of the mountain can be compared only to that of birds. And though the mountain, where there was no track, greatly abated the ſpeed of our rein-deer, they got at length to the top of it, where we immediately made the obſervation for which we came. In the mean while our rein-deer had dug deep holes in the ſnow, where they browzed on the moſs that covers the rocks; and the Laplanders had lighted a great fire, and we preſently joined them to
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:031692_0591_0FEE768C1FDC76B0"/>
warm ourſelves. The cold was ſo extreme, that the heat of the fire could reach only to a very ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As the ſnow juſt by it melted, it was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately froze again, forming a hearth of ice all round.</p>
                     <p>Our journey up hill had been painful; but now our concern was leſt our return ſhould be too rapid. We were to proceed down the ſteep in conveyances, which though partly ſunk in the ſnow, ſlid on notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drawn by animals, whoſe fury in the plain we had already tried, and who, though ſinking to their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the ſnow, would endeavour to free themſelves by the ſwiftneſs of their flight. We very ſoon found ourſelves at the bottom of the hill. The next day we finiſhed our ſurvey, and made all poſſible haſte back to Tornea, to ſecure ourſelves in the beſt manner we were able from the increaſing ſeverity of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>The town of Tornea, at our arrival on the 30th of December, had really a moſt frightful aſpect. Its little houſes were buried to the tops in ſnow, which, had there been any day-light, muſt have effectually ſhut it out. But the ſnow continually falling, or ready to fall for the moſt part hid the ſun the few moments he might have appeared at mid-day.</p>
                     <p>In the month of January the cold was increaſed to that extremity, that Mr. Reaumur's mercurial thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters, which at Paris, in the great froſt of 1709, it
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:031692_0592_0FEE7690307A6298"/>
was thought ſtrange to ſee fall to 14 degrees below the freezing point, were now got down to 37. The ſpirit of wine in the others was frozen. If we opened the door of a warm room, the external air inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted all the vapour in it into ſnow, whirling it round in while vortexes. If we went abroad, we felt as if the air was tearing our breaſts in pieces; and the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wood, of which the houſes are built, as if it ſplit by the violence of the froſt, continually alarmed us with an increaſe of cold. The ſolitude of the ſtreets was as great as if the people had been all dead. In this country you may often ſee people who have loſt an arm or a leg by the froſt. The cold, which is always very great, ſometimes increaſes by ſuch violent and ſudden fits, as are almoſt infallibly fatal to thoſe who are ſo unhappy as to be expoſed to it; and ſometimes there riſe ſudden tempeſts of ſnow, which are ſtill more dangerous.</p>
                     <p>The winds ſeem to blow from all quarters at once, and drive about the ſnow with ſuch fury, that all the roads are in a moment rendered inviſible. Dreadful is the ſituation of a perſon ſurpriſed in the fields by ſuch a ſtorm. His knowledge of the country, and even the mark he may have taken by the trees, cannot avail him. He is blinded by the ſnow; and if he attempts to find his way home, is generally loſt.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, during the whole winter the cold was ſo
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:031692_0593_0FEE7691DE349AE0"/>
exceſſive, that on the 7th of April, at five in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the thermometer was fallen to twenty diviſions below the point of freezing, though every afternoon it roſe two or three diviſions above it; a difference in the height not much leſs than that which the greateſt heat and cold felt at Paris uſually produce in that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus, in the ſpace of twenty-four hours, we had all the variety felt in the temparate zones in the compaſs of a whole year.</p>

Their ſummits approach each other, and the diſtance of their extremities widens towards the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.

Sometimes they line a part of the ſky with ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</p>
                     <p>On the 18th of December, I ſaw a phaenomenon of this kind, that in the midſt of all the wonders to which I was now every day accuſtomed, raiſed my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To the ſouth a great ſpace of the ſky appeared tinged with ſo lively a red, that the whole conſtellation of Orion looked as if it had been dipped in blood. This light, which was at firſt fixed, ſoon moved, and changing into other colours, violet and blue, ſettled into a dome, whoſe top ſtood a little to the ſouth-weſt of the zenith. The moon ſhone bright, but did not in the leaſt efface it.</p>
                     <p>In this country, where there are lights of ſo many different colours, I never ſaw but two that were red; and ſuch are taken for preſages of ſome great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. After all, when people gaze at theſe phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na with an unphiloſophic eye, it is not ſurpriſing if they diſcover in them armies engaged, fiery chariots, and a thouſand other prodigies.</p>
                     <p>During the winter we repeated many of our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and calculations, and found the moſt evident proofs of the earth's being flatted at the poles. Mean time the ſun came nearer, or rather no more quitted us. It was now May, when it was curious enough to ſee that great luminary enlighten for ſo long a time a whole horizon of ice, and to ſee ſummer in the heavens,

At length, on the 10th, the earth which had been ſo long hid, began to appear; ſome high points that were expoſed to the ſun ſhowed themſelves, as the tops of the mountains did after the deluge, and all the fowls of the country returned.

                     <head>SECT. CI. OF ST. ANDREWS IN SCOTLAND.</head>
                     <p>I HAD deſired to viſit the Hebrides, or Weſtern Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands of Scotland ſo long, that I ſcarcely remember how the wiſh was originally excited; and was in the Autumn of the year 1773 induced to undertake the journey, by finding in Mr. Boſwell a companion, whoſe accuteneſs would help my enquiry, and whoſe gaiety of converſation and civility of manners are ſufficient to counteract the inconveniences of travel, in countries leſs hoſpitable than we have paſſed.</p>
                     <p>On the 18th of Auguſt we left Edinburgh, a city too well known to admit deſcription, and directed our courſe northward, along the eaſtern coaſt of Scotland, accompanied the firſt day by another gentleman, who could ſtay with us only long enough to ſhow us how much we loſt at ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>As we croſſed the Frith of Fourth, our curioſity was attracted by <hi>Inch Keith,</hi> a ſmall iſland, which neither of my companions had ever viſited, though, lying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their view, it had all their lives ſolicited their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Here, by climbing with ſome difficulty over
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:031692_0598_0FEE769C26774E28"/>
ſhattered crags, we made the firſt experiment of unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented coaſts. Inch Kieth is nothing more than a rock covered with a thin layer of earth, not wholly bare of graſs, and very fertile of thiſtles. A ſmall herd of cows graze annually upon it in the ſummer. It ſeems never to have afforded to man or beaſt a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent habitation.</p>
                     <p>We left this little iſland with our thoughts employed a while on the different appearance that it would have made if it had been placed at the ſame diſtance from London, with the ſame facility of appoach; with what emulation of price a few rocky acres would have been purchaſed, and with what expenſive induſtry they would have been cultivated and adorned.</p>
                     <p>When we landed, we found our chaiſe ready, and paſſed throug <hi>Kinghorn, Kirkaldy,</hi> and <hi>Cowpar,</hi> places not unlike the ſmall trading market-towns in thoſe parts of England where commerce and manufactures have not yet produced opulence.</p>
                     <p>Though we were yet in the moſt populous part of Scotland, and at ſo ſmall a diſtance from the capital, we met few paſſengers.</p>
                     <p>The roads are neither rough nor dirty; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>At an hour ſomewhat late, we came to St. Andrews,
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:031692_0599_0FEE769F10F8D940"/>
a city once archiepiſcopal; where that univerſity ſtill ſubſiſts in which philoſophy was formerly taught by Buchanan, whoſe name has as fair a claim to immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as can be conferred by modern latinity, and perhaps a fairer than the inſtability of vernacular languages ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</p>
                     <p>We found, that by the interpoſition of ſome inviſible friend, lodgings had been provided for us at the houſe of one of the profeſſors, whoſe eaſy civility quickly made us forget that we were ſtrangers; and in the whole time of our ſtay we were gratified by every mode of kindneſs, and entertained with all the elegance of lettered hoſpitality.</p>
                     <p>In the morning we aroſe to perambulate a city, which only hiſtory ſhows to have once flouriſhed, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the ruins of ancient magnificence, of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ruins cannot long be viſible, unleſs ſome care be taken to preſerve them; and where is the pleaſure of preſerving ſuch mournful memorials? They have been, till very lately, ſo much neglected, that every man carried away the ſtones who fancied that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
                     <p>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, of which the foundation may be ſtill traced, and a ſmall part of the wall is ſtanding, appears to have been a ſpacious and majeſtic building, and not unſuitable to the primacy of the kingdom. Of the architecture, the poor remains can hardly exhibit,

even to an artiſt, a ſufficient ſpecimen. It was demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, it is well known, in the tumult and violence of Knox's reformation.</p>
                     <p>Not far from the Cathedral, on the margin of the water, ſtands a fragment of the caſtle, in which the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop anciently reſided.

                     <p>The city of St. Andrews, when it had loſt its archiepiſcopal
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:031692_0601_0FEE76A36A7629B8"/>
pre-eminence, gradually decayed. One of its ſtreets is now loſt; and in thoſe that remain, there is the ſilence and ſolitude of inactive indigence and gloomy depopulation.</p>
                     <p>The univerſity, within a few years, conſiſted of three colleges, but is now reduced to two; the college of St. Leonard being lately diſſolved by the ſale of its buildings and the appropriation of its revenues to the profeſſors of the two others. The chapel of the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted college is yet ſtanding, a fabric not inelegant of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtructure; but I was always, by ſome civil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, hindered from entering it. A decent attempt, as I was ſince told, has been made to convert it into a kind of green houſe, by planting its area with ſhrubs. This new method of gardening is unſucceſsful: the plants do not hitherto proſper. To what uſe it will next be put, I have no pleaſure in conjecturing. It is ſomething that its preſent ſtate is at leaſt not oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiouſly diſplayed. Where there is yet ſhame, there may in time be virtue.</p>
                     <p>The diſſolution of St. Leonard's College was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of that neceſſity there is reaſon to complain. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> is ſurely not without juſt reproach, that a nation, of which the commerce is hourly extending and the wealth increaſing, denies any participation of its proſperity to its literary ſocieties; and while its
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:031692_0602_0FEE76A4F01A0E70"/>
merchants or its nobles are raiſing palaces, ſuffers its univerſities to moulder into duſt.</p>
                     <p>Of the two colleges yet ſtanding, one is by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of its founder appropriated to divinity. It is ſaid to be capable of containing fifty ſtudents; but more than one muſt occupy a chamber. The library, which is of late erection, is not very ſpacious, but ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and luminous.</p>
                     <p>The doctor, by whom it was ſhown, hoped to irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate or ſubdue my Engliſh vanity, by telling me, that we had no ſuch repoſitory of books in England.</p>
                     <p>St. Andrews ſeems to be a place eminently adapted to ſtudy and education, being ſituated in a populous, yet a cheap country, and expoſing the minds and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of young men neither to the levity and diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a capital city, nor to the groſs luxury of a town of commerce, places naturally unpropitious to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In one the deſire of knowledge eaſily gives way to the love of pleaſure, and in the other, is in danger of yielding to the love of money.</p>
                     <p>The ſtudents however are repreſented as at this time not exceeding a hundred. Perhaps it may be ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to their increaſe, that there is no Epiſcopal chapel in the place. I ſaw no reaſon for imputing their paucity to the preſent profeſſors; nor can the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of an academical education be very reaſonably objected. A ſtudent of the higheſt claſs may keep his
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:031692_0603_0FEE76A90AC2C6A8"/>
annual ſeſſion, or as the Engliſh call it, his term, which laſts ſeven months, for about fifteen pounds, and one of lower rank for leſs than ten; in which board, lodging, and inſtruction are all included.</p>
                     <p>The chief magiſtrate reſident in the univerſity, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to our vice-chancellor, and to the <hi>rector magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficus</hi> on the continent, had commonly the title of Lord Rector; but being addreſſed only as <hi>Mr. Rector</hi> in an inauguratory ſpeech by the preſent chancellor, he has fallen from his former dignity of ſtyle. Lordſhip was very liberally annexed by our anceſtors to any ſtation or character of dignity. They ſaid, the <hi>Lord General</hi> and <hi>Lord Ambaſſador;</hi> ſo we ſtill ſay, <hi>my Lord,</hi> to the judge upon the circuit, and yet retain in our Liturgy <hi>the Lords of the Council.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In walking among the ruins of religious buildings, we came to two vaults, over which had formerly ſtood the houſe of the ſub-prior. One of the vaults was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by an old woman, who claimed the right of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode there, and the widow of a man whoſe anceſtors had poſſeſſed the ſame gloomy manſion for no leſs than four generations. The right, however it begun, was conſidered as eſtabliſhed by legal preſcription, and the old woman lives undiſturbed. She thinks however that ſhe has a claim to ſomething more than ſufferance; for as her huſband's name was Bruce, ſhe is allied to royality, and told Mr. Boſwell, that when there were
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:031692_0604_0FEE76AA91452480"/>
perſons of quality in the place, ſhe was diſtinguſhed by ſome notice; that indeed ſhe is now neglected, but ſhe ſpins a thread, has the company of her cat, and is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to nobody.</p>
                     <p>Having now ſeen whatever this ancient city offered to our curioſity, we left it with good wiſhes, having reaſon to be highly pleaſed with the attention that was paid us. But whoever ſurveys the world muſt ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that give him pain. The kindneſs of the profeſſors did not contribute to abate the uneaſy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of an univerſity declining, a college alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and a church profaned and haſtening to the ground.</p>
                     <p>St. Andrews indeed has formerly ſuffered more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious ravages and more extenſive deſtruction; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent evils affect with greater force. We were reconciled to the ſight of archiepiſcopal ruins. The diſtance of a calamity from the preſent time ſeems to preclude the mind from contract or ſympathy. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents long paſt are barely known; they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. We read with as little emotion the violence of Knox and his followers, as the irruptions of Alaric and the Goths. Had the univerſity been deſtroyed two centuries ago, we ſhould not have regretted it; but to ſee it pining in decay and ſtruggling for life, fills the mind with mournful images and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wiſhes.</p>

                     <head>SECT. CII. OF INVERNESS.</head>
                     <p>INVERNES may properly be called the capital of the Highlands. Hither the inhabitants of the inland parts come to be ſupplied with what they cannot make for themſelves. Hither the young nymphs of, the mountains and valleys are ſent for education, and as far as my obſervation has reached are not ſent in vain.</p>
                     <p>Inverneſs was the laſt place which had a regular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by high roads with the ſouthern counties. All the ways beyond it have, I believe, been made by the ſoldiers in this century. At Inverneſs therefore Cromwell, when he ſubdued Scotland, ſtationed a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, as at the boundary of the Highlands. The ſoldiers ſeem to have incorporated afterwards with the inhabitants, and to have peopled the place with an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh race; for the language of this town has been long conſidered as particularly elegant.</p>
                     <p>Here is a caſtle, called the caſtle of Macbeth, the walls of which are yet ſtanding. It was no very capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious edifice, but ſtands upon a rock ſo high and ſteep, that I think it was once not acceſſible, but by the
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:031692_0606_0FEE76B16838A568"/>
help of ladders or a bridge. Oppoſite to it, on anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hill, was a fort built by Cromwell, now totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed; for no faction of Scotland loved the name of Cromwell, or had any deſire to continue his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p>Yet what the Romans did to other nations, was in a great degree done by Cromwell to the Scots. He civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized them by conqueſt, and introduced by uſeful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the arts of peace. I was told at Aberdeen, that the people learned from Cromwell's ſoldiers to make ſhoes and to plant kail.</p>
                     <p>How they lived without kail, it is not eaſy to gueſs. They cultivated hardly any other plant for common tables, and when they had not kail, they probably had nothing. The numbers that go barefoot are ſtill ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhow that ſhoes may be ſpared. They are not yet conſidered as neceſſaries of life; for tall boys, not otherwiſe meanly dreſſed, run without them in the ſtreets and in the iſlands. The ſons of gentlemen paſs ſeveral of the firſt years with naked feet.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether it be not peculiar to the Scots to have attained the liberal, without the manual arts; to have excelled in ornamental knowledge, and to have wanted not only the elegancies, but the conveniencies of common life. Literature ſoon after its revival found its way to Scotland, and from the middle of the ſixteenth century, almoſt to the middle of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:031692_0607_0FEE76BB0C290D68"/>
the politer ſtudies were very dilligently purſued. The Latin poetry of <hi>Delici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Poetorum Scotorum</hi> would have done honour to any nation; at leaſt till the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of <hi>May's Supplement,</hi> the Engliſh had very little to oppoſe.</p>
                     <p>Yet men thus ingenious and inquiſitive were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live in total ignorance of the trade by which human wants are ſupplied, and to ſupply them by the groſſeſt means. Till the Union made them acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Engliſh manners, the culture of their lands was unſkilful, and their domeſtic life uninformed.</p>
                     <p>Since they have known that their condition was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of improvement, their progreſs in uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge has been rapid and uniform. What remains to be done they will quickly do, and then wonder, like me, why that which was ſo neceſſary and ſo eaſy was ſo long delayed. But they muſt be forever content to owe to the Engliſh that elegance and culture, which, if they had been vigilant and active, perhaps the Engliſh might have owed to them.</p>
                     <p>Here the appearance of life began to alter. I had ſeen a few women with plaids at Aberdeen; but at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs, the Highland manners are common. There is I think a kirk, in which only the erſe language is uſed. There is likewiſe an Engliſh chapel, but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built, where on Sunday we ſaw a very decent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="285" facs="unknown:031692_0608_0FEE76C0BA98C350"/>
We were now to bid farewell to the luxury of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, and to enter a country upon which perhaps no wheel has ever rolled. We could indeed have uſed our poſt-chaiſe one day longer, along the military road to fort Auguſtus, but we could have hired no horſes beyond Inverneſs, and we were not ſo ſparing of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to lead them, merely that we might have one day longer the indulgence of a carriage. At Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therefore we procured three horſes for ourſelves and a ſervant and one more for our baggage, which was no very heavy load. We found in the courſe of our journey the convenience of having diſencumbered ourſelves, by laying aſide whatever we could ſpare; for it is not to be imagined without experience, how in climbing crags, and treading bogs, and winding through narrow and obſtructed paſſages, a little bulk will hinder, and a little weight will burden; or how often a man that has pleaſed himſelf at home with his own reſolution, will, in the hour of darkneſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, be content to leave behind him every thing but himſelf.</p>
                     <p>We took two Highlanders to turn beſide us, partly to ſhow us the way, and partly to take back from the ſea-ſide the horſes, of which they were the owners. One of them was a man of great livelineſs and activity, of whom his companion ſaid, that he would tire any horſe in Inverneſs. Both of them were civil and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-handed.
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:031692_0609_0FEE76C4EA0A96A8"/>
Civility ſeems part of the national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rcter of the Highlanders. Every chieftain is a monarch, and politeneſs, the natural product of royal gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, is diffuſed from the laird through the whole clan. But they are not commonly dextrous. Their narrowneſs of life confines them to a few operations, and they are accuſtomed to endure little wants more than to remove them.</p>
                     <p>We mounted our ſteeds on the thirteenth of Auguſt, and directed our guides to conduct us to Fort Auguſtus. It is built at the head of Lough Neſs, of which Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtands at the outlet. The way between them has been cut by the ſoldiers, and the greater part of it runs along a rock, levelled with great labour and exactneſs near the water-ſide.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of this day's journey was very pleaſant. The day, though bright, was not hot; and the appearance of the country, if I had not ſeen the Peak, would have been wholly new. We went upon a ſurface ſo hard and level, that we had little care to hold the bridle, and were therefore at full leiſure for contemplation. On the left were high and ſteep rocks ſhaded with birch, the hardy native of the North, and covered with fern or heath. On the right the limped waters of Lough Neſs were beating their bank, and waving their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face by a gentle agitation. Beyond them were rocks ſometimes covered with verdure, and ſometimes tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:031692_0610_0FEE76C9231BDE88"/>
in horrid nakedneſs. Now and then we eſpied a little corn-field, which ſerved to impreſs more ſtrongly the general barrenneſs.</p>
                     <p>Lough Neſs is about twenty-four miles long, and from one to two miles abroad. It is remarkable that Boethius, in his deſcription of Scotland, gives it twelve miles of breadth. When hiſtorians or geographers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit falſe accounts of places far diſtant, they may be forgiven, becauſe they can tell but what they are told; and that their accounts exceed the truth may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed, becauſe moſt men exaggerate to others, if not to themſelves. But Boethius lived at no great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. If he never ſaw the lake he muſt have been very incurious, and if he had ſeen it, his veracity yielded to very ſlight temptations.</p>
                     <p>Lough Neſs, though not twelve miles abroad, is a very remarkable diffuſſion of water without iſlands. It fills a large hollow between two ridges of high rocks, being ſupplyed partly by the torrents which fall into it on either ſide, and partly, as is ſuppoſed, by ſprings at the bottom. Its water is remarkably clear and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and is imagined by the natives to be medicinal. We were told, that it is in ſome places one hundred and forty fathoms deep, a profundity ſcarcely credible, and which probably thoſe that relate it have never ſounded. Its fiſh are ſalmon, trout, and pike.</p>
                     <p>It was ſaid at Fort Auguſtus, that Lough Neſs is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:031692_0611_0FEE76CD51744300"/>
in the hardeſt winters, thoug a lake not far from it is covered with ice. In diſcuſſing theſe exceptions from the courſe of nature, the firſt queſtion is whether the fact be juſtly ſtated. That which is ſtrange is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, and a pleaſing error is not willingly detected. Accuracy of narration is not very common, and there are few ſo rigidly philoſophical as not to repreſent as perpetual what is only frequent, or as conſtant, what is really caſual. If it be true that Lough Neſs never freezes, it is either ſheltered by its high banks from the cold blaſts and expoſed only to thoſe winds which have more power to agitate than congeal: or it is kept in perpetual motion by the ruſh of ſtreams from the rocks that incloſe it. Its profundity, though it ſhould be ſuch as is repreſented, can have little part in this exemption; for though deep wells are not frozen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their waters are excluded from the external air, yet where a wide ſurface is expoſed to the full influence of a freezing atmoſphere, I know not why the depth ſhould keep it open.

                     <p>The road on which we travelled, and which was itſelf a ſource of entertainment, is made along the rock, in the direction of the lough, ſometimes by breaking off protuberances, and ſometimes by cutting the great maſs of ſtone to a conſiderable depth. The fragments

are piled in a looſe wall on either ſide, with apertures left at very ſhort ſpaces, to give a paſſage to the wintry currents. Part of it is bordered with low trees, from which our guides gathered nuts, and would have had the appearance of an Engliſh lane, except that an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh lane is almoſt always dirty.

                     <head>SECT. CIII. DESCRIPTION OF A HIGHLAND COTTAGE.</head>
                     <p>NEAR the way, by the water ſide we eſpied a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. This was the firſt Highland Hut that I had ſeen; and as our buſineſs was with life and manners, we were willing to viſit it. To enter a habitation without leave, ſeems to be conſidered here as rudeneſs or intruſion. The old laws of hoſpitality ſtill give this licence to a ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>A hut is conſtructed with looſe ſtones, ranged for the moſt part with ſome tendency to circularity. It muſt be placed where the wind cannot act upon it with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, becauſe it has no cement; and where the water will run eaſily away, becauſe it has no floor but the naked ground. The wall, which is commonly about ſix feet high, declines from the perpendicular a little in ward. Such rafters as can be procured are then raiſed for a roof, and covered with heath, which makes a ſtrong and warm thatch, kept from flying off by ropes of twiſted heath, of which the ends, reaching from the centre of the thatch to the top of the wall, are held firm by the weight of a large ſtone. No light is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but at the entrance, and through a hole in the
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:031692_0614_0FEE76D322B68538"/>
thatch, which gives vent to the ſmoke. This hole is not directly over the fire, leſt the rain ſhould extinguiſh it; and the ſmoke therefore naturally fills the place before it eſcapes. Such is the general ſtructure of the houſes in which one of the natives of this opulent and powerful iſland has been hitherto content to live. Huts however are not more uniform than palaces; and this which we were inſpecting was very far from one of the meaneſt, for it was divided into ſeveral apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and its inhabitants poſſeſſed ſuch property as a paſtoral poet might exalt into riches.</p>
                     <p>When we entered we found an an old woman boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goat's-fleſh in a kettle. She ſpoke little Engliſh, but we had interpreters at hand; and ſhe was willing enough to diſplay her whole ſyſtem of oeconomy. She has five children, of which none are yet gone from her. The eldeſt, a boy of thirteen, and her huſband, who is eighty years old, were at work in the wood. Her two next ſons were gone to Inverneſs to buy meal, by which oatmeal is always meant. Meal ſhe conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as expenſive food, and told us, that in ſpring when the goats gave milk, the children could live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. She is miſtreſs of ſixty goats, and I ſaw many kids in an encloſure at the end of her houſe. She had alſo ſome poultry. By the lake we ſaw a potatoe-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and a ſmall ſpot of ground on which ſtood four ſhucks, containing each twelve ſheaves of barley. She
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:031692_0615_0FEE76D4AA0EF3D8"/>
has all this from the labour of their own hands, and for what is neceſſary to be bought, her kids and her chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens are ſent to market.</p>
                     <p>With the true paſtoral hoſpitality, ſhe aſked us to ſit down and drink whiſky. She is religious, and though the kirk is four miles off, probably eight Engliſh miles, ſhe goes thither every Sunday. We gave her a ſhilling and ſhe begged ſnuff; for ſnuff is the luxury of a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land cottage.</p>
                     <p>Soon afterwards we came to the <hi>General's Hut,</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led becauſe it was the temporary abode of Wade, while he ſuperintended the works upon the road. It is now a houſe of entertainment for paſſengers, and we found it not ill ſtocked with proviſions.</p>

                     <p>AS the iſland of Sky lies in the fifty-ſeventh degree, the air cannot be ſuppoſed to have much warmth.
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:031692_0616_0FEE76D62F9B8FA0"/>
The long continuance of the ſun above the horizon, does indeed ſometimes produce great heat in the northern lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; but this can only happen in ſheltered places, where the atmoſphere is to a certain degree ſtagnant, and the ſame maſs of air continues to receive for many hours the rays of the ſun, and the vapours of the earth. Sky lies open on the weſt and north to a vaſt extent of ocean, and is cooled in the ſummer by perpetual ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation, but by the ſame blaſts is kept warm in winter. Their weather is not pleaſing. Half the year is delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with rain. From the autumnal to the vernal equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, a dry day is hardly known, except when the ſhowers are ſuſpended by a tempeſt. Under ſuch ſkies can be expected no great exuberance of vegetation. Their winter overtakes their ſummer, and their harveſt lies upon the ground drenched with rain. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn ſtruggles hard to produce ſome of our early fruits. I gathered gooſeberries in September; but they were ſmall, and the huſk was thick.</p>
                     <p>Their winter is ſeldom ſuch as puts a full ſtop to the growth of plants, or reduces the cattle to live whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſurpluſage of the ſummer. In the year ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one they had a ſevere ſeaſon, remembered by the name of the Black ſpring, from which the iſland has not yet recovered. The ſnow lay long upon the ground, a calamity hardly known before. Part of their
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:031692_0617_0FEE76D7B7450858"/>
cattle died for w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt, and part were unſeaſonably ſold to buy ſuſtenance for the owners.</p>
                     <p>The ſoil, as in other countries, has its diverſities. In ſome parts there is only a thin layer of earth ſpread upon a rock, which bears nothing but ſhort brown heath, and perhaps is not generally capable of any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter product. There are many bogs or moſſes of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſs extent, where the ſoil cannot be ſuppoſed to want depth, though it is too wet for the plough. But we did not obſerve in theſe any aquatic plants. The vallies and the mountains are alike darkened with heath. Some graſs however, grows here and there, and ſome happier ſpots of earth are capable of tillage.</p>
                     <p>Their agriculture is laborious, and perhaps rather feeble than unſkilful. Their chief manure is ſea-weed, which, when they lay it to rot upon the field, gives them a better crop than thoſe of the Highlands. They heap ſea ſhells upon the dunghill, which in time moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a fertilizing ſubſtance. When they find a vein of earth where they cannot uſe it, they dig it up, and add it to the mould of a more commodious place. Their corn grounds often lie in ſuch intricacies among the craggs, that there is no room for the action of a team and plough. The ſoil is then turned up by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual labour, with an inſtrument called a crooked ſpade, of a forth and weight which to me appeared very
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:031692_0618_0FEE76DA95AA7688"/>
incommodious, and would perhaps be ſoon improved in a country where workmen could be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>According to the different modes of tillage, farms are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>long land and ſhort land.</hi> Long land is that which affords room for a plough, and ſhort land is turned up by the ſpade.</p>
                     <p>The grain which they commit to the furrows thus tediouſly formed, is either oats or barley. They do not ſow barley, without very copious manure, and then they expect from it, ten for one, an increaſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to that of better countries; but the culture is ſo operoſe, that they content themſelves commonly with oats; and who can relate without compaſſion, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all their diligence, they are to expect only a triple increaſe? It is in vain to hope for plenty, when a third part of the harveſt muſt be reſerved for ſeed.</p>
                     <p>When their grain is arrived at the ſtate, which they muſt conſider as ripeneſs, they do not cut, but pull the barley. To the oats they apply the ſickle. Wheel
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:031692_0619_0FEE76DC1B00B458"/>
carriages they have none, but make a frame of timber, which is drawn by one horſe, with the two points behind preſſing on the ground. On this they ſometimes drag home their ſheaves, but often convey them home in a kind of open panier, or frame of ſticks upon the horſe's back.</p>
                     <p>Of that which is obtained with ſo much difficulty, nothing ſurely ought to be waſted; yet their method of clearing their oats from the huſk is by parching them in the ſtraw. Thus with the genuine improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſavages, they deſtroy that fodder for want of which their cattle may periſh. From this practice they have but two petty conveniences. They dry the grain ſo that it is eaſily reduced to meal, and they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the theft of the threſher. The taſte contracted from the fire by the oats, as by every other ſcorched ſubſtance, uſe muſt long ago have made grateful. The oats that are parched muſt be dried in a kiln.</p>
                     <p>Of their gardens I can judge only from their tables. I did not obſerve that the common greens were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuppoſe, that by chooſing an advantageous poſition, they can raiſe all the more hardy eſculent plants. Of vegetable fragrance or beauty they are not yet ſtudious. Few vows are made to Flora in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides. They gather a little hay, but the graſs is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>own late; and is ſo often almoſt dry and again very wet, before it is houſed, that it becomes a collection of
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:031692_0620_0FEE76DEE80861F0"/>
withered ſtalks without taſte or fragrance. It muſt be eaten by cattle that have nothing elſe, but by moſt Engliſh farmers would be thrown away.</p>
                     <p>In the iſlands I have not heard that any ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treaſures have been diſcovered, though where there are mountains there are commonly minerals. One of the rocks in <hi>Col</hi> has a black vein, imagined to conſiſt of the ore of lead: but it was never yet opened or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed. In <hi>Sky</hi> a black maſs was accidentally picked up and brought into the houſe of the owner of the land, who found himſelf ſtrongly inclined to think it a coal, but unhappily it did not burn in the chimney. Common ores would be here of no great value; for what requires to be ſeparated by fire, muſt, if it were found, be carried away in its mineral ſtate, here being no fuel for the ſmelting-houſe, or forge. Perhaps by diligent ſearch in this world of ſtone, ſome valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpecies of marble might be diſcovered. But neither philoſophical curioſity, nor commercial induſtry, have yet fixed their abode here, where the importunity of immediate want ſupplied but for the day, and crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the morrow, has left little room for excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive knowledge, or the pleaſing fancies of diſtant profit.</p>
                     <p>They have lately found a manufacture conſiderably lucrative. Their rocks abound with kelp, a ſea-plant, of which the aſhes are melted into graſs. They burn
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:031692_0621_0FEE76E1A8D581A8"/>
kelp in great quantities, and then ſend it away in ſhips which come regularly to purchaſe them. This new ſource of riches has raiſed the rents of many maritime farms; but the tenants pay, like all other tenants, the additional rent with great unwillingneſs; becauſe they conſider the profits of the kelp as the mere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of perſonal labour, to which the landlord contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes nothing. However, as any man may be ſaid to give what he gives the power of gaining he has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as much right to profit from the price of kelp, as of any thing elſe found or raiſed upon his ground.</p>
                     <p>This new trade has excited a long and eager litigation between Macdonald and Macleod, for a ledge of rocks which, till the value of kelp was known, neither of them deſired the reputation of poſſeſſing.</p>
                     <p>The cattle of Sky are not ſo ſmall as is commonly believed. Since they have ſent their beeves in great numbers to ſouthern marts, they have probably taken more care of their breed. At ſtated times the annual growth of cattle is driven to a fair, by a general drover, and with the money which he returns to the farmer, the rents are paid.</p>
                     <p>The price regularly expected, is from two to three pounds a head. There was once one ſold for five pounds. They go from the Iſlands very lean, and are not offered to the butcher till they have been long fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Engliſh</hi> paſtures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="299" facs="unknown:031692_0622_0FEE76E32F5F22E0"/>
Of their black cattle, ſome are without horns, called by the Scotch <hi>humble cows,</hi> as we call a bee an <hi>bumble bee,</hi> that wants a ſting. Whether this difference be ſpecific, or accidental, though we enquired with great diligence, we could not be informed.</p>
                     <p>Their horſes are, like their cows, of a moderate ſize. I had no difficulty to mount myſelf commodiouſly by the favour of the gentleman.</p>
                     <p>The goat is the general inhabitant of the earth, complying with every difference of climate and ſoil. The goats of the Hebrides are like others; nor did I hear any thing of their ſheep to be particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked.</p>
                     <p>In the penury of theſe malignant regions, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is left that can be converted to food. The gòats and the ſheep are milked like the cows. A ſingle meal of a goat is a quart, and of a ſheep a pint. Such at leaſt was the account which I could extract from thoſe of whom I am not ſure that they ever had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                     <p>The milk of goats is much thinner than that of cows, and that of ſheep is much thicker. Sheep's milk is never eaten before it is boiled. As it is thick, it muſt be very liberal of curd, and the people of St. Kilda form it into ſmall cheeſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſtags of the mountains are leſs than thoſe of our parks or foreſts, perhaps not bigger than our fallow-deer.
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:031692_0623_0FEE76E62BB550D8"/>
Their fleſh has no rankneſs, nor is it inferior in flavour to our common veniſon. The roebuck I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw nor taſted. Theſe are not countries for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular chaſe. The deer are not driven with horns and hounds. A ſportſman, with his gun in his hand, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the animal, and when he has wounded him, traces him by the blood.</p>
                     <p>They have a race of brinded grey hounds, larger and ſtronger than thoſe with which we courſe hares, and thoſe are the only dogs uſed by them for the chaſe.</p>
                     <p>There are in Sky neither rats nor mice, but the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is ſo frequent, that he is heard in houſes ratling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind cheſts or beds, as rats in England.

                     <p>THE inhabitants of <hi>Sky,</hi> and of the other iſlands which I have ſeen, are commonly of the middle ſtature, with fewer among them very tall or very ſhort, than are ſeen in England, or perhaps as their numbers are ſmall, the chances of any deviation from the common meaſure are neceſſarily few. The talleſt men that I ſaw are among thoſe of higher rank. In regions of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſcarcity, the human race is hindered in its growth by the ſame cauſes as other animals.</p>
                     <p>The ladies have as much beauty here as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but bloom and ſoftneſs are not to be expected among the lower claſſes, whoſe faces are expoſſed to the rudeneſs of the climate, and whoſe features are ſometimes contracted by want, and ſometimes harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blaſts. Supreme beauty is ſeldom found in cottages or work-ſhops, even where no real hardſhips are ſuffered. To expand the human face to its full perfection, it ſeems neceſſary that the mind ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate by placidneſs of content, or conſciouſneſs of ſuperiority.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="302" facs="unknown:031692_0625_0FEE76EC0EAD9180"/>
Their ſtrength is proportionate to their ſize, but they are accuſtomed to run upon rough ground, and therefore can with great agility ſkip over the bog, or clamber the mountain. For a campaign in the waſtes of America, ſoldiers, better qualified could not have been found. Having little work to do, they are not willing, nor perhaps able, to endure a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of manual labour, and are therefore conſidered as habitually idle.</p>
                     <p>Having never been ſupplied with theſe accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, which life, extenſively diverſified with trades affords, they ſupply their wants by very inſufficient ſhifts, and endure many inconveniencies which a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attention would eaſily relieve. I have ſeen a horſe carrying home the harveſt on a crate. Under his tail was a ſtick for a crupper, held at the two ends by twiſts of ſtraw. Hemp will grow in their iſlands, and therefore ropes may be had. If they wanted hemp, they might make better cordage of ruſhes, or perhaps of nettles, than of ſtraw.</p>
                     <p>Their method of life neither ſecures them perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual health, nor expoſes them to any particular diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. There are phyſicians in the iſlands, who, I believe, all practiſe chirurgery, and all compound their own medicines.</p>
                     <p>It is generally ſuppoſed, that life is longer in places where there are few opportunities of luxury; but I
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:031692_0626_0FEE76F038335440"/>
found no inſtance here of extraordinary longevity. A cottager grows old over his oaten cakes, like a citizen at a turtle-feaſt. He is indeed ſeldom incommoded by corpulence. Poverty preſervs him from ſinking under the burden of himſelf, but he eſcapes no other injury of time. Inſtances of long life are often related, which thoſe who hear them are more willing to cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it than examine. To be told that any man has attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a hundred years, gives hope and comfort to him who ſtands trembling on the brink of his own climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric.</p>
                     <p>Length of life is diſtributed impartially to very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent modes of life in very different climates; and the mountains have no greater examples of age and health, than the lowlands, where I was introduced to two ladies of high quality; one of whom, in her nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fourth year, preſided at her table with the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all her powers; and the other has attained her eighty-fourth, without any diminution of her vivacity, and with little reaſon to accuſe time of depredations on her beauty.</p>
                     <p>The habitations of men in the <hi>Hebrides</hi> may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed into huts and houſes. By a houſe, I mean a building with one ſtory over another, by a hut, a dwelling with only one floor. The Laird, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lived in a caſtle, now lives in a houſe; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſufficiently neat, but ſeldom very ſpacious or
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:031692_0627_0FEE76F3164293F0"/>
ſplendid. The tackſmen and the miniſters have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly houſes. Wherever there is a houſe, the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger finds a welcome.</p>
                     <p>Of the houſes little can be ſaid. They are ſmall, and by the neceſſity of accumulating ſtores, where there are ſo few opportunities of purchaſe, the rooms are very heterogeneouſly filled. With want of cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it were ingratitude to reproach them; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants having been bred upon the naked earth, think every floor clean; and the quick ſucceſſion of gueſts, perhaps not always over-elegant, does not allow much time for adjuſting their apartments.</p>
                     <p>Huts are of many gradations; from murky dens, to commodious dwellings.</p>
                     <p>The wall of a common hut is always built with mortar, by a ſkilful adaptation of looſe ſtones.—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, perhaps, a double wall of ſtones is raiſed, and the intermediate ſpace filled with earth. The air is thus completely excluded. Some walls, are, I think, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of turfs, held together by a wattle, or texture of twigs. Of the meaneſt huts, the firſt room is lighted by the entrance, and the ſecond by the ſmoke-hole. The fire is uſually made in the middle. But there are huts or dwellings, of only one ſtory, inhabited by gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which have walls cemented with mortar, glaſs windows, and boarded floors. Of theſe all have chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and ſome chimneys have grates.</p>
                     <p>The houſe and the furniture are not always nicely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. We were driven once, by miſſing a paſſage, to
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:031692_0628_0FEE76F89FBFA7B0"/>
the hut of a gentleman, where after a very liberal ſupper, when I was conducted to my chamber, I found an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant bed of Indian cotton, ſpread with fine ſheets. The accommodation was flattering; I undreſſed myſelf, and felt my feet in the mire. The bed ſtood upon the bare earth, which a long courſe of rain had ſoftened to a puddle.</p>
                     <p>The petty tenants, and labouring peaſants, live in miſerable cabins, which afford them little more than ſhelter from the ſtorms. The Boor of <hi>Norway</hi> is ſaid to make all his own utenſils. In the Hebrides, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be their ingenuity, the want of wood leaves them no materials. They are probably content with ſuch accommodations as ſtones of different forms and ſizes can afford them.</p>
                     <p>Their food is not better than their lodging. They ſeldom taſte the fleſh of land animals; for here are no markets. What each man cats is from his own flock. The great effect of money is to break property into ſmall parts. In towns, he that has a ſhilling may have a piece of meat; but where there is no commerce, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Fiſh in fair weather they need not want; but, I believe, man never live, long on fiſh, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; he will rather feed upon roots and ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>The only fuel of the iſlands is peat. Their wood is
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:031692_0629_0FEE76FE57146AB0"/>
all conſumed, and coal they have not yet found. Peat is dug out of the marſhes, from the depth of one foot to that of ſix. That is accounted the beſt which is nearer the ſurface. It appears to be a maſs of black earth held together by vegetable fibres. I know not whether the earth be bituminous, or whether the fibres be not the only combuſtible part; which, by heating the interpoſed earth red-hot, make a burning maſs. The heat is not very ſtrong nor laſting. The aſhes are yellowiſh, and in a large quantity. When they dig peat, they cut it into ſquare pieces, and pile it up to dry beſide the houſe. In ſome places it has an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſmell. It is like wood charked for the ſmith. The common method of making peat fires, is by heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on the earth; but it burns well in grates, and in the beſt houſes is ſo uſed.</p>
                     <p>The common opinion is, that peat grows again where it has been cut; which, as it ſeems to be chiefly a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable ſubſtance, is not unlikely to be true, whether known or not to thoſe who relate it.</p>

                     <head>SECT. CVI. OF THE HEBRIDIAN TABLES.</head>
                     <p>IT need not, I ſuppoſe, be mentioned, that in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſo little frequented as the Iſlands, there are no hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes where travellers are entertained for money. He that wanders about theſe wilds, either procures recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to thoſe, whoſe habitations lie near his way, or, when night and wearineſs come upon him, takes the chance of general hoſpitality. If he finds only a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he can expect little more than ſhelter; for the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagers have little more for themſelves. But if his good fortune brings him to the reſidence of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he will be glad of a ſtorm to prolong his ſtay. There is, however, one inn by the ſea-ſide at Sconſor, in Sky, where the poſt-office is kept.</p>
                     <p>At the tables where a ſtranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land ſo thinly inhabited, muſt have much wild fowl; and I ſcarcely remember to have ſeen a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the ſea abounds with fiſh, need not be told; for it ſupplies a great part of Europe. The Iſle of <hi>Sky,</hi> has ſtags and roebucks, but no hares. They ſell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be ſuppoſed to want beef at home. Sheep and goats are in great numbers, and they have the common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic fowls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="308" facs="unknown:031692_0631_0FEE77042D4D80F0"/>
But as here is nothing to be bought, every family muſt kill its own meat, and roaſt part of it ſomewhat ſooner than Apicius would preſcribe. Every kind of fleſh is undoubtedly excelled by the variety and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Engliſh markets; but that which is not beſt may be yet free from bad; and he that ſhall complain of his fare in the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> has improved his delicacy more than his manhood.</p>
                     <p>Their fowls are not like thoſe plumped for ſale by the poulterers of London, but they are as good as other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces commonly afford, except that the geeſe, by feeding in the ſea, have univerſally a fiſhy rankneſs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe geeſe ſeem to be of a middle race, between the wild and domeſtic kinds. They are ſo tame as to own a home, and ſo wild as ſometimes to fly quite away.</p>
                     <p>Their native bread is made of oats, or barley. Of oatmeal they ſpread very thin cakes, coarſe and hard, to which unaccuſtomed palates are not eaſily reconciled. The barley cakes are thicker and ſofter. I began to eat them with unwillingneſs. The blackneſs of their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our raiſes ſome diſlike, but the taſte is not diſagreeable. In moſt houſes there is wheat-flour, with which we were ſure to be treated, if we ſtaid long enough to have it kneaded and baked. As neither yeaſt nor lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are uſed among them, their bread of every kind is unfermented. They make only cakes, and never mould a loaf.</p>
                     <p>

A man of the Hebrides, for of the women's diet I can give no account, as ſoon as he appears in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſwallows a glaſs of whiſky. Yet they are not a drunken race: at leaſt I never was preſent at much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance. But no man is ſo abſtemious as to refuſe the morning dram, which they call a <hi>ſkalk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The word <hi>whiſky</hi> ſignifies water, and is applied by way of eminence to <hi>ſtrong water,</hi> or diſtilled liquor. The ſpirit drunk in the North is drawn from barley. I never taſted it, except once for experiment at the inn in <hi>Inverary,</hi> when I thought it preferable to any <hi>Engliſh</hi> malt brandy. It was ſtrong, but not pungent, and was free from the empyreumatic taſte or ſmell. What was the proceſs I had no opportunity of enquiring, nor do I wiſh to improve the art of making poiſon pleaſant.</p>
                     <p>Not long after the dram may be expected the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, a meal in which the Scots, whether of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands or mountains, muſt be confeſſed to excel us. The tea and coffee are accompained not only with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but with honey, conſerves, and marmalades. If an epicure could remove by a wiſh, in queſt of ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gratifications, wherever he had ſupped, he would breakfaſt in Scotland.</p>
                     <p>In the iſlands however, they do what I found it not very eaſy to endure. They polute the tea-table by plates piled with large ſlices of Cheſhire-cheeſe which mingles its leſs grateful odours with the fragrance of the tea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="310" facs="unknown:031692_0633_0FEE7711D3F81750"/>
Where many queſtions are to be aſked, ſome will be omitted. I forgot to enquire how they were ſupplied with ſo much exotic luxury. Perhaps the French may bring them wine for wool, and the Dutch give them tea and coffee at the fiſhing ſeaſon, in exchange for freſh proviſion. Their trade is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrained. They pay no cuſtoms, for there is no officer to demand them. Whatever therefore is made dear only by impoſt, is obtained here at an eaſy rate.</p>
                     <p>A dinner in the Weſtern Iſlands, differs very little from a dinner in <hi>England,</hi> except that in the place of tarts, there are always ſet different preparations of milk. This part of their diet will admit ſome improvement. Though they have milk, and eggs, and ſugar, few of them know how to compound them in a cuſtard. Their gardens afford them no great variety, but they have always ſome vegetables on the table. Potatoes at leaſt are never wanting, which, though they have not known them long, are now one of the principal parts of their food. They are not of the mealy, but the viſcous kind.</p>
                     <p>Their more elaborate cookery, or made diſhes, an Engliſhman at the firſt taſte is not likely to approve; but the culinary compoſitions of every country are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch as become grateful to other nations only by degrees; though I have read a French author, who, in

                     <p>Their ſuppers are, like their dinners, various and plentiful. The table is always covered with elegant linen. Their plates for common uſe are often of that kind of manufacture which is called cream-coloured, or queen's-ware. They uſe ſilver on all occaſions where it is common in <hi>England,</hi> nor did I ever find the ſpoon of horn but in one houſe.</p>
                     <p>The knives are not often either very bright or very ſharp. They are indeed inſtruments, of which the Highlanders have not been long acquainted with the general uſe. They were not regularly laid on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, before the prohibition of arms and the change of dreſs. Thirty years ago the Highlander wore his knife as a companion to his dirk or dagger, and when the company ſat down to meat, the men who had knives, cut the fleſh into ſmall pieces for the women, who with their fingers conveyed it to their mouths.</p>
                     <p>There was perhaps never any change of national manners ſo quick, ſo great, and ſo general, as that which has operated in the Highlands, by the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and the ſubſequent laws.
