            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following collection of ſongs, idle and trifling as they may ſeem at firſt view, will, it is hoped, have a further uſe than mere amuſement.</p>
            <p>The ſongs are principally Naval and Military, join'd to a few others that have a tendency to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite that love of our King, of our country, and of Liberty, which, in the breaſts of Engliſhmen, are one and the ſame thing; and which, of all the paſſions, affords the nobleſt ſtock, upon which to graft the Military Virtues. It were to be wiſhed that there was greater choice; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the man whoſe boſom is open to the glow of patriotiſm and of glory, will hear few of them without ſome worthy feelings.—What is wanting in ſentiment and poetry, may be often ſupplied by the energy and maſculine tones of the muſic; and when both combine, the ſoul is raiſed to a grateful pitch of gallant enthuſiaſm, the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which make laſting impreſſions, and give the ſoldier a taſte for thoſe hardſhips and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which he would otherways undergo with reluctance, as mere points of duty.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh troops have for ſome years, had to do with an enemy that has never as yet beheld with ſteady countenance, the glare of a rank of bayonets; and the navy, ſkulking pirates alone to contend with, full of trick, but without bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.—Men who, altho' of Engliſh deſcent, are
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:016530_0003_0F9C8B232144E438"/>
thus debaſed by engaging in purſuits repugnant to all ſenſe of honour, juſtice and humanity. —There is now the proſpect of a tougher taſk for both. The eſtabliſhed armies and navies of the great European powers, (compoſed of ſoldiers and ſeamen, train'd to firm ſervice, and full of officers poſſeſſed of a high point of honour and military ardour,) preſent a very different field for their ambition, and call for a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of all their ancient virtue.—A field, in which ſuperior valour and diſcipline will not only command that reſpect which is ever their own, but inſure complete ſucceſs; in which, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion will depend more upon the arms than the legs, and in which the moſt ſtrenuous graſp will always reap a full harveſt of glory. There the firm ſoldier will not be balked of his object by the illuſive ſhifts of a ſhrinking enemy, nor obliged to imitate practices deſpiſed, and indeed heretofore unknown to the Britiſh troops, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to gain, at beſt, a negative triumph; but will have fair occaſions, amidſt the ſerious but liberal contentions of civilized war, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play all the virtues of his profeſſion, and contraſt the awful qualities that ſway the fate of battle, with that humanity which alone can gild his lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with true ſplendor, and ſtamp a ſacred ſeal upon his merit.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who have any knowledge of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, a knowledge of all others the moſt eſſential to an officer, and who are aware of the powers of muſic and poetry over the mind of man, it is unneceſſary to ſay much in favour of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.—With others of lighter minds, it may poſſibly incur ridicule and excite to laughter, but until ſuch gentlemen are pleaſed, by giving the
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:016530_0004_0F9C8B23E1924CA0"/>
reaſons of their merriment, to ſhow whether their cenſure is more owing to the accuteneſs of their wit or the depth of their judgment, it is in vain to contend with them. In the mean time they will have an opportunity of amuſing them ſelves occaſionally, with a ſong that they might not ſo readily procure a copy of, and ſo far they will allow there is no harm done.</p>
            <p>To readers of taſte and ſentiment, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to obſerve, that many of thoſe odes breathe a pure ſpirit of liberty, warlike ardor, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, adorned with much of the fire, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and melody of genuine poetry: Some of a more tender nature, throw a mild and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing luſtre upon the military profeſſions and the duties attending them; while others of a coarſer caſt, are peculiarly calculated to engage the people and ſtrengthen their attachment to their King, country, and its conſtitution, by combining the intereſts of their enjoyments and appetites, as well as their rights, with the duties of good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: Of thoſe, many may appear not to deſerve a place, but the popular taſte has ſtamped a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon them which ought not to be diſputed— Even the Britiſh Grenadiers, unworthy as the words are of the ſubject, will reach the heart of every Engliſh ſoldier.</p>
            <p>An officer of ſervice, if poſſeſſed of a poetical genius, might certainly, in compoſitions of this kind, inculcate the moſt eſſential points of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary duty and honour, by adapting the words and muſic to the various operations of war.</p>
            <p>In a light infantry ſong, for inſtance, the 1ſt verſe to repreſent that corps turning out upon an alarm, and forming in front of its wigwams— the muſic irregular, bouncing, elevated. The
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:016530_0005_0F9C8B25623E8678"/>
2d verſe, advancing upon the enemy into cover, the muſic ſprightly, animated, but regular.—In ſhort, a good quick-ſtep tune. The 3d verſe, firing, gaining ground, and operating to the flanks —the muſic broken, confus'd, elevated. The 4th verſe, a bloody purſuit—the muſic rapid, crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, harſh. The 5th verſe, the action decided and reſiſtance at an end, the ſoldiers yielding to the impulſe of pity and humanity, ſparing and protecting the vanquiſh'd—the muſic in melting tones of tender ſympathy, unbending the high wound ſpirits to the ſofter, but equally manly feelings of generous compaſſion.</p>
            <p>In a Song for the heavy foot, the line to be repreſented as moving on to battle, ſteady, firm, and ſlow.—The muſic ſolemn, regular, <hi>décidé.</hi> Then engaged in cloſe action and charging.— The muſic lofty, ſtrenuous. Laſtly, the enemy routed, the line leaving the purſuit to the light troops, and employed in regaining its order, preparatory to a ſecond attack.—The muſic more calm and regular, with ſome ſwells of triumph.</p>
            <p>The Highland March is ſingularly ſuited to ſuch a ſubject. The firſt part—the line in march. The ſecond part or chorus—engaged, and the few laſt notes reſuming its order.</p>
            <p>A Song for the Cavalry might repreſent that body as availing itſelf of its advantages.—If againſt horſe, the ſquadrons advancing with velocity to the charge, avoiding all uſe of fire arms, and truſting entirely to the momentum of their horſes and the points of their ſwords, ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying inſtantly to their ſtandards, after the diſorder neceſſarily ariſing from the ſhock, and carrying every thing before them by the joint
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:016530_0006_0F9C8B262162E3E8"/>
effect of their coheſion and impetuoſity.—If againſt infantry, the ſquadrons taking ſhelter from the effect of their fire, by plunging among them, and, once in, remaining there to keep them down—If in purſuit, the horſe abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at all hazards without heſitation upon the enemy, to retard their flight.</p>
            <p>Many other general points of duty, and of intereſt might be interwoven among the imagery in theſe Songs, as equally ſuitable to all of them; ſuch as ſilence—obedience—to ſtand by the colours—to adhere to their officers and to their comrades—to keep up their fire, and rely chiefly on their bayonets or ſwords—the little loſs that troops ever ſuffer in action, compared to the ſlaughter in flight—the triumph and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of victory, with the miſery attending captivity, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The above hints may be of uſe to thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who, although not bred to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of arms, may be diſpoſed to aſſiſt this deſign by their poetical exertions. To Soldiers it is not meant to preſcribe rules—their ideas will naturally keep the proper bounds, and their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius unconſtrained make bolder efforts.</p>
            <p>The Corps of Artillery well deſerve to have a Song apart, but it muſt come from themſelves.</p>
            <p>With regard to the Navy, it would require the knowledge of a thorough bred Seaman, joined to great powers of imagination, and a warm predilection in favour of his country and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to enable a man to compoſe any thing worthy of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>At preſent when the warlike ſpirit of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is thoroughly rouſed, this Book may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into by others as well as military men, and
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:016530_0007_0F9C8B26DF4BBFD0"/>
therefore the occaſion is proper for taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of an unworthy and narrow prejudice, which in England not only prevails among the lower people, where alone it is excuſable, but is alſo received by an order of men, who both from their rank in the community and general edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ought to entertain more liberal and juſt opinions.</p>
            <p>Many of the country gentlemen indulge in an ungenerous jealouſy and diſlike of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Army that does little honour either to their knowledge of the conſtitution or of the hiſtory of their country. Thoſe who truly underſtand the nature of the government of England, its ſituation and commercial intereſts, perceive the unavoidable neceſſity of ſtanding forces, not only to ſupport the power of the nation by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting its foreign eſtabliſhments, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the forbearance and reſpect of its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by enabling it to act offencively againſt thoſe who may adventure to injure or inſult it, but alſo to ſecure us from the ſudden enterprizes of the immenſe armies kept ever on foot by the enemies of England and of liberty, within twelve hours ſail of our coaſt. Brave as the people of Britain are, time is neceſſary to form and train them to arms, and it requires a guarded and cautious hand to introduce gradually the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination neceſſary to qualify the militia to act in any degree in concert for the general pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of ſervice, and to cheriſh at the ſame time that high and independant ſpirit which renders Engliſhmen when undiſciplined the worſt, and when diſciplined the very beſt ſoldiers of the world.—For this purpoſe too the inſtructions of the officers of the army and the example of
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:016530_0008_0F9C8B27A47AF188"/>
the troops are both eſſentially neceſſary; and granting it practicable by this means to put the militia in a few months in a condition to cope with men who had paſſed their lives in arms and had been long inured to war, it would ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a proportion of thorough bred officers to aſſiſt in conducting and fighting it, as well as a train of regular artillery and a good cavalry, which, with many other neceſſary aids, can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be derived from a permanent military eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. In fact, the militia and the army are equally neceſſary to the power and ſecurity of the Britiſh Empire, and moſt juſtly has the former been termed the ſhield, the latter the ſword of England: But he who aſſerts that a militia is alone ſufficient or equal to all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of war, muſt either be uncapable of counting, or prompted by ſome bad deſign.</p>
            <p>A brave militia, conducted by officers who knew the extent of its powers, and exacted no more from it than was to be expected from its diſcipline and experience, might certainly in a country ſo ſingularly ſtrong as England is from its incloſures, render every hedge a bloody en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment to an invading enemy, with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of a certain proportion of veteran foot to ſteel the edge of the points of attack, ſo as to enable the nation to adopt an offenſive mode of defence, (the only one worthy of the ſpirit of Britons or of ſucceſs,) and take the lead in every ſervice which required that coolneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of manoeuvre in the face of an enemy, that alone can enable troops to attack and re-attack with confidence and effect, and which is ſcarce to be attained without long practice and the habit of danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:016530_0009_0F9C8B2861A20BE0"/>Perhaps there has only been two periods ſince the reſtoration in which the militia of England could be deemed in any degree equal to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal defence of the country—in the war of 56, after two years of great exertion and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and at preſent, when a twelvemonth has been heartily employed by the united conſent of all men to prepare it—at both times they have been formed under the inſtruction, and ſtimulated by the example of very gallant and highly diſciplined ſtanding armies.</p>
            <p>It has been a cuſtom to cite the brilliant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſucceſſes of the Edwards and the Henries as proofs of the inutility of ſtanding forces; but before this plea is urged, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to recollect that France and Spain were in thoſe ages ſeverally divided within themſelves, as well as unconnected with each other; and their kings, with very little authority, ſcarce any revenue, and no army at all; whereas at preſent theſe monarchs have entire command of the properties and perſons of their ſubjects, an immenſe revenue, 500,000 regular troops at their nod, and are cloſely united, with the ſame objects in view.</p>
            <p>With regard to the Navy, no doubt without its ſupport we could neither be powerful abroad, nor ſafe at home, and were fighting at ſea alone in queſtion, it is equal to every thing; but it cannot ſail againſt the wind, it cannot be every where at the ſame time, nor can it follow an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading enemy on ſhore.</p>
            <p>Without the advantage of a ſuperior marine, as well as of a willing conſtitutional militia, an army of 200,000 men, with a number of ſtrong fortreſſes, would ſcarce be ſufficient to ſecure
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:016530_0010_0F9C8B29232DDC00"/>
Great-Britain againſt the Houſe of Bourbon. As it is, 30 or 40,000 made ſoldiers, under officers who know how to employ them with oeconomy, and draw from the militia the aids it may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, will, whilſt our navy is in condition to diſpute the dominion of the ſea, prove a full match for any force that an enemy may in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded moment, or in conſequence of a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind, or of a ſucceſsful ſea action find means to land. But the man who from his enthuſiaſm for liberty, ſhould deſire to ſee this very ſmall comparative proportion of ſtanding forces further reduced, muſt have diſcovered with the rebel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that the French king is the beſt protector of our rights and conſtitution, and therefore wiſh to give him an opportunity of reforming the errors of our government, by introducing amongſt us 60 or 80,000 of thoſe legiſlators, uſually employed by his predeceſſors to eſtabliſh peace, liberty and happineſs among their neighbours.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of this caſt muſt indeed be little read in hiſtory not to have in mind, that to the virtue of a ſtanding army we owe a reſtoration and a revolution without bloodſhed, waſte or confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the reduction of two rebellions, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of all liberty and property, at times when the nation ſeemed reſigned to its fate, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with deſpondency—and alſo that to the virtue of the army it has been often owing that the promoters of ſedition have been prevented from endangering real liberty by deſtroying all order and government.</p>
            <p>All circumſtances weighed, it cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to thoſe who are ſuperior to prejudice, and capable of taking a comprehenſive and liberal view, that, in the preſent ſtate of the world, a
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:016530_0011_0F9C8B29E56712C0"/>
ſtanding army is eſſential to the ſecurity of the Britiſh empire againſt foreign attacks—conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the exiſtence of the rights and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the inhabitants; and that it is of equal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the great objects of liberty, that this army ſhould not be mercenary, but have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the conſtitution of its country. Certain reſtraints are no doubt neceſſary to command the obedience and ſubordination of the military to the civil power, and to cruſh in the bud all attempts that might be made by unprincipled men to turn againſt the people thoſe arms which it is only ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to bear in their defence.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who endeavour to undervalue the military character, or to make unneceſſary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon its profeſſional rights, or by inferior uſage and invidious diſtinctions try to eſtrange the troops from all attachment to their country and intereſt in the conſtitution, can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand acquitted of treaſon againſt the freedom of their fellow-ſubjects, at the expence of their intellects.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the army is held in that eſtimation which its actions heretofore well claim, and which is the beſt ſecurity for its behaviour in future, it will continue to be full of officers, who from their education, property and rank in the kingdom, muſt have an intereſt in the well-being of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuperior to all views of military command or emolument; ſeconded by ſoldiers, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural attachment to their country will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the ſhare they are allowed in its credit and happineſs.</p>
            <p>But ſhould the profeſſion of arms ever be held in diſreſpect, and thoſe that follow it unneceſſarily deprived of the common rights of citizens, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:016530_0012_0F9C8B2AF26B0350"/>
to inſult and oppreſſion, then indeed the army may become mercenary, as no man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or property will remain in it, and thoſe who do, will naturally favour every change, having nothing to loſe and every thing to gain.</p>
            <p>As the writer of theſe lines may poſſibly be gueſſed at, and thoſe who are diſpoſed to judge with ſeverity, may among many other faults, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the expreſſions as too ſtrong or hazarded, and the language as not ſufficiently chaſte or indeed correct, he begs leave to be allowed in extenuation of his offences to obſerve, that licences which might be extremely improper in a Sermon, may perhaps admit of excuſe in a preamble to a Book of Songs. In other reſpects, if he ſhould ſucceed in drawing the attention of officers to an object that appears to him uſeful, he is little ſolicitous about the appearance he himſelf may make upon this occaſion, and with much indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference gives up his literary character to the wrath of whatever enraged critic may chooſe to exerciſe his gall upon it; recommending it to the gentlemen of that family, when they ſhall find their bile overheated by ſo doing, to quit the Preface and apply to the Songs, which will probably excite ſome unuſual feelings of candor and good humour, that, however ill they may ſuit the temper of a Critic's mind, will certainly contribute to the health of his body.</p>
