            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>REFLECTION upon paſt enjoyments tends only to the aggravation of preſent ſufferings; and yet, I know not how, the mind of man is ever fondly diſpoſed to draw the painful parallel betwixt the happineſs which he once poſſeſſed and the miſery which he now feels. This was the caſe of the captive Iſraelites, as is pathetically deſcribed in the pſalm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: <q>By the rivers of Babylon, ſays the divine poet, there we ſat down, yea, we wept when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered Zion: we hanged our harps upon the willows which grew in the midſt thereof.</q> As the ſoul in affliction is ever apt to dwell upon every circumſtance which heightens the ſorrow, he here repreſents his harp, that ſacred inſtrument devoted to his GOD, now laid aſide, ſilent and neglected; for how indeed could he "ſing the LORD'S ſong in
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0005_0F98D2FDC5181F78"/>
a ſtrange land?" Oppreſſion and ſervitude throw a damp upon every noble faculty; no wonder then the ſacred muſician could ill exert the heavenly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony under the diſpiriting preſſure of a foreign ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. How ſhall we ſing the LORD'S ſong in a ſtrange land? Here the faithful patriot turns, by a very natural tranſition, from lamenting over his country's fate, to the ſtrongeſt profeſſions of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his affection forever inviolable towards her, <q>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem! let my right hand forget her cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief joy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER the incitement of ſo animating an example, I ſhall offer a few ſentiments concerning that virtue which produced this glorious reſolution; and, after endeavouring to explain the nature and obligation of love to our country, ſhall attempt to point out that conduct which ſeems requiſite to teſtify the ſincerity of this affection.</p>
            <p>THE love of our country is a principle which hath been more celebrated in all ages, hath been the ſubject of more praiſe and panegyric, than any other affection in the whole train of virtue. It hath been the conſtant theme of poets, orators and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; ſtatues and medals have been erected and ſtruck, and all the treaſures of art and wit perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhauſted, in doing honour to thoſe who have
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0006_0F98D2FE8620EC88"/>
excelled in this character: And indeed the name of Patriot implies, in its true ſenſe, every thing that is moſt great and godlike among men; it carries in it the idea of a public bleſſing; it implies a power of doing good, exerted and extended to whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities; and reſembles, within its ſphere, that univerſal providence which protects and ſupports the world. This is that elevated paſſion, of all others the moſt neceſſary, as well as moſt becoming, to mankind; and yet, if we believe the common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, of all others the leaſt viſible in the world. It lives, we are told, rather in deſcription than reality, and is repreſented by the firſt writer of this age as an antiquated and forgotten virtue. Wretched picture of the human race! If this be a juſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, we are degenerate indeed! inſenſible to the beſt of all ſocial duties, counteracting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bond of alliance with our ſpecies, and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſource of our moſt refined pleaſures. The public is, as it were, one great family; we are all children of one common mother, <hi>America,</hi> our country; ſhe gives us all our birth, nurſed our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years, and ſupports our manhood. In this light, therefore, our regards for her ſeem as natural as the implanted affection betwixt parents and children.</p>
            <p>I might here enlarge on the mutual delights given and received in the ſocial entertainments and converſation of a people connected together with
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0007_0F98D2FF451AD6C8"/>
the ſame language, cuſtoms and inſtitutions, and from thence ſhew the reaſonableneſs of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate attachment to the community, but I chuſe to point out the obligations to this aſſociating virtue as they ariſe from higher and more intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles.</p>
            <p>THE miſeries of the ſtate of nature are ſo evident that there is no occaſion to diſplay them; every man is ſenſible that violence, rapine and ſlaughter muſt be continually practiſed where no reſtraints are provided to curb the inordinancy of ſelf-affection. To ſociety then we muſt owe our ſecurity from theſe miſeries, and to a wiſely conſtructed and well regulated government we muſt ſtand indebted for our protection againſt thoſe, who would encroach upon the equal ſhare of liberty which belongs to all, or would moleſt individuals in the poſſeſſion of what is fairly appropriated, or juſtly claimed. And what an unſpeakable ſatisfaction is it to be free, and to be able to call any thing one's own! Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſecurity diffuſe a cheerfulneſs over the moſt uncomfortable regions, and give a value to the moſt inconſiderable poſſeſſions; even a morſel of bread in the moſt frozen climate would be more worth contending for, if liberty crowned the meal, than the nobleſt poſſeſſions and greateſt affluence under the mildeſt ſkies, if held at the mercileſs will of a civil or religious tyrant. And as ſuch a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is only to be eſtabliſhed by the love of ſociety;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015368_0008_0F98D30004673E38"/>
as all the bleſſings we enjoy ſpring from this ſource; gratitude calls upon us to cultivate a principle to which we owe ſuch tranſcendent obligations. But the obligation riſes upon us, when we conſider, that from ſociety is alſo derived a ſet of amiable duties, unknown to men in a detached and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected ſtate. It is from this foundation that hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, gratitude and generoſity flow, with all the pleaſing charities which adorn human nature; for, where have thoſe virtues their theatre? where is their ſcene of action? or how can they exert themſelves, but in ſociety? It is there alone we have opportunities of diſplaying the moral charms, and of exhibiting the glorious manifeſtation of good-will to mankind. On this account, therefore, ſociety has a high demand for our affectionate regard.</p>
            <p>BUT to be unmindful of the public, is not only an argument of an <hi>ungrateful,</hi> it is a proof alſo of a <hi>diſhoneſt</hi> temper of mind. GOD has aſſigned each of us our ſtation, and a part which we are obliged to diſcharge in carrying on the great work of ſocial happineſs. If then I neglect the part appointed me, I am highly unjuſt; becauſe I take a ſhare of the benefits of ſociety, and yet leave the burden to be borne by others. A greater injuſtice than this can ſcarcely be conceived. He who injures parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, is indeed an offender; but he who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds from the public the ſervice and affection to
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0009_0F98D300C4675990"/>
which it is intitled, is a criminal of a far higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as he thereby robs a whole body of people, and deprives the community of her juſt demand. If GOD has given to one man a good underſtanding, and he does not exert it for the general advantage by advice and counſel; if to another riches, and he will not aſſiſt with his liberality; if to a poor man ſtrength, and he will not aid with his labour; if, in ſhort, any be wanting in purſuing the benevolent principle, by directing his talents to their proper ends, he deſerves to be treated as a common ſpoiler, inaſmuch as he takes what properly belongs not to him, the title of each man's ſhare of the benefits of ſociety ariſing only from that proportion which he himſelf has contributed.</p>
            <p>PUBLIC good is, as it were, a common bank, in which every individual has his reſpective ſhare; and conſequently whatever damage that ſuſtains, the individuals unavoidably partake of the calamity. If liberty be deſtroyed, no particular member can eſcape the chains; if the credit of the aſſociated body ſink, his fortune ſinks with it; if the ſons of violence prevail, and plunder the public ſtock, his part cannot be reſcued from the ſpoil; and ſome real ſhare (be it more or leſs) all, even the meaneſt, have in this common fund, and a valuable one too, though it were nothing but the loweſt earnings of induſtrious labour. If, then, we have a true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for ourſelves; if we would reap the fruits of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015368_0010_0F98D30185E9AC00"/>
induſtry, and enjoy our property in ſecurity, we muſt ſtand firm to the cauſe of liberty and public virtue, otherwiſe we had better return to the raw herbage for our food; to the inclemencies of the open ſky for our covering; go back beyond the mountains to uncultivated nature, where our wants would be fewer, and our appetites leſs. Such a ſituation, notwithſtanding all its inconveniences, is far preferable to a tyrannical government, and far more deſirable than the lot of ſlaves.</p>
            <p>WE ſee then how cloſely the kind Creator has connected our intereſt with our duty, and made it each man's happineſs to contribute to the welfare of his country.</p>
            <p>BUT ſtill the more noble motive to a generous ſoul is that which ſprings from a benevolent deſire of diffuſing the joys of life to all around him. There is nothing he thinks ſo deſirable as to be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of doing good; and the further it is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the greater is the delight, and the more glorious his character. Benignity to friends and relations is but a narrow-ſpirited quality compared with this, and perhaps as frequently the effect of caprice or pride as of a benevolent temper. But when our flow of good-will ſpreads itſelf to all the ſociety, and in them to diſtant poſterity; when charity riſes into public ſpirit, and partial affection is extended into general benevolence, then it is that man ſhines in
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0011_0F98D303BAB7FF68"/>
the higheſt luſtre, and is the trueſt image of his Divine Maker.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of this affection, laudable as it is, we are not, however, to forget, that it may be ſo conducted as to become a very criminal paſſion. If any aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted body, apprehending themſelves ſuperior to other ſtates, ſhould, for that reaſon only, invade their rights, this would be to undermine the very foundation of ſociety, and conſequently an unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable enterprize. Does true patriotiſm inſpire ſuch a conduct? Does the love of our country teach us to aggrandize it at the ruin of another? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly not. And if we think at all, we muſt allow ſuch attempts utterly repugnant to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental laws of juſtice and univerſal charity. Hard would be his fate who ſhould be commanded to perform ſuch a ſervice, and glorious the triumph of his ſoul if he reſolved to decline it! In vain would he call in the example of ancient Rome for his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; for, after all the extravagant encomiums beſtowed upon her patriotiſm, we ſhall ſcarce be able to clear it from the imputation of flagrant tyranny. Rome, early poſſeſſed with the high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm of diſtinction and empire, declared war againſt mankind, and out of a feveriſh fondneſs for dominion and renown, laid deſolate all the known world. Their poſſeſſions, their habitations, their paintings, their ſculptures, all their riches
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0012_0F98D303CBA47FD0"/>
were the ſpoils of injured nations. Thus they erected to themſelves an empire as unweildy as it was unjuſt, on the ruins of their fellow-creatures. What then are all their beautiful lectures and pompous declamations on the love of their country? What their laboured orations in praiſe of liberty? Indiſputable proofs, indeed, of their eloquence, but not ſo of their humanity. If the language of benevolence were to conſtitute the patriotic cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, you muſt allow it due to theſe Romans; but if actions are to aſcertain the right, we ſhall find it a difficult taſk to make good their claim, though we were maſters even of their own eloquence.</p>
            <p>Look into their city, and behold the inhabitants; there you will find this celebrated freedom ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf only amongſt particular branches, and giving a few the licenſe to tyranniſe over an infinite number of miſerable ſlaves, rendered more wretched by having always before their eyes a diſagreeable ſubject of compariſon. Look into their provinces, (which they ought in duty to have protected) and you behold ſcenes of the utmoſt injuſtice, barbarity and horror. Their tyrants, not content with what might with ſome degree of propriety be called law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful taxation, but murdering them in cold blood without mercy. Now and then, it is true, you ſee the conquered enjoying a little eaſe under a humane, honeſt governor; but in general their oppreſſions were intolerable, and their whole
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0013_0F98D30484DA4F40"/>
adminiſtration no better than a courſe of hoſtility and plunder.</p>
            <p>LET us change the ſcene, and take a curſory view of our own caſe. Thanks and praiſe be given to the LORD GOD of armies, it is our felicity not to be members of ſuch a ſociety! not to be in ſo abject and humiliating a ſtate as thoſe Roman colonies were! We have never yet been conquered; we never yet tamely received laws from a tyrant, nor never will, while the cauſe of religion, the cauſe of nature and of nature's GOD cry aloud, or even whiſper <hi>reſiſtance</hi> to an oppreſſor's execrated power. The gloomy cloud that has long been gathering and hovering over our Jeruſalem, is indeed ſtill formidable, and demands our utmoſt efforts to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate its diſperſion; and this great and wiſhed for good is in all human probability the moſt likely to be accompliſhed by firmneſs, unanimity, perſeverance and a fixed determination ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to execute and defend what our Continental Congreſs, Provincial Aſſemblies, Commanding Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and ſo forth, ſhall wiſely and prudently reſolve.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Let fools for modes of</hi> government <hi>conteſt,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That which is beſt adminiſter'd is beſt.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>AND here I will obſerve, that it was not through licentious oppoſition, or for conqueſt, we drew the
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0014_0F98D305447860F0"/>
ſword, but for juſtice; not to introduce, but to prevent ſlavery; not upon a vain principle of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to gratify the reſentment or pride of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, (as many of our internal enemies have ſtupidly and falſely aſſerted) but in defence of the plaineſt rights, and ſuch as all mankind have ever claimed at the call of a provoked and long injured people, and that after every other method of redreſs had been tried in vain.</p>
            <p>THE liberty we contend for is not the licenſe of a few to tyranniſe over multitudes; but an equal freedom to all, ſo far as is conſiſtent with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances of our country, good order, the conſtitution, and peace of government. Theſe are circumſtances which give a ſanction to patriotiſm, and not only juſtify, but demand our moſt active reſolutions to promote the welfare of our country, by all thoſe methods which become a civilized and numerous people, born with an inſtinctive love of liberty.</p>
            <p>IF we bear a true and cordial affection for our country, we ſhall be warm and active in her cauſe; a calm concern is inconſiſtent with true patriotiſm, which gives ardor to the coldeſt breaſt, and makes even cowards brave.</p>
            <p>THERE never was a country had ſtronger motives
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0015_0F98D30604A95C00"/>
to unite in active zeal than this, nor was there ever a time required it more than the preſent. By how much the more the enjoyment of liberty hath been aſſerted, improved and eſtabliſhed amongſt us; ſo much the greater ought to be our reſolution to maintain it, and the more ſcandalous is our folly if we loſe it. Liberty with danger is better than ſlavery with ſecurity.</p>
            <p>OF all the known parts of the world, and for many ages, Britain hath been the moſt extolled for the love and protection of liberty; there the heavenly goddeſs ſeemed to have fixed her temple; and whilſt her ſacred fires have been extinguiſhed in ſo many other countries, there they have till lately been religiouſly kept alive; there ſhe hath had her ſaints and confeſſors, and a whole army of martyrs: But, alas! how are the mighty fallen! The gates of hell hath prevailed againſt her.</p>
            <p>IF then liberty be that delicious and wholeſome fruit on which the Britiſh nation hath fed for ages, and to which they owe their riches, their ſtrength, and all the advantages they boaſt of, ſurely it is highly incumbent upon us to cheriſh and cultivate the tree which bears that delicious fruit, and will continue to bear it as long as we are careful to fence it in and trench it round againſt the beaſts of the field and inſects of the earth. It is then our duty to be ever vigorous and ardent in the ſupport of
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0016_0F98D306C762EA38"/>
ſuch a cauſe; to reverence the majeſty of liberty, and conform our conduct to it; to cauſe all other inclinations to bow to this; to make it, in ſhort, the conſtant object of our warmeſt wiſhes, cloſeſt attention and higheſt admiration <q>to prefer Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem above our chief joy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſhall give a further proof of our patriotiſm, if, out of a ſenſe of the obligations we lie under to thoſe on whom the execution or management of our glorious cauſe is delegated, we endeavour to ſtrengthen their hands, oil the wheels of patriotic power, and ſmooth the rugged paths of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Whilſt they diſcharge their important duties with ability and honour, they have a juſt demand to the returns of grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are entitled to the warmeſt applauſes of that people whom they have faithfully ſerved. And as it is incumbent upon us to pay this tribute, ſo it is natural for them to expect it. Glory is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of honourable toils, and public fame is the juſt retribution for public ſervice; the love of which is ſo connected with virtue, that it ſeems ſcarcely poſſible to be poſſeſſed of the latter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome degree of the former. Nor is this any ſort of derogation to the benevolence of the character: A good man feels a pleaſure from the reputation he acquires by ſerving his country, becauſe he loves it; but he does not love it merely for the ſake of that pleaſure; the paſſion did not ſpring from the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015368_0017_0F98D307847F7D40"/>
expectation of the delight, but the delight was the conſequence of the paſſion.</p>
            <p>BUT after all theſe duties are diſcharged, we muſt not ſtop here, ſomething more is ſtill required at our hands to give the finiſhing teſtimony: If the love of your country is indeed the governing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of your ſoul, you will give up every inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is incompatible with it; nor will you cheriſh in your breaſts any rivals of the favorite paſſion. All the train of darling vices muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be brought forth, and offered up as victims on the altars of liberty. You cannot be ſaid to "pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Jeruſalem above your chief joy," whilſt you foſter any appetites which have a manifeſt tendency to her detriment. But what is ſo pernicious to the common weal as vice? and what vice ſo much as luxury? It is this which enfeebles the body, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the mind, impoveriſhes the fortune, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces every baneful cauſe of ruin. This it was which deſtroyed imperial Rome, and aſſiſted Caeſar to enſlave her citizens. She had ſtrength enough left her to withſtand the attacks of her enemies; but thoſe who ſeemed to wiſh her proſperity had not virtue enough to give up their luxury to her intereſt. Rome, therefore, fell a ſacrifice to the vices of her friends. Effects always correſpond to their cauſes: If we purſue the ſame courſe, we muſt expect the ſame fate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:015368_0018_0F98D308444D6CD8"/>
THIS conſideration is ſurely ſufficient to rouſe our virtue, and make us abandon all intemperate purſuits. But if out of a luxurious vanity we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the manufactures of other countries, to the detriment of our own; if our profuſion in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant expences render us leſs able, or leſs willing, to aſſiſt the public, we violate the moſt ſacred of all ſocial duties, and become flagrant tranſgreſſors of the will of our Creator.</p>
            <p>IT was ſuch a conduct as this which provoked the anger of GOD againſt the Iſraelites, when he ſent his prophet (Amos) to them with this denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: <q>Wo unto them that are at eaſe in Zion! ye that put far away the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of violence to come near! That lie upon beds of ivory, and ſtretch themſelves upon their couches, eat the lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the midſt of the ſtall; that chant to the ſound of the viol, and invent to themſelves inſtruments of muſic; that drink wine out of bowls, and anoint themſelves with their chief ointments: but are not grieved for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Joſeph!</q> A beautiful and pathetic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription this of the levity of the Hebrews; who, at a time of public diſtreſs, regarded only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of voluptuous appetites, but never felt one tender ſentiment for their bleeding country, "were not grieved for the affliction of Joſeph." Thus the children of Iſrael were brought down (ſays
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0019_0F98D309044B4228"/>
the ſcripture) in that day, and the children of Judah prevailed, becauſe they relied on the LORD their GOD. Theſe things were written for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, as well as the Jews; and the wo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced is equally applicable to any other nation in the like circumſtances.</p>
            <p>LET us then not build too much upon human proſpects, or ſhut GOD out of our councils and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; but let us flee humbly to him for ſuccour in a pious acknowledgment, that <q>without him nothing is ſtrong; that without him no king can be ſaved by the multitude of an hoſt, nor the mightieſt man be delivered by his ſtrength.</q>
            </p>
            <p>OUR unnatural enemies have their earthly king, their lords ſpiritual and temporal, to apply to on this occaſion; let us leave them to their protection, and let us chuſe on our part the LORD of lords for our GOD and for our king. In his name have we ſet up our banners, who alone <q>giveth victory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to kings, and ſaveth from the peril of the ſword.</q> Let us every one contribute his endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and leſſen the weight of public guilt by at leaſt reforming and amending himſelf, and unite in our prayers and in every good work, that <q>GOD may be entreated for the land.</q> So we may pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly hope, that he will go forth with our armies, and "command deliverances for Jacob;" that thro' him we ſhall <q>caſt down our enemies, and keep
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0020_0F98D309C62AF6D8"/>
them under that riſe up againſt us.</q> So ſhall we not only conſult the peace and proſperity of this our Jeruſalem, but ſhall provide in the beſt manner for our future peace and happineſs in a better country, and ſhall be received as true ſons and citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of that Jeruſalem which is above.</p>
            <p>TO conclude: Temperance and patriotiſm go hand in hand, and adhere together by an inſeparable connection. And as there can be no real virtue in that breaſt, which is not ſuſceptible of the love of the public, ſo there can be no genuine love of the public where virtue is wanting; ſince that is not only the trueſt ornament, but the beſt ſupport of the community. National affection therefore, if it be derived from a true principle, muſt neceſſarily inſpire a moral conduct, muſt incline us to quit every baneful vice, to contract the circle even of what we call innocent amuſements, and inſtead of looking out for daily parties of pleaſure, it will prompt us rather to make a conſtant feſtival of human kindneſs, the moſt delicious of all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments to a generous mind. If we behave thus, then we are patriots indeed. It is thus we are to arm ourſelves againſt our unprincipled enemies; who, though they ſhould not dread our ſtrength, will certainly ſtand in awe of our virtue. Whilſt we act in this manner, our profeſſions will not only meet with full applauſe from men, but alſo with the approbation of GOD, when with the pious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb facs="unknown:015368_0021_0F98D30A84DD4128"/>
of the text we cry out, <q>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem! let my right hand forget her cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief joy.</q>
