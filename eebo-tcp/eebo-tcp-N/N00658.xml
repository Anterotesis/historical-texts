            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>, that <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; no <hi>Grace,</hi> but <hi>this Faith,</hi> ha's the Honour to <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> us. This is the <hi>Good old way,</hi> of arriving unto <hi>Reſt</hi>; and, <hi>Aliter qui Vadit, cadit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But every <hi>Jewel</hi> ha's a <hi>Counterfeit.</hi> And, <hi>How ſhall a man know, that his Faith in the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for his Juſtification, is not a Counterſeit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To anſwer that Caſe, the Bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> under the <hi>Inſpirations of the Almighty,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares unto us, the <hi>Marks</hi> of a <hi>Juſtifying Faith</hi>; and thoſe <hi>Marks</hi> are, the <hi>Works</hi> which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually diſpoſes the Believer unto.</p>
            <p>Now among the Admonitions of the Apoſtle to this purpoſe, there is a ſpecial Remark due to that, in Jam. 2.20. <hi>Wilt thou know, O vain man, that Faith without works is Dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader will preſently obſerve in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage; both the Character of the <hi>Faith,</hi> which does not produce and promote <hi>Good Works,</hi> in the <hi>man</hi> that hath it: It is a <hi>Dead Faith</hi>; it will be of no uſe unto the man in whom it is; it can do nothing for him: and then, the Character of the <hi>Man</hi> who ha's this <hi>Faith</hi>; He is a <hi>vain man</hi>; he ſeems, and he boaſts, to <hi>have,</hi> what he hath <hi>not</hi>; and he flatters himſelf with <hi>Hopes</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be made Good unto him. So that, we are now Aſſured, <hi>A Workleſs Faith is a Worthleſs Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> who Profeſſedly handles the Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> does plainly aſſert, That no man
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000800_0004_0FAA509F71B34C10"/>
living is <hi>Juſtified</hi> by <hi>Works,</hi> but a man is <hi>Juſtifyed</hi> only by <hi>Faith. James</hi> does nevertheleſs aſſert, That a man is <hi>Juſtified</hi> by <hi>Works,</hi> and a man is not <hi>Juſtified</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> only. And yet, however ſome of the Ancients, as well as <hi>Luther</hi> ſtumbled at this <hi>Appearance of Contradiction,</hi> the Aſſertions do not Contradict one another at all. <hi>Paul</hi> treats of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> and the Right unto Everlaſting Life, therein granted unto us, which is only by <hi>Faith</hi> in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>James</hi> treats of that which may manifeſt our <hi>Juſtification</hi> unto <hi>men,</hi> that See &amp; Hear, our Profeſſion of our <hi>Faith</hi>; and here <hi>Works</hi> are ſignificant. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> of a man, may be diſtreſſed with a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Accuſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, A man may be Accuſed of <hi>Iniquity</hi>; It may be ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt broken the Law, and thereby wronged the Name, of God, and the terrible penalty of that Law, now belongs unto thee.</hi> The Anſwer to this <hi>Accuſation</hi> is to be, <hi>My Lord Jeſus Chriſt ha's fully obey'd the will of God, and ſuffered the penalty due to me for my Diſobedience; and I do by Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on this Righteouſneſs of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for my Acceptance with God for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, A man may be Accuſed of <hi>Hypocriſy</hi>; It may be ſaid, <hi>Thou Talkest of thy Faith; but is it not meer Talk? How canſt thou prove, that thy Faith is any more, than what is in the very Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> The Anſwer to this <hi>Accuſation</hi> is, <hi>The works of a Sanctified man, which I am doing every Day, are the Proof of my Faith.</hi> According hereunto it is aſſerted
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000800_0005_0FAA50A029FC7D48"/>
by <hi>Paul,</hi> That a man is <hi>Juſtified alone by Faith:</hi> but it is aſſerted by <hi>James,</hi> That a man is <hi>not Juſtified by a Faith which is alone.</hi> The Queſtion diſcourſed by <hi>Paul</hi> is, <hi>How a Guilty Perſon may come to be Acquitted by the Lord, from all the Guilt that lies upon him?</hi> The Anſwer to this Queſtion, is, Not by any <hi>Works</hi> of our own, but only by the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is, on our part, only by <hi>Faith</hi> applied unto us. The Queſtion diſcourſed by <hi>James,</hi> is, <hi>Whether a man pretending to Faith in the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved, though he continue without the works of an Holy Life, agreeable thereunto</hi>? The Anſwer to this Queſtion is, <hi>No,</hi> Such a man ha's no <hi>Saving Faith</hi> at all. And that <hi>James</hi> is to be taken in that ſenſe, is evident from This: He does inſiſt upon the Inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>; and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>Juſtified man,</hi> Thirty years, before thoſe <hi>Works,</hi> which are ſaid here to <hi>Juſtify</hi> him Upon the whole then, we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, or, indeed, never contrdicting. And we are Adviſed after all; Tis a <hi>Vanity</hi> in any man to <hi>Profeſs,</hi> that he ha's a <hi>True Faith</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if his <hi>Faith</hi> be not <hi>Fruitful</hi> in thoſe <hi>Good Works,</hi> which may <hi>Juſtify</hi> the mans <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Two very Important <hi>Caſes,</hi> about which the Thoughts of every Chriſtian, cannot but be Exerciſed; and we will here beſtow ſome of our Thoughts thereupon.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Caſe</hi> which a Chriſtian, muſt Conſider, if he would be a <hi>Christian,</hi> is,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000800_0006_0FAA50A1086903E0"/>
What are thoſe <hi>Good Works,</hi> which a True Faith, will Quicken &amp; Incline the Believer unto?</p>
            <p>Now we may thus conceive of them; <hi>Good Works,</hi> are <hi>Sincere Eſſayes</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Law of God.</hi> Our God hath given us <hi>a Rule of Life,</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ich we call, <hi>The Moral Law.</hi> None of our <hi>Works</hi> are <hi>Perfectly Good,</hi> if in any point they fall ſhort of that <hi>Rule.</hi> But none of our <hi>Works</hi> do <hi>Perfectly</hi> come up to the <hi>Rule,</hi> as long as we are lodg'd in <hi>this Body which is to Dy.</hi> The <hi>Beſt men</hi> alive, when they look upon the <hi>Beſt Works</hi> of their Lives, may cry out, with one of the Ancients, <hi>Terret me tota vita mea, nam apparet mihi, aut Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum, aut tota Sterilitas</hi>; The <hi>Sinfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranneſs,</hi> of all my <hi>Life,</hi> ſtrikes me with a <hi>Deadly Terror</hi> of Soul! Nevertheleſs, there are <hi>Sincere Eſſays</hi> towards <hi>Perfection,</hi> which all Believers are Conſcientiouſly making every Day. Now theſe <hi>Eſſayes</hi> are <hi>Good,</hi> in the Merciful Reckoning of God, our <hi>Father</hi> in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Tho' none of our <hi>Sincere Eſſayes</hi> at <hi>Well-doing</hi> are ſuch <hi>Good works</hi> as to <hi>Juſtify</hi> us, before that Thrice <hi>Holy God,</hi> who is of <hi>Purer eyes than to behold Evil,</hi> &amp; whoſe <hi>Pure Eyes</hi> yet <hi>behold</hi> in our <hi>Good Works,</hi> a world of <hi>Evil</hi>: Yet our <hi>Sincere Eſſayes</hi> are pleaſing unto our God, who by His Good <hi>Spirit</hi> ha's Excited them, &amp; Aſſiſted them; and, <hi>Whoſe workmanſhip we are, Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto Good works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> Such Good <hi>Works,</hi> as our <hi>Prayers,</hi> are, as tis ſaid, in Prov. 15.8.

               <hi>The Delight of the Lord</hi>; and ſuch Good <hi>Works,</hi> as our <hi>Alms,</hi> are, as tis ſaid, in Heb. 13.16. <hi>The Sacrifices where-with God is well pleaſed.</hi>

Good Works</hi> muſt be ſuch, as the Lord hath <hi>ſhewn</hi> to us, that He hath <hi>Required</hi> of us. They are no <hi>Good Works,</hi> whereof our God may ſay, <hi>Who hath required 'em</hi>? Works of <hi>Piety,</hi> are <hi>Good Works</hi>; for we have the <hi>Word</hi> of our God for them; as in Pſal. 92.1. <hi>It is a Good Thing to give Thanks unto the Lord.</hi> Works of <hi>Charity</hi> are <hi>Good Works</hi>; for we have the <hi>word</hi> of our God for them; as in Heb. 13.16. <hi>To Do Good, and to Communicate, forget not.</hi> No works are <hi>Good,</hi> but ſuch as are contained in the <hi>Two Tables</hi> of the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi>; the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Man.</hi>

            <p>But unto the Conſtitution of <hi>Good Works,</hi> it is not enough, that the <hi>matter</hi> of what we do, be according to the <hi>Law</hi> of God. Men may do <hi>Works</hi> that ſhall be <hi>Good</hi> for the <hi>matter</hi> of them, and yet, <hi>Every work of their Hands be unclean, ſaith the Lord. Plowing</hi> is Lawful, and <hi>Praying</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:000800_0008_0FAA50A280C92818"/>
is Lawful; and yet theſe <hi>works</hi> may be ſinful in the Doer of them. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Manner</hi> of our <hi>Works,</hi> muſt be Right, as well as the <hi>Matter</hi> of them. A man may incur the Wrath of God, by his <hi>Good Works,</hi> if he do them not in any <hi>manner</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Law,</hi> as they ſhould be done. We find, in 1 Chron. 15.13. <hi>The Lord our God</hi> is offended at thoſe who <hi>Seek Him not after the due Order.</hi> No meer <hi>External Actions</hi> are to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <hi>Good Works</hi>; there muſt <hi>Internal Cautions</hi> go along with them; elſe they are but the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Good Works,</hi> without the <hi>Form. Good Works</hi> muſt be done with <hi>Regular Circumſtances,</hi> if they would be called, <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Deſign</hi> of our <hi>Works</hi> muſt be Right, as well as the <hi>manner</hi> of them. The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> of God has aſſigned for our <hi>Good Works,</hi> is, That the Great God, may be acknowledged, and magnified, and glorified: And the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of God, coming in, has aſſigned a further <hi>Deſign</hi> for them; namely, To expreſs our <hi>Gratitude</hi> unto our Lord Redeemer, for His Redeeming of us. Thus 'tis Enjoined, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Whatever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> An <hi>Evil Intention</hi> will utterly ſpoil any <hi>Good Works,</hi> tho' they were otherwiſe never ſo <hi>Good.</hi> And a meerly <hi>Selfiſh Intention</hi> is an <hi>Evil</hi> one. <hi>Good Works</hi> muſt all be done, with an Eye, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of God, and the <hi>Service</hi> of Chriſt, before any <hi>Temporal Advantage</hi> to <hi>Self</hi>: elſe the

               <hi>Beſt Sacrifices</hi> are but an <hi>Abomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Good Works</hi> muſt proceed from a <hi>Good <hi>Principle</hi>
               </hi>; or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d Heart,</hi> Like a <hi>Good Fountain,</hi> muſt be the <hi>Principle,</hi> from whence <hi>Good Works</hi> are to flow. We are told, in Mat. 12.35. <hi>A Good man, out of the Good Treaſure of the Heart, bringeth forth Good Things.</hi> A <hi>Good Principle</hi> within, is a <hi>Good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Heart. Works</hi> done meerly from a Principle of <hi>Slaviſh Fear,</hi> or <hi>Fleſhly Love,</hi> are not <hi>Good,</hi> tho' they be never ſo <hi>Good.</hi> There muſt be a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Reſpect unto God in Christ,</hi> woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us unto all our <hi>Good Works,</hi> or elſe they are <hi>Stark Naught.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, muſt be in us, as a <hi>Vital Principle,</hi> for our <hi>Good Works,</hi> or elſe they are <hi>Dead Works,</hi> every one of them. Hence, no <hi>Good Works</hi> were ever done by any one <hi>Unregenerate</hi> man, ſince the World began; for every <hi>Unregenerate</hi> man is deſtitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now there is a Second <hi>Caſe</hi> which a Chriſtian has to conſider, that ſo he may be ſtirred up, and helped on, to do thoſe <hi>Good Works</hi> by which he may approve himſelf indeed a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Now we do know this; That our <hi>Good Works</hi> are not <hi>Antecedently</hi> neceſſary unto our <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> before the God of Heaven. For <hi>Good VVorks</hi> cannot be done by any man, <hi>until</hi> he be <hi>Juſtified.</hi> Until a man be <hi>United</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is our <hi>Life,</hi> he is a <hi>Dead man:</hi> and what <hi>Good Works</hi> can a <hi>Dead man</hi> do? This is a thing <hi>Livelily</hi> Preached unto us, by our Lord Himſelf, in the fifteenth Chapter of <hi>John; The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Hence that common ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, Bona Opera ſequuntur Juſtification, non praecedunt Juſtificandum.</hi> No, nor is <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, <hi>As</hi> doing of <hi>Good Works,</hi> that which Enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But then, <hi>Good Works,</hi> are <hi>conſequently</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon our <hi>Juſtification.</hi> 'Tis indeed ſaid, That <hi>God Juſtifies the Ungodly</hi>; but then, He does not Leave them <hi>Ungodly</hi> when He hath <hi>Juſtified</hi> them.

Juſtifying Faith</hi> is a <hi>Tree,</hi> which cannot but have the <hi>Good Fruits</hi> of <hi>Good Works</hi> growing upon it.

Faith</hi> to be a <hi>Working Faith.</hi> The Scriptures of Truth, aſſure us, in Gal. 5.6. <hi>Faith works, by Love.</hi> It was well ſaid, therefore by <hi>John Hus, Ubi Bona Opera non apparent ad extra, ibi Fides non eſt ad intra: Faith</hi> is not <hi>within,</hi> if <hi>Good VVorks</hi> are not <hi>without.

            <p>Again; <hi>Wilt thou know, O man?</hi> That <hi>Good works</hi> are no <hi>Small part</hi> of the <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> which is the Hope and claim of all the <hi>Juſtified.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath <hi>Redeemed</hi> us by His Blood; What for?

their <hi>Redeemer; they remembred that the Lord was their Rock, and their Redeemer,</hi> and yet all is but a <hi>Dead Faith</hi>: thus it is with many.</p>
            <p>When Perſons <hi>Converſions</hi> want due, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected <hi>Reformations,</hi> we judge their work was not a thorow work; and ſo when perſons have had great <hi>Convictions,</hi> and have been in much trouble, and all dyeth away, after a while, without any work of <hi>Faith</hi> at all, ſuch cannot be in any good, or right way: but when much trouble for ſin, and about a mans Eſtate, iſſues in a work of <hi>Faith,</hi> and comfort from ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; we hope well of ſuch many times, but if it be, (as oft it is) but a <hi>Dead Faith,</hi> the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſad, and the <hi>end</hi> like to be miſery for ever: If never ſo many <hi>Promiſes</hi> come to a mans mind, and if never ſo much <hi>Comfort</hi> ariſe there-from; yet if a perſon do take <hi>comfort</hi> (as many do) and yet not take <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his comfort ſhall be taken from him, ſome time or other: yea, if he take <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo, as many do, after a ſort, yet if it be not by a <hi>Lively Faith,</hi> (and what that is we ſhall ſhew) it profits him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: many will ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt out Devils,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet he will profeſs that he never knew them; and they muſt depart from him for ever:</hi> ſee Mat. 7.21, 22. many think they have <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who yet indeed fall ſhort of him: not knowing him indeed, <hi>Whom to Know is Life Eternal,</hi> Joh. 17.3. nor knowing the way to him, nor what it is

And thoſe <hi>good works,</hi> (as they ſeem to be) when ſearched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are but <hi>dead works,</hi> tho' ſeemingly never ſo full of <hi>Life</hi>; and hence they are all as rotten, and unſound things. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. we read of <hi>dead works:</hi> and indeed all a mans <hi>works</hi> are ſuch, until he come to a true <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt; his moſt affectionate <hi>Prayers,</hi> yea, his higheſt Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but <hi>dead works</hi>; tho' a perſon afflict (not his Body only, but) his very Soul; yet God will <hi>take no knowledge of it.</hi> Iſa. 58.3. and how many be in ſuch a caſe as this is, and how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable are they, <hi>wretched, naked, and know it not.</hi> Rev. 3.17.</p>

            <p>But ſome may ſay, who is there that will not own all his <hi>Works</hi> to be of <hi>God,</hi> and deny himſelf in them?

And of this ſorrow and ſhame I ſhall ſay theſe things briefly; a little to open, and enlighten the things we are upon, as we go along. (1.) This <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>abaſement</hi> ariſes from an <hi>enlightning</hi> to ſhew a man more of ſin, than once he ſaw in himſelf; and to ſhew him the <hi>evil</hi> that is in ſin. Firſt there muſt be an <hi>enlightning,</hi> Act. 26.18. <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to light.</hi> There muſt then be an <hi>enlightning,</hi> as alſo we have already hinted: and they have nothing of this <hi>enlightning,</hi> that know nothing of their own <hi>blindneſs</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> who never ſaw, felt and mourned under <hi>that.</hi> And this <hi>enlightning</hi> is to ſhew a man more of <hi>himſelf,</hi> than once he did ſee: for this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, perſons though they live under the light of the Goſpel, yet they don't know how bad and vile they be, until God open their eyes, and cauſe them to know their <hi>abominations</hi>; which is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the work of the Miniſtry, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 2. The <hi>Spirit</hi> working with the word; otherwiſe all is nothing: or the moſt that a perſon will attain, is an <hi>Hiſtorical knowledge</hi> of himſelf, and of his own vileneſs; and his <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> will be anſwerable. Alſo the <hi>evil of ſin</hi> (as we ſaid)
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:000800_0079_0FAA50E22C9DBCD8"/>
muſt be ſeen: ſin muſt be ſeen in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and look with another face, than once it did: it muſt appear <hi>ſin,</hi> which it doth but to a few, and become <hi>exceeding ſinful.</hi> Rom. 7.13. And then a man will be aſhamed and mourn, and not elſe. (2.) This ſorrow and mourning hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a great mixture of <hi>hardneſs</hi> and <hi>pride of heart</hi> with it: for in nothing are we <hi>perfect</hi> in this life; and what is there almoſt that a humbled Soul complains of more, and deſires to get rid of more, than of an <hi>hard,</hi> and a <hi>proud</hi> heart; and ſo much of this is ſometimes ſeen, and felt, that a perſon fears there is <hi>nothing elſe.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. This is certainly one part of a Chriſtians work, and his <hi>Warfare</hi> is within his own heart, with the pride, hardneſs, unbrokenneſs, and other diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers thereof. Some Profeſſors indeed find no hard work with their own hearts, they think they have <hi>all things,</hi> and have <hi>need of nothing</hi>; but theſe are indeed <hi>miſerable, wretched, blind and naked,</hi> Rev. 3.17. They indeed <hi>Pray</hi> for many things, but not from a ſight and ſenſe of their <hi>wants:</hi> they are only <hi>empty words,</hi> which they ſpeak, and the Lord abhors their beſt Prayers. (3.) This ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and abaſement is a <hi>growing thing</hi>: if other Graces grow, this doth; and as this groweth ſo do all other: if a perſon don't grow in <hi>Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> he groweth not at all, ſo <hi>as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to increaſe with the increaſe of God.</hi> Now this growth in ſome, indeed is very little; as ſome men, ſo ſome Chriſtians are very low in ſtature:
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000800_0080_0FAA50E3255EFC70"/>
and there are <hi>Winter ſeaſons</hi> in many Chriſtians lives, in which they grow but little, or not at all: yet in their general courſe they do grow. Joh. 15.2. <hi>He purgeth them that they may bring forth more fruit.</hi> Now conſider this; ſome ſay, they have <hi>Repented</hi> of ſin; and hence ſit down, as if all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were over, and they had no more to do: but if their work be right, it muſt continue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and <hi>grow.</hi> If your <hi>Repentance</hi> be all <hi>over,</hi> and <hi>done,</hi> it was never yet well <hi>begun</hi>: Alas you have deceived your ſelves: think of it, while time laſteth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The main <hi>ſpring</hi> of this ſorrow and abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſome <hi>Goſpel Conſideration</hi>: ſomething of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Grace</hi> of God in him. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. What is that which effectually teacheth a perſon to <hi>deny</hi> his ſin, and to <hi>repent</hi> of it? Truly nothing ſo much as this: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Grace of God appearing.</hi> There be other things, but this is the main. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. two laſt verſes. Conſider then what influences, and motives you are under: is it things <hi>Legal</hi> or <hi>Evangelical?</hi> is it <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Goſpel</hi> that chiefly moves you? you will ſay, how ſhall I know that? <hi>Anſw.</hi>

               <p n="1">(1.) Hath the light of the glorious <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ever been made to ſhine in unto your hearts? To ſome it is <hi>hid.</hi> See 2 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.3, 4, 6. But <hi>God ſhines into the hearts of ſome to give light.</hi> Hath he ever ſhined into thy heart? Hath the light of the Goſpel been unto thee, the moſt glorious light?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Do <hi>Goſpel Conſiderations</hi> influence, and

work on your hearts? it may be you can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>fear</hi>: but doth the <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt ever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain</hi> you. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15.

The ſecond fruit to be conſidered of (by way of tryal) is <hi>Mortification</hi> of ſin, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the Soul from it, which is a <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> Acts 15.9. <hi>Purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> The <hi>heart</hi> is never <hi>purified</hi>; and <hi>ſin</hi> is never <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,</hi> until <hi>faith</hi> come: and that always doth ſomething this way, unleſs it be a <hi>Dead faith.</hi> Sin may be as it were ſtunned, and knockt on the head, by <hi>Convictions,</hi> and legal terrors, but is never <hi>mortified,</hi> until <hi>faith</hi> come, and then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done indeed.</p>
               <p>Now, having mentioned this, as one thing to try our ſelves by, we muſt clear and open the point, and endeavour to free it, ere we leave it, from whatſoever might cloud and darken it: And the difficulty is to ſhew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the effects of <hi>Legal terrors,</hi> and <hi>Common Convictions</hi> in <hi>restraining ſin,</hi> and that of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>mortifying ſin:</hi> and the difference between that effect which that <hi>faith</hi> which is yet indeed but a <hi>Dead faith</hi> may have upon <hi>ſin,</hi> and that which a <hi>Lively faith</hi> hath in <hi>mortifying</hi> of ſin.</p>
               <p>And firſt we ſhall conſider the difference that is between <hi>Legal Terrors reſtraining</hi> Sin; and that of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>mortifying</hi> it. And here I promiſe

this one thing: <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>particular Luſts,</hi> by <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Terrors,</hi> and common convictions, are many times, as it were <hi>benummed,</hi> in a <hi>ſwound,</hi> when not at all <hi>mortifyed</hi>; and here many deceive themſelves; they find no preſent diſpoſition, or inclination to their former luſts, but ſome <hi>averſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from them, and hence they think they are throughly reformed, and <hi>mortified,</hi> when as there is no ſuch thing; they have only changed their <hi>way of ſinning</hi>; as he that was a groſs Sinner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, is now a <hi>formal Profeſſor,</hi> a <hi>ſelf-righteous Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now when ſin is only <hi>ſtunned</hi> and <hi>benummed</hi> with <hi>Legal Terrors,</hi> and forced as it were to pull in its head, and to ſhrink back into the deep, &amp;c dark corners of the heart, and ſo to find another vent, a more ſecret, and undiſcovered paſſage. Then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A mans life in <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>mercenary</hi>; all his Obedience is <hi>Legal,</hi> and <hi>Servile</hi>; not <hi>filial</hi>: ſuch a perſons Obedience is but an endeavouring to pay the <hi>debt</hi> of Satisfaction for Sin which he ows to God, and to pacify his <hi>anger,</hi> which he hopes to do, by a better walking then formerly; and though ſuch perſons do not profeſs ſo, yet really it is ſo, with them. And hence one of theſe things following, may be ſaid of them: either (1) They deceive themſelves in thinking all is <hi>well</hi> with them, when it is not. (2) They
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000800_0086_0FAA50E9A6F09120"/>
find that they cannot make their <hi>peace</hi> with God, and ſo return again to folly; or elſe (3) Spend their time in a <hi>wearyiſh formality,</hi> and ſo periſh for ever at laſt.—(1) Some think, they have paid their debt, by their <hi>repentings,</hi> and <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and other <hi>good works</hi>; and hence their minds are at reſt, in ſome meaſure; but there comes an <hi>after reckoning</hi> at death, when it appears that their coin is not current: &amp; what they truſt to will not be accepted; the Lord abhors all that they have offered to him for <hi>payment</hi>; and hence they are <hi>caſt into Hell,</hi> where they are for ever <hi>tormented</hi>; for they can never pay the debt. (2) Some find that by all they do, they cannot make their <hi>peace</hi> with God; they are ſtill running into arrearages: ſtill God is <hi>provoked</hi> by them dayly; and hence complain that their <hi>labour is in vain,</hi> that they ſerve an <hi>hard maſter.</hi> Mat. 25.24. that gathers where he had not ſowen; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires obedience, but gives not ſtrength anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and hence grow diſcouraged, and like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, finding the difficulties of the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> would return into <hi>Egypt</hi> again: ſo theſe forſake the Lord, and his Service, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their <hi>old wayes</hi> again, or ſome other as bad: as the <hi>dog to his vomit.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. ult. (3) Some wear out their time in a heartleſs, uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and unprofitable attendance to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Religion</hi>; they do <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as be the wainings or increaſe of their own righteouſneſs, or <hi>legal performances:</hi> for the

                  <hi>way of peace they have not known</hi>; and there is no <hi>judgment in their goings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the true believer, his obedience is <hi>filial</hi>: he goes to <hi>work,</hi> but not to <hi>pay his debt:</hi> for he hath ſeen that done already by <hi>another,</hi> or knows that if ever it be done, it muſt be by <hi>another</hi>; and hence the main ſpring of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is <hi>Love</hi> to God, and his great Redeemer; <hi>his faith works by love.</hi> Gal. 5.6. it will work, or ſet a man on work; but how? by <hi>love.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. This <hi>Faith</hi> then doth not ſet a man on work, to pay old debts, or new, which no man can do any thing of, either more or leſs: though many attempt it daily, who yet perhaps under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what they do, and ſo undo themſelves, but ſee not how, until it be too late.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then a mans <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> is not like that of a true believers: What is the <hi>legal</hi> mans <hi>hope? Anſw.</hi> That God will not caſt him into <hi>Hell,</hi> when he dyes. What is his comfort in this world? <hi>Anſw.</hi> His comfort is partly that <hi>hope,</hi> and partly ſome <hi>luſt,</hi> or creature-comfort, that he feeds upon, and commits Spiritual <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> with every day, continually. What do theſe <hi>hopes</hi> ſtand on? What are they built on? <hi>Anſw.</hi> His own <hi>Obedience,</hi> and ſomething in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and hence as he find things there, <hi>better</hi> or <hi>worſe</hi> as he reckons, ſo his <hi>hopes</hi> are higher, or lower, they ebb or flow accordingly, as we have but now intimated. Well, how is it with the

true believer, what are his <hi>hopes?

                  <hi>Every vally ſhall be filled, and every mountain, and hill ſhall be brought low</hi>;—and then, <hi>All fleſh ſhall ſee the Salvation of God.

               <p>The next thing to be ſpoken to is this, <hi>viz.</hi> the difference between that effect which that faith, which is indeed but a <hi>Dead faith</hi> may have upon ſin, and that which a <hi>Lively faith</hi> hath in <hi>mortifying</hi> of ſin: for there is in ſome a work; not only meerly <hi>legal,</hi> or rather, in that degree <hi>legal</hi>: for ſome <hi>legalliſts</hi> are more groſs than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but together with it, there is a <hi>Faith,</hi> though indeed, but a <hi>Dead faith,</hi> and even this <hi>faith</hi> hath in them, ſome effects on <hi>ſin,</hi> to <hi>reſtrain</hi> it, though it never <hi>mortify</hi> it. Thus, I conceive it was with them, Pſal. 78.34, 35, 36. <hi>They ſought him; and they returned, &amp; enquired early after God</hi>: and not only ſo; <hi>but they remembred that God was their rock, and the high God, their Redeemer.</hi> What then is, and how may we diſcover the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? In true <hi>faith</hi> there is <hi>Love</hi>; ſo in that which is yet but A <hi>Dead faith,</hi> there is A <hi>Love</hi> too, though not ſuch a <hi>Love,</hi> as is in the former:
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000800_0091_0FAA50EDD5C00DE0"/>
we muſt then ſee, if we can make the difference, or ſhew it, in ſome few things at leaſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where this <hi>true love,</hi> or <hi>lively faith</hi> is, which <hi>purifies the heart,</hi> and engageth the Soul in <hi>mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin,</hi> there is an <hi>hatred</hi> to <hi>All ſin.</hi> Pſa. 119.104 <hi>I hate every falſe way.</hi> In others there may be a falling out, with a ſin, a quarrel with it for a ſeaſon; as true <hi>Lovers</hi> may have their fallings out: but here is a real, and a rooted <hi>Hatred.</hi> Now it muſt needs be a <hi>great work</hi> whereby, &amp; <hi>

A making out, in the uſe of <hi>means</hi> after, an <hi>utter abolition,</hi> and <hi>rooting cut of ſin:</hi> ſo that nothing will give the heart full reſt, or content, while any thing of <hi>ſin</hi> ſtill remaineth.

               <p n="2">2. This true, lively <hi>faith,</hi> which makes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſeek to <hi>Mortify</hi> his ſin; it ſets him on <hi>work,</hi> as Gal. 5.6.

               <p>Now it is true that an unſound Profeſſor may <hi>do many things,</hi> as <hi>Herod</hi> did, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. he may <hi>abound</hi> with Religious performances, as they <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11. had <hi>multitude of ſacrifices,</hi> yet to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: the Lord ſaith that he was <hi>full of them</hi>: So they Iſa. 58.2. <hi>Sought him daily.</hi> Yet there is this difference alſo, beſides what hath been ſaid.

But true <hi>faith</hi> teaches a man to look chiefly where God looks chiefly, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>manner</hi> of performance, to the ſincerity and uprightneſs of the heart in all duties. And hence what complaints do true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers many times make of <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> and <hi>by ends</hi> in duties, of <hi>ſelf ſeekings,</hi> and the like, which they cannot wholly lay aſide &amp; free themſelves from?

               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt ſubmit to his <hi>Government:</hi> he muſt <hi>rule</hi> us; diſpence to us, diſpoſe of us, and of all that doth concern us, as he will: and he that will be his <hi>diſciple</hi> muſt <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> take up his <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>follow him.</hi> Matth. 16.24. This is difficult, and yet it muſt be done, and that <hi>daily,</hi> Luk. 9.23. This ſubmitting is in a <hi>low degree</hi> in ſome of the Children of God: but where there is <hi>nothing</hi> of it, there is no <hi>true faith.</hi> And he lives the ſweeteſt life of all, that
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:000800_0126_0FAA4FFB5A080830"/>
lives moſt in a a real <hi>reſignation</hi> of himſelf, and of all his concerns, into the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, ſubmitting all unto the will, and wiſdom of this <hi>King of Kings:</hi> and this is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by all that profeſs faith in Chriſt Jeſus. To <hi>believe</hi> in him, and <hi>rebel</hi> againſt him, how do theſe agree? or to ſay, he ſhall be <hi>King,</hi> but yet not <hi>rule</hi> us: but we will direct him in his dealings with us, or with ours, or with the Church of God. It is certain that there are many that reject the <hi>Government</hi> of Chriſt, and hence whatever they pretend, their <hi>Faith</hi> is not right. And when I have opened this a little, you will further ſee what it is, that I exhort, and direct you to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some do openly and manifeſtly <hi>reject</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus: they live in <hi>open rebellion</hi> againſt him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.9. They practically ſay as Luk. 19.14, 27. <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us</hi>; and he calls them his <hi>Enemies.</hi> Some do <hi>openly,</hi> and manifeſtly caſt off his Government. (1) Sometimes by living in ſins of <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> (2) Sometimes by living in ſins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi>; when they will not attend to every <hi>known duty.</hi> Luk. 1.6. They did <hi>walk in all the Ordinances, and Commandments of the Lord</hi>: when any <hi>known duty,</hi> or ordinance of Chriſt is neglected, and men continue ſo to do, how doth Chriſt <hi>rule</hi> in them; do not they caſt off his yoke?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:000800_0127_0FAA4FFC4D836960"/>2. Some do <hi>ſecretly</hi> caſt off his <hi>Government</hi>; though they make an <hi>outward profeſſion</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and be <hi>outwardly</hi> conformable unto his Laws; yet <hi>inwardly</hi> they reject him, and caſt off his Government. Thus do many, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as live in any <hi>particular known ſin,</hi> though it be <hi>ſecret:</hi> thus do many. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.9. There is <hi>ſecret</hi> Drunkenneſs, and <hi>ſecret</hi> Uncleanneſs, and <hi>ſecret</hi> neglects of duties, and Cloſet work: now when perſons live in <hi>ſecret ſins,</hi> they do really though not manifeſtly caſt off the yoke and <hi>Government</hi> of Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.12. <hi>It is a ſhame to ſpeak what ſome do in ſecret.</hi> And what ſome do actually, others do in their <hi>ſecret thoughts</hi> and cogitations: there is <hi>heart</hi> Adultery, and <hi>heart</hi> Murder, and <hi>heart</hi> Pride, and the like; little or nothing of which appears <hi>outwardly</hi>: but the day comes, when the <hi>hidden things of darkneſs, ſhall be brought to light,</hi> and the <hi>counſels of the heart made manifeſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.5. And then it will be ſeen that many that now carry a <hi>fair face</hi> among men, are <hi>abominable Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as are not at all <hi>kept at work with their own hearts</hi> day by day: theſe <hi>ſecretly</hi> caſt off his <hi>Government</hi>: it appears thus; our great work every day is with our own <hi>hearts,</hi> and we muſt <hi>watch</hi> them, and <hi>keep</hi> them for
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:000800_0128_0FAA4FFCB629D070"/>
Chriſt. He hath ſo commanded, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. The <hi>heart</hi> is the <hi>Temple</hi> of God in which he deſires to dwell; and we muſt endeavour to <hi>keep</hi> it for him, leaſt we prove treacherous and traitors. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. We may talk of <hi>truſting</hi> in him, but we deceive our ſelves; we have faith, but it is a <hi>Dead</hi> faith. It is in vain to cry, <hi>Hail Maſter,</hi> to make a <hi>fair Profeſſion,</hi> while our <hi>hearts</hi> are in a manner only a poſſeſſion of <hi>unclean,</hi> or <hi>vain things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as quarrel with <hi>croſſes</hi> and <hi>afflictions. Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>no evil in the City, but the Lord hath done it; no croſs</hi> but he hath ſent it; it is <hi>his croſs</hi>; now when perſons will not <hi>take up</hi> the Croſs, but their <hi>hearts</hi> will <hi>break,</hi> before their <hi>wills</hi> will <hi>bow,</hi> how doth Chriſt now <hi>reign,</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> in their hearts? it is true, much <hi>unſubduedneſs</hi> is in ſome of the Children of God, even <hi>Jonah</hi> was very froward. <hi>ch.</hi> 4.9. but when perſons will not <hi>labour</hi> to ly under the will of Chriſt, &amp; ſo to do is not <hi>precious</hi> to them; truly they caſt off his <hi>Government,</hi> and may conſider whether or not there is cauſe to fear that <hi>he</hi> will reject, and caſt off them at laſt, as ſuch as would not deny them ſelves, and ſubmit to his Croſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such as ſeem to <hi>ſubmit</hi> themſelves unto the <hi>will</hi> of Chriſt, but not by the <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt: what they do is by their <hi>own power,</hi> and ability: this is to bring in a <hi>forreign power</hi> ſecretly, and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:000800_0129_0FAA4FFD66B5F538"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not <hi>King</hi> in that Soul, he doth not <hi>reign</hi> there. See 2 Theſ. 1.11, 12. He muſt work all, by <hi>his power,</hi> that he may be glorified. Now conſider this; you ſay, you do this or that, and you ſubmit to the will of God, but by what <hi>power</hi>? is it by the <hi>power of Chriſt</hi>? you will it may be, ſay, <hi>Yes:</hi> but I anſwer, conſider it well: if it be, then the more you attain, the <hi>meaner</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> you will be in your own eyes, as <hi>Paul</hi> that had attained unto <hi>much,</hi> yet ſaith, <hi>I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.11. do you find it thus? as I may ſay, <hi>gaining</hi> one way, and <hi>looſing</hi> another, <hi>growing greater,</hi> and yet withal <hi>growing leſs?</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand aright, and conſider it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as ſeem to ſubmit to Chriſt, but not out of <hi>reſpect,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but in all they do, they ſeek <hi>themſelves,</hi> as they did. Zech. 7.5, 6. <hi>did you do it unto me, even unto me.</hi>— So here, you read, you pray, you do <hi>many things,</hi> which Chriſt commands; did not <hi>Herod</hi> as much. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. but if the Lord ſay at laſt, <hi>did you do it unto me, even unto me,</hi> that will be ſaid. Again, ſome ſeem to ſubmit under Croſſes, and Afflictions, but ſometimes it is rather <hi>hardneſs</hi> of heart, than ſubmiſſion; <hi>they cry not when he binds them; they deſpiſe the Chaſtiſement of the Lord</hi>; and then ſeem to ſubmit: in other ſome it is more from <hi>natural temper,</hi> than from <hi>Grace.</hi> And often there is no <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> where there
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:000800_0130_0FAA4FFE3AB655A0"/>
ſeem to be a great deal; and that which is a <hi>great tryal</hi> to <hi>one</hi> man, is none at all to <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to cloſe, and ſhut up all that I ſhall ſay on this Subject, conſider only this word; <hi>viz.</hi> if your <hi>Faith</hi> be found at laſt to be a <hi>Dead Faith,</hi> it will be dreadful: for conſider what elſe might be ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe few <hi>Sermons</hi> will be ſo many <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> againſt you that have heard them; they will riſe up in Judgment againſt you: He that <hi>Uttered</hi> them, and all they alſo that <hi>profited</hi> by them, ſhall appear in <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt you; and perhaps theſe and thoſe whom you now <hi>deſpiſe,</hi> ſhall one day be your <hi>Judges.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſhall then appear that you had <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Conviction</hi>: but you would not ſee that you <hi>held faſt deceit,</hi> as they did. Jer. 8.5. that you would not come unto the light; now it may be, you ſay, you are <hi>willing</hi> to ſee, but then it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that you <hi>refuſed Conviction</hi>; and being evil, <hi>choſe darkneſs rather than light,</hi> and indeed <hi>hated knowledge.</hi> Prov. 1.29.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your <hi>Damnation</hi> will be the greater, your <hi>Hell</hi> the hotter, your <hi>puniſhment</hi> the heavier, and <hi>torment</hi> the more intollerable: you may now neglect <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and make light of <hi>Sermons,</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:000800_0131_0FAA4FFF38184678"/>
ſoon forget all Searching Truths; but there is a day coming, when perſons ſhall be judged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have been, and done and means of <hi>Grace</hi> which they have enjoyed it is good to think much of that great and dreadful day, and thereby be ſtirred up to labour for, and to make ſure of, <hi>A Faith in Chriſt,</hi> which will not at laſt be found a <hi>Dead Faith</hi>; all ſuch will be <hi>Led forth with Workers of Iniquity</hi>: as Pſal. 125. ult. whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> is when tried, but a <hi>Dead Faith.</hi> Let your great care be to be <hi>Sound in the Faith,</hi> as the phraſe is. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>Examine your ſelves dayly, whether you be in the Faith; prove your own ſelves.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. all we can do here, is little enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and provide for that <hi>one hour of Death</hi>; that time when we muſt go hence, and be no more ſeen in this World.</p>
