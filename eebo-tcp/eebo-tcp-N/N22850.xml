            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHAT can be more ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the human mind than the appearance of one of thoſe fallen angels that were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of heaven, and now make the habitations of darkneſs their homes! Such an appearance would ſtrike terror into the moſt unſhaken mind, the moſt hard &amp; ſtubborn heart; yea, of ſuch a kind as no one can conceive of, but thoſe who have had the trial, which has been ours—an account of which we now ſend abroad.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 24th of May, 1784, John Cheſſelden and James Arkins, ſet out from Kenfry, a town near the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi, to viſit an old friend of ours, who lived about twenty

The road that led to this place was through a wood, called Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num's wood, on account of its belonging to one Varnum. We ſat out about 8 o'clock in the morning; ſoon after which, James Arkins began to tell me, (John Cheſſelden) that ſhould we in paſſing this wood, meet with ſuch a devil of a fright as Iſaac King did, (a perſon who paſſed them a few months before, and ſuppoſed he ſaw a perſon without either head or arms) we ſhould deſerve to ſtay in them, and never be ſuffered to return or paſs them. He likewiſe ſaid that perſons of the character of King, ought to be baniſhed from the ſociety of all that had either ſpirits or common ſenſe; and that he defied all the devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the infernal regions to intimidate him in the leaſt, ſhould they be pleaſed to appear to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

this ſpeech of his, I undertook to reprimand him for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded talk, telling him that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſuppoſed the ſaid King was frightened, at nothing more than imagination, yet I believed the devil was often permitted to appear to men, tho' we had not ſeen the appearance, This talk ſeemed greatly to raiſe his ſpirits, inſomuch that he ſaid if there ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er appeared a devil or any ſpirit unto men while on earth, he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he might in paſſing this wood, have one of them for a gueſt.</p>
            <p>Little did he, as well as myſelf thing of theſe words of his being fulfilled; which however was done, in a moſt frightful and ſhocking manner; in a manner which clearly ſhewed it to be the hand of heaven, that it ſhould be as he deſired, and which ſhews us that the all-wiſe God obſerves the actions of men, and often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

had not proceeded above two miles after this converſation was over, before we came to a ſmall river which croſſed the road, at which we made a ſtop and ſat down; we had not ſat there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eight or ten minutes before we heard a ruſtling among the leaves at ſome diſtance, and which we ſuppoſed to be occaſioned by porcupines, which are very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thoſe parts. Here we ſat for ſome time waiting to ſee theſe ſuppoſed creatures come into our view, which ſeemed to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, though very moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but at length reſolved not to wait for their coming, but ſet out to meet them. We had not gone far before we roſe a ſmall hill, on the other ſide of which, near the bottom, ſtood a large bunch of buſhes, in which was this ruſttling of leaves. We both deſcended the hill till we came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

ſudden iſſued out of them a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of ſmoke, together with a beaſt as large as a mooſe, of the moſt tremendous and hideous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, ſomething like that of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though infinitely more ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as his eyes appeared to be a very flame of fire in its full ſtrength, and out of his mouth went a ſmoke like that of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. He had not been out of the buſhes above the ſpabe of a minute, before he ſtood erect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feet, and greatly altered both in ſhape and geſture; at the ſight of which we both fell proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate on the ground, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a while, wholly inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; when at length, I John Cheſſelden partly recovered from my inſenſibility and raiſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up partly on my hands and feet, diſcovered this monſter about three yards from me, in a hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal poſture, in the clear fluid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

earth, having the perfect form of a man, except a head, of which he was wholly deſtitute. My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, James Arkins, being not yet recovered, I thought, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to do it, and endeavour to make our eſcape from the feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tyrant: whereupon I ſtepped up to him and upon gently touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, he immediately, its great ſurprize ſprang up, and with a loud voice exclaimed, God be merciful to me the greateſt of ſinners, and moſt worthy of thy diſpleaſure. Upon theſe words being pronounced, this truly frightful monſter immediately left his ſituation in the air, and ſtood upright on his feet before the ſaid James Arkins, without either head or hands, and in the very form which the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned King had repreſented. In this poſture he continued for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſpace of half an hour, ſtanding the whole of the time
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030187_0009_0FE4FD2F0AFE9728"/>
directly before the ſaid Arkins, and imitating him in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, even in the very motion of his fingers; till at length he gradually drew back from us, and ſeated himſelf near a ſmall ſtream that paſſed at the bottom of this hill, about twenty rods from where we now were. Here in this place he ſent forth the moſt horrid cry that perhaps ever mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals heard, or devils uttered. It was ſo ſtrong a ſound, that the earth where we ſtood was in great commotion, and every tree ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be leaving its foudation. It is not poſſible to deſcribe our feelings at theſe moments when we expected ſo ſhortly to bid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu to our earthly bodies; to be deſtroyed by this univerſal ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; what to do we knew not; to flee from him was not in our power.

we reſolved to make an attempt to return, which was not above two miles and an half. No ſooner had we attempted to move, than the monſter aroſe from his ſeat, which when he took, he was without head or hands, or any kind of garment, but was now adorned with all theſe, and of the moſt dazzling appearance; and truly had a more ſtriking appearance than the greateſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate or prince on earth;— and in this form made up to us, where he ſtood for ſome time, as likewiſe did we, without either attempting to move in the leaſt; but at length we undertook to proceed on our way back from whence we came, which when he ſaw, he made up to us, and with a very pleaſant voice, ſaid, why do you hurry yourſelves, friends; I will ſhortly be your companion, and will attend you where you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

countenances, what can be the cauſe of it? pray let me know, and I will free you from it; come, young friends, walk as I do; upon which he immediately clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf from the earth, and walked about three feet above the ſurface, which was truly a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight, and highly aſtoniſhing. After he had proceeded in this manner about 20 rods, he again came upon the ſurface of the earth, and proceeded with us on our way until we were within one hundred rods of our habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when he told us we had got to go a little way with him, where he would ſhew us ſeveral cities, moſt elegantly adorned with a thouſand objects that would highly elevate us, and where he ſaid were many pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant dwelling places, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, we ſhould ſo greatly fancy that he believed we ſhould be willing to take up with them

for our abodes and laſting homes, where likewiſe he ſaid were many that ſpoke our language, and he believed were our countrymen. After this ſpeech of his, I John Cheſſelden made anſwer to him in theſe words: My buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a nature it renders it impoſſible for me to attend you to this delightſome dwelling, muſt therefore beg you to let me paſs, together with my compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, until ſome other ſeaſon and more convenient opportunity. Upon this ſpeech of mine, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared greatly incenſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately caught James Arkins by the hair of his head, and with a horrid cry ſaid, what ſuch young upſtarts as you diſobey my will! Where were you, when old Adam and Eve in paradiſe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence ſtood? why did not they diſobe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> my will? After he had ſaid theſe words he ſet Arkins at his liberty, but not without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030187_0013_0FE4FD308F64BC20"/>
out at leaſt one half of the hair of his head, and wounding him in many parts of his body. Now it was about ſunſet, and we were at leaſt four miles from any inhabitants, in this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation, never expecting to be in any other, with Arkins groaning with his wounds and death ſtaring us in the face on every ſide.—Here, gentle reader, drop a tear at our condition in theſe moments, when we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never to eſcape to inform the world of our feelings or the cauſe of our deaths. But Heaven be praiſed; now did we even in theſe moments that ſo ſhortly threatened our ruin, get from his infernal hands. Seeing night was come upon us, and we ſtill in the hands of the devil, who every minute would aſſume what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever forms he pleaſed, and them which were the moſt ſhocking to behold, I reſolved to look up to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030187_0014_0FE4FD3213235678"/>
heaven for relief, fell upon my bended knees and cryed with a loud voice to him who made the heavens, that he would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to be deſtroyed by this fallen angel, who was driven out of heaven and ſentenced to dwell in chains and everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Immediately upon the tyrant's hearing theſe words, he vaniſhed out of our ſight, and was gone; upon which I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took Arkins on my back, who was ſo wounded that he could not walk, and arrived ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at our own homes about 8 o' clock at night.</p>
            <p>But by the way, we muſt not forget to inform the reader, that among the many forms this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant aſſumed, was this truly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing one: as the dark of the evening approached, Arkins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great diſtreſs with his wounds, and as I ſuppoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhattered in reaſon, he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

out, who, or which of you can deliver me out of theſe deep agonies? upon which the devil ſaid, I will give you the relief you deſerve, and inſtantly mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large rock, upon which he had the perfect form of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, both lying proſtrate, one like a man when expiring, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt piercing groans that perhaps ever mortals heard, and ſaying, oh my ruined and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul! The other form in ſome meaſure reſembled a man, tho' much larger, with one cloven foot, his face black, and geſtures very terrible. After they had continued in this poſture ſome time, the one in form of a man, uttered ſeveral more piercing groans than any of the former, and violently ſtruggling, ſeemed to die immediately! upon which there ſeemed to come or evapor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from his body, the ſame form or likeneſs, to appearance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

of pure air, whick kept in a gentle motion or tremor for ſome time—when at length, this other form aroſe upon his feet, with an aſpect very terrible, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to the utmoſt extremity of the rock, where he extended his arms to receive this form in the air, which gradually made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, tho ſeemingly with great reluctance, until it came within them, when he graſped it with the greateſt fury, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately leaped down upon the ground, which when his feet touched, gave way for the ſpace of two rods in circumference, and ſunk directly down, leaving a large cavity, into which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended with this form or body in his arms, where appeared melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed minerals or brimſtone, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which they both continued ſome time, where were groans not to be uttered. At length he who had the cloven
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030187_0017_0FE4FD5362D48100"/>
foot came out of this place, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other behind, who ſent forth ſuch ſhrieks as we ſhall not attempt to deſcribe, as language would be too feeble for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. Upon his coming out of this place, he returned to this rock, and on touching it with one hand it rolled over and entirely ſhut up the cavity or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in the earth, when all was ſilent; he then put on many frightful ſhapes by turns, till at length he vaniſhed and was gone.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of our giving the reader a more particular account of this laſt appearance was, that we verily believe it to have had great reſemblance to a perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning his breath, and having his immortal ſoul committed by the great Sovereign of the univerſe into the hands of the prince of darkneſs. Surely it muſt have been the emblem of this, as one of theſe forms was the exact pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030187_0018_0FE4FD59C8704358"/>
of one in the agonies of death, as the very image of the immortal ſoul appeared in open air, near the form of the body with the monſter, this univerſal tyrant receiving and conſinging it to this true deſcription of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs torments.</p>
            <p>And ſince this was without doubt a repreſentation of what we have ſaid, where ſhall the wretch be found, ſo hard and ſo ſtupid as to one day more, yea one hour, follow the ways of the devil, however inviting they may appear; for they will ſurely lead to the death of the immortal ſoul! Tho' he now ſmiles at thy ways, he will at death appear as he did to us upon this rock (moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) and after groaning life away as the form did, he will, with the ſame ferocity, confine the ſoul in endleſs miſery, and a rock will be rolled to the cavern's mouth, never to be moved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030187_0019_0FE4FD5B4C9E54D8"/>During the whole day nothing gave me a greater ſhock, than to hear the devil ſay to Arkins, I will give you the relief you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as I ſuppoſe he meant by this to make an attempt upon our lives, and his appearing upon the rock as he did ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the opinion. Without doubt he intended by this to ſhow us, that he had a will, though he had not power, quickly to deſtroy our ſouls, and confine them in the dark abyſs which he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us; but heaven be praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was not permitted, but ſent his way, without executing his plan, and we were conducted to our habitations, rejoicing in the ſtrength of the Lord, and praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his holy name for this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deliverance.</p>
            <p>The next morning we related the narrative to our friends, which ſoon ſpread thro' the town, and before 12 o'clock there were at
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030187_0020_0FE4FD4CF148D628"/>
leaſt two hundred people collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with countenances that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſorrow of the deepeſt nature, ſuppoſing it was an appearance that foreboded their deſtruction, was the appearance real, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of which, Arkins ſhewed them his wounds; but this not being ſufficient, we told them that by walking with us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Varnum's wood, they would be convinced; upon which four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons turned out and went with us, viz. James Erwin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Cole, Benjamin Guy, and Samuel Ford, to whom we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rock which was moved, and which wholly ſatisfied them as to the truth of it; we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with theſe four men, who told the people that what we had related was without doubt true, as the huge rock was moved (for ſo it was called) at leaſt 12 feet; which when they heard they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and we were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030187_0021_0FE4FD5DED56FEA0"/>
them and related the whole affair, with the converſation that paſſed between us before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the wood, which greatly ſatisfied them, for, ſaid they, it was to puniſh a wicked perſon, and not to deſtroy us, as we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined. After the people's fears were abated, Mr. John Boyd, who was preaching in theſe parts, and who came to enquire into the matter, called us out, and in the preſence of all the people ſaid, "the appearance of the devil is a great and ſhocking ſight to the human mind, yet not ſo ſhocking as the ſight of one who makes light of it, and can deliberately, when a little out of humour, wiſh him to be his companion and gueſt: ſurely the ſight of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theſe ought to ſtrike us with vaſtly greater aſtoniſhment than the former. It ought to put each one of us upon ſtrict enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whether we are wholly free
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030187_0022_0FE4FEB777E470F0"/>
from ſuch an abominable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. All muſt be convinced by what happened yeſterday, that the great God takes notice of the words and actions of men, and often in this life gives them what they ſay they deſire. And as we know he is a being of juſtice, we may conclude, that thoſe who paſs through this life in a courſe of ſin, and yet go unpuniſhed, muſt, when they die, be ſentenced to that world, where they muſt ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er remain in unſpeakable miſery and deſpair. We ſee one before us who has been taken at his word, and in a ſhocking manner wounded by one who he wiſhed might attend him. What can he ſay? he has had his wiſh. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him and take warning, flee his ways with the greateſt abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. May this be a mean of turning him into the ways of righteouſneſs and every one preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, till we ſhall ſay theſe are the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030187_0023_0FE4FD3ED2FBD918"/>
ways of pleaſantneſs and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Then will the Lord ſmile on this new world, and chooſe it for his habitation from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation."</p>
            <p>After this ſpeech James Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins in preſence of all the people, came forth, ſhewed his wounds and with tears in his eyes ſaid, theſe have I received juſtly, and had I received my deſerts, I muſt confeſs it would have been to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with the devils to the endleſs ages of eternity. Here, my friends, you ſee one who has lived in a courſe of ſin, and at length was ſo hardened as even to deſire the devil for a gueſt in bodily ſhape. Be admoniſhed, my friends, not to follow ſuch ſteps as theſe, but flee them with the utmoſt deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Let it ſtrike horror upon every ſoul that makes light of thoſe things, and at every trifle will wiſh his appearance. Let it remind us that all our words are
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030187_0024_0FE4FCF5632E68A0"/>
taken notice of, and will at ſome period come upon us, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps when we are not aware of it. Let it be the means of reforming my ways, and all others of this character, and of turning unto the Lord for mercy, which if we do, perhaps he may attend upon our cry and ſave us, which ſhall ever be the prayer of</p>
