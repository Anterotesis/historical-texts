            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

When therefore our Minds are effectually Influenced by this God-like Vertue, inſtead of ſaying, <hi>go, be warmed, be filled;</hi> we ſhall ſincerely Endeavour as we have Opportunity, <hi>to do good to all Men.</hi> But in as much as we
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007407_0005_102BAE124D968BD0"/>
ha'n't the ſame Advantages, to ſhew the Effects of our Charity to ſome, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (for ſome are raiſed to ſuch a Pitch of Grandure, and Dignity, that they are above our Reach; others are at ſuch a Diſtance from us; that we don't ſo much as know them, or the Nation they belong to; and our Enemies by their Perverſeneſs, and ill Nature, may render themſelves uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive Benefit by us;) the only way therefore for us to ſhew our Chriſtian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in ſuch Caſes, is by our fervent Addreſſes at the Throne of Grace on their Behalf. But whether we can actually do good to Men, or no; the great Duty of Interceſſion for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is not to be neglected; for the moſt that we (or indeed the very Angels themſelves,) can do for them, is juſt nothing at all, in Compariſon of that great Good, that GOD may beſtow upon them, in Anſwer to our Prayers. We need not marvel therefore, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of this, as a Duty of ſuch great Importance. <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions, &amp; giving of Thanks, be made for all Men.</hi> We muſt pray for all Men, Friends, and Enemies, Relations and Strangers, Bond and Free. But as our own Peace, the civil and religious Intereſts of the Community, and the beſt good of Rulers themſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007407_0006_102BAE1482BC1E78"/>
upon their Conduct; therefore we are eſpecially <hi>to pray for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</hi> And we are directed what to pray for on their Account; <hi>viz.</hi> That they may be Influenced by GOD's Grace, and have his Bleſſing upon their Perſons, and Adminiſtrations, that under their Protection <hi>we may lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſundry things of very great Importance, that we may obſerve from theſe Words. Particularly,</p>
            <p>That civil Government is a divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and therefore we muſt pray for GOD's Bleſſing upon all that are in Authority, as being GOD's Miniſters.</p>
            <p>That the Work of Rulers is of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and attended with peculiar Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and accordingly they ſtand in need of the Prayers of good Men.</p>
            <p>That good Rulers are a great Bleſſing to a People, ſince under their Influence, and Protection, their civil and religious Intereſts are Secure; ſo that <hi>they may lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the People owe Obedience, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to then Rulers; without which they can have no Peace, Godlineſs, for Honeſty.</p>
            <p>That Subjects ought not only to acquieſce in, but be thankful for, the good Offices of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007407_0007_102BAE179617E240"/>
their Rulers; for Thankſgiving is to be joyned with Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſſions.</p>
            <p>That People are not animated with a chriſtian Spirit, nor truly ſenſible of their own Intereſt, when they neglect to pray for their Rulers.</p>
            <p>And that all Men ought to Improve the Advantages they enjoy under a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>by leading a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Each of theſe Obſervations might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oper Entertainment, for ſuch an Occaſion as this; yet I ſhall not expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate upon either of them: But what I have chiefly in View as the Subject of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is this;—</p>
            <p>That when civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, they will ſincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote not only the Peace, and outward Proſperity; but likewiſe the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Intereſts of the People under their Government.</p>
            <p>The Rulers of the World, when this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle was Written, were Heathen; and the great Thing that their Subjects were to pray for on their Behalf was, that they might be Converted, and ſo become ſincere Chriſtians, and then it would follow, that under their Government they might lead a quiet, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007407_0008_102BAE1997B198F8"/>
peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. And we muſt now pray for <hi>them that rule over Men, that they may be juſt, ruling in the fear of God;</hi> for if this be their true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, we may reſt Satisfied that their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours will not be wanting, to ſecure to us our juſt Rights, Civil, and Religious.</p>
            <p>But that I may expreſs my Sentiments upon this Subject, with as much Clearneſs, and Brevity as I can; I ſhall endeavour to ſhow,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> That the good of Society in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, (next to the Glory of GOD,) is the direct End of civil Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> Althô Religion is not the direct, and immediate Object, of the Concern of civil Rulers in their political Capacity; yet the good of Society can never be effectually promoted by them, unleſs they are ſincerely concerned for the Intereſt of Religion.</p>
            <p>And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> When civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, to do their Duty; they will ſincerely endeavour to promote Religion; as there is ſuch a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, between this, and the good of Society.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> That the good of Society in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, (next to the Glory of GOD,) is the direct End of civil Government. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007407_0009_102BAE1B1A7E97C0"/>
was not appointed, that ſome Men might enjoy Riches, Dignity, and Power above others, excluſive of the good of the Public: That ſome might become as Beaſts of Prey, to the weaker part of the Herd while others muſt be Beaſts of Burden: That ſome might <hi>be clothed in Purple, and fine Linen, and fare Sumptuouſly every Day; while others muſt be fed with the Crumbs that fall from their Table.</hi> No; Societies were not formed for the ſake of Rulers, but Rulers were made for the ſake of Societies; that the good of all, (Rulers and Ruled) in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, might be Promoted. And as civil Government was not appointed for the good of any Part of a Community, in Oppoſition to the Reſt; ſo it was not deſign'd for the good of any Community as ſuch, in the World to come. For thô <hi>the chief End of Man, is to glorify God and enjoy him for ever:</hi> And the chief End of Government, as well as all other Means that GOD is uſing with Men; is His Glory, and their everlaſting Good; and therefore every Man, of every Community, ought to improve this, together with all other Advantages, that he may <hi>be made meet to be a Partaker, of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in Light:</hi> Yet no Society as ſuch will have a future Exiſtence, <hi>in that Kingdom which can never be moved,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007407_0010_102BAE1D2E54BF90"/>
can receive neither Good, nor Harm, from this, or any thing elſe in that Reſpect. <hi>For when the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe, and the Elements ſhall Melt with fervent Heat, and the Earth alſo, and the Works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up;</hi> When all Nature ſhall fall on Sleep, Time ſhall expire, and Death it ſelf ſhall die; then Empires, and Kingdoms, and States, and Communities, ſhall be no more; but glorified Saints ſhall be united in another Manner of Society, <hi>when God will be all in all.</hi> But Men in this preſent State of Weakneſs, and Depravity, have a mutual Dependance one upon another, and can't Subſiſt without the Advantages of civil Society; and this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implies, that there muſt be ſome Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For an animal Body could as well live without an Head, as a political one could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without Government. For without it we ſhould be in a ſtate of Confuſion; like an Herd of wild Beaſts; the Strongeſt, and moſt Miſchievous, would Domineer over and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs others. There would be <hi>no Peace, to him that ſhould go out, or to him that ſhould come in;</hi> our Lives, and Properties, and all that is dear to us, would hang in Suſpence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ungoverned Luſts of the Sons of Fraud, and Violence. When a People therefore grow uneaſy under Government, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007407_0011_102BAE202B7B06F8"/>
endeavour to overthrow the Foundations of it; they are like a Pond that being weary of Confinement, contends for Liberty, with the Dam upon which it depends for it's very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. Government is ſo neceſſary to the very Being of a Society; that it is not at all Probable, that ever any great Number of People continued long together, without it in ſome Form or other. To ſuppoſe (as ſome have done,) that Mankind were ever in ſuch a mere State of Nature; as to have had no Laws, no Regulations, no ſort of Government; is to ſuppoſe a Contradiction; for ſuch a wild, and ſavage State, could not with any Propriety be called a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for it would be a very unnatural State. And therefore it follows that Government was not brought in by Improvement, and Cultivation, as the Arts and Sciences were. For thô it is true, the different Modes, and Forms, of it, (as they are ſuited to the Genius, Inclination, and Circumſtances of every Community,) depend upon Agreement, and Compact: Yet Government itſelf, was inſtituted at the beginning of the World, by the great Author of our Natures; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Word of GOD; and is even implied in thoſe Words, <hi>It is not good the Man ſhould be alone.</hi> For <hi>Adam</hi> was to have had a ſort of Government over his Wife and

            <p>The Doctrines of the unlimited Power of Princes, to govern without Law, and of the Obligations that Subjects are under to ſubmit to their lawleſs Determinations, upon Pain of eternal Damnation; were in Times paſt greatly in Vogue in our Nation, and taught for precious Goſpel Truths.</p>
            <p>But their mighty Zeal to propagate theſe Doctrines, by a vile Proſtitution of Pulpits, Preſſes, and Courts of Juſtice, was (methinks,) but a poor way of complimenting the then reigning Princes, for it evidently implied a Conſciouſneſs that they were endeavouring to oppreſs their Subjects, by trampling the Laws under their Feet. But ſuch was the blind Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of thoſe worthleſs Princes, that inſtead of being affronted they were flattered by theſe Men; for they wanted ſuch Inſtruments to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their Deſigns.

We find then by Experience, as well as from the Nature of Things, that there can be no civil Liberty, where the ſacred Authority of the Laws is diſregarded by any Order of Men.

            <p>But althô in this Senſe, civil Rulers have no Right to intermeddle with the things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by invading the miniſterial Office; yet in another Intendment, they ought to be greatly concerned about Religion by Virtue of their Office; as they never can effectually promote the Peace, and Proſperity of the Community, without being concerned for the Intereſt of Religion. For if Rulers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have no Religion, no fear of GOD, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Rewards, and Puniſhments of <hi>the World to come,</hi> what Security can they have?

one in another? Their firmeſt Promiſes will ſignify nothing; and their moſt ſolemn Oaths, will bind them no more than ſo many Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs.

            <p>To ſay nothing here, of the moral Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Vice, and Wickedneſs; tho' it is certain that <hi>in the End they will bite like a Serpent, and ſting like an Adder; and becauſe of theſe things cometh the Wrath of God, upon the Children of Diſobedience;</hi> and often too upon Kingdoms, States, and Communities; ſo <hi>that God is Known by the Judgments, that he executeth.</hi> But I ſay without bringing this into the Reckoning; every Vice in a political View, injures the Public; for it is ſo far from being true, (as has been pretended<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </gap> and they ſhall be driven to Darkneſs.</hi> In a word, Religion is like <hi>an Ax laid at the Root of the Tree;</hi> but all other Means without it, will do but little more than lop off ſome of the luxuriant Branches; and be but a ſmall Check, to its Growth, and Fruitfulneſs. I therefore add,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> When civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, to do their Duty, they will ſincerely Endeavour to promote Religion, as there is ſuch a neceſſary Connexion, between this, and the good of Society. The Grace of GOD is <hi>that Wiſdom that is from above, which is firſt pure, and then peaceable gentle, eaſie to be intreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocriſy.</hi> It is abſolutely neceſſary, to make Men really good, in every Buſineſs, and in every Relation of Life. It will make Men good Maſters, good Parents, good Neighbours, good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, good Magiſtrates, and good Subjects. It has a mighty transforming Efficacy; It will turn Rebels, and Traitors, into loyal and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007407_0025_102BAE3DA9389108"/>
obedient Subjects: fierce and cruel Savages, into kind Benefactors: and Tyrants, Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Oppreſſors, into <hi>nurſing Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Grace of GOD will refine the Minds, and enlarge the Hearts, of Men in Power. It will raiſe them above any low, ſelfiſh, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Views; and give them more exalted and ſublime Sentiments; ſo as to conſider themſelves as <hi>God's Miniſters,</hi> veſted with his Authority, and acting for Him, and their greateſt Concern will be, <hi>not to lade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with thick Clay;</hi> nor to gain the vain Applauſes of Men, (whoſe Tongues are ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and whoſe Affections are as mutable as the Wind) but the Approbation of GOD, whom they conſider as their Witneſs, and Judge, <hi>their Shield, and exceeding great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Aims, and Views will not be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this little Spot of Earth; or within the Compaſs of a few Moments of Time; but their Proſpect will extend to the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a boundleſs Duration.</p>
            <p>It will fill them with a tender Affection, and ſincere Concern for all Mankind; but more eſpecially for the People that they are ſo nearly related to, and will give them a fellow Feeling, and Sympathy with the reſt of the Body, both in Proſperity and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:007407_0026_102BAE3FDE278F08"/>
It will enliven their Zeal, animate their Courage, and quicken their Activity, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the public good: And as they know by Experience the Neceſſity of Religion, to make Men good Members of Society, they will exert themſelves to promote it.</p>
            <p>But then the great Queſtion is, Since Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not the direct Object of the Concern of the civil Magiſtrate in his political Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, what may he, or what ought he to do to promote it?</p>
            <p>A full Diſcuſſion of this important Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would take more Time than this Occaſion will allow: And beſides I am not ſo ſanguine, as to imagine, that I can draw the Line with ſuch Clearneſs, and Exactneſs that the contending Parties will abide by it, as the true Boundary. But however, I ſhall venture to ſuggeſt a few things, which may perhaps, give ſome Light, in the Caſe. And accordingly I would Obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no civil Magiſtrate has Authority to puniſh Men, for their religious Principles, or Practices, provided they don't diſturb the civil Peace. The Right that all Men have as moral Agents, and accountable Creatures, to think, and act for themſelves in thoſe things that relate to their own eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is now much better underſtood, and more freely acknowledged, than formerly,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007407_0027_102BAE420AA54010"/>
when Bigotry was too often Subſtituted, in the Room of that Zeal, which Springs from the Love of GOD, and our Neighbour. It is now generally acknowledged by Proteſtants, of every Denomination, that all Perſecution merely upon the Account of Religion, is an unmerciful Violation, of the Law of Nature, and of the <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi> And as there are eternal Rewards, or Puniſhments annexed to our Belief, and Practice; that civil Magiſtrate, who would compel Men to comply with his religious Sentiments, ſhould give them good Security, that if they are miſled, he will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for them a vicarious Puniſhment, in the <hi>World to come,</hi> and that they ſhall be guiltleſs. For if we muſt believe by Proxy, what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given why we ſhould not be rewarded, or puniſhed by Proxy? If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate had a juſt Claim to Infallibility, he aught have ſomething more to ſay, <hi>for afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mens Bodies for the good of their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as we are (at beſt) but in a very imperfect State, while we <hi>dwell in Houſes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Advantages, of Education, Reading, and Converſation; and therefore different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: And all the Severities that can be inflicted upon Mens Bodies, will in no wiſe enlighten their Minds, and change their Hearts: The utmoſt that can be done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this way is to bring Men to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in Hypocriſy. But beſides if one Magiſtrate has a Right to puniſh Men for their Heterodoxy, another who ſuſtains the ſame Office, has as much Right to uſe the ſame Power, and upon this Foot, all the Perſecutions that have ever been in the World, may be juſtified.</p>
            <p>Among the Jews Idolaters were to be put to Death, it is true; but then they were a Theocracy, and Idolatry ſo far as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſo far it deſtroyed their Polity, civil, as well as religious. But now as there is not the ſame Reaſon, there can't be the ſame Law.</p>
            <p>The chriſtian Religion never was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by perſecuting others. The Church may be made <hi>Drunk</hi> (as the Scripture expreſſes it) but will never thrive, by being fed with the Blood of human Sacrifices; inſtead of the <hi>ſincere Milk of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the <hi>Meekneſs and Gentleneſs of Chriſt,</hi> that he never forced any Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Religion, thô he could have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, <hi>more than twelve Legions of Angels
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007407_0029_102BAE4712BF7FE0"/>
to compel Men to come in,</hi> if this method had been agreeable to the Nature and Deſign of it: But inſtead of this; when his Diſciples diſcovered a perſecuting Temper, towards Men who <hi>Worſhipped they knew not what;</hi> He ſeverely reproved them; <hi>Ye know not (ſays He) what manner of Spirit ye are of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Apoſtles when they went forth to propagate the Goſpel, (being then fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Nature, and Deſign of it) aſſured their Hearers, <hi>that the Weapons of their Warfare were not Carnal,</hi> but Spiritual; and that if <hi>the Mighty Works</hi> that were wrought by them, and <hi>the Preaching of the Goſpel with Demonſtration, and Power,</hi> were not ſufficient to convert them, they would leave them to the Deluſions of <hi>a reprobate Mind.</hi> But if their Hearers had known at the ſame Time, that when once the Rulers of the World would joyn with them; it was their real Deſign; and agreable to their true Principles, to convert Men with Fire, and Sword, Bonds and Impriſonments; I gueſs, they would hardly have thought, they were <hi>as harmleſs as Doves;</hi> how much ſo ever they might have, of <hi>the Wiſdom of the Serpent:</hi> Neither would they have thought, they deſerved the Character our Saviour gave them, when he ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

2. The civil Magiſtrate has no Right to make any Alterations, either in the Doctrins, Diſcipline, or Ordinances of Religion; for the ſake of promoting the good of the State, or for any other Pretence whatſoever. The chriſtian Religion in its native Purity, and Simplicity, has not been at all agreeable to the Guſt of, curious Projectors: And hence Work enough has been found for the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inventions of Men, that they might mix ſome Ingredients to make it more palatable; either from a Pretence of Order, Unity, and Decency; or to accommodate it to the Temper of the People; or to promote the Schemes of Politicians. King JAMES the firſt from political Views, had a great Fondneſs for the epiſcopal Form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was his darling Maxim, no Biſhop, no King. But another (who was ſo far from being a Puny in Politicks, that he placed himſelf at the Head of three Kingdoms, and cauſed himſelf to be worſhipped, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong, but even by the Gods of the Earth) had a very different View, he thought it was abſurd, and dangerous to ſet up Imperium in Imperio; a Form of Government in the Church, to rival that of the State. But I imagine they were both very wrong, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Religion the Creature of the State, when it ought to have be'n the Pillar, and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007407_0031_102BAE4B36FB5528"/>
of it. For the chriſtian Religion does not depend upon the capricious Fancies of States men; or the Refinements of Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; (for if ſo, it would be as fluctuating as the Waves of the Sea) but it is, what it is, a glorious Scheme of Salvation, contrived, and inſtituted by infinite Wiſdom, in all the Parts of it; to promote the Glory of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Author, and the preſent Peace, and everlaſting Happineſs of Men.</p>
            <p>There is a reſplendent Glory, that Shines round the chriſtian Religion; ſo that it is <hi>all glorious</hi> without; as well as <hi>all glorious within.</hi> The Angels behold it with humble Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' men, ungrateful Men treat it as an old faſhioned thing <hi>without Form, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> But as counterfeit Colours, how art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſoever laid on, would tarniſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face an exquiſite natural Beauty; ſo all the Ornaments, and Decorations that have be'n, or can be contrived, to make Chriſt's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more decent, and faſhionable; ſerve to no other Purpoſe, but to hide their true Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Glory; and to ſhow the Preſumption, and diſtempered Imaginations of the Authors and Contrivers of them. And indeed, it would be a bold Invaſion of Chriſt's Kingly Office, and a daring Impeachment of his Wiſdom, to pretend to make any Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Ordinances, let the Pretence be
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007407_0032_102BAE4DC8590238"/>
ever ſo Specious. In theſe things then, <hi>we muſt call no Man Maſter on Earth, for one is our Maſter, even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and we muſt ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free, and not be entangled with the Yoke of Bondage.</hi> When we do <hi>whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded,</hi> we are in a ſtate of Liberty; but when we are <hi>ſo beguiled</hi> as to Submit our Necks to the Yoke of human Impoſitions, in the Worſhip of GOD, as our Worſhip will be ſo far a vain Worſhip; ſo we ſhall oe in <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to Men,</hi> who may without End, make one indifferent Thing Neceſſary, as well as another. The ſame tranſubſtantiating Power, that can change the Nature of one indifferent thing can another, until all the Fopperies of the Church of Rome, will become neceſſary Goſpel Ordinances. In a Word then, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt has required of us, either by the Law of Nature, or by his Written Word, ought to be a Part of our Religion; <hi>but whatſoever is more than theſe cometh of evil;</hi> and therefore indifferent things ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as they are, without any Stamp of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authority to give them a Currency. This is (I think) the only firm Foundation, on which the Peace, and Purity of the Church can be Built.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Magiſtrate has no Right by Virtue of his Office, to intermeddle with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007407_0033_102BAE4F4A56B2B0"/>
of the Church. As Chriſt is the only King in his Church, He has appointed a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Order of Men to be Officers therein: And he has committed unto them the <hi>Key</hi> of Diſcipline, as well as the <hi>Key</hi> of Doctrine. All therefore that would <hi>live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> are required <hi>to obey them who have the Rule over them, and ſubmit themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they watch for their Souls as they that muſt give Account.</hi> CHRIST's Kingdom is not a Worldly, but a Spiritual Kingdom, ſet up in the Hearts, and Conſciences of Men; and all his true Subjects are <hi>a willing People:</hi> And no external Force, or Violence is to be uſed with Men to keep them within the Church, any more than to bring them in. But when Diſcipline (which is a Spiritual Thing,) has been uſed with ſuch as are guilty of Hereſy, or Scandal, for their ſpiritual Good, and the Good of others; <hi>for Edification, and not for Deſtruction;</hi> if after all, <hi>the unbelieving depart, let them depart, &amp; remain as Heathen Men and Publicans.</hi> If they ſhould be brôt to a Submiſſion, by Fines, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it would be an Argument of their Hypocriſy; but not of their <hi>Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, &amp; Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and therefore ſuch a forced Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would in no wife qualify them for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of CHRIST. But
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007407_0034_102BAE5167A3CFD8"/>
theſe things being premiſed, I proceed to ſay; that there are many things notwithſtanding, that ought to be done by civil Rulers by Virtue of their Office, to promote Religion.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) They ought to publickly own and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the chriſtian Religion, in ſuch a Way as they think, (according to the beſt Light they can get from the Word of GOD) to be moſt agreable to the Mind, and Will of the great Governor of the World; and therefore would beſt anſwer the Ends of Government. There is a great Difference between a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and an Eſtabliſhment. Every Religion that don't diſturb the civil Peace ought to be tolerated, but not eſtabliſhed, and ſupported at the public Charge. But as the chriſtian Religion ought to be owned, and profeſſed by all Men, ſo it ſhould be eſtabliſhed and ſupported by public Authority. The glory of GOD, and the good of Society, as well as the eternal Salvation of the Souls of Men; make it evident that ſuch a pure and merciful Religion, which was publiſhed by the Son of GOD, ought to be publickly received with due Deference, and Reſpect; and not be put upon a Level with mere Heatheniſm. But if civil Rulers have nothing to do to provide for the Support of Religion, but every Man muſt be allowed to act in this Caſe, as his
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007407_0035_102BAE53E7A8FFF8"/>
own Prejudice, or Avarice may incline him; what can they do by virtue of their Office, to ſhew their Reſpect to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion more than to mere Heatheniſm? And how can Rulers anſwer the Character that is given of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, in the Word of GOD; if they are not to provide for the Support of Religion? Don't we read, <hi>that kings ſhould be Nurſing Fathers, and Queens ſhould be Nurſing Mothers,</hi> to the Church, and People of GOD, under the Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation?</p>
            <p>But then, the religious Eſtabliſhment ought to be founded upon ſuch a broad Bottom, and underſtood in ſuch a Latitude, that all good Chriſtians notwithſtanding their different Sentiments, may receive Benefit by it. Men may be ſincere Chriſtians, and therefore very uſeful Members of the political Body; tho' they may be miſtaken with Reſpect to ſome circumſtantial things in Religion: They may <hi>build Wood, Hay, and Stubble,</hi> (as the Apoſtle expreſſes it) upon the true Foundation. In this Caſe the Law of Charity, (which is in a peculiar Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>Law of Chriſt</hi>) requires us <hi>to bear one anothers Burdens, and receive one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as Chriſt alſo receives us.</hi> Uniformity in all the Externals of Religion, would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirable, if we could all think alike; but
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007407_0036_102BAE556AADA4D8"/>
as this is not to be expected in this preſent State of Imperfection; a Law of Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would be much more agreable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the chriſtian Religion, (which is to unite Men to Chriſt by Faith, and to one another by Charity) than a Law of ſtrict Uniformity, whereby Men muſt be obliged to act alike, whatever their Thoughts are. And therefore as the Terms of Chriſtianity, and Nothing elſe, ought to be the Terms of Communion in the Church of Chriſt; ſo the Religion of CHRIST, and Nothing elſe, ought to be eſtabliſhed under the Notion of Religion in a chriſtian State. And as all chriſtian Churches have a Right to Judge for themſelves, what are the Terms of Chriſtianity, and therefore what Qualifications are neceſſary in their own Members; ſo the Legiſlature of every chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State, have a right to judge what is the Religion of CHRIST, and what Principles, and Practiſes may juſtly exclude Men from the Privileges of a religious Eſtabliſhment. For if every Man ought to have the Liberty of private Judgment, then every Community ought to have the Liberty of public Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Legiſlature ought to have as much Liberty of Conſcience to think for themſelves, what will be for the public good, as every Man ought to have; that he may think for himſelf what will be for his own
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007407_0037_102BAE56F9967650"/>
good. And therefore it will follow, that if the Legiſlature muſt be obliged to receive Men as Chriſtians, (who profeſs a Religion that tends to the beſt good of the State) when they believe in their Conſcience, that their profeſſed Principles, and Practiſes, are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with Chriſtianity, and ſo with the good of the State; they have no Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And upon the ſame Suppoſition, there could be no Diſcipline in the Church, nor any Religion at all eſtabliſhed, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the State; but every Man muſt be left to his own Fancy, or Humour, and be intitled to equal Authority, and equal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges with others, let him be an Atheiſt, or a Deiſt, a Papiſt, or an Heathen, any Thing, or Nothing. And indeed upon this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, there could be no ſuch thing as a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State, unleſs there may be a Chriſtian State, that do'n't (as ſuch,) profeſs the chriſtian Religion. But upon the whole, as the religious Eſtabliſhment, ought to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon charitable Principles, otherwiſe it would not be Suited to the Temper of the Goſpel; ſo they who don't think fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it, ought <hi>to lead a quiet, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Life,</hi> and be contented with a Toleration. And they not think it hard, if they are obliged to bear a Part in the public Charges, that are thought neceſſary by the proper
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007407_0038_102BAE598270D8F0"/>
Judges to promote the good of the Public; <hi>for in the Peace thereof, they themſelves ſhall have Peace.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) They who are in Authority, ought to take care of the public Worſhip of GOD, and oblige all that are under their Government, to ſteadily, and orderly attend upon his public Worſhip, in ſome way, and manner agreable to their Profeſſion; when they have the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and Opportunity for it. It is abſurd, to ſpeak of allowing Atheiſts Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Becauſe he who profeſſeth himſelf to be an Atheiſt, at the ſame Time profeſſes that he has no Conſcience. For what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can a Man have; who believes there is no GOD, no moral Obligations, no future Rewards, and Puniſhments? But whatever Men Profeſs with their Mouths, their refuſing to worſhip GOD in Public, is a practical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Atheiſm. For altho' there have been ſome, who have ſo far ſunk into Brutality as to deny the Being, and Perfections of GOD; Yet there never were any that did believe the Being of a GOD, of infinite Perfections, and at the ſame Time believe that he ought not to be Worſhipped. And as GOD hath appointed one Day in Seven, for his more immediate Worſhip, and Service, due care ſhould be taken by civil Rulers, that the Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath be not Prophaned. Experience ſhews,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007407_0039_102BAE5B85680498"/>
that a due Sanctification of the Lord's-Day, has a mighty Influence upon the Manners of the People; and that all practical Religion, will ſtand, or fall according as it is obſerved.</p>
            <p>I add,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Every Word, and every Action, that in an open &amp; profane Manner, diſcovers a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of GOD, and Religion, is an Iniquity that ought to be <hi>puniſhed by the Judge.</hi> Not only vile Swearers, <hi>who ſet their Mouth againſt the Heavens;</hi> and prophane Deſpiſers of GOD, who in a way of Defiance, call upon their Maker, to exert his Almighty Power in the Damnation of themſelves, and others; but even Scoffers, who make a mock of Sacred Things, ought to be treated as Enemies to GOD, and human Society. Religion is a very ſerious Thing, and it would be very unchriſtian, as well as uncivil, to Mock and Deride Men for their religious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Practiſes, ſuppoſing them to be wrong: inſtead of this, we ought to pity them, and pray for them, and uſe proper Methods to convince them of their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes. But as the chriſtian Religion will certainly ſtand its Ground, if it may have a fair Trial at the Bar of Reaſon, and is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly owned as the Religion of the State; no Man ought to be allowed with Impunity to treat it in a flouting, and ſcoffing Manner.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007407_0040_102BAE5D87AB8BF8"/>
And the like may be ſaid with reſpect to the Rule of our Faith, the Holy Scriptures; and the Ordinances of Religion; which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times treated with ſuch <hi>railing Accuſations, as Michael the Archangel would not bring againſt the Devil himſelf.</hi> This Method has be'n the principal Engine that has be'n made uſe of, to batter down the Bulwarks of our Faith, and to propagate Infidelity. Thô I hope this has not been ſo common among us, as in ſome other Places; but if the Floodgates ſhould be ſet open, or the Banks ſhould be removed, what can we expect, but to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luged with a Flood of Impiety? And,</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Civil Rulers ſhould uſe all proper Endeavours to ſtrengthen the Hands, and encourage the Hearts, of the Miniſters of Religion. Thus <hi>King Hezekiah, ſpake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to all the Levites, that taught the good Knowlege of the Lord.</hi> The magiſterial, and miniſterial Authority, are very different, in their Nature, and Kind; but yet inſtead of rivaling one another, when they are duly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, they will be very helpful; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient each to the other. <hi>Thus God led his People like a Flock, by the Hand of Moſes, and Aaron.</hi> The civil, and eccleſiaſtical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, were united in promoting the good of that People. If Miniſters are faithful, and ſucceſsful, they will be greatly Inſtrumental
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007407_0041_102BAE5FCFB73D38"/>
to preſerve the Peace of the State, and to promote the Honour, and Obedience which the People owe to their Rulers. For the more real Succeſs they have in their Work, the more Conſcientious People will be, to diſcharge every Duty, in every Relation of Life, <hi>that they may render to all their Dues: Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom; Fear to whom Fear; Honour to whom Honour.</hi> And therefore good Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, as well as the expreſs Command, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Chriſt, requires that they ſhould be Encouraged, and Supported.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I truſt we are not ſeeking great things for ourſelves: We are not in the Purſuit of Riches, nor worldly Promotions. We don't want the Aſſiſtance of the ſecular Arm, that we may lord it over God's Heritage; Nor do we deſire to make the civil Magiſtrate, the Inſtrument of our religious Vengeance, to oblige Men to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to our Dictates. No; all that we deſire is, that we may be conſidered, (as we always have be'n) upon the Account of our Office, as uſeful, and neceſſary Members of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and that as ſuch, we may be enabled to lead a quiet and a peaceable Life, not in Pomp, and Luxury, but in the humble and decent Exerciſe of our Miniſtry, which calls for all our Time and Talents.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:007407_0042_102BAE6221E696C0"/>
(5.) Civil Rulers ought to provide, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and regulate the proper Means of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; that there may be a Succeſſion of well qualified Men in the Sacred Miniſtry. Schools, and Colleges for the Education of Youth, are neceſſary that Men may be fitted for public Offices in the State; (as I obſerved) but they are more eſpecially neceſſary that Men may be fitted for the Service of the Sanctuary. We that are now on the Stage of Action are going off; <hi>and muſt not continue by Reaſon of Death: The Eyes of them who now ſee us, in a little Time muſt ſee us no more.</hi> And it would give us a very gloomy Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, if we had Reaſon to think, that when our heads are laid, our People will be led, (as one expreſſed it,) by dark Lanthorns, or erratic Fires.</p>
            <p>There are ſome (we know,) who deſpiſe Learning, and ſpeak of Colleges with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Contempt. But if Ignorance be ſuch a precious thing, as to be the Mother of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in the Church of Rome; yet it is not the moſt neceſſary Qualification in a Goſpel Miniſter; who according to the Direction of the Apoſtle, <hi>muſt give himſelf to Reading, that he may be apt to teach; able to inſtruct others; and able to reſiſt Gainſayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Jeroboam's Sin, <hi>that he made Prieſts of the meaneſt of the People.</hi> And Julian the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007407_0043_102BAE656E39E0A8"/>
Apoſtate; that he might deſtroy Chriſtianity, endeavoured to Suppreſs Learning among the Chriſtians, as much as lay in his Power.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>But as Learning is not the only neceſſary Qualification for the Goſpel Miniſtry, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Colleges, and Schools of Learning ſhould be kept under, ſuch religious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, that they may be Nurſuries of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and true Religion. For if theſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are poiſoned with Error, or corrupted with Vice, what can we expect of the Streams that are to water the Sanctuary?</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Civil Rulers of the higheſt Rank, ought to imploy Men that are friendly to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in ſubordinate Places of Power, and Truſt. Men of corrupt Principles, ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the Religion of the State; or that are irreligious in their Behaviour, are unfit to be imployed in Places of Power, and Truſt. Men who have no Self-Government, ſhould not be ſet to govern others. David's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this Caſe, was agreable to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a good Politician, as well as of a good Man <hi>Mine Eyes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall be upon the Faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way, he ſhall ſerve me.</hi> And the Advice that Jethro gave Moſes, made his <hi>Name</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:007407_0044_102BAE6791922758"/>
               <hi>to become better than precious Ointment: Thou ſhalt Provide,</hi> ſays he, <hi>out of all the People, able Men, ſuch as fear GOD, Men of Truth, hating Covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them.</hi> I ſhall add but once more,</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Civil Rulers ſhould endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Religion by an unblemiſhed, exemplary Converſation. Examples operate in a Way that is hard to deſcribe, but yet they have a very powerful Influence upon others, and eſpecially the Examples of Men of high Rank and Dignity. If the Sins of Rulers <hi>go before hand to Judgment;</hi> if they ſhew a Contempt of GOD, and Religion, and live in the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of fleſhly Luſts; their Examples will <hi>be a Deſtruction that will waſt at Noon-Day;</hi> and they themſelves inſtead of being Lights in the World, will be no better than an Ignis fatuus, a falſe Blaze, to bewilder others in the Darkneſs of the Night; until they go out <hi>in utter Darkneſs,</hi> and their deluded Followers <hi>ſtumble upon the dark Mountains.</hi> But on the other Hand, when they become bright Examples of undiſſembled Piety, and of all that is truly great, &amp; good; they will appear <hi>as burning and ſhining Lights, to revive, and cheriſh Religion in others. And as their Lights thus ſhine before Men, others ſeeing their good Works, will glorify their Heavenly Father.</hi>

               <hi>I.</hi> We may learn from what has be'n ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it ought to be the great Care, and Concern of them who are in Authority in this Community; to ſuppreſs, or remove every thing that is hurtful to Religion among us. That there are many abounding Iniquities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, we can't but be Senſible, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many Means that have be'n uſed to promote a Reformation. Good Laws have be'n enacted, Days of Faſting, and Humiliation, have be'n obſerved, and theſe things have be'n teſtified againſt by them who are ſet as <hi>Watchmen,</hi> and required to <hi>cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and lift up their Voice like a Trumpet.</hi> And what has been the Event? Are we now a reformed People? A People devoted to the Service of GOD? No; <hi>but our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are multiplied, and our Iniquities teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy againſt us,</hi> and forebode the ſevere Rebukes of a Sin-revenging GOD. <hi>We may look for Salvation;</hi> but what Reaſon have we to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, <hi>but that it will be far from us,</hi> unleſs our <hi>Repentance</hi> prevent <hi>our Ruin?</hi> And is there nothing further to be done by our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Guides in this deplorable Caſe? Muſt they now come to that ſad Concluſion; <hi>let him that is unjuſt be unjuſt ſtill; and let him that is filthy be filthy ſtill?</hi>

But notwithſtanding there are ſo many GOD-provoking Sins to be found in our Skirts; I don't Suſpect that we <hi>are Sinners above all Men that dwell in New England;</hi> unleſs it be in one Inſtance, and how that is <hi>God knows.</hi> But I greatly fear, (I tremble to Speak it!) I greatly fear, that the Sin of falſe Swearing, is more common among us than many People imagine. An enormous Crime! The Weight of a Mountain of Lead, would be no more than a Feather, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that Load of Guilt that lies upon the Souls of ſuch Men, as do in the moſt explicit Manner, renounce the Mercy, and imprecate the Vengeance of that Almighty Being <hi>to whom Vengeance belongs!</hi>

                  <hi>The very Heathen by the Light of Nature, were taught the Religion of an Oath; and look'd upon Perjury as a Sin of the deepeſt Dye. Machiavel in one of his Diſcourſes upon the firſt Decad of Livy; ſays <q>that whoever will peruſe the extraordinary Actions of the City of Rome collectively; or of ſeveral Romans in particular; will find that they were more tender of falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying an Oath, than of violating the Laws; judging an Offence againſt God, more hainous than an Offence againſt Men; and God more able to puniſh it.</q> And to the ſame Purpoſe Cicero, <q>Our Anceſtors (ſays he) could never find out any thing ſtronger than an Oath, to bind us to the faithful Diſcharge of what we had engaged.</q> Diodorus Siculus (Lib. 1. c. 77) relates of the Egyptians; that by their Laws, <q>Perſons that had forſworn themſelves, were Adjudged to capital Puniſhments, as guilty of the two greateſt Crimes, in violating that Piety they owed to God, and deſtroying Faith from amongſt Men, the ſtrongeſt Pillar of human Society.</q> See a Pamphlet entituled the Nature and Importance of Oaths and Juries.</hi>

But tho' I charitably believe, there are but few that would dare to call the great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verliving GOD to witneſs, to the truth of what they know to be falſe: Theſe are abandoned Sinners, <hi>whoſe Conſciences are ſeared as with an hot Iron:</hi> Yet have we not Reaſon to fear, that there are too many, that bring themſelves under the Obligations of a promiſſary Oath; who but little conſider, that <hi>God will not be mocked?</hi> But as Sermons upon theſe Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are not deſigned for mere Parade, and Show; I would with Suitable Deference to the Legiſlature, humbly propoſe it to their
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007407_0048_102BAE70434D0050"/>
Conſideration; whether ſome petty Offices might not be diſcharged as well without the ſolemnity of an Oath? Or whether the levying a Fine, upon ſuch as are Unfaithful might not be as effectual to ſecure their Fidelity? An Oath is a very ſolemn thing, and ought not to be trifled with, and there is infinite Danger in theſe Caſes, that too great Familiarity may breed Contempt.<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Nothing has raiſed the Character of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King of Pruſſia more among foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or rendr'd him more a Father to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; than the Reformation that he has made, in the Laws of his Country, and in the Courts of Juſtice. I ſhall tranſcribe one Paſſage out of a Letter from Berlin, (dated March 11th, 1755,) which is to my Purpoſe. The King has provided,</hi> 
                  <q>that the Sacredneſs of Oaths, which the Law admits only as an extreme Remedy, to come at the Truth, do not degenerate into a public Abuſe; by too lightly multiplying Oaths, the criminal Cuſtom of which, brings the Wrath of God upon States.</q> 
                  <hi>The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher of this Letter remarks ſatyrically enough,</hi> 
                  <q>that his Countrymen (the Engliſh) need not take notice of any thing ſaid in it; no not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Abuſe of Oaths; ſince ſome Folks are ſo wiſe, as to think the Revenue cannot be collected without that dangerous Expedient.</q> See <hi>N.

And I would beg Leave to propoſe further, whether in the Oath commonly call'd the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Oath, ſufficient Allowance is made for the Weakneſs, and Infirmities of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in ſome of the Expreſſions of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The Judges (it is true,) are as much bound by their Oath, not to ſhew Favour to any Man in the Execution of their Office; as the Freemen are in giving their Vote. But then it may be conſidered,</hi> 1ſt, <hi>That the mobile Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, the unthinking Part of Mankind, are no more fit to take the Judges Oath, than to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Office.</hi> 2dly, <hi>The Law makes allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the Infirmities of human Nature, in the Caſe of Judges, and diſcharges them from ſetting in Judgment, when they are under viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Temptations to break their Oath.

I make no Queſtion, but that Oaths may be neceſſary in ſome Caſes to ſecure the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; thô Experience ſhews, they are not ſo great a Security as might be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expected. Trajan the roman Emperor was very ſenſible of this; and being conſcious of his own good Intentions; inſtead of taking an Oath, as uſual of the Captain of the Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Guards; when he delivered the Sword to him; he ſaid, <hi>Draw this for me if I deſerve it, otherwiſe draw it againſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thô they are neceſſary, in ſome Caſes, (as I obſerved;) yet (it appears to me,) they ought to be ſo expreſſed that every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man that is a Friend to the Government, may take them without any Scruple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and that every honeſt Man that does take them, may freely act upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any Uneaſineſs in his Mind after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. As in the Marriage Covenant, it is thought ſufficient for the Man to Swear, that he will be a loving, and a faithful Huſband; but if he ſhould proceed further, and Swear that he would never treat his Wiſe with any Unkindneſs, in any one Inſtance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Temptations, or Provocations that he might meet with; it would be a very unadviſed Oath. How far this is applicable in the preſent Caſe, I ſhall leave to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Superiors: But with Submiſſion,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007407_0051_102BAE7656E47940"/>
I would make this Remark; if it be found upon due Inquiry, that there are ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that are too ſtrong for the preſent ſtate of Weakneſs, and Depravity that we are in; and ſo become an Occaſion of laying waſt Mens Conſciences, they ought no Doubt to be altered. A Medicine may be very good, and very proper to cure a Diſeaſe; but yet if the State of the Patient be'nt duly conſidered, it may prove preſent Death; inſtead of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. I know that our worthy Anceſtors had a good End, in forming the Oath as it now ſtands: And Moſes had a good End too, in making the brazen Serpent, he did it by the divine Command, and it was the Medium by which GOD diſpenſed a miraculous Mercy to his People; and it was moreover; A ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Type of the great Redeemer of the World; and yet when it became the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Peoples Sinning againſt GOD, the good <hi>King Hezekiah break it in Pieces, and called it Nehuſhtan;</hi> i. e. A brazen thing by way of Contempt. And if Perjury is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come common among us, by the Occaſion of this Oath, and the Legiſlature uſe no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prevent it; the Community as ſuch, are involved in the Guilt of it, and may expect the heavy Judgments of GOD. This is a Sin that will <hi>cauſe the Land to mourn:</hi> for how can we expect but that GOD will <hi>curſe</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:007407_0052_102BAE78DD086368"/>
               <hi>our Bleſſings,</hi> if we don't endeavour to purge out ſuch <hi>an accurſed thing from our Tents?</hi> As there is a <hi>GOD that judgeth in the Earth,</hi> He will ſurely vindicate the Honour of his Name. We find Inſtances in Scripture of Public Judgments, that were inflicted upon a whole Nation upon the Account of this Sin. In the Days of David GOD ſent <hi>a Famine three Years, year after Year,</hi> becauſe under the Conduct of Saul, they had violated the Oath, that their Fathers made to the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, above two Hundred Years before. And afterwards by breaking the Oath, that their <hi>prophane Prince</hi> made in their Behalf to the King of Babylon, <hi>they filled up the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Iniquities, and their Land was left deſolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Sin becomes common among a People, and is connived at, it is in vain for them to expect that the LORD will be their GOD. <hi>Will ye</hi> (ſays GOD by the Mouth of his Prophet)—<hi>Swear falſely—and come and ſtand before me, in this Houſe that is called by my Name!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall add but one Remark further upon this head, and that is, that if ever this Caſe required the Attention of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without Doubt it does now; as there are ſo many Perſons, that have their Minds ſo much ruffled, with Prejudice, and Paſſion,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007407_0053_102BAE7A95DF4228"/>
that they appear to be utterly uncapable to act with that Seriouſneſs, and Solemnity that they ought to do, when they have given their Souls as a Pledge, to be diſpoſed of by Him <hi>who judgeth righteouſly,</hi> according as they obſerve their Oath; and when they are in ſuch amazing Danger, of <hi>treaſuring up to themſelves Wrath, againſt the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, whether it be thought, that what I have Suggeſted, proceeds from a well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Zeal, or from an over-heated Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I have this to ſay, I have no worſe Motive (that I know of;) than a compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Concern for the Souls of Men, and an hearty Regard to the beſt good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; and I pray GOD that all that are under the Obligations of this, or any other Oath, may duly conſider, that <hi>the Judge ſtands before the Door;</hi> and that the Time is approaching, when GOD will certainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, <hi>between him that Sweareth, and him that feareth an Oath; and that he will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in Vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> If civil Rulers in their political Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ought to uſe their ſincere Endeavours to promote Religion, we may then learn,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:007407_0054_102BAE7C9FF59078"/>
what inviolable Obligations the Miniſters of Religion, are under to devote themſelves wholly to the Service of it. Religion ought to be the direct, and immediate Object of our Concern, <hi>as Miniſters of CHRIST, and Stewards of the Myſteries of GOD.</hi> We are employed in this Work, that we may be the Means of enlarging the Redeemer's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>and of making ready a People prepared for the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>it pleaſes GOD by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching, to Save them that believe; we muſt warn every Man, and teach every Man, in all Wiſdom, that we may preſent every Man, Perfect in CHRIST JESUS.</hi> Our Work is great, and of vaſt Importance to the Souls of Men: <hi>To ſome we are a ſavour of Life, unto Life; and to others a ſavour of Death, unto Death; and who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May GOD give us a due Senſe of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of our Work, the Worth of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and immortal Souls, and the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that we muſt give of our Stewardſhip.</p>
            <p>And may we have Grace, <hi>that we may be found faithful, that the Bleſſings of Souls ready to periſh may come upon us; and when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, may we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again,</p>

               <hi>III.</hi> From what we have heard, we may learn that as good Rulers are a great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, we ought to be thankful to GOD for them, diſcharge the Duties, we owe to them, and ſuitably improve the Advantages we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy under them. Good Rulers are decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered in the divine Oracles, by ſuch ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Expreſſions, as convey a very grand, and ſublime Idea, of their great Uſefulneſs. They are called <hi>Lights</hi> to comfort, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the political Body; <hi>Shields</hi> to protect, and defend it; <hi>Nurſing Fathers</hi> to provide for it; and the very <hi>Breath of our Noſtrils,</hi> to preſerve its Life, and Vigour. And the very Light of Nature, as well as the Word of GOD, makes it evident, that there are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent Duties, that Subjects owe to their Rulers. Inſtead of being <hi>Murmurers and Complainers;</hi> Inſtead of <hi>reviling the Gods, and ſpeaking evil of the Rulers of our People;</hi> Inſtead of liſtening to the groundleſs Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>and evil Reports</hi> of deſigning Men; inſtead of being fickle, and given to Change, like Weather-cocks, that turn with every Breath of Wind, until they wear themſelves out, with their own Motion: (the Bane of popular States!) I ſay inſtead of theſe things, we ought with the moſt unfeigned Gratitude, to pay our Vows <hi>to the Father of Mercies;</hi> for the Proviſion that He has made for our
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:007407_0056_102BAE80A869BFB8"/>
Peace, and Safety, under them <hi>who naturally care for our State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ought to Honour our Rulers, <hi>and eſteem them very highly in Love, for their Works Sake.</hi> Support them honourably, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Character, that neither their Perſons, nor Office may be deſpiſed: Submit to their juſt and legal Authority: Defend their Perſons, and good Names, againſt all the Aſſaults of Malice and Envy: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fervently pray for them to the <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> that they may be bleſſed with all the Bleſſings of his Grace, and Goodneſs, and that they may be to us, as <hi>the Light of the Morning when the Sun riſeth, even a Morning without Clouds: As the tender Graſs ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Earth by clear Shining after Rain.</hi> And the beſt Improvement, we can make of the Advantages we enjoy under them is, <hi>to lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs, and Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to conclude; let us all endeavour to do <hi>the Work of the Day, while the Day laſts; and to ſerve our Generation</hi> in our various Stations, <hi>by the Will of GOD before we fall on Sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD has diſtinguiſhed us above any other People, by the innumerable temporal, and ſpiritual Bleſſings, and Privileges that we
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:007407_0057_102BAE82AF136C10"/>
enjoy. Our Air is healthful to breathe in, and our Soil is ſufficiently Fruitful, to libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reward the diligent Huſbandman, and Supply us with all the Neceſſaries, and moſt of the Conveniences of Life. Our civil Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges are ſo great, as to make us the Envy, (not to ſay of our Enemies,) but even of our Neighbours. Our Laws, are very well calculated to ſecure our Lives, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to reward the good, and puniſh the bad. Our Rulers were born, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated among our ſelves, and have no foreign Attachments, to counteract the Love of their Country; no Separate Intereſts to draw off their Attention from the good of the public. And indeed, we ſhall be guilty of inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ingratitude, if we don't freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, that the Government has be'n ſerved from Time, to Time, by Men of a public Spirit, and of great Wiſdom, and Probity. So that inſtead of having the Bramble to rule over us, to ſcratch and tear us, (as in Jotham's Parable,) we have ſat under the Shadow, of the ſpreading and fruitful Vine.</p>
            <p>Our Miniſters are learned, and orthodox, and have ſupported their Character, by their evangelical Preaching, and by the Regularity of their Lives; as well (to ſpeak Modeſtly) as any ſuch Number of Men of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:007407_0058_102BAE861A57B2B8"/>
in any Part of the World. So that our Zion, does not ſet Solitary, <hi>ſtretching forth her Hands</hi> and looking until her <hi>Eyes fail,</hi> for ſome to relieve her from beyond the Seas; <hi>for her own Sons ſtand ready to comfort her and take her by the Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our religious Conſtitution is very good, if not in all Reſpects perfect; and is well fitted to preſerve religious Liberty, Unity, and good Order amongſt the Miniſters, and Churches of Chriſt: And one of the peculiar Excellencies of it is, that Men may differ in Opinion about ſome circumſtantial things in Religion, and yet be owned as united Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>We are watered with <hi>the Rains and Dews</hi> of GOD's Ordinances, adminiſtred according to their Original Inſtitution; that in them we may <hi>ſee CHRIST, as though evidently ſet forth as Crucified before our Eyes.</hi> And GOD has very often appeared for us, in a very ſignal Manner in the Way of his Providence; <hi>and be'n as a Wall of Fire round about us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely we have Reaſon to ſay, on this Day of <hi>the Gladneſs of our Hearts, how precious are thy Thoughts unto us O God! How great is the Sum of them! when we count them over, they are more in Number than the Sand</hi>

               <hi>which is upon the Sea Shore, and when we awake we are ſtill with thee.

What can make us unhappy, if we don't make ourſelves ſo? And now <hi>what ſhall we render to God for all his Benefits?</hi> Should not the <hi>Mercies of God</hi> excite us, <hi>to preſent not only our Bodies, but even our Souls as living ſacrifices, holy and acceptable unto God?</hi> Can we content ourſelves with a mere <hi>Form of Godlineſs, while we deny the Power of it?</hi> Can we ſatisfy ourſelves one Moment, without <hi>a good hope thrô Grace</hi> that we have laid the Foundation of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Life, by a ſaying Converſion to GOD, in a way of Humiliation, and Faith in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Redeemer? <hi>And can we rejoice in this Hope, unleſs we have the Teſtimony of our own Conſcience, that in Simplicity, and godly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom; but by the Grace of God, we have our Converſation in the World?</hi> We may value ourſelves very much upon our Privileges, and upon our Profeſſion; but we ſhould conſider, that it is a Truth that will remain more firm, and unſhaken, than the Pillars of Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:007407_0060_102BAE89A0D0E100"/>
We ought to be greatly concerned about the Sins of others, and even <hi>mourn in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Places,</hi> that there are ſo many Land-defiling Sins, that break in upon us, like a Flood: And as <hi>GOD's Hand is now lifted up,</hi> and he is ſhowing us <hi>the Rod of his Anger, our Fleſh might well tremble for fear of GOD,</hi> and we might be <hi>afraid of his Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however GOD may deal with us as a People, or as a Community, it infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns every one of us in particular, <hi>to know the Plague of our own Hearts</hi> and to mourn over our own paſt Sins; and <hi>to fly for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before us.</hi> We are all haſtening to that Place, <hi>from whence we ſhall never return,</hi> and we have ſomething to do, of greater Importance, than to blow Feathers about in the Air. We may live in Jeſt, but we muſt die in earneſt; and there is no trifling in Heaven, or Hell. There is an awful Seriouſneſs, that may be obſerved in all the Parts of the viſible Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
