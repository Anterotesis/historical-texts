            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Our Text is a Reaſon for the Diſſuaſion, taken from the Inconſiſtency of the Love of the World with the Love of GOD. <hi>If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi> The Words intend much the ſame with thoſe of our Saviour<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. vi. 24.</note>, <hi>No Man can ſerve two Maſters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other; ye cannot ſerve GOD and Mammon.</hi>

In ſpeaking to the Words, I ſhall endeavour theſe two Things.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſtate the true Meaning of them. And</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To open and illuſtrate the Truth contained in them, or to ſhow that <hi>such a Love of the World,</hi> as is here intended, is utterly <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Love of GOD.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the Explanation of the Words. <hi>If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi> By the <hi>World</hi> is here doubtleſs intended thoſe Enjoyments of the World which tend to ſeduce us, which are ſo ſuited to the Corruptions of Men, as that they prove a Temptation and Share to them: Theſe are well ſum'd up by the Apoſtle in the Verſe following our Text under theſe three Heads, <hi>The Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.</hi> By the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> as it here ſtands diſtinguiſh'd, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, is intended thoſe Things which tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke our ſenſual Appetites, and inflame our Deſires after fleſhly Delights. By <hi>the Luſt of the Eyes,</hi> is to be underſtood thoſe Things which tend to feed our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, when we earneſtly deſire and eagerly purſue thoſe Things which our Eyes have ſeen. By <hi>the Pride of Life,</hi> is intended thoſe Things which tend to raiſe or cheriſh our Pride; ſuch as the Honours and Dignities of the World, or whatever elſe tends to gratify our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Views, to exalt us in our own Eſteem, or we are diſpoſed to take a Pride in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any Man love the World.</hi> By loving the World, cannot, I think, be underſtood every Kind of Love to any of the Enjoyments of it; this would be to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Exerciſe of thoſe natural Principles which are implanted in us by the God of Nature, and which are neceſſary for us in our preſent State. Some Regard to the World and the Things of it is neceſſary to keep the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005386_0005_1017B54C93AF5E20"/>World in good Order, and for our comfortable Subſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence here; yea, for the Diſcharge of many Duties which God requires of us. GOD commands that <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> love their <hi>Wives,</hi> and <hi>Parents</hi> would never do their Duty to their <hi>Children,</hi> if they had not a real Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for them; Diligence in our particular Calling is our Duty, but how apt would Mankind be to indulge themſelves in Lazineſs, were it not that they have a Love to the World, and ſome Deſire to have a larger Portion of the Things of it? Nor can I ſee any Evil in ſuch Deſires, ſo long as our Love to theſe ſublunary Enjoyments is ſubordinate to our Love to GOD, and we ſeek them with an humble Submiſſion to the divine Will, and poſſeſs them with a Diſpoſition to reſign them whenever GOD in his Providence calls for them; A Love to the World which is accompanied with ſuch a Frame and Temper is, I think, lawful and perfectly conſiſtent with our Love to GOD—'Tis then an <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Love</hi> to the World which the Apoſtle here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, ſuch a Love as influences us to be immoderate in our Purſuit after it, and unwilling to part with it. Some of the Signs of ſuch an inordinate Love I ſhall have Occaſion to ſpeak of preſently.</p>
            <p>If any Man love the World, <hi>the Love of the Father is not in him,</hi> i. e. he has not that ſupreme Love to GOD, which is the Characteriſtick of the true Chriſtian, he remains in his natural Enmity to GOD, and has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver experienced that Change in his Soul by which he may be denominated a Chriſtian.— This I take to be the plain Senſe of the Words, and without troubling you with any critical Remarks upon them, I proceed</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To open and illuſtrate the Truth contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, or to ſhow that an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to the <hi>World</hi> is inconſiſtent with the <hi>Love of GOD,</hi> Here I ſhall ſhow</p>

I. When our <hi>Love to the World</hi> may be called an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Anſwer</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the <hi>World</hi> ſo takes up our <hi>Thoughts</hi> as to exclude the <hi>Thought of GOD and Religion,</hi> then our Love to the World may be ſaid to be <hi>inordinate.</hi> To contemplate on GOD and Divine Things is moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our reaſonable Natures, moſt delightful and moſt profitable to the renewed Soul: It is a Conſideration which demands our cloſeſt Attention, how we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Favour of GOD, and how we may glorify and honour him; and it argues too great a Regard to the World, when we are ſo attach'd to it, as that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preſently call off our Thoughts from it to thoſe Things which are of infinitely greater Importance to us. While we are in the World, we are neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in worldly Buſineſs, and it muſt take up much of our Thoughts; but ſurely it ought not to have all, there ought to be ſome Time allotted for the Care of our Souls, which is by Way of Eminence <hi>the one Thing needful;</hi> and though the World, or the Care of thoſe committed to us may employ the greater Part of our Time; yet, if our Hearts are not too much ſet upon it, our Thoughts will frequently run upon ſpiritual and divine Subjects: Yea, when we are engaged in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buſineſs, theſe will be eaſy and natural to us. Our Love to the World muſt be an inordinate Love, if we allow our Minds to dwell wholly upon it, and never think of Divine Things, or if religious Thoughts are burdenſome, and we find more Delight in contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the World and the Things of it: When we put by religious Conſiderations as <hi>Felix</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi> to a more convenient Seaſon, have our Minds engaged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our temporal Affairs all the Day long, contriving how we may buy and ſell and get gain, and imagine it enough if we contemplate of ſpiritual Things at the Times of our ſtated Devotions: Nor will it be ſo eaſy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005386_0007_1017B550024B2498"/>a Thing, as many think it is, to bring ourſelves ſutably to attend to theſe Subjects, and to fix our Thoughts upon them; when our Minds have been for a long Time otherwiſe engag'd; eſpecially, when they have been employed upon Subjects ſo much more agreeable to our Corruptions: In ſuch a Caſe, you'l find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to get your Heart diſengag'd from the World; it will ſteal upon you in your Retirements, when you go aſide profeſſedly to meditate on Things of a ſpiritual Nature; it will intrude itſelf into your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and take off your Thoughts when you would engage them elſewhere. Our Care about the World is <hi>then</hi> immoderate, and our Love to it inordinate, when we put aſide religious Thoughts when they come into our Minds, and will give them no Place, but on thoſe Times which we have expreſly ſet apart for them; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it is, if ſuch Thoughts never come into our Minds; if the Cares of the World take up all our Time; if theſe lie down with us, and are firſt with us when we awake; Such a Frame of Mind is a certain Indication that our Souls are ſet upon them, and that we have a greater Regard to them than to any Thing elſe— <hi>As a Man thinketh in his Heart, ſo is he.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 23.7.</note> If then, any one thinketh of the World with moſt Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and Delight, he is a worldly Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Love</hi> to the World is <hi>then inordinate,</hi> when we are <hi>diſcontented</hi> becauſe we have not more of it. Though their ought to be a prudent Care about the Things of the World, and it is in our Nature to have ſome Love to it, and we may lawfully purſue after it; yet our Care and our Purſuits are to be reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bounds of Reaſon and Religion, and we ſhould ſubmit to the Allotments of Divine Providence without murmuring or repining. It argues a very unbecoming Temper, and too great a Love to the Things of this
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005386_0008_1017B559136C9478"/>preſent World; when we are fretful becauſe we have not more, and envious towards thoſe that have. Some, when they look upon others, who abound in temporal Bleſſings and ſeem to have all Things comfortable and pleaſant about them, are ready to ſay within themſelves; <q>why, I have taken as much Pains and have had as fair Opportunities as my Neighbours, but I an't thus proſper'd: This Man has Honour and Reſpect ſhown him, I am ſlighted and deſpiſed; another has amaſs'd great Poſſeſſions I am ſtill low in the World.</q> Well, and what then I pray? so GOD is pleaſed in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to order, and its all right and juſt as it ſhould be. You love the World <hi>too well,</hi> if you an't willing GOD ſhould govern it as pleaſes him, but are uneaſy and diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied becauſe he does not give you as much as he does others, or as you deſire. GOD has a ſovereign Right to diſpoſe of all Things here, and 'tis our indiſpenſable Duty to ſubmit to his Will whatſoever it is concerning us. If then you are in a contrary Frame, and can't be eaſy with what GOD beſtows upon you becauſe you have not more, it argues a too great Regard for the Things of the World, and that your Deſires after it are not kept within due Bounds, ſince the mere Want of it puts you into an undutiful Frame towards the bleſſed GOD. We are ready to think there's no Danger of our loving the World too well, when we have not a great Share of it: But a covetous Temper may be as evident and prevail as much in thoſe, who are denied an Abundance of the good Things of this Life, as in thoſe who abound; though they have them not, yet they <hi>crave</hi> them, and an't <hi>contented</hi> without them: What can this proceed from but an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to them? They diſcover their Regard to them by their <hi>Cravings</hi> after them, as the others do by their <hi>Attachment</hi> to them when they have them: Was our Love to the World under due Regulations, though we ſhould take a <hi>prudent</hi> Care about it, yet if our Endeavours were not crown'd
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005386_0009_1017B55A9C3FCFC0"/>with Succeſs, it would not diſturb us; much leſs ſhould we diſcover a diſcontented murmuring Frame of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our <hi>Love to the World</hi> is then <hi>inordinate,</hi> when we take <hi>indirect Methods to gain it.</hi> Under this Head I rank not only thoſe who <hi>ſteal</hi> and are guilty of the more notorious Acts of <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> but thoſe alſo, who involve themſelves in <hi>Debts</hi> which they have no reaſonable Proſpect of honeſtly diſcharging, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what is due to another without his Knowledge or Conſent; ſuch as are diſpos'd to take every Advantage they can of their Neighbours, and embrace every Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to gripe and oppreſs them; ſuch as engage in more Buſineſs than they can accompliſh and attend the Duties of Religion, or engage in unlawful Buſineſs: Theſe all take <hi>indirect Methods</hi> to gain the World. I know many ſuch paſs for honeſt Men, and maintain a good Character; but their Character is better than they deſerve. There are fair open Ways enough of gaining a Subſiſtence and Livelihood in the World, Men need not make Uſe of ſuch mean Methods and ſo contrary to the Genius of the Goſpel; ſuch a Behaviour <hi>can</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from nothing but <hi>an unlawful Deſire of Gain,</hi> they are eagerly ſet upon growing rich, and have a Proſpect of gaining more in this Way, than in any other. They may indeed perſuade themſelves that there is nothing amiſs in their Conduct, becauſe they are not guilty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen palpable Acts of Injuſtice: but 'tis their Love to the World that deceives them; did they impartially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, many ſuch Acts as now they think juſt and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt would appear as <hi>really evil</hi> as open <hi>Robbery</hi> or <hi>Theft.</hi> That my Meaning may be quite plain, I ſhall inſtance in two or three Caſes too common among us wherein I think Men take <hi>indirect Methods</hi> to gain the World, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Hints I juſt now gave—Such then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the World in an <hi>unlawful Way,</hi> who involve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo deeply in <hi>Debt,</hi> that they can have no Proſpect
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005386_0010_1017B55C9CA0B088"/>of diſcharging their Obligations with the leaſt Meaſure of Punctuality, and ſo are neceſſitated to <hi>break their Word,</hi> if they have made any Promiſes; or at beſt to <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>defraud</hi> their <hi>Creditors:</hi> Who keep that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>trade upon,</hi> or to lay out to their Advantage, which they know to be juſtly due to another, without his Knowledge or Conſent, yea, when they know he wants it himſelf; Who never will pay their juſt Debts, till they are obliged to it; but for the Sake of a ſmall Advantage, which they hope to reap to themſelves, keep the honeſt Creditor out of his juſt Due as long as they can. Call this what you pleaſe, it is no better than <hi>Knavery</hi> and <hi>Cheating:</hi> The Money is not their own, nor have they any Right to uſe it; and it appears to me very little worſe to take their Neighbour's Intereſt out of his Cheſt, than to keep him out of what is due to him, when there is any Poſſibility off diſcharging the Debt; I ſay, when there is any Poſſibility of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Debt, becauſe an unforeſeen Series of Accidents may put it beyond their Power to do as they ought and really deſire to do: I ſpeak of thoſe, who will not pay their Debts when they are able, or involve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more deeply in Debt, then they have any Reaſon to hope, by a common Bleſſing upon their Endeavours, they ſhall be able to pay according to their Contract with and the conſequent Expectation of their <hi>Creditors.</hi> —Another inſtance, wherein Men take <hi>indirect Methods</hi> to gain the World, is this; a Man ſees his Neighbour in <hi>abſolute Neceſſity</hi> for a Sum of Money or ſomething elſe, which he can eaſily help him to, and which he knows or thinks he cannot procure elſewhere; upon this he demands very large Intereſt, or an extravagant Price, much more than he would pretend to aſk, if his Neighbour was not in ſuch extreme Neceſſity that he could not do without it: If this is not <hi>Extortion,</hi> I confeſs I am ignorant what is. It is equally <hi>unjuſt,</hi> when one Man impoſes upon the Ignorance of another,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005386_0011_1017B560824B76A0"/>puts off that <hi>Commodity</hi> for <hi>cheap,</hi> which he knows in his own Conſcience is <hi>dear,</hi> or that for <hi>good,</hi> which he knows to be <hi>bad;</hi> when he knows that the <hi>Buyer</hi> is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and depends upon him for Direction: This is a complicated Crime, there's <hi>Breach of Truſt</hi> as well as <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi> And yet, in theſe Ways how many are purſuing after Eſtates? In ſhort, with many the Role of Trading ſeems to be only this; every one to get what he can, and, if he don't actually ſteal, in what Way he can: The Worth of the Thing, the Value of their Labour or what would be a reaſonable Profit ſcarce come into Conſideration. Others there are, who take ſuch a Multiplicity of Buſineſs into their Hands, that they cannot accompliſh it without a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the more important Concerns; they are for driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World before them and ſcruple no Methods, that won't abſolutely deſtroy their Character, to gain the Things of it; They are always in a Hurry and can ſpare no Time to attend the Duties of Religion: Now what can ſuch a mean baſe ſinful Temper as this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from but an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> of the World? Would Men be thus eager after it, would they for the Sake of it ſo abuſe and oppreſs their Neighbours, if they had a juſt Contempt of it? Would they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect what is plainly their Duty for the Sake of it, if they did not love it too well? I allow there may be ſome Caſes, when we may defer or omit what would otherwiſe be our Duty for the Sake of taking Care of our <hi>temporal Eſtate:</hi> As it may be a Man's Duty to omit <hi>praying in his Family</hi> at the ſtated Seaſon, when he has a large Intereſt at Stake, or great Sums in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Hazzard. But ſuch Allowances in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Caſes will by no Means excuſe an <hi>habitual Neglect</hi> of theſe or ſuch like Duties: It will not be any ſufficient Excuſe for ſuch a Conduct to ſay, that your proper Buſineſs obliges you to omit your Duty; for the Caſe is plain; If it is ſo, your Buſineſs is unlawful, and you
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005386_0012_1017B56673F3B2A8"/>ought to lay it aſide and look out for another Calling; But I believe ſuch Pretences of want of Time for the Duties of Religion are uſually falſe and groundleſs, Men may attend them if they will, and find Time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for their worldly Buſineſs. Obſerve here, I ſpeak only of thoſe with Reſpect to <hi>Family Duties,</hi> who are at home with their Families; and not thoſe who are neceſſarily called at a Diſtance from them, as are our <hi>Seafaring Brethren</hi> and others. I ſpeak of thoſe who make a Practice of going out from their Families ſo early in the Morning and returning ſo late at Night under Pretence or really for the Sake of following their Calling, as that they have no Time to offer up their <hi>Morning and Evening Sacrifices of Prayer and Praiſe.</hi>— Such Men are certainly actuated by an <hi>inordinate Love to the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Our <hi>Love to the World</hi> is <hi>inordinate</hi> when our <hi>Anxiety</hi> about it leads us to <hi>diſtruſt the good Providence of GOD.</hi> This is the Temper of many: As others are diſcontented becauſe they have not an Abundance of the good Things of this Life; ſo theſe, altho' they have them, are perpetually reſtleſs and uneaſy, through a ſlaviſh Fear of loſing them. <hi>The ambitious Man</hi> can't ſleep, nor take any Comfort in his exalted Station, leſt ſome Change of Affairs ſhould happen, and he ſhould be deprived of his Honours. <hi>The rich Man</hi> is harraſs'd with continual Fears leſt he ſhould loſe his Subſtance; when he is awake he imagines it will be ſtole when he is aſleep; and the ſame diſquieting Fears diſturb his Reſt, he dreams of Thieves and Robbers and a thouſand Dangers when none is near him. They forget that the Moſt High governs the World, and orders all Things in it with conſummate Wiſdom, and watches over it with infinite Vigilance; and that he is able to preſerve to them the Bleſſings which he has beſtowed upon them; theſe Conſiderations would Influence them to put their Truſt in him, and to depend upon the Care of his Providence;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005386_0013_1017B569DCB61518"/>which would ſtill their Fears and quiet their Minds about Futurity.—<hi>Anxiety</hi> about the Things of the World, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways argues a <hi>Diſtruſt of GOD</hi> and his Providence; and ſo it evidences <hi>too great a Love to the World;</hi> for if we loved it in Meaſure, we ſhould be reſigned to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will about it, and leave our ſelves and ours at the Diſpoſal of our heavenly Father. I tell you again, I ſpeak not againſt a prudent Care of theſe Things; ſo far as this conſiſts with a humble Reſignation to the Divine Will, and a Dependance on the good Providence of GOD, it is our incumbent Duty. I ſpeak of ſuch an <hi>anxious Concern</hi> about worldly Enjoyments as unfits us for Duty, for Converſation, and deprives us of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Life. Such is the Care of <hi>Parents</hi> for their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> when they can't bear them out of their Sight, and if at any Time they are abſent from them, are fill'd with diſtreſſing Fears leſt ſome Accident ſhould befal them, altho' the ſame careful Providence watches over them then as at other Times. Such is the <hi>Anxiety</hi> of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> or thoſe that have ſmaller Sums at <hi>Sea,</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, leſt they ſhould loſe their Subſtance by Storms, Enemies or other Ways; when they ought to leave their Care with GOD and commit themſelves and their's to his good Providence. Such a Temper of Mind is a certain Indication that our Hearts are <hi>too much ſet on the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Our <hi>Love to the World is inordinate,</hi> if we are <hi>loth to part with it,</hi> when there is <hi>proper Occaſion</hi> for it, or are <hi>angry when GOD in his Providence takes it from us.</hi> It is an evident Truth; that, as GOD has given us all we enjoy, ſo, he has a Right to command us how we ſhall diſpoſe of it, or, if he pleaſe, to take it from us: It argues therefore, that we have a greater Love to the World than we ought to have, if we are unwilling to improve what he gives us according to his Will and Command, or murmur and fret, when he ſees fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of it: If we can ſee <hi>Objects of Charity</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005386_0014_1017B56B64C9FFD0"/>not relieve them; or if it troubles us when we meet with them; if we put them off with good Words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of generous Actions; or if we give grudgingly and and with Reluctance: If its a Burthen to us to ſupport the Goſpel, or to beſtow of our Subſtance for other pious Uſes; one who has only a religious Regard to theſe Things would give as freely as he receives, he conſiders his Eſtate as a Talent given him to improve, for the Improvement of which he muſt be accountable to GOD; under the Influence of this Conſideration, his chief Care is, how he ſhall diſpoſe of theſe Things ſo, as will beſt anſwer the Ends for which they were given him; he rejoices therefore, when he has an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſerving GOD or relieving his Brethren, and is willing to part with all for the Sake of CHRIST: I mean not, that, in ordinary Caſes, any one is obliged to give <hi>all he has</hi> in Charity; the State of the World or of the Church of CHRIST is not ſuch as to require it; but a good Proportion of our Income ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for this Purpoſe; and a greater as there ſhall be a Call in Providence for more. How vaſtly <hi>too great</hi> then is their Love to the World, who can't bear to ſpend a Penny either to promote the Kingdom of CHRIST or to relieve the Neceſſitous, and had rather their Money ſhould ruſt in their Cheſt, than take it out to keep a <hi>Brother</hi> from ſtarving?</p>
            <p>It proves the ſame <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to the World, if we find a Diſpoſition to repine at the Providence of GOD, when he takes away any wordly Enjoyment; if we can't chearfully, at leaſt without murm'ring, give up our Character, Eſtate and every Thing elſe, when GOD calls for them, or acquieſce in the Providence which deprives us of them; if we are apt to think hardly of GOD and behave undutifully towards him when he is pleaſed to remove <hi>Relatives</hi> near and dear to us. We ought never to ſet our Affections upon any Creature to ſuch a Degree, as that the Loſs of it ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005386_0015_1017B56EC3612490"/>our Reaſon, unfit us for Duty, or diſturb and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet us in it; but ſhould maintain ſuch an Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards them, as that whether with or without them, we could ſtill bleſs GOD, and think him a good GOD and a merciful Father.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When Men <hi>purſue</hi> the World with <hi>greater Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs</hi> than they do the <hi>Favour of GOD</hi> and the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Joys of Heaven,</hi> then is their <hi>Love to the World</hi> an <hi>inordinate Love.</hi> When they are warm, eager and diligent to ſecure any worldly Advantage, and are cool, lazy and indolent about obtaining an Intereſt in Chriſt and ſecuring the Treaſures of Heaven: When they make the World, the main Object of their Purſuit, and Religion a Thing by the by: When they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Care of their Souls rather than the Care of the World: When they are very ſollicitous to ſecure the Honours, Riches and Pleaſures of this World, and are under no Concern to be found unto Praiſe, Honour and Glory in the other World: Such a Temper evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers a <hi>too great Love</hi> to the World; becauſe the moſt valuable Objects ought always to be purſued with the greateſt Diligence; as then the Things of the World are no Way to be compared with the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which accrue from the Love and Favour of God; ſo our Love to them muſt be inordinate if we prefer them ſo as more earneſtly to follow after them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Our <hi>Love to the World</hi> is <hi>too great,</hi> if the <hi>Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of it afford us <hi>greater Delight</hi> than the <hi>Service</hi> of GOD and <hi>Communion</hi> with him. We always delight moſt in thoſe Things which we love beſt; the Service and Company of others is pleaſant and agreeable in Proportion to the Love we bear to them; according to this Rule we may determine which has the higheſt Place in our Affections GOD or the World: If we delight in the Service of GOD and prize the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him above every Thing here, then he has the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005386_0016_1017B5746325FC60"/>ſupreme Place; but if we take more Delight in the Things of the World, it is becauſe we love it beſt; and we certainly love the World too well, if we love it better than GOD who is the <hi>ſupreme Good.</hi> Their <hi>Love to the World</hi> is therefore <hi>inordinate</hi> who ſerve God with an unwilling Mind; who think it hard to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from their worldly Buſineſs to attend the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, and account the Sabbath and other Times which they ſpend in religious Exerciſes, to be loſt Time, and long to get into the World again; who can't keep their Hearts engaged, when they draw near to GOD with their Bodies; but ſuffer their Tho'ts to wander with the <hi>Eyes of the Fool</hi> unto <hi>the Ends of the Earth</hi>—Such Men have no Taſte for the Pleaſures of Religion, nor do they prize the Manifeſtations of Divine Love: The utmoſt Deſire of their Souls and the plain Language of their Practice is <hi>who will ſhew us any</hi> worldly <hi>Good.</hi> If they loſe any Part of their earthly Subſtance, they can grieve and mourn, nor can they take Satisfaction and Comfort from the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the infinite Fulneſs of Chriſt, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treaſures which are promiſed in the Word of GOD: But they can bear the Abſence of GOD and the Light of his Countenance without any Concern of Mind or Emotion of Spirit, and have no Uneaſineſs at the Want of Communion with him. If the World ſmiles upon them, they diſcover no Sollicitude about ſpiritual Pleaſures, or the Evidences of the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Such a Temper is a <hi>clear Evidence</hi> that we love the World <hi>too well:</hi> Every Thing ought to pleaſe us according to its real Value and the Degree of ſolid Pleaſure it is capable of affording: If then the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Religion, which reſult from Communion with and the Enjoyment of GOD are ſuperior to any which the World can afford us, as I take it for granted they are, it argues that we have too great a Value for the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005386_0017_1017B577D947F450"/>Enjoyments of the World, if we prefer them to the other. There can't be a clearer Evidence of an <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Love</hi> to the World, than when we purſue after the Pleaſures of it with greater Eagerneſs than we do ſpiritual Enjoyments, when we prize them more in Poſſeſſion, and mourn more for the Abſence of them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When Mon <hi>pride</hi> themſelves in the Things of this World, it proves that they have an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to them. This is extremely natural to Man; to value themſelves upon ſuch Things as diſtinguiſh them from others, and to deſpiſe thoſe who in theſe Reſpects are inferior to them; hence they expect great Deference and Reſpect, are offended if they are not conſulted in every Thing, are touchy and waſpiſh, won't bear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or endure Controul: Thus, its ſtrange to ſee, how ſome empty Wretches expect a Deference to their Judgment becauſe they are rich; as if Riches procured them Brains and they were Men of Senſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had large Poſſeſſions: So likewiſe as to Honour and other Things, they oftentimes put Men above themſelves, ſo that they are in a Rage at the leaſt Slight, yea, if they are not preferred before others. Now what can ſuch a proud haughty Spirit proceed from, but an Over-valuation of thoſe Qualifications they are endowed with, or thoſe Enjoyments they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs? They think more highly of them than they ought to think: This muſt be the Caſe when we pride ourſelves in any worldly Enjoyment, becauſe they are none of them ſo valuable, as that we can have any Reaſon to be proud of them; and this high Opinion of them muſt proceed from an undue Affection to them: Thoſe Objects which we love, we are always apt to think better of and to imagine them more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than they really are: Our Love to them cauſes us to look upon them with Prejudice, it blinds our Eyes,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005386_0018_1017B579CC5FC538"/>ſo that we don't ſee the Imperfections of the Object we love, and fancy a Thouſand Excellencies which are only imaginary. This is the Foundation of Pride, this is therefore an Evidence of an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to the World.</p>
            <p n="9">9. and laſtly, Our <hi>Love</hi> to the World is then <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,</hi> when we deſire only to keep within the Bounds of <hi>Duty,</hi> and allowedly proceed to the very <hi>Limits of what is lawful.</hi> A Chriſtian ought never to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented without Growth in Grace, it ſhould be his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Care to get at the greateſt Diſtance from Sin and to preſs towards Perfection. But how contrary to this is the Conduct of a great Part of the Chriſtian World, of thoſe who make a Profeſſion of Religion? They would be Chriſtians and that is all; they deſire juſt to eſcape Hell and get to Heaven and no more; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Reliſh for ſenſual Pleaſures, as did the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> for the <hi>Leeks</hi> and <hi>Onions</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> they have not ſuch a Love to Holineſs as that they deſire to be more holy; they'll readily gratify their Luſts and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the World, as far as they imagine they may venture to do it without forfeiting their Title to Heaven: As for ſuch as behave with more Strictneſs, and endeavour to be Examples of Holineſs, they ſtigmatize them as <hi>Preciſians, Phariſees</hi> and what not, while they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves behave with ſuch Levity, and approach at leaſt ſo near the Borders of Vice, as is a Scandal to Religion and a Diſgrace to their holy Profeſſion. Now what can ſuch a Behaviour as this proceed from but an <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Love</hi> to the World? Theſe Men have not loſt their Affection to it, though they may have reſtrained themſelves from the more groſs Acts of Sin; they flatter themſelves that they have renounced the World, whereas they have only reformed their Lives after a Sort, but their Hearts are the ſame, and they retain the ſame Affection to the World. Why elſe have they ſuch
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005386_0019_1017B57E4C219B28"/>an Inclination towards it and the Things of it? Why do they give themſelves ſuch a Licence, to go to the <hi>utmoſt Bounds</hi> of what is lawful, and allow themſelves in the Gratification of their ſenſual Appetites, ſo far as is not plainly ſinful; When they ought to endeavour to get at the greateſt Diſtance from the Ways of Sin, and as near to Perfection as they poſſibly can? This is a <hi>certain Evidence</hi> that they have an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to this World and the Things of it. Thus I have ſhown, by ſuch Hints as came to my Mind, what it is to have an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to the World.</p>
            <p>I come now to ſay Secondly.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That an <hi>inordinate Love of the World</hi> is <hi>inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> with the <hi>Love of GOD.</hi> But here I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that no <hi>particular Act of inordinate Love</hi> to the World is enough to determine that we have not Love to GOD: Alas! We are all too worldly carnal and ſenſual: The World ſteals upon the beſt and too often interrupts their Communion with GOD and draws away their Hearts from him. But I ſpeak of the <hi>habitual</hi> Frame and Temper of the Mind; when an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> of the World is the <hi>prevailing reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſpoſition of the Soul,</hi> the Love of GOD is not there.—For firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where there is <hi>true Love to GOD</hi> he has the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Place</hi> in the <hi>Affections:</hi> That Diſcovery of him which attracts our Love to him at all, will influence us to love him above every Thing elſe. — There is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in our Souls a Principle of Enmity to the bleſſed GOD, which reſults from this Conſideration, that he is holy, juſt and true, and that we are odious to his Holineſs, obnoxious to his Juſtice and expos'd to the Execution of his Threatnings: This Enmity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can never be removed, 'till the Cauſe is taken
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005386_0020_1017B585192E9C08"/>away; which muſt be by a Change both of our State and our Nature: Which Change is effected when GOD is pleas'd effectually to call us by his Grace: Our <hi>State</hi> is then changed by GOD's <hi>free juſtifying Act</hi> on Account of the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us on our receiving him by Faith; our Nature is changed by the <hi>Operation of the bleſſed Spirit</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Graces within us. When this Change is effected, GOD is no longer an Object of Hatred; the Cauſe of our Enmity is removed, we are not the Objects of his Anger or Diſpleaſure; he is reconciled to us and engaged for us; and his Goodneſs in ſhewing Mercy to ſuch guilty Rebels, as we all are in our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State, now recommends him to our Love, as much as his other Attributes render'd him hateful to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Yea, thoſe ſeverer Attributes of the Deity are now amiable and lovely: his Holineſs eſpecially, when we are ſanctified ourſelves, excites our Eſteem and Love; and all his Excellencies, which now ſhine upon the Soul with peculiar Luſtre, eſpecially as they are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Face of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> have this attractive Influence. And the ſame Conſideration which induces us to love him at all will conſtrain us to love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every Thing elſe: We love every Object ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goodneſs or Excellency there <hi>appeares</hi> to us be in it; as then after we are changed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the Holy Spirit, GOD evidently appears to the Soul the beſt and moſt excellent Being; ſo he will love him beſt: He will then ſee the Emptineſs and Vanity of the Creature, when compared with GOD, and therefore will deſpiſe it. That which induces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to love the World, is the Good which they think there is in it, it's Suitableneſs to their Deſires, Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Inclinations and the Proſpect of Happineſs they have from it: But the renewed Soul has his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations ſo changed that he no longer Deſires the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005386_0021_1017B5888D543F28"/>Pleaſures of the World, nor any Portion of it any further than is needful for his Subſiſtence, or than he can improve to the Glory of his Maker. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the World cannot yield him Happineſs; that there is that and infinitely more in GOD, than he can expect from the World; and he looks for Happineſs from him and not from ſublunary Enjoyments.— As then GOD, by the Diſcoveries which he makes of himſelf to the true Chriſtian, appears to him not of himſelf to the true Chriſtian, appears to him not only the greateſt but the beſt of Beings; as all he hopes for is from him; and he ſees evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no Creature is of any Service, or can yield any Pleaſure, or be of any Value, but by his Appointment; ſo he loves him with a ſupreme Affection; yea, he deſpiſes every Thing in Compariſon with him. 'Tis true, he ſtill loves the World, but with a ſubordinate Love, according to its real Uſe, and in its proper Place. Where there is not ſuch a ſupreme Love to God, there is no Love to him; this is the natural neceſſary Effect of that Change, which the Spirit of GOD makes in the Soul of a Sinner, when he renews and ſanctifies it.—</p>
            <p>But to go on Secondly,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This <hi>inordinate Love</hi> of the World is inconſiſtent with the Love of GOD becauſe it naturally leads to <hi>Acts directly contrary to the Will of GOD:</hi> Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, becauſe the Service of GOD and the World are inconſiſtent. The bleſſed GOD requires us to devote ourſelves to him, and to uſe the World ſo as ſhall moſt glorify him: But an <hi>inordinate Love</hi> to the World leads us to devote ourſelves to that, and to improve it in the Gratification or our Luſts. GOD commands us to mortify our Members and curb our Luſts: The World preſents us with Objects which tend to inflame our Deſires and provoke our Luſts. GOD commands us to ſet our Affections on Things above and not on
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005386_0022_1017B58A4BF4AB40"/>Things below: The World would engage our Affections upon earthly Enjoyments and repreſents the other as no Way ſuitable for us, and therefore not to be valued. GOD commands us to <hi>ſeek firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD and his Righteouſneſs;</hi> the World would entice us to neglect theſe Things till the laſt. GOD tells us that he is the alone Fountain of Happineſs: The World would have us to ſeek it in the Enjoyments of Senſe. GOD commands us to give him our whole Heart, to love him with <hi>all our Heart;</hi> but this is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inconſiſtent with an inordinate Love of the World. <q>GOD, ſaith, (to allude to the Words of another,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Henry. Expoſition upon Mat 6.24.</note> 
                  <hi>My Son give me thy Heart:</hi> The World ſaith, no, give it me. GOD ſaith, <hi>Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch Things as you have:</hi> The World ſaith, graſp at all that ever thou canſt. GOD ſaith, defraud not, never tell a Lie, be honeſt and juſt in all thy Dealings: The World ſaith, cheat thy own Father, if thou canſt get by it. GOD ſaith, be charitable: The World ſaith, hold thy own, this giving undoes us all. GOD ſaith, <hi>Be careful for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> The World ſaith, be careful for every Thing. GOD ſaith, <hi>Keep holy the Sabbath Day:</hi> The World ſaith, make Uſe of that Day, as well as any other for the World. Thus inconſiſtent are the Commands of GOD and the World, ſo that we cannot ſerve both.</q> Agreeably our Saviour tells us in forecited Matth. 6.24. <hi>No Man can ſerve two Maſters, for either he will hate the one and love the other. Or elſe he will hold to the one and deſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve GOD and Mammon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the APPLICATION of what has been ſaid; and,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005386_0023_1017B58DE57FC310"/>
1. I ſhall apply what has been ſaid for the <hi>Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Awakening</hi> of thoſe who <hi>have</hi> that <hi>inordinate Love of the World,</hi> which has been deſcribed. Many ſuch there are, 'tis to be fear'd, who yet think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good Chriſtians. They miſtake their Greedineſs after the World for Prudence, and their Covetouſneſs for Frugality: And upon this Principle, they blame others of a more generous charitable Diſpoſition, charge them with Extravagance, would have them think whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can afford what they give in this Way, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſha'n't hurt themſelves and Families. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, my Brethren, there is but little Need in our Day for ſuch Cautions as theſe: Few, very few are in Danger of hurting themſelves or their Families by what they give in pious and charitable Uſes; the moſt give but a Trifle in this Way. But, (ſuffer me to ſpeak my Fears) if I miſtake not, the moſt of you are in much greater Danger of loving the World too well. Look into your own Hearts then (for GOD calls you to apply theſe Truths to yourſelves rather than to others.) What are your Thoughts employ'd about? Is it not, how ſhall I buy and ſell and get Gain? How ſhall I advance my Eſtate? How ſhall I lay out my Money to the beſt Advantage? I ſay not, that all ſuch Tho'ts are ſinful; but don't they take up ſo much of your Time, that you ſhut out the Care of your Soul and neglect to ſecure the <hi>one Thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</hi> I verily believe that many think more how they ſhall get or ſave a Penny, than how they ſhall ſave their Souls from Hell. Is not their Love to the World then inordinate? Is it not too great to have any Room for GOD in the Heart?</p>
            <p>Again, What meaneth this Bleating in our Ears? What is all this Murmuring and Fretting that you have not more of the World? That you muſt toil and labour and yet be poor, while others get Eſtates
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005386_0024_1017B591CFCB8888"/>without half the Pains you take? Is not your Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt the Lord? Is it not he that allots out every one's Circumſtances? Did you love him half ſo well as you do the World, you'd be eaſy, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thankful; for the pooreſt of you have much more than you deſerve. The Apoſtle could ſay, <hi>I have learned in whatſoever State I am therewith to be content.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. <hi>4, 11.</hi>
               </note> How contrary are many, who would be thought Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians too, who <hi>in whatever State they are, are always diſcontented?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, What ſhall we ſay of thoſe who don't ſcruple to take any Meaſures juſt or unjuſt ſo they can but gain the World? I ſpeak not only to Thieves and open Robbers, but to many who would think it hard if their Goodneſs was to be ſuſpected: Such as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Poor and lie in wait to take Advantage of the Neceſſities of their Brethren: Such as have no Rule in Dealing, but to get as much as they can, and take extravagant Intereſt, when their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, through Neceſſity, are obliged to borrow of them: Such as will commend their Goods when they know them to be bad; and will take the Bread out of their Brethren's Mouths, to lay up Money in their Cheſts: who are growing rich upon the Spoils of others, and defraud others to raiſe themſelves.—Is this your Way to get Eſtates? poor Souls! You'l periſh with your Money unleſs you repent.</p>
            <p>Again, What Occaſion for that Anxiety and Diſtreſs which many diſcover leſt they ſhould not have enough to carry them thro' the World? Is there not a GOD in Heaven whoſe Care has been extended towards you, ever ſince you have been in the World? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming a Chriſtian is it, when he ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005386_0025_1017B5975C6C4A78"/>his Caſe to GOD, to unfit himſelf for Duty, through a reſtleſs Anxiety about Futurity.</p>
            <p>Again, You have Reaſon to ſuſpect your State; who are as ſtingy when you have got Money, as you was avaricious in getting it.— How hard is it to get any Thing out of ſome Men, when the Honour of GOD plainly calls for it! How many Excuſes do they make; its hard Times, I've a large Family. I allow there's ſomething in theſe Things, but will this excuſe you from doing any Thing for the Service of GOD? Or if ſome Men give, yet with what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Reluctance is it? It ſeems as if they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as willingly give a Piece of their Fleſh, it ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hurts them; and I'm ſure, it hurts me, when I ſee ſuch Men give.— GOD loves a <hi>chearful Giver,</hi> but he hates ſuch mean, ſordid, ſtingy Souls.</p>
            <p>Again, How melancholly is your Caſe, who can take Delight in the World, and the Things of it, but none in the Service of GOD: Who take great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in getting the good Things of Life, but none in converſing with GOD: Who are eaſy if you can but procure large Poſſeſſions to yourſelves, though you have no Communion with GOD, no Manifeſtations of the Divine Love.—Or who can labour and toil to get earthly Riches, but can find no Time to ſcare to ſecure the infinitely preferable Treaſures of Heaven. This World's Goods you may poſſibly get, but, if you carry this Temper with you to the Grave, the other you ſhall never have, theſe Things will be ſuch a heavy Weight upon you as will ſink you deep in the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit.—Need I ſay any Thing to ſet forth the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of thoſe who are puff'd up with Pride, on Account of what they enjoy here? Your Folly is inexcuſable and your Danger is great, that ſince you ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly miſimprove the Bounty of Heaven towards you, he will at Length take an effectual Way to humble
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005386_0026_1017B598E18471C0"/>you, even by leaving you to contemplate on your Vanity with Shame and Grief to all Eternity. As for ſuch as are for being religious and worldly too, who are for getting a little Grace, juſt enough to <hi>ſqueeze</hi> in at the ſtrait Gate; who deſire no more than juſt to get over the Line between a converted and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted State; I fear you'll be ſo cautious of going too far, that you won't go far enough.—In plain Words, ſuch a Temper diſcovers you are a Stranger to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and know nothing of the Power of Godlineſs. Oh be awaken'd and convinced then, all theſe Kinds of Perſons, I have been deſcribing love the World too well, too well to have any Love to GOD, too well to be Chriſtians. — But Secondly,</p>
            <p n="2">2. What has been ſaid may ſerve to reprove the Children of GOD. Alas do not the beſt of us find that we love the World too well: Though thoſe Tempers I have mentioned, are not the habitual Frame of our Minds; yet are they not too often prevailing, within us? Have we not had Reaſon to judge and condemn ourſelves more than once while we have heard an inordinate Love to the World deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But how is this, my Brethren! have we not choſen GOD as the Object of our Hope and Truſt? Does he not deſerve that Affection we have placed upon him? Yea, have we not found more Pleaſure in the little Communion we have had with him, and the little Time we have been ſerving him than in all that the World has afforded? Have we not found the World empty and vain; and that 'tis GOD only can ſatisfy our Deſires? Why then do we return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the World, or expect that from it which we know by Experience it cannot yield us? Shall we who have partook of the <hi>Fountain of living Waters,</hi> go back again to thoſe <hi>broken Ciſterns that can hold no
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005386_0027_1017B59A7639DDD0"/>Water?</hi> Shall we halt <hi>between two Opinions,</hi> who have determined upon ſo good Grounds for the Lord, and have choſen his Service? Oh rouſe up, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate on the Excellencies of the Divine Nature, and you'll ſee ſo much to attract your Love, that you'll deſpiſe every Thing which the World preſents.</p>
            <p>There are two Reaſons eſpecially, which ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Children of GOD not to diſcover too great an Affection to the Things of the World. The one is the bad Influence it is like to have upon others; they are ready to think they are within due Bounds, becauſe they ſee ſuch a good Man as eager and anxious about the World as they—the bad Example of good Men has a great Influence upon others: they ſhould therefore endeavour to diſcover their Contempt of the World and to ſhow the little Value they put upon it that others may follow them, may examine the real Value of it, and be brought to ſlight and deſpiſe it. The other Reaſon is that it will cloud their Evidences for Heaven if they ſuffer their Hearts to go out after the World. The Way to have our Title to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance clear'd up, is to get weaned from the World and more conformed to the heavenly World. The more worldly we are, ſo much the more Darkneſs are we like to have about our State, the more we are like the Men of this World, the more difficult it will be to determine that we are not of it ourſelves. And this may diſcover to many of us the Reaſon, why we have not had more of the Light of GOD's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: We have been too worldly, too eager in our Purſuits after it, too anxious about the Things of it, when we ought to have conſider'd ourſelves as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and Strangers here, and lived as ſuch.—</p>
            <p n="3">3. But I would juſt ſay one Word for the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſome poor diſconſolate Souls, who are
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005386_0028_1017B59FEBE5AFA8"/>ready to conclude every Thought about the World unlawful, and to give all over for loſt, becauſe they are not ſo weaned from it as they think they ſhould be. As to the firſt of theſe: You can't expect to be free entirely from the Cares of the World; while you are here, you muſt and you ought to think about it, and to take Care for your comfortable Subſiſtence here. As to the other, I am inclin'd to think it's true, that you are not ſo weaned from the World as you ought to be: But is not this your Grief, your Burden? Don't you long to get more wean'd? Don't you mourn before GOD that you are ſo much attach'd to the World? And pray that you may have Grace to withſtand the Temptations of it? Don't you watch againſt it, and ſtrive againſt it, and don't you long to be free from the Snares of it? This is not the Temper of thoſe, who have an habitual inordinate Love to the World, but are the genuine Marks of a Child of GOD.</p>
            <p>In fine, Let us all be exhorted to <hi>moderate our Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to the Things of this World, and to place them on GOD and CHRIST and Things that are heavenly and Divine. Your own Experience will teach you, that all Things here are empty, vain, and unſatisfactory; whatever we promiſe ourſelves from the Enjoyment of them, we find ourſelves diſappointed, and ſtill a great Way off from that Eaſe and Contentment which we expected from them. It is not in their Nature to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the boundleſs Deſires of our rational Souls.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all ſublunary Enjoyments are fading and periſhing; they <hi>make to themſelves Wings and flee away;</hi> they will ſoon leave us, or if not, we muſt ſoon leave them; and if we chooſe our Portion here, we muſt go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it hereafter, if the World engroſſes our Affections while we are in this State, we muſt be miſerable fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.—Shall we ſuffer theſe Things then to engage our
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005386_0029_1017B5A3E17C5F58"/>Attention, our Affections, our Deſires, and Purſuits, which are ſo mean in themſelves and ſo fatal in their Conſequences? Eſpecially, when they come in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the <hi>Treaſures of Heaven,</hi> which are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely valuable in themſelves, and eternal in their Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Theſe, my Brethren, are worthy your cloſeſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; you can't be too earneſt in your Deſires, or too eager in your Purſuit after them. Oh then, <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of GOD and his Righteouſneſs.</hi> Labour to make ſure of an Intereſt in CHRIST, he is the <hi>Pearl of, great Price;</hi> and if you can but make him your's, tho' it be at the Expence of all you have in this World, you'll gain infinitely by the Bargain, you'll find that Happineſs in Communion with and in the Enjoyment of him, which you vainly expect from the Things of this World, and infinitely more: in him there are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches, it has pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell,</hi> he can ſatisfy your moſt enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deſires, and make you as happy, as without him you muſt be miſerable. — If you are intereſted in his Merits, you ſhall have Grace and Glory, nor will GOD withhold any good Thing from you. If GOD ſees it to be for your Good, he will beſtow the Enjoyments of this Life upon you, for ſo far <hi>Godlineſs has the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this Life</hi> as well as <hi>of that which is to come.</hi> And what reaſonable Man would deſire the Promiſe of it any further? But however GOD may ſee fit to deal with you here, you ſhall be admitted to the richeſt Happineſs in the Glory of the heavenly World. I conclude with Col. iii. 2, 5. <hi>Set your Affections on Things above, and not on Things on the Earth. Mortify your Members which are upon the Earth—inordinate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, evil Concupiſcence, and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry.</hi>
