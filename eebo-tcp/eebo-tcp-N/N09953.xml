            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A REPLY TO Mr. <hi>Joſeph Fiſh.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALL muſt allow that to know, the true limits of the church of Chriſt, what are his inſtitutions, and who have a right to them, are matters of no ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; tho' many have complained, and not without reaſon, that in many of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about them in our day, the nature of the ſubject has not been ſo cloſely attended to as it ought, but that many things have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced which tend to miſlead or perplex the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring mind, rather than to enlighten it. And as I ſhall have occaſion before I cloſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to give the particular reaſons of my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this ſubject, I deſire to refer the reader thereto for his own ſatisfaction, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed directly to the argument in hand.</p>
            <p>In 1767 Mr. <hi>Joſeph Fiſh</hi> publiſhed nine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons from Mat. 16.18. in which he tried to prove, that thoſe called <hi>ſtanding churches</hi> in New-England, are built upon the Rock, and from
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012655_0003_0F8BBEDC87878938"/>thence to ſhew what great evils they are guilty of who have withdrawn from them. In this proceeding many were ſo fully perſuaded that he had injured both the truth and people of God, that I was prevailed with to publiſh an axamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſermons in 1768.</p>
            <p>Againſt which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has endeavoured to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf and his ſermons, in a piece intitled, <hi>The Examiner Examined,</hi> printed 1771; which, for reaſons hereafter to be given, I think expedient to make ſome reply to, under the following heads.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Of the <hi>matter</hi> of the goſpel church.</p>
            <p>This is the capital point of our diſpute. I concurred with Mr. <hi>F.</hi> that the <q>Truth which Peter confeſſed, or the perſon of Chriſt, of whom this confeſſion is made, is the ROCK upon which Jeſus Chriſt reſolves to build his church; and that Peter was one of thoſe <hi>lively ſtones,</hi> or precious <hi>materials</hi> of that building.</q> And when he obſerved from Deut. 29.10, &amp;c. <q>That children, even infants were always reckoned a part of that body or church, which the Lord gathered in Abraham's family,</q> I readily concurred with that alſo; but when he ſaid, <q>Is it not altogether reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the Chriſtian church is made up of the <hi>ſame materials,</hi> that the Jewiſh church was?</q> my anſwer was, No by no means, becauſe God has ſaid the contrary; to prove which I referred him to ſer. 31.31, 32. Heb. 8.5, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">Let the reader obſerve, that through this diſcourſe, Ser. ſtands for Mr. <hi>F</hi>'s Sermons: Ex. for my Examination of them; and only p. with figures, for his laſt piece.</note> Ex. p. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:012655_0004_0F8BBEDD44E03310"/>
Now in reply Mr. <hi>F.</hi> charges me a number of times with entirely miſtaking his meaning, for no better reaſon that I can ſee, than only becauſe I dont agree with it. At length he comes to the point in hand, and ſays if he underſtands me, he thinks my meaning is, <q>That the covenant which God made with Iſrael when he brought them up out of Egypt, was the covenant which took in parents and children, and made them the <hi>materials</hi> of the Jewiſh church; but the new covenant which he would make with them afterwards is eſſentially different from that covenant; and therefore there muſt be an eſſential difference in the materials of the churches, Jewiſh and Chriſtian.</q> p. 27.— —True, that is my meaning; and what has he produced againſt it? Why he firſt tries to reduce it to this abſurdity; that I hold the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of the <hi>viſible</hi> church to be all gracious perſons, and yet own that hypocrites do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>creep</hi> into it; which conſequently puts an end to the diſtinction between <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Theſe, ſays he, are his ſentiments ſo far as I can ſee any thing of his meaning.</q> Yet I did repeatedly anſwer this very objection, Ex. p. 57, 95. And Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has a remark upon a page in which I obſerved that, Theſe miniſters <hi>confound</hi> the conſtitution of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches together, and ſhuffle and ſhift from one to the other as occaſion ſuits, and then charge us with not diſtinguiſhing between the <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible</hi> church. They allow that the inviſible church contains none but the <hi>firſt born which are written in heaven,</hi> Heb. 12.23. but they would have the viſible church contain abundance more;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012655_0005_0F8BBEDE2E01C560"/>and fly to the Jews, to parables, and to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites to ſupport their notions. Whereas the proper notion of viſible is the making <hi>manifeſt</hi> what was before inviſible: hence ſays Paul, <hi>With the heart man believeth, and with the mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is made;</hi> therefore an <hi>outward ſhew</hi> of what is not <hi>inviſibly real,</hi> is <hi>hypocriſy.</hi> The only reaſon why any get into the viſible church who are not born again, is not owing to the <hi>rule,</hi> but to the <hi>imperfection</hi> of men in acting upon it. Hence old Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> in anſwer to this queſtion, <hi>Do not hypocrites and no true members of Chriſt</hi> creep in? Says, <q>Yes; but if they could have been known to be ſuch they ought to be KEPT OUT; and when they are known, they are orderly to be CAST OUT. Mat. 25.1, 2 Tim. 3.5. Rev. 2.20. Tit. 3.10.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">His ſum of the Chriſtian Religion. p. 25. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are my words; and I did hope that at leaſt the ſentence of one of our learned fathers who compoſed the <hi>Cambridge</hi> platform, would have had ſome weight with Mr. <hi>F.</hi> but no; that old beaten road muſt be kept, let fathers or children be trampled upon ever ſo much, yea and his eyes are ſo dim that he ſays, "I dont ſee why Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 
               <q>may not juſt as well ſay of Paul and his brethren in the miniſtry, as he does of me and mine:—for who of all writers or preachers, does ſo much as Paul and the other apoſtles, at connecting the Jewiſh and Chriſtian churches together; ſhewing that the latter ſprings out of the former; or rather, is but a continuation of the <hi>ſame</hi> church?</q> p. 116. And are there no means to help our authors eye-ſight? Yes;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012655_0006_0F8BBEDEC344AB80"/>at the top of the ſame page he has helped mine, and I cant but hope to requite his kindneſs in the ſame way. I had quoted 2 Tim. 3.5, but was ſo ſhort-ſighted as to write, THE <hi>form of godlineſs,</hi> inſtead of A <hi>form.</hi> This he corrects, and ſays, <q>There is THE form of <hi>ſound words,</hi> which we are to <hi>hold faſt;</hi> and ſo THE form of divine ſervice which <hi>God</hi> has inſtituted to be religiouſly obſerved, and not trifled with. And there is A form of godlineſs which <hi>man</hi> invents and ſets up, and ſo not binding to chriſtians, widely different from THE form which is of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I heartly thank Mr. <hi>F.</hi> for this correction, and that for two reaſons; one is becauſe I am glad to get rid of my own miſtakes; the other is becauſe I hope to do him and others good by it, and for that end requeſt attention to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. THE form of <hi>ſound words,</hi> calls the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that conſtituted Abraham's houſehold into a church, <hi>The covenant of circumciſion.</hi> Act. 7.8. But A form that man has invented calls it, <hi>The covenant of grace.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 THE form of ſound words, calls Abraham's two ſons, with the mothers who bare them, an <hi>allegory</hi> of the TWO covenants, one of which the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> the other the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> church ſtood in. Gal. 4.22—31. But the words of mans invention, and which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> follows, ſay, <q>The covenant that made the Jews the church of God is eſſentially the <hi>ſame</hi> in all ages,</q> p. 39.</item>
               <item>3. The form of ſound words ſhews that circumciſion was a <hi>ſign</hi> of Chriſt's death, and of an inward change, Col. 2.11. and that as Abraham had this change, and by faith
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012655_0007_0F8BBEE38562B150"/>
                  <hi>ſaw</hi> and <hi>embraced</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John 8.56. Heb. 11.13.</note> Chriſt <hi>before</hi> circumciſion was inſtituted, it was a <hi>ſeal</hi> of the <hi>faith that he had,</hi> when he was in <hi>uncircumciſion,</hi> Rom. 4.10, 11. But man's wiſdom aſſerts that it was a <hi>ſeal</hi> to that church in general, tho' it is never called ſo in the ſacred oracles.</item>
               <item>4. From Abraham's faith in Chriſt, <hi>before</hi> circumciſion and other rites of the law were appointed, the apoſtle proves that his title to be <hi>heir of the world,</hi> ſo that all believers ſhould be called <hi>his children,</hi> was not thro' the Jewiſh covenant, but a <hi>better</hi> covenant, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>better promiſes,</hi> Rom. 4.12, 13. Gal. 3.16, 17. Heb. 8.6. Yet Mr. <hi>F.</hi> holds both cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to be eſſentially the ſame. He allows a circumſtantial difference, and that the goſpel diſpenſation is <q>more ſpiritual, ſimple, and free from outward ceremonies.</q> p. 35. More <hi>ſpiritual</hi> as to ordinances, but <hi>carnal</hi> as ever in materials; for he declares that <q>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the conſtitution of this new covenant, that neceſſarily requires a <hi>change</hi> of the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> of the church.</q> p. 36. Tho' THE form of ſound words, plainly makes ſo great change in the materials, as there is between the children of Abraham's fleſh, and the <hi>children of God;</hi> and tells us that thoſe of his ſeed which the Gentiles were grafted in among, were a <hi>remnant accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the election of grace;</hi> the <hi>reſt</hi> being <hi>broken off</hi> becauſe of <hi>unbelief,</hi> and thoſe who <hi>ſtood,</hi> it was <hi>by faith,</hi> Rom. 9.8, and 11.5, 17, 20. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</item>
               <item>5. The greateſt difference between the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of circumciſion, that God made with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and the new covenant which he made with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012655_0008_0F8BBEE5D3750888"/>his believing poſterity, lay in the <hi>materials</hi> of the church. The firſt of his ſeed who was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed was an unbeliever; and when that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was renewed, and the ordinance of the paſſover was added, in <hi>the day</hi> that Iſrael came out of Egypt, there was alſo a precept given, that when a <hi>ſtranger</hi> would join with that church, <hi>let all his males be circumciſed, and then let him come near and keep it.</hi> Exod. 12.48. But God ſays, the new covenant with the believing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, is <hi>not according</hi> to the covenant he made with their fathers <hi>in that day;</hi> and the ſpecial excellency of this new covenant is, that <hi>all ſhall know him from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> Heb. 8.8—11. Here note; Iſhmael did not know God tho' he was thirteen years old when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted one of the materials of that church, but it would not have anſwered ſo well, to have placed the oppoſition there, becauſe Abraham had no precept given him to admit <hi>ſtrangers</hi> by <hi>houſholds;</hi> that was given in <hi>the day</hi> they came out of Egypt. So that as I ſaid before, I cannot conceive it poſſible, for words to expreſs more plainly than theſe do, that there is an eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the materials, as well as the forms of the two churches.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And what has Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſaid againſt this? Why he has taken up much time to prove, that the covenant of grace was always the ſame, and that God has brought ſome to know him in all ages (which I never denied) and then he both adds to, and takes from the word of God; and by that time he has got ſo bewildered, as to deny his knowing any thing of what himſelf had tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſt above. This you will ſay is very ſtrange.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012655_0009_0F8BBEE6ED541C58"/>It is ſo, but no more ſtrange than true. I have already proved that the word of truth calls the covenant which formed Abraham's houſhold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a church, The covenant of circumciſion; but Mr. <hi>F.</hi> takes this away, and <hi>adds</hi> the name <hi>grace</hi> to it, which is not put to it in the bible; and reaſons upon it till he ſays, <q>As for any expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit act or prohibition, forbidding children to come (into the chriſtian church with their believing parents) neither Mr. <hi>B.</hi> nor any other, that I know of, plead ſuch a bar.</q> p. 36. And yet he had tranſcribed in the ſame page, part of my plea of ſuch a bar, becauſe God <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly</hi> ſays, the new covenant is <hi>not according</hi> to that which he made in <hi>the day</hi> wherein he firſt appointed ſuch a practice. I am very ſenſible that children are freely called to come to Chriſt, and that 'tis a joyful thing to hear them cry, <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to him, which implies <hi>faith</hi> in him as the <hi>Saviour;</hi> but I do plead an explicit prohibition againſt bringing them to baptiſm before they profeſs this faith. For the firſt adminiſtrator of baptiſm expreſsly required, <hi>fruits meet for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and ſaid to the Jews, <hi>Think not to ſay we have Abraham to our father.</hi> Mat. 3.8, 9. I am ſenſible that many will here tell us, that this reſpects men's coming upon a <hi>perſonal</hi> right. True it does ſo; but then it is an explicit teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that baptiſm is not a token of the <hi>ſame</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that circumciſion was; for that covenant took in all the <hi>men</hi> of Abraham's houſe ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if any one of them remained uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, <hi>that ſoul ſhould be cut off from his people.</hi> Gen. 17.14. Thus the covenant that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that church, took in all the <hi>men</hi> of Abraham's
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012655_0010_0F8BBEE718C68F50"/>houſe: and as the <hi>men</hi> of his houſe, were thus warned not to <hi>think</hi> of coming to baptiſm upon their <hi>father's</hi> right; and as the Hebrews were expreſsly told, that the new covenant is <hi>not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi> to the covenant that was made in <hi>the day</hi> that firſt opened a door for <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to bring, their <hi>houſholds</hi> upon their faith; if all this does not lay an explicit bar againſt ſuch a practice, I deſire to know what can lay one?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now endeavour to conſider all the force of Mr. <hi>Fiſh's</hi> arguments againſt this point, as diſtinctly as my capacity will admit of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He endeavours to prove that this <hi>new</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſet in oppoſition to the Sinai law, which neither took in nor caſt out children, and not to Abraham's covenant, which he ſays, "was a pure covenant of grace." p. 29. And that infants, <q>muſt certainly hold their place in the church, —unleſs by ſome ſpecial act of God, their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege is taken away; which is not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Here then appears the <hi>fatal</hi> miſtake of Mr. <hi>B. fatal</hi> to his cauſe.</q> p. 32. Anſwer, if the taking away the name which the holy Ghoſt has given to that covenant, and adding that of <hi>pure grace</hi> to it; and applying Gal. 3.17. thereto, in which the apoſtle expreſsly refers to Abraham's juſtification by faith in Chriſt, <hi>before</hi> he took the <hi>bondwoman,</hi> by which he proves that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of circumciſion is now to ceaſe when the <hi>ſeed Chriſt</hi> is come. Gen. 12.3, and 15.6. Gal. 3.6, 8, 16, 17. and 4.31. If theſe things be duly examined, I believe the <hi>fatal</hi>-miſtake will be found to belong to his cauſe, and not mine: for this new covenant is ſet in oppoſition to what was done, in the day they came out of Egypt,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012655_0011_0F8BBEE7C5139B38"/>more directly than to what was done at Sinai, months or years afterward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> quotes a number of texts out of the old teſtament which ſpeak the language of grace, and then ſays, <q>I WILL and they SHALL, was ever the gracious word of God, or form of his covenant of grace; how then is this a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covenant,</hi> eſtabliſhed upon <hi>better promiſes?</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> argues.</q> p. 34. Anſwer, I have already obſerved, that the covenant of grace was always the ſame, and the language, <hi>I will</hi> and <hi>they ſhall,</hi> in Abraham's covenant, inſured the continuance of the church in the line of his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, till THE SEED ſhould come <hi>to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made.</hi> Gal. 3.19. but then all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in him, were <hi>broken off</hi> from the church of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> grants this, but ſtill will have it that the chriſtian diſpenſation preſerves the <hi>ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for kind,</hi> becauſe the new covenant is made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> p. 37. To which I reply, that I well know the goſpel church was firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of believing Jews; the ſecond covenant was made with them, but then the covenant was <hi>new,</hi> and ſo different from the firſt, that Chriſt <hi>took the firſt out of the way, nailing it to his croſs,</hi> that he might <hi>eſtabliſh the ſecond:</hi> and has charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to <hi>beware</hi> leſt any man, thro' <hi>philoſophy and vain deceit,</hi> ſubject us to <hi>ordinances</hi> from thoſe <hi>rudiments.</hi> Col. 2.8, 14, 20. Heb. 10.9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our author would have it, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is only circumſtantially and not eſſentially new; to prove which he refers us to the law of <hi>love,</hi> which is eſſentially the ſame in all ages; yet our Lord calls it <hi>new.</hi> becauſe he taught it more plainly, and preſſed it by <hi>new motives,</hi> p. 35.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012655_0012_0F8BBEE894EEB420"/>I fully concur with his premiſes, but not with his conſequence, for this new commandment is ſo far from being <hi>oppoſed</hi> to the old, that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be <hi>the old commandment</hi> which we had <hi>from the beginning.</hi> John 13.34. 1 John 2.7, 8. Whereas this new covenant is <hi>not according</hi> to the old one; and the difference is ſo great that the firſt of Abraham's ſons, and multitudes of thoſe who came after, were in their <hi>ſins,</hi> and did not <hi>know God,</hi> when they were taken into covenant, but the ſubjects of this new covenant <hi>all know him,</hi> and have their <hi>ſins forgiven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> holds this difference to be only gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and ſays, <q>In goſpel times the bleſſings of this new covenant were to iſſue forth <hi>more abundantly.</hi>
               </q> p. 35. But I anſwer, that the ſubject we are upon is, not the <hi>degree</hi> of things, but the <hi>nature</hi> of the church conſtitution; for he owns that <q>'tis the <hi>covenant</hi> that makes the church <hi>what it is.</hi>
               </q> p. 39. I muſt therefore once more turn him to his own corrections, and obſerve, that THE form of the church which God has appointed ſays, <hi>They ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; for</hi> ALL <hi>ſhall know me, from the</hi> LEAST <hi>to the greateſt.</hi> Heb. 8.11. This is the covenant which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, makes the church <hi>what it is.</hi> And who is there that does not know, that the <hi>oracles of God</hi> which were the <hi>chief</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the Jewiſh church, Rom. 3.2. were confined ſo much thereto, that before Chriſt had taken that covenant away, and nailed it to his croſs, he expreſsly forbid his apoſtles to preach to any but thoſe who were in it? yet after it was taken away he commanded them to <hi>teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012655_0013_0F8BBEE9457AA238"/>and to <hi>preach the goſpel to every creature,</hi> in order to bring ſuch as were <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>believed,</hi> to baptiſm and into the church. Mat. 10.5, 6, and 28.19. Mark 16.15, 16. So that the greateſt difference between theſe two covenants appears to be, that men muſt have a ſtanding in the firſt, in order to have the free uſe of the means which ordinarily <hi>teach them to know God;</hi> while theſe means in a clearer light, are now freely uſed with all nations, in order to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecond covenant; and that none come into the church aright but ſuch as knew him before. And if any get in beſide ſuch as ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> they do not come in by the <hi>door,</hi> but like <hi>thieves, climb up ſome other way,</hi> or <hi>creep in unawares:</hi> John 10.9. Gal. 2.4. Jude 4.</p>
            <p>Here my opponant tries again to involve me in an abſurdity, and ſays, <q>Whether they got in by <hi>creeping,</hi> flyly or boldly; thro' the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of the church, or with their <hi>conſent</hi> and according to their judgment, it matters not in the preſent caſe; they are <hi>in the church:</hi> and ſo 'tis after all but a viſible church, of the common ſtamp.</q> p. 45. But where will tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition carry men! who ever thought that if a thief has but once got <hi>into the houſe,</hi> that would make void the law that forbids his coming there and what ſchool is it that will teach, that thoſe who take God's <hi>covenant into their mouths,</hi> if they once <hi>ſee</hi> that a <hi>thief</hi> IS IN, it is "no matter" if they then CONSENT <hi>with him!</hi> Pſalm 50.16, 18.</p>
            <p>However I muſt not forget that our author ſays, I miſtook his meaning. He tells us that his book treats of the church in a <hi>large</hi> ſenſe, but that I take the word in the moſt <hi>limited</hi> ſenſe.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012655_0014_0F8BBEEA60A39740"/>This he inſiſts much upon. p. 10, 15, 16, 23, 51. To which I reply, that the title of his book is, <q>The church of Chriſt a firm and durable houſe:</q> and his firſt character of it is, <q>That Jeſus Chriſt has but ONE church in the world, and that is the <hi>ſums</hi> which it always was.</q> I obſerved that the <hi>inviſible</hi> church is ſo, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my exception againſt its being true of the <hi>viſible</hi> church, which I took notice was what Mr. <hi>F.</hi> intended. Ex. p. 11. and whether the houſe be ſo large as he would make it or not, I thought was the main point of diſpute between us; and to have firſt allowed it to be ſo large, and then to have tried to prove that it was not ſo, is a way that I never learned. Indeed he tells me, that my book "ſufficiently proves" me not to be a <hi>learned</hi> man in their way. p. 126. and he alſo ſays, <q>Needful accompliſhments of <hi>learning,</hi> can be judged of by none but ſuch as are <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> thus accompliſhed.</q> p. 82. It ſeems then that I muſt refer it to the learned, whether the right way of diſputing be for one to lay down a propoſition, and for another to own it to be truth, and then try to prove that it is not ſo? and whether a <hi>maſter</hi> of <hi>arts</hi> would act in <hi>charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or not, if he declared that the other, "diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes without an opponant, and talks entirly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the purpoſe." p. 16, only becauſe he did not firſt allow that what he diſputes againſt is truth!</p>
            <p>Might I be indulged with the common privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Engliſh men, to be tried by my equals, I ſhould not much fear the conſequence; for as far as I am acquainted, people in towns endeavour to have their materials ſo <hi>framed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012655_0015_0F8BBEEF56BFE9E0"/>they are put into the <hi>houſe,</hi> that <hi>every joint</hi> may ſupply its place.<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. 2.21. and 4.16. Col. 2.19.</note> And in new beginnings in the wilderneſs, where they build in the courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner, I think their materials are all <hi>cut off from their natural ſtock,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 11.24.</note> before they are put into the houſe; and if a learned gentleman ſhould tell thoſe new beginners, that they ought to build their houſe ſo <hi>large,</hi> as to take in a good quantity of the <hi>young groth</hi> for future repairs; and one ſhould attempt to convince him of his miſtake, I hardly think the honeſt people would attribute their controverſy to a miſtake about the meaning of the word <hi>houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was ſo far from miſtaking his meaning, that I took particular notice, that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> holds thoſe who own the covenant, according to the ſynod in 1662, and all baptized children, to be <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> ſo as to be under <q>the faithful authoritative watch and diſcipline of the church,</q> Tho' I obſerved, that the talk of diſciplining ſuch in our day, was but <hi>empty words.</hi> Ex. p. 104. <note n="‡" place="bottom">His notion of diſciplining ſuch, is to <hi>inſtruct</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> upon them "till their way is cleared" to come up to full communion. Ser. p. 90, 92, but what diſcipline is this, more than may be exerciſed toward thoſe, who are not in the church? Any man in the Jewiſh church who <hi>forbore</hi> to keep the paſſover, unleſs neceſſarily hindered, was to be <hi>cut off from his people</hi> Num. 9.13. Hence Mr. <hi>F</hi>'s <hi>large</hi> notion of a church, has neither law nor goſpel to ſupport it.</note> But he ſays of that part of my book, that he could not ſee as I had <hi>touched</hi> his arguments with anything <hi>to the purpoſe,</hi> and therefore paſſes it over. p. 118. So I ſhall leave theſe matters with the reader, and cloſe this head with the following queries.</p>

            </list>
            <p n="2">II. Of the goſpel <hi>manner of building</hi> churches.</p>
            <p>I know Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, <q>I have really nothing to do with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> upon this head; 'tis out of the queſtion, as a <hi>particular</hi> church is not <hi>the church,</hi> which my ſermons treat of.</q> p. 51. It may therefore be needful to enquire into the following things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is any other viſible church-ſtate inſtituted in the goſpel, but a particular one? <hi>The church</hi> ſpoken of by our Lord in Mat. 18.15,—18, is ſuch an one as a brother can <hi>tell</hi> his grievance to; and whoever thought that could be to any other than a particular community? The ſeven churches of Aſia are ſpoken to by their great Head, not as one national or provincial church, but as ſo many diſtinct churches, who are commended, or reproved by him, according as their <hi>works</hi> were, in each particular community. The church of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012655_0017_0F8BBEF2DDD29520"/>Corinth was reproved, for neglecting to <hi>judge</hi> ſuch as were <hi>within,</hi> and not thoſe <hi>without</hi> their particular ſociety. 1 Cor. 5.12. And if Mr. <hi>F.</hi> was not treating of a particular church, what means his talk of the privilege of the baptized, as being under her authoritive watch and diſcipline? In truth our fathers were not a little puzzled with this queſtion. One of them that concurred with another who had gone before him, in <hi>reſolving</hi> to have an argument able to <hi>remove a mountain,</hi> before he would recede from infant baptiſm; and was <hi>peremptory</hi> for bringing perſons to own the covenant, in order to bring their children to baptiſm, who did not ſee their way clear to come up to full communion; yet he confeſſed himſelf not to be ſo peremptory whether they were baptized as in a <hi>catholic,</hi> or in a <hi>particular</hi> church-ſtate. But after much labour between him and others of great note upon it, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to reſt the matter thus; <q>That we are to diſtinguiſh between a particular church, as it is more <hi>ſtrictly</hi> taken for a <hi>particular corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of covenanting believers, entruſted by our Lord with the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and as it is more <hi>largely</hi> taken for that ſpecial part of our Lord's viſible church, which doth <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> in this or that particular place.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Mitchel's life, p. 70, 78. and Dr. Increaſe Mather's, life. p. 54.</note>
               </q> So that according to them, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in a particular <hi>place</hi> entitled ſuch as would own the covenant to baptiſm and diſcipline, while the power to diſpenſe them belonged to the church more ſtrictly taken.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012655_0018_0F8BBEF309EA19E8"/>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, <q>This is what our ſeparate brethren <hi>improperly</hi> called a half-way cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</q> Ser. p. 92. If ſo his learned brethren have now got very openly into the ſame <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> has writen a number of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt it under that name; and a learned opponent of his ſays, <q>As to the <hi>half-way</hi> practice; I am in it, but not for it.

            <p n="2">2. To enquire whether perſons ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſaving faith when they come into the church or not? Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſays, <q>We deſire no more to conſtitute <hi>church members,</hi> and we can deſire no leſs than what in a judgment of charity may comply with the <hi>union</hi> that is between Chriſt the Head and the church, 1 Cor. 12.27. Eph. 2.22. 1 Cor. 3.16, 17. 2 Cor. 11.1. 18. 1 Theſ. 1.1. &amp;c. that may in the ſame judgment anſwer the way of the beginning and increaſe of the church according to the will of God, who adds unto the church ſuch as ſhall be <hi>ſaved.</hi> Acts 2.47. the rule of our receiving of them being <hi>becauſe he hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them,</hi> Rom. 14.1, 2. that may anſwer that profeſſion of faith which was the <hi>foundation</hi> of the church, which was not what <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi>

               </q> The laſt of theſe ſcriptures is connected with Mr. <hi>Fiſh's</hi> text. To which I ſhall only add, that, tho' ſome in our day would have it, that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>all the heart,</hi> which was required of the Eunuch in order for baptiſm, meant ſomething ſhort of ſaving faith; yet Paul ſays, If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy <hi>mouth</hi> the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt <hi>believe in thine heart,</hi> that God raiſed him from the dead, thou <hi>ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Rom. 10.9. Note, he that believes <hi>in his heart, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> how daring then is it for any to argue that, a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>all the heart,</hi> can mean any lower kind of faith!</p>
            <p n="3">3. How is this faith to be confeſſed? The foregoing ſcriptures and many more ſhew, that it was with the <hi>mouth</hi> or verbally; tho' many would have it to be general and not particular: to prove which the Eunuch's declaration is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times produced. Not obſerving, that Philip had immediate teaching from heaven to go to him, and got well acquainted with his ſoul-exerciſes before this confeſſion; nor the vaſt difference there is between ſaying, <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> now when a man would expoſe himſelf in the world to ſay the contrary; to what it was then, when that truth was ſo much denied. Saints are often called God's witneſſes; and who does not know, that the general teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony from ſuch is not ordinarily enough, but men want to hear in particular, how
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012655_0020_0F8BBEF48FF95B00"/>they came to the knowledge of what they teſtify? Hence, tho' Peter had immediate direction from above to go to Cornelius, yet when he came he would have from <hi>his mouth</hi> an account how he came to ſend for him. And when the church at Jeruſalem wanted ſatisfaction of Peter about that matter, he did not turn them off with a general declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the holy Ghoſt ſent him, and owned him; tho' he had a much better claim to be credited by that church, than common perſons now have to be credited by a church they would join with: but inſtead of turning them off with generals, Peter <hi>rehearſed the matter from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and expounded it by order unto them.</hi> Acts: 11.4. And as our Lord has commanded his diſciples, not to give <hi>holy things</hi> to unholy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to <hi>beware</hi> of falſe prophets, ſaying, <hi>ye ſhall know them by their fruits.</hi> Mat. 7.6, 15, 16. ſo he has explained thoſe fruits to be, what is <hi>brought forth</hi> out of the <hi>heart</hi> by <hi>ſpeaking.</hi> Luk. 6.45. and John ſays, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us.</hi> And do not theſe things ſufficiently prove that the goſpel method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing our faith, is by a particular declaring of it with our mouths?</p>
            <p n="4">4. To whom is the declaration to be made? Mr. <hi>F.</hi> refers us to a clauſe in Cambridge pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form where they ſay, in caſe of <q>exceſſive fear,— 'tis ſufficient that the <hi>elders,</hi> having received <hi>private</hi> ſatisfaction, make relation thereof in public before the church.</q> p. 51.

                  <q>All the pleas of the Romaniſts are utterly inſufficient to ſecure their papal dominion from this ſword of the mouth of the Lord Jeſus; for, whereas their utmoſt pretence and defence conſiſts in this, That it is not dominion and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>abſolutely</hi> that is forbidden, but the <hi>unlawful, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, oppreſſive</hi> exerciſe of power;—never was there any dominion in the world, more cruel,—than that of the Popes hath been.

Our author in his ſermons tells us, that Chriſt did not go to colleges or ſchools of learning for his firſt miniſters, but that they whom he took into his ſchool, were chiefly <hi>unlearned</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> men; to whom in a little time, he gave ſuch a meaſure of knowledge, learning, and grace, as abundantly qualified them for the great work, whereto he appointed them. Yet now ſince the canon of ſcripture is compleated, he ſays, <q>It muſt be but a fond conceit, a remark without reaſon, judgment or truth—to ſay, The Lord is now raiſing up and ſending forth,—unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ignorant men.</q> And he repreſents all ſuch as going <q>without any warrant or call from the King of Zion,</q> and compares them to <hi>Sceva</hi>'s ſons. Acts 19.15, 16.</p>
            <p>But of them that are furniſhed with <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>underſtanding,</hi> he ſays, <q>Such men being found, and preſenting <hi>themſelves,</hi> with a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſerious <hi>deſire</hi> to engage in the work (1 Tim. 3.1.) the apoſtle farther directs and charges, that they ſhall have the work of the <hi>miniſtry committed</hi> to them by authorized hands, even by <hi>officers</hi> already in the church.</q> &amp;c. In reference to which, as I came acroſs his uſe of the word extraordinary in another caſe, I inſerted a note upon the great things that were done by that word, and ſaid, <q>The power of Chriſt in <hi>qualifying</hi> men for miniſtry, without going to colleges for them, is hereby limitted to the apoſtles days; and all are rejected with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by Mr. <hi>F.</hi> who do not receive their <hi>gifts</hi> at <hi>college,</hi> and their <hi>authority</hi> from <hi>authorized</hi> hands, p. 15—17, and theſe authorized hands, by the help of this word have got ſuch an

                  <hi>extraordinary</hi> power as the apoſtles never had. For the apoſtles were only <hi>witneſſes</hi> for Chriſt, and as ſuch pointed out to the church, what qualifications officers ſhould have, and ſaid, <hi>Brethren look ye out among you</hi> ſuch men. Acts 1.8. and 6.3. But theſe pretended ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the apoſtles, aſſume a power to limit the church, in her choice to ſuch as they have <hi>approbated;</hi> which I truſt will be made evident to be a power which the apoſtles never had.</q> Ex. p. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>The reader may note, that here I ſpake of the qualifying, approbating, and choice of officers; but Mr. <hi>F.</hi> paſſes over what I <hi>ſaid,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to tell what I <hi>meant:</hi> for he ſays, <q>'tis evident Mr. <hi>B.</hi> there means a power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining officers in the church.</q> And ſo fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon what I neither ſaid nor meant in that place, he accuſes me with <q>keeping back the principal words in the text, as it relates to the preſent queſtion:</q> and with affirming that the apoſtles, "never had <hi>power</hi> to ordain;"—with a <q>preſumptuous handling of the holy ſcriptures, and a daring corrupting of the ſenſe of them,</q> &amp;c. p. 65, 66. The way he takes to try to prove that I meant what I did not expreſs, is to tell the reader that I refer to a page in his book that treats of ordination; as if I had referred to but one page; whereas my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was exactly as I have now laid it before the reader, who will judge whether I have injured the truth or not, ſince the apoſtles only deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what thoſe officers qualifications and work ſhould be, and then called the church to <hi>look them out;</hi> and the church did ſo, and <hi>they</hi> ſet
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012655_0025_0F8BBEFC32CFEB58"/>thoſe whom they had looked out, <hi>before</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. But the modern method is, for ſuch as <hi>deſire</hi> to be miniſters, <hi>humbly</hi> to <hi>preſent themſelves</hi> before officers to be approbated; and the church is limited, in her choice of miniſters, to ſuch candidates.</p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>F.</hi> cannot deny, but after ſaying much upon it, he comes to theſe words; <q>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we think the affair of examination and judging of the qualifications of candidates for the miniſtry, is committed to the <hi>miniſters,</hi> by the Head of the churches, yet we neither arrogate it <hi>wholly</hi> to ourſelves, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, i. e. ſo as to exclude the people from try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judging and chooſing for themſelves; nor do we ever pretend to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon <hi>them,</hi> thoſe whom we examine and approbate.</q> p. 82. Reply: What I charged them with, he is here forced to own; and though his mind was ſo intent upon miniſterial power, as not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the churches choice, in the page which he ſays treats of ordination, yet I did not ſuppoſe that he excluded the people from a choice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their candidates; and to ſay I charge them therewith, is what I deny, and let him prove it if he can. This art of ſlipping in ſomething which does not belong to the caſe in hand, to prevent its appearing in its true light, is a dreadful part of the <hi>learning</hi> of our world. Not only ſo, but he has alſo proved himſelf <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſably</hi> guilty of the <hi>ſame thing</hi> that he unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged upon me; namely, of keeping back principal words of ſcripture, on which the preſent queſtion depended. For when I produced our Lord's commendation of the church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012655_0026_0F8BBEFEB88E0318"/>Rev. 2. to prove that it is the churches work to <hi>try miniſters,</hi> Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, <q>Theſe words were ſpoken <hi>to</hi> and <hi>of</hi> the <hi>angel</hi> or <hi>miniſter</hi> of the church.</q> p. 81. And keeps back thoſe important words, that the epiſtle is, <hi>What the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>ſaith</hi> UNTO THE CHURCHES. What a <q>daring and manifeſt corrupting of the holy ſcripture is here!</q>
            </p>
            <p>So when I obſerved that in Paul's day, letters of commendation were <hi>to</hi> and <hi>from the church;</hi> but proved that ſome miniſters in our land claim a power like civil rulers, contrary to the expreſs command of Chriſt, and then ſaid, If miniſters would leave their <hi>worldly</hi> compariſons, and attend wholly to divine rule, I believe they would find that it belongs to the church <hi>with</hi> them to try miniſters. Ex. p. 40, 41. Yet Mr. <hi>F.</hi> takes much pains to make the reader believe that I don't hold ſo, and at laſt ſays of the Corinthian church, <q>If letters of commendation went <hi>from</hi> them or came <hi>to</hi> them, 'twill be hard for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to prove that the <hi>brotherhood</hi> and <hi>not</hi> the <hi>miniſters,</hi> gave and received them</q> p. 83. I was ſo far from ſaying <hi>Not</hi> the miniſters, that I ſaid The church <hi>with</hi> them; and if men under a pretence of learning may thus change our words from <hi>with</hi> to <hi>not,</hi> what will they not do to ſerve their own turn!</p>
            <p>From approbation we now come to ordination; and I obſerve that the grand point wherein he accuſes me with perverting ſcripture is my ſaying the apoſtles were only <hi>witneſſes;</hi> 
               <q>which (ſays he) every one knows are perſons that act in a very different character from thoſe who <hi>appoint, ſet</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:012655_0027_0F8BBEFF9ECBFCC8"/>and <hi>ſix</hi> in a ſtation or office.</q> p. 66. Anſwer 1. It is ſo in earthly ſtates; tho' by the way, 'tis as well known, that in ſuch ſtates all office-power is originally derived from the people; and in the Maſſachuſetts, if not in other provinces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon towns have power, when they have elected their officers, to inveſt them therewith, by their moderators giving them their oaths, before the meeting is diſſolved; and would he place the church of Chriſt beneath our common towns?</p>
            <p>Anſwer 2. Our Lord himſelf told his apoſtles, that they ſhould receive <hi>power,</hi> after the holy Ghoſt came upon them; and that they ſhould be <hi>witneſſes</hi> unto him, both in Jeruſalem, and unto the uttermoſt part of the earth. Acts 1.8. And in after times he ſpeaks of giving <hi>power</hi> unto his <hi>witneſſes,</hi> and they ſhall propheſy. Rev. 11.3, 6. Therefore let our author and others conſider well, where men have got to, who plead for <hi>power</hi> to "act-in a <hi>character</hi> very different from" that which the Son of God gave to his apoſtles, and to later miniſters. The gift of God which Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy received by the putting on of Paul's hands, and which he was called to <hi>ſtir up,</hi> was <hi>not the ſpirit of fear, but of</hi> POWER, <hi>and of</hi> LOVE, <hi>and of a</hi> SOUND MIND. A <hi>power</hi> to keep him from being <hi>aſhamed of the</hi> TESTIMONY <hi>of our Lord,</hi> or of his ſuffering ſervants. A power to <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words in faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> at a time when many <hi>turned away</hi> from that cauſe. 2 Tim. 1.6—8, 13—15. This pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er keeps Chriſt's miniſters from <hi>fainting,</hi> and enables them to <hi>renounce the hidden things of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, not walking in</hi> CRAFTINESS, <hi>nor handling the word of God</hi> DECEITFULLY, <hi>but by manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012655_0028_0F8BBEFFC8C1F950"/>of the</hi> TRUTH, <hi>commending themſelves to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God.</hi> And any miniſter who has not a meaſure of this <hi>power,</hi> if he could have as many biſhops or preſbyters, to lay their hands upon him, as could ſtand betwixt here and Jeruſalem, they could not make it the duty of any ſoul to obey him as a miniſter of Chriſt. What we are called to is to <hi>obey the truth;</hi> and ſo far as miniſters hold forth the truth by word and example, it is an important duty to obey and follow them; yea to eſteem them highly in love for their <hi>works ſake.</hi> Gal. 3. 1. Phil. 3.17.1 Theſ. 5.12, 13. Heb. 13.7, 17. And thoſe who <hi>deſpiſe</hi> ſuch, deſpiſe him that ſent them. Luke 10.16.</p>
            <p>But to have men's <hi>perſons in admiration becauſe of advantage</hi> is an evil way; even tho' it were the perſon of an <hi>apoſtle</hi> or an <hi>angel from heaven.</hi> Gal. 1.9. Jude 16. And as all true religion has its ſeat in the hearts and conſciences of men, from whence it flows out into their lives and conduct; ſo Joſhua when he had laid open the truth to Iſrael, ſaid, if it ſeems evil <hi>unto you</hi> to ſerve the Lord, <hi>chooſe you this day whom you will ſerve.</hi> And Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to the Jews, <hi>Why even of yourſelves judge ye not what is right.</hi> And Paul ſaid to the Chriſtians, <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay.</hi> Hence it is referred to every conſcience, whether we can juſtly view the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in any other light, than as being Chriſt's <hi>witneſſes</hi> and the <hi>churches ſervants.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.5. pointing out to the church what was to be done; who having choſen their officers, and ſet them before them, that the apoſtles in conſequence of the churches act, laid hands on them, and were
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012655_0029_0F8BBF009E52DCF8"/>the churches mouth to heaven for a bleſſing on ſaid officers. I think this idea is confirmed by what Peter ſays of himſelf; for when writing to elders, he ſtiles himſelf alſo an <hi>elder,</hi> and a <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and a <hi>partaker</hi> of the glory that ſhall be revealed. From whence he exhorts the elders of churches, to feed the flock of God, taking the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither <hi>as being lords</hi> over God's heritage, but being <hi>enſamples</hi> of the flock.</p>
            <p>Now you may remember that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> (as quoted a little back) tells us, that the utmoſt pretence and defence of the Romaniſts, to ſecure their dominion is, That it is not dominion ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely that is forbidden, but the <hi>unlawful ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranical</hi> exerciſe of power. And I before refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mr. <hi>F.</hi> to one of his brethren in the ſame county with him, and a truſtee of one of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, that he would limit Chriſt's church to for miniſters, who aſſerts, that the rights conveyed by the keys, and belonging to the <hi>elderſhip only,</hi> are <q>As diſtinct as the rights of a magiſtrate are from thoſe of a private freeman, in a civil community. Theſe rights are connected <hi>with,</hi> and inherent <hi>in</hi> the <hi>office</hi> of the elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. —The expreſs charge given them, not to <hi>lord</hi> it over God's heritage, ſuppoſeth them to have ſuch rights and powers <hi>above, over,</hi> and diſtinct <hi>from,</hi> and independent <hi>of</hi> the church.—For—'tis not poſſible they ſhould be in danger of <hi>abuſing</hi> a power they never had.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſecond letter upon lay-ordination, by Mr. George Beck-with of Lyme.

And according to both, Peter miſtook the caſe when he ſaid, Not <hi>as lords;</hi> for he ought to have ſaid, Not <hi>as tyrants!</hi> and ſo they are the reverſe of the apoſtles, who ſpake not in the <hi>words</hi> which <hi>man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghoſt teacheth;</hi> comparing <hi>ſpiritual with ſpiritual.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.13. For theſe late plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for power, ſpeak not in the <hi>words</hi> which the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> teacheth, but in thoſe which man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom teacheth; comparing Chriſt's <hi>heavenly</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>earthly</hi> ſtates, directly in the face of his word.</p>
            <p>Our author imagines that as our excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <q>had indeed felt the ſeverities of a uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power at home, the power of the clergy, it endangered the other extreme.—Here they abate to themſelves the <hi>power</hi> which Chriſt their Lord had given them, in the point of ordination.</q> p. 46. But when all is ſaid and done, can it be more certain that three and two make five, than it is, that if the power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only in officers, then he muſt have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſucceſſion of ſuch ordinations, down from the apoſtles, or elſe he has not a right ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation himſelf? To try to cover the matter with <hi>don't knows</hi> is to go back into the church which holds <hi>ignorance</hi> as the mother of devotion. As in the jewiſh church the prieſthood was limited to one line, ſo I produced an inſtance, of ſuch as the ſacred hiſtorian allows to be children of the

Then from an old book he mentions the names of ſome in each century; and I obſerve that <hi>baptiſts</hi> miniſters will do as wellas any, if people do not know them to be ſuch. For in the 12th century, beſide others he ſays, <q>Were <hi>Peter Bruis</hi> and his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Henry</hi> of Tholouſe, two famous preachers againſt popiſh errors.</q> p. 25.

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012655_0032_0F8BBF02E0E445D8"/>to the plain ſcripture example which ash been produced, he ought not, either as <hi>polluted</hi> to be put from the miniſtry, or elſe own him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have been unjuſt in blaming, both our fathers and us, for holding the power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be in the church? I proceed to conſider</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Of the difference between civil and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical government.</p>
            <p>In opening the conſtitution of thoſe which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> calls ſtanding churches, I produced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny facts, to ſhew how civil and eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs have been confounded together in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; which has done amazing miſchief, and was the worſt miſtake that our fathers brought to this land. I fully declared <hi>for a harmony</hi> between the church and ſtate, but <hi>againſt ſuch a union</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as has been practiſed among us. Ex. p. 23.</p>
            <p>In reply Mr. <hi>F.</hi> blames me much for not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe matters reſt as our fathers had left them, while yet he has not the courage to juſtify all their conduct, nor to run the line, or fix the bound between the two powers, better than they did; and ſays, "This is too delicate an affair "for me to attempt." p. 56. Then he goes on to prove, what I never in the leaſt denied, that the Jewiſh church and ſtate were united, while yet their acts as to civil polity, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip, were kept diſtinct. p. 56.57. Yet from this and ſome other things he tries to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, or elſe to confound me.</p>
            <p>Two things therefore appear neceſſary here to be conſidered; which are, how the civil rulers in Iſrael did behave toward the church, and what the difference is betwixt us and them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:012655_0033_0F8BBF03A06EE6F8"/>
Firſt, how did Iſrael's civil rulers behave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the church? This may be anſwered in two branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to a place and furniture for worſhip. Tho' their great Lawgiver could, had he ſeen fit, as exactly have proportioned each man's part of the expence, as to have given the <hi>pattern</hi> of what was to be made; yet inſtead of that, after giving notice of what was wanted, he ſaid, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is of a <hi>willing</hi> heart, let <hi>him bring an Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto the Lord,</hi> gold, ſilver, &amp;c. Exod. 35.5. And when their coſtly temple was to be built. David like a <hi>nurſing father,</hi> led the way, and of his <hi>own proper goods,</hi> offered very largely; and then exhorted his people to do the like; which had ſuch effect, as cauſed him with grateful won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſay. <q>As for me in the uprightneſs of my heart I have <hi>willingly</hi> offered all theſe things; and now have I ſeen with joy, thy people which are preſent here, to offer <hi>willingly unto thee.</hi>
               </q> 1 Chron. 29.3, 17.</p>
            <p>Who can fail to obſerve, that here it appears, both in the proviſion that was made for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and for the temple, that what was done was <hi>offered to the Lord,</hi> and that, as each one found a <hi>willing heart,</hi> without any preſcribing or compelling in either case? Indeed half a ſhekel was preſcribed for each man to offer, to make attonement for his ſoul, in which the rich ſhould not give more, nor the poor leſs. Exod. 30.15. Importing that all ſouls are of equal value; which money was for the ſervice of the tabernacle. And when the temple needed repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in after times, the king ſaid to the prieſts, all this money, and all the money that <hi>cometh into
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012655_0034_0F8BBF04470FE450"/>any mans heart to bring into the houſe of the Lord,</hi> let the prieſts take it, every man of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and let them repair the breaches of the houſe. 2 Kings, 12.4, 5. But they being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent of their duty, the king reproved them for it; and at his commandment they prepared a cheſt, and ſat it in the gate of the houſe, and made a <hi>proclamation</hi> through Judah and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, to <hi>bring in to the Lord</hi> the collection that Moſes commanded. And <hi>all the princes,</hi> and <hi>all the people rejoiced,</hi> and <hi>brought in</hi> and <hi>caſt into the cheſt in abundance.</hi> 2 Chron. 24.6, 8—11. This was their method, as to the place of worſhip, and</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the ſupport of thoſe who mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in it; we find that the great land-lord and proprietor of all things, enjoined it upon Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to offer him the firſt fruits, and alſo the tenth of all their increaſe, to be a proviſion for his miniſters, for the ſtranger, fatherleſs and widow; which they were to offer as they would expect a continuance, and a <hi>bleſſing</hi> on his land. Levit. 18.9—13. Deut. 26.1—15. Thoſe alſo who miniſtred at the altar, were to partake with it. Levit. 6.16—26.1 Cor. 9.13.</p>
            <p>And we find in the reformation in Hezekiah's time, that he firſt ſtired up thoſe miniſters to their duty, and then the people to give them their <hi>portion,</hi> that they might be <hi>encouraged</hi> in their work; and as ſoon as his commandment came abroad, the children of Iſarel <hi>brought in abundance.</hi> 2 Chron. 31.2—5. And after the Jews return from captivity, they were very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in their covenant concerning theſe matters; and, when they neglected to act accordingly, Nehemiah contended with them, and ſtirred them
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012655_0035_0F8BBF055655C218"/>up to their duty. Neh. 10.32—39. and 13.10—12. Afterwards the Lord by his prophet, charged them with <hi>robbing</hi> him in theſe things, and declares that he had <hi>curſed</hi> the whole nation therefor: but calls them to <hi>return</hi> unto him, and <hi>bring in</hi> the <hi>ſtores</hi> ſo that their might be <hi>meat</hi> in his houſe, and to prove him therewith, if he would not pour them out ſuch a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> that they ſhould not have room enough to receive it. Mal. 3.7—10. All which very clearly ſhew, that both rulers and prophets, endeavoured each in their place, to ſtir up the prieſts and Levites to do their duty in the houſe of God, and to ſtir up the people to do their part, both toward his houſe, and towards thoſe who miniſtred therein; but I cannot find that rulers were ever allowed, much leſs required, to uſe any <hi>force</hi> to bring any to it. We have many accounts of their inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corporal puniſhments in other affairs, but not in this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is the difference between the Jewiſh ſtate and ours? I anſwer</p>
            <p n="1">1. The laws of their ſtate, were made by infallible authority; ours are but the <hi>ordinances</hi> of fallible <hi>men.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God was the King of that ſtate, idolatry was treaſon againſt him as ſuch; hence his laws were moſt ſtrict, that if a brother, the wife of their boſom, or a friend that was as their <hi>own ſoul,</hi> ſhould ſecretly entice them to ſerve <hi>other gods,</hi> they ſhould not only refuſe to conſent; but ſays God, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely kill him.</hi> And if they found that one of their cities had thus turned away. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:012655_0036_0F8BBF05E9A04FA0"/>Deut. 13.6, 9—15. But the King of Zion ſays, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world;</hi> which he gave as the reaſon why his ſervants ſhould not <hi>fight,</hi> to prevent his being delivered into the hands of his enemies. John 18.36. And his laws allow of ſome ſort of <hi>company</hi> with <hi>idolaters</hi> of this <hi>world;</hi> and if a <hi>brother</hi> in the <hi>church</hi> be found guilty of this crime, chriſtians are only required to come out and be <hi>ſeparate from ſuch company.</hi> 1 Cor. 5.10, 11.2 Cor. 6.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Iſrael would ſet up a king over them, it muſt be from <hi>among their brethren,</hi> and ſays God, Thou mayeſt not ſet a <hi>ſtranger</hi> over thee, which is <hi>not thy brother.</hi> Deut. 17.15. But it was in obedience to a decree from Caeſar, (a <hi>ſtranger</hi> and an <hi>idolater</hi>) that Joſeph with Mary came to Bethlehem, when Jeſus was born, Luke 2.1, 7. And when the Jews aſked Jeſus, if it was <hi>lawful</hi> to give <hi>tribute</hi> to ſuch a ruler? his anſwer was, Render unto Caeſar, the things which are Caeſars; and unto God, the things that are Gods. Mat. 22.21. And his goſpel expreſsly allows, the <hi>ſword to execute wrath</hi> upon evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in civil ſtates. Rom. 13.4. Whereas the foundation and ſupport of Chriſt's Kingdom is TRUTH. John 18.36, 37. And tho' his ſervants walk <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> yet they are <hi>not to war after the fleſh;</hi> for their <hi>weapons are not carnal.</hi> 2 Cor. 10.3, 4. Were this difference between church and ſtate juſtly viewed, it would obviate the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſome make, againſt any uſe of the carnal weapon at all, as well as prevent others abuſing of it about religion as many do: For,</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Jewiſh ſtate the <hi>prieſts</hi> ſentence had
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012655_0037_0F8BBF0A85433E88"/>
               <hi>liberty;</hi> and ſuch as he pronounced <hi>utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> muſt be had away <hi>without the camp.</hi> Levit. 13.1—46. And by his ſentence a man might dwell in his own houſe or not; yea by it, a houſe muſt be <hi>broken down,</hi> and its materials carried <hi>without the city.</hi> Levit. 14.44, 45. And their power went ſo far as to <hi>thruſt a king</hi> out of the temple when he appeared to be <hi>unclean.</hi> 2 Chron. 26.20. But what awful tyranny, yea helliſh cruelty, has been practiſed under the chriſtian name, by the <hi>prieſtcraft</hi> of thoſe who have <hi>confounded</hi> the Jewiſh and chriſtian conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions together! Tho' if we view them in their diſtinct light; the high prieſt was an evident type of Him who has the <hi>key</hi> of David, that openeth, and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth, and no man openeth. Rev. 3.7. And the other prieſts were types of the <hi>lively</hi> materials of which his <hi>houſe is built.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. And by the ſentence of our great high prieſt, a <hi>houſe</hi> or church, which will not be <hi>cleanſed</hi> or reformed, is taken down or <hi>remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of its place.</hi> Rev. 2.5. And by the ſame power will our earthly <hi>tabernacle</hi> be <hi>diſſolved.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1—4.</p>
            <p>And as the apoſtles were inſpired to publiſh his goſpel, they reſtored to <hi>men</hi> the <hi>key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> which blind guides had <hi>taken away.</hi> Mat. 23.13. Luke. 11.52. And were inſtruments of opening a <hi>door of faith</hi> unto the gentiles. Acts 14.27. And by the ſame authority they gave rules for receiving members into Chriſt's church; and by his <hi>power</hi> the <hi>church</hi> of God at Corinth, <hi>called to be ſaints,</hi> were required, when they were <hi>gathered together,</hi> to <hi>put away from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> a wicked perſon. 1 Cor. 1.2. and 5.4, 13.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012655_0038_0F8BBF0CDA23E118"/>and their obedience thereto was a puniſhment <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted of many.</hi> 2 Cor. 2.6. And not a word of its being a work done only by officers. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> who aſſumed ſuch a power to himſelf, when an apoſtle wrote <hi>unto the church;</hi> his <hi>prating</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> therein is expoſed, for a warning to all after ages. 3 John 9.10.</p>
            <p>Miniſters, as diſtinct from other ſaints, are never called prieſts in the new-teſtament; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the power of the ancient prieſts to govern in the houſe of God, is an argument for, and not againſt the government of Chriſt's houſe, being in the church as a body. In all civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from the greateſt empires to our common families, ſome have power to <hi>judge for others,</hi> which power others ought to <hi>ſubmit to;</hi> but our Lord has moſt plainly forbidden, either the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or ſubmitting to any ſuch thing in religion. Luke 22.25—27. Truth is ever to be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, tho' bad men deliver it; but we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to call any man on earth <hi>maſter</hi> or <hi>father.</hi> Mat. 23.1—9. Miniſters ſhould be <hi>burning and ſhining lights,</hi> and rule the church as the ſun <hi>rules the day,</hi> by holding forth <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> to direct and quicken men in their walk and work. This is to be done by word and and example. Mat. 5.14—16. Heb. 13.7, 8, 17. And dreadful will be the caſe of all ſouls who diſobey ſuch rule and influence; but even women are called to <hi>look to it,</hi> that they <hi>receive not</hi> ANY teacher of a contrary character, as they would eſcape a <hi>partaking of his evil deeds.</hi> 2 John 8.11.</p>
            <p>Once more,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſame birth that brought a Jew into the <hi>world,</hi> brought him alſo into the <hi>church,</hi> even
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012655_0039_0F8BBF0EDC30A108"/>ſo that if a conformity to its ordinances was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,</hi> he muſt be <hi>cut off from his people.</hi> Gen. 17.14. Num. 9.13. And if he or a ſtranger blaſphemed God's name or committed adultry, they muſt <hi>ſurely be put to death.</hi> Levit. 20.10, 11. and 24.16. But the goſpel only requires. excommunication for ſuch crimes, if impenitent, and forgives and receives ſuch perſons, when penitent. Mat. 12.31. John 8.11.1 Cor. 5.1. 2 Cor. 2.7.1 Tim. 1.13, 20. And though Chriſt ſows nothing but good ſeed where ever his goſpel comes, yet he knew how the devil would do the contrary; and alſo how his own ſervants would be in danger of acting toward the <hi>tares,</hi> the children of the <hi>wicked one,</hi> when they <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> among <hi>his children;</hi> therefore he ſtated this caſe in a parable, and then explained it to his diſciples, to let them know, that the order of the <hi>kingdom of heaven</hi> is, to let <hi>both grow together</hi> in the <hi>world</hi> till the end of it. Mat. 13.24—30, 37—39. Yet how dreadfully have theſe orders been violated in our land!</p>
            <p>I produced many inſtances of violent methods that were taken, with ſuch as would not conform to, nor ſupport the <hi>pariſh miniſters.</hi> Mr. <hi>F.</hi> now ſays, It is quite injurious for me to charge theſe things upon <hi>miniſters</hi> or <hi>churches;</hi> and ſays, <q>Whether thoſe proſecutions he ſpeaks of, were <hi>fact,</hi> or if <hi>fact,</hi> whether <hi>right</hi> or not (which is not my buſineſs here to determine) it matters not in the preſent caſe: 'tis evident they are the doings of the <hi>civil authority,</hi> and of that ALONE.</q> p. 56, 59.</p>
            <p>On which I would remark
<list>
                  <item>1. That miniſters influence in thoſe affairs is too well known, by
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012655_0040_0F8BBF0F8AF3CD70"/>rulers and people, to admit this aſſertion for truth.</item>
                  <item>2. What Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has diſcovered thro' his book, leaves no room to think that he would have left theſe <hi>facts</hi> undiſputed, if he could have found any ground to diſpute upon.</item>
                  <item>3. If it was not his buſineſs to have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to determine whether thoſe proſecutions were <hi>right</hi> or not, what buſineſs had he to blame me for expoſing them? Nay, he does try to juſtify them; for the rules concerning the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates power in <hi>matters eccleſiaſtical,</hi> which were laid down by former <hi>miniſters,</hi> he now declares with "judgment and excellency of ſpirit;" p. 59. and the proſecutions referred to, were exactly according to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of them rules, as I ſhall have further occaſion to ſhew to him.</item>
                  <item>4. To avoid the name of uſing <hi>force</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port religion, he calls the contracts made with miniſter's <hi>civil covenants,</hi> and the proceedings of the civil ſtate to collect the ſame, <q>acts of the civil ſtate done for <hi>its own utility.</hi>
                     </q> p. 56.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I obſerved that the <hi>offerings</hi> of the people, out of which ancient miniſters were fed, were as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from civil contracts, as their own houſes were from the temple. Ex. p. 79. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, my conſequence is <hi>falſe:</hi> and to prove it, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the contract of a people with a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to build or repair a meeting-houſe, which he obſerves is for <hi>religious worſhip,</hi> yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is intirely of a <hi>civil nature;</hi> and after ſome reaſonings upon it he ſays, <q>Let the ſervice done, be what it will, ſpiritual, civil or ſecular, 'tis ſolely the <hi>conſideration</hi> in the covenant that denominates it. If the <hi>conſideration</hi> be money
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012655_0041_0F8BBF1047346BE0"/>or worldly ſubſtance, 'tis a civil covenant; in that the <hi>material cauſe</hi> of it, is worldly property, and is under the care of the civil ſtate.</q> p. 94. And after citing ſeveral paſſages concerning the Jewiſh worſhip he ſays, <q>Had not thoſe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, which required a certain ſum, viz. tithes and offerings for the Lord's miniſters, been of a civil or political nature, what right or authority would thoſe civil rulers, Moſes and Nehemiah, have had to intermeddle with them; to reprove and correct the people for breaking or neglecting them; and on the whole, to <hi>oblige</hi> them to render to prieſts and Levites their due.</q> p. 96.</p>
            <p>Anſwer
<list>
                  <item>1. As one if not both of them, were prophets, as well as rulers, and as all the people were required, <hi>in any wiſe to rebuke their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> Levit. 19.17. Is it not ſurpriſing to hear a profeſſed miniſter of the word, aſk what right Moſes and Nehemiah had to <hi>reprove</hi> people, unleſs it were in things civil and political!</item>
                  <item>2. The inſtance that eh brings of Moſes, is a reproof, not of the <hi>people,</hi> but of the <hi>prieſts,</hi> for neglecting their duty in the <hi>prieſts office.</hi> p. 96; and if that was political, how came Mr. <hi>F.</hi> to ſay of the Jews, <q>Their civil &amp; religious <hi>officers</hi> were <hi>different</hi> ſetts of men, performing different ſervices, and maintaining as <hi>diſtinct authority</hi> in their reſpective provinces, as now takes place, or SHOULD DO, in congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational churches and civil communities.</q> p. 56. I have before produced inſtances, both of kings and prophets, reproving and ſtirring up, prieſts and people, each to their reſpective duties concerning religious worſhip; but does that make, either its performance, or its ſupport to
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012655_0042_0F8BBF111B5B1510"/>be <hi>political</hi> matters?</item>
                  <item>3. The inſtance for illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration which our author brings is not to the purpoſe; for a man or a ſociety have right to contract with what workmen they pleaſe, to build a houſe to meet in for worſhip, and upon ſuch terms as they can agree upon, which contract has the ſame force with other civil engagements; and there is no more of the nature of religion in the ſtones and timber of the meeting-houſe, nor in the workmen's hewing and placing of them, than there is in other houſes. But will Mr. <hi>F.</hi> hold it to be ſo with his <hi>bodily exerciſe,</hi> when he "reads, writes, viſits, prays or preaches?" p. 94. If he, or any other miniſter, will honeſtly own, that their exerciſe and labour in thoſe things, has no more of the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>religion</hi> in it, than there is in a carpenter or maſon's building a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe; and if people will then contract with them for a <hi>certain ſum,</hi> to perform ſuch exerciſe, let them pay it: but then call them <hi>political mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> and not miniſters of Chriſt. If the <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> and <hi>material cauſe</hi> in the covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a miniſter and his people be, (as he aſſerts) <hi>worldly property,</hi> they deſerve no better name.</item>

            <p>Men have liberty to teach their ſons what trade they think beſt; and their ſons, when of age, have liberty to follow that or other buſineſs, as people will employ them, and they can find the beſt pay; but no man in the Jewiſh church might be a <hi>prieſt</hi> except he were <hi>called of God, as was Aaron.</hi> And the means of their ſupport, as has been already ſhewn, were <hi>offered</hi> and <hi>conſecrated</hi> to God.

And their father told them the difference, between this and common injuſtice, ſaying, "If one man ſin againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>judge ſhall judge him;</hi> but if a man <hi>ſin againſt the</hi> LORD, who ſhall intreat for him? ver. 25.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible for any words to diſtinguiſh more plainly than theſe do, the difference between civil judge's work, and theſe religious affairs? Unjuſt dealings of one man againſt another are ſins againſt God, and he has armed the magiſtrate with the ſword to redreſs ſuch wrongs; but the affairs of worſhip, both as to officers and people, lie directly between Him and them. And it is but <hi>lip ſervice,</hi> when their <hi>fear toward him is taught by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of men.</hi> Yea it is <hi>vain worſhip,</hi> and only a <hi>pretence,</hi> by which they would cover injuſtice and cruelty toward others. Iſa. 29.13. Mat. 15.5—9. and 23.14.</p>
            <p>When great ſtores had been brought in by the people, in Hezekiah's time, he, in conjuction with the chief ruler of the temple, gave orders to ſecure them and appointed men to overſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the ſame, according to the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. 2 Chron. 31.11, 13—21. And
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012655_0044_0F8BBF12D4C68310"/>who can ſay any thing againſt rulers doing the like now?</p>
            <p>But what is there in all this, to favor their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the people to ſupport miniſters, and uſing <hi>force</hi> to collect it? Indeed my opponent does not like this word, and the facts that I related agreable to it, he calls "horrible things." p. 111. And he chuſes the more ſoft and ambiguous word, <hi>oblige.</hi> p. 63, 96. Tho' if he had felt the effect of it as much as we have, I am perſuaded that <hi>force,</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> added to the end of it, would appear to him mild enough to ſet their conduct in its true light.</p>
            <p>I before declared, that the ſcripture is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly clear for a <hi>free</hi> ſupport of miniſters, but not a <hi>forced</hi> one; and obſerved, that there is as much difference between them, as there is between the power of <hi>truth</hi> in the mind, and the power of the <hi>ſword</hi> on the body. Ex. p. 27. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> is ſo far from concurring with that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that he ſays, I <hi>corrupted</hi> the ſenſe of Mat. 11.5, only becauſe I ſaid, We uſed to <hi>think</hi> the goſpel was preached <hi>freely to the poor.</hi> The word <hi>freely,</hi> he ſays, is not in the text. p. 64. I did not ſay, it was expreſſed there, but in the preceeding page I had quoted Chriſt's orders to his miniſters, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> Mat. 10.8, 14. Ex. p. 24, 25. which I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they obeyed: but Mr. <hi>F.</hi> would have it, that theſe orders had <hi>no reference</hi> to preaching, but only to working miracles. p. 61. and the word <hi>freely</hi> he ſays, <q>Is a <hi>capital</hi> word in the preſent diſpute; the controverſy in this place turns upon it.</q> p. 64, 65. So it does; and where he will turn to ſave his ſcheme I know not;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012655_0045_0F8BBF13675F77C0"/>for he had declared, that the falſe apoſtles <hi>gloried</hi> in preaching <hi>freely,</hi> to prove which he brought 2 Cor. 11.12. But I attempted to ſhew that their glorying was in things of another nature; that as Paul, when he firſt came to Corinth, wrought at tent-making, on weak days, and preached on the ſabbath, <hi>not with enticing words of man's wiſdom:</hi> they <hi>commended themſelves,</hi> and ſaid of him, <hi>His bodily preſence is weak, and his ſpeech contemptible.</hi> Ex. p. 25. This interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Mr. <hi>F.</hi> diſlikes; and in order to prove that the <hi>falſe</hi> apoſtles gloried in preaching <hi>freely,</hi> he has fully proved that the <hi>true</hi> apoſtle did ſo; and if he could have brought the text to ſay, <hi>Wherein</hi> WE <hi>glory,</hi> inſtead of, <hi>wherein</hi> THEY <hi>glory,</hi> it would have anſwered his end; but that was beyond his power. p. 66, 69. Therefore I think the argument ſtands thus: Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, Chriſt's order to his apoſtles, <hi>Freely give,</hi> had <hi>no reference to preaching,</hi> and that I corrupted a text, by ſaying, We <hi>thought</hi> they preached ſo; yet Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has clearly proved that a <hi>true</hi> apoſtle did <hi>glory</hi> in <hi>preaching freely,</hi> but has failed of proving any ſuch thing of the <hi>falſe</hi> ones!</p>
            <p>The reaſon he gives for confining the word <hi>freely</hi> to working miracles, in Chriſt's order to his firſt miniſters, is becauſe he ſays, <hi>The workman is worthy of his meat;</hi> and, the <hi>labourer is worthy of his hire;</hi> which words, <hi>workmen</hi> and <hi>labourer,</hi> are in other places uſed concerning common mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial labours, where no miracles are in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Be it ſo, yet 'tis nothing to his purpoſe, for the verſe he quotes which ſays, The labourer is worthy of hire, alſo deſcribes how they ſhould come at it, namely, by receiving <hi>ſuch things as
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012655_0046_0F8BBF194CE5C200"/>they give.</hi> Luke 10.7. And the texts that he adds with our fathers comments thereon, all ſpeak the ſame language. 1 Cor. 9.9—14. which ſays, <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained;</hi> refers to ancient miniſters being maintained out of the <hi>offerings</hi> of the people. And Gal. 6.6, ſays, <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good-things.</hi> Not let the collector <hi>take it,</hi> if he will <hi>not give it.</hi> Next they cite a paſſage which ſays, <hi>As God hath proſpered him.</hi> What is to be done as God hath proſpered him? anſwer, a <hi>collection</hi> of <hi>liberality for the ſaints at Jeruſalem.</hi> 1 Cor. 16, 1—3. Theſe are our miniſters proofs for not being maintained by <hi>free gift;</hi> to which they add Neh. 13.11. to prove that <q>when the church power cannot attain the end, the magiſtrate is to ſee that the miniſtry be duly provided for.</q> p. 63. The text ſhews that Nehemiah uſed reproofs and expoſtulations in the affair; and the effect was this: <hi>Then bro't all Judah the tithe. All</hi> Judah were their own collectors; and it proves clearly, that Nehemiah uſed his influence by reproof, inſtruction and good example, to move both miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, faithfully to diſcharge their reſpective duties in religion: and Oh that all rulers, and ſubjects too, would do the like!</p>
            <p>But, ſay our miniſters, it is a <hi>due debt,</hi> therefore if the people will not pay it, the magiſtrate is to interpoſe and <hi>oblige</hi> them to do it. p. 63. Anſwer, both miniſters and people <hi>owe</hi> their all to God, and when they have done all that he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, they ought to realize and acknowledge, that they are <hi>unprofitable ſervants.</hi> He has plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed in his word, both what miniſters, and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012655_0047_0F8BBF1BD301A960"/>what people are to do, relating to his worſhip; and ſays to each, <hi>I know thy works.</hi> And <hi>with him we have to do.</hi> Heb. 4.13. And when he ſays, <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to him that teacheth in all good things;</hi> to enforce it he ſays, <hi>Be not deceived,</hi> GOD IS NOT MOCKED; <hi>for whatſoever a man ſoweth that ſhall he reap.</hi> Gal. 6.6—7.</p>
            <p>It is in vain to mince the matter. I am as ſenſible as Mr. <hi>F.</hi> is, that the body is much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in miniſterial labours, and that God has commanded his people to communicate to them of their <hi>carnal things;</hi> yet the obedience of both, is what they <hi>owe to God,</hi> who can either proſper or blaſt them as he pleaſes; yea, can <hi>this night require the ſoul of him who layeth up treaſure for</hi> HIMSELF, <hi>and is not</hi> RICH TOWARDS GOD. Luke 12.20—21. And if <hi>money</hi> or <hi>worldly property,</hi> be the <hi>conſideration</hi> in the covenant between any miniſter and his people, what are they doing but <hi>ſowing to the fleſh?</hi> therefore <hi>be not deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſum of the matter is evidently this. All orders of men ought to do what they can in their ſeveral ſtations to promote religion, by ſpeaking and practiſing the <hi>truth in love,</hi> but have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to uſe any force therein: the exact limits between eccleſiaſtical and civil government being this, That the <hi>church</hi> is armed with <hi>light</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> to pull down ſatan's ſtrong holds, and gain ſouls to Chriſt, and into his church, to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his rules therein; and again to exclude ſuch from their communion, who will not be ſo governed: while the <hi>ſtate</hi> is armed with the <hi>ſword</hi> to guard the peace, and civil rights of all
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012655_0048_0F8BBF1CAC242FA8"/>perſons and ſocieties, and to <hi>revenge</hi> and <hi>execute wrath</hi> on thoſe who violate the ſame.</p>
            <p>And if none but <hi>Sons of Beliel</hi> ever preſumed, even under the <hi>legal</hi> diſpenſation, ſo far to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere between God and his people, about ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſters, as to ſay, if you will not <hi>give</hi> it I will <hi>take it by force;</hi> how great muſt their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be, who can preſume to do ſo, under the diſpenſation which is <hi>purely evangelical!</hi> And I earneſtly beſeech my dear countrymen, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how <hi>inexcuſable</hi> we ſhall appear in <hi>judging,</hi> if we continue to do, not the <hi>ſame</hi> but <hi>worſe</hi> things, than we <hi>condemn</hi> in others!</p>
            <p>How much have our rulers, miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, complained of <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> becauſe of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that have been made, againſt the right of <hi>giving</hi> our money, either by ourſelves or our repreſentatives, to ſupport government! but if the right thus to <hi>give</hi> it, is eſſential to <hi>liberty</hi> in <hi>civil</hi> government, where <hi>force</hi> belongs (as I believe it is) what oppreſſion muſt it be, to deprive any of the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>giving</hi> their money <hi>freely</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>religion,</hi> where <hi>force</hi> has no place at all! And as we have proved it to be contrary to our Lord's commandment, to call any man on earth <hi>maſter</hi> or <hi>father,</hi> it being impoſſible for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute another to anſwer for us at his bar; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we connot convey a right to a repreſentative to <hi>compel</hi> any perſon, either to attend, or to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a worſhip contrary to his conſcience. And our fathers example in theſe things, will condemn, rather than excuſe us, in ſo doing; for while they thought <hi>force</hi> was warrantable in ſuch affairs, they were zealous in the <hi>compelling</hi> perſons to <hi>conform,</hi> to what they eſteemed the right way of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012655_0049_0F8BBF1D055520A8"/>worſhip, as well as to <hi>ſupport</hi> it: and if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was perſecution, what cloak can be left for the latter! Some tell us, that money is not conſcience: that we know as well as they, but they &amp; all will know, ſooner or later, that we all are but <hi>ſtewards</hi> of what we profeſs, and muſt give account thereof to the great Lord of all; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it muſt be a matter of conſcience to thoſe who view things as they are, not voluntarily to ſupport a worſhip, which they believe is not right. And as a <hi>widow</hi> who ſuffered in this cauſe, which I before mentioned, Ex. p. 21, is now gone beyond the frowns and flatteries of men, I will give the reader her teſtimony, of what ſhe experienced in her ſufferings, as ſhe wrote the ſame with her own hand on Nov. 4. 1752, in theſe words. <q>October 15, the collectors came to our houſe, and took me away to priſon, about 9 o'clock in a dark rainy night. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers H. and S. were brought there the next night. We lay in priſon 13 days, and then were ſet at liberty, by what means I know not. Whilſt I was there a great many people came to ſee me, and ſome ſaid one thing, and ſome another: O! the innumerable ſnares and temptations that beſet me, more than I ever tho't on before! But O, the condeſcention of heaven! tho' I was bound when I was caſt into this furnace, yet was I looſed, and found Jeſus in the midſt of the furnace with me. O! then I could give up my name, eſtate, family, life and breath, freely to God. Now the priſon look'd like a palace to me. I could bleſs God for all the laughs and ſcoffs made at me. O! the love that flowed out to all mankind! then I
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012655_0050_0F8BBF1DCB99B230"/>could forgive, as I would deſire to be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and love my neighbour as myſelf. Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con G. was put in priſon the 8th of October, and yeſterday old brother G. and they are in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of others; all which calls for <hi>humiliation.</hi> This church has appointed the 13th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember to be ſpent in <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>faſting</hi> on that account. I remember my love to you and your wife, and the dear children of God with you, begging your <hi>prayers</hi> for us in ſuch a day of trial.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here note, Mr. <hi>F.</hi> in his ſermons ſays, <q>The true church of Chriſt, in whom his ſpirit dwells, has never been a bitter, fierce, revengeful, <hi>perſecuting</hi> church; but the reverſe.</q> And tries to fix theſe odious characters upon the ſeparates, becauſe they ſometimes called ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as he is pleading for, <hi>hirelings,</hi> and <hi>blind leaders;</hi> which he ſays, was done with an air of <hi>glorying</hi> rather than <hi>mourning.</hi> p. 47, 155. The reader will now judge what regard is to be paid to his witneſs in <hi>his own cauſe:</hi> and alſo who behaved moſt like the true church under trouble. Eſther 4. 1—3.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Their prayers were heard, ſo that ſuch oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſoon ceaſed in that place, and have not been practiſed there in that manner ſince; tho' they are continued in other parts of the land. But if any will yet continue to <hi>devour widows houſes,</hi> to uphold a <hi>pretence</hi> of religion, I truſt this widow's teſtimony will be a witneſs againſt them another day. We come,</p>
            <p n="5">V. To conſider what are, and what are not, <hi>juſt reaſons for ſeparation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> accuſes the body of the ſeparates with being <hi>truce-breakers;</hi> but his proof of their being ſuch, all turns upon this point, viz. <q>Whereas they promiſed, to walk with us in holy fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012655_0051_0F8BBF1E87094118"/>in all goſpel ordinances, they openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced communion with us, when <hi>we</hi> the ſtanding churches, were daily attending theſe ordinances of Chriſt, agreable to his inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> Ser. p. 173. And now, as I had ſet down in my title page, Dr. <hi>Owen's</hi> ſaying, That he who will not ſeparate from the <hi>world</hi> and <hi>falſe worſhip,</hi> is a ſeparate from Chriſt; Mr. <hi>F.</hi> allows the ſentence to be undoubted truth, and ſays, it <q>Makes directly againſt the people for whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is going to plead.</q> p. 17. Let this matter therefore be carefully examined.</p>
            <p>And.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I think we have already produced ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof, that according to Chriſt's inſtitution, none ought to be received into the church without goſpel evidence of their ſaving union to the great Head of it. The Jewiſh church was diſtinguiſhed from the nations of the <hi>world</hi> by their being <hi>choſen</hi> of God as a <hi>nation,</hi> and by the ordinances that he gave to keep them diſtinct from all other nations; But our Lord has bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down that wall of <hi>partition;</hi> and through the new-teſtament he diſtinguiſhes his church from the world, by <hi>chooſing them out of the world,</hi> and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to <hi>know God</hi> which is <hi>eternal life,</hi> whom the <hi>world hath not known.</hi> John 15.19. and 17.3, 25.1 John 5.19, 20. In the Jewiſh cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they were choſen in their <hi>family</hi> and <hi>national</hi> capacity; but the goſpel covenant is <hi>not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to that, and the difference deſcribed is, <hi>All ſhall know God, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> Yet the firſt thing that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> advanced to prove, that his brethren had not the ſpirit of Chriſt, but the reverſe, in ſeparating from his church, is he ſays,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012655_0052_0F8BBF1F606AB8A8"/>
               <q>They endeavoured to draw off from us every <hi>true believer,</hi> and would have left a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion behind them, of nothing but ſuch as they judged to be hypocrites and graceleſs perſons. —Surely this is not according to Chriſt's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Let both grow together until the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</hi>
               </q> Ser. p. 154.</p>
            <p>Now obſerve, the <hi>field</hi> wherein Chriſt ſaid, Let both grow together, he ſays is <hi>The world;</hi> and this direction was given when both wheat and tares <hi>appeared</hi> by their <hi>fruit:</hi> how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then muſt it be, for thoſe miniſters and churches to be duly ſeparated from the <hi>world,</hi> who apply to the <hi>church</hi> what Chriſt ſaid of the <hi>world?</hi> And let it be particularly noted, that the crime charged by Mr. <hi>F.</hi> upon his brethren, is their endeavouring to ſeparate <hi>true believers</hi> from ſuch as <hi>they judged</hi> to be graceleſs perſons; and acting according to <hi>their judgment</hi> in thus ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the church from the world, he declares to be contrary to Chriſt's direction. And ſo did all the miniſters of Windham county; for they not only brought the parable of the tares, and many others for the ſame end that our author does, but alſo, after declaring it to be the deſign of Chriſt to <q>make his ſaints, and the <hi>ordinances</hi> of his viſible Kingdom to be the means of the <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of others,</q> repreſent that miniſters and chriſtians cannot let their <hi>light ſhine</hi> as they ought before men, when they will have <q>No <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with them in the ſame worſhip, and the <hi>ſame ordinances.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Aſſociation letter. p. 16. 17.</note> And for prayer and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012655_0053_0F8BBF20059DBA98"/>the word, we ever held them to be the means for converſion as much as our opponents, and as freely admit all men to the uſe of them as they do; but to commune with the world in baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper in order to convert them, this they held and we denied; and this was a principal reaſon of our ſeparation from them. Yet they ſay, <q>That the church ought to keep and caſt out all thoſe who by their <hi>fruits</hi> are known to be tares no body denies.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 10.</note>
               </q> What can all this mean? why in the ſame place they ſhew, that by thoſe who are known to be tares, they mean "ſcandalous perſons;" but they go on to ſay,<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 23.</note> 
               <q>It is the will of Chriſt, that all thoſe who make an outward credible profeſſion of chriſtianity, ſhould be admitted into his church, and <hi>tho' unconverted</hi> be there <hi>among the wheat,</hi> that they may be under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>ordinances</hi> for their <hi>converſion.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> while he was pleading for all who were not openly ſcandalous, to come to the Lord's-ſupper as a <hi>converting ordinance,</hi> tells us that in the ſynod of 1679, they had a diſpute, whether perſons ſhould give <q>A relation of the WORK OF GOD's SPIRIT upon their <hi>hearts,</hi> in order to coming into full communion.—The reſult was, that they blotted out the clauſe, of making a relation of the work of God's ſpirit, and put in the room of it, The making a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith and repentance;</hi> and ſo I voted with them, and am of the ſame judgment ſtill.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Stoddard's appeal to the learned. p. 94.</note>
               </q> This general profeſſion, to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012655_0054_0F8BBF24F882BC60"/>of a relation of the <hi>work of God's Spirit on the heart,</hi> was the real ſtate of our difference with them; but as I noted before, Ex. p. 50, this true ſtate of the controverſy was induſtriouſly ſhifted, from the <hi>way</hi> of knowing to the <hi>degree</hi> of knowledge. As for inſtance; Mr. <hi>Eliſha Paine</hi> proved from many ſcriptures, that, <q>The church is to caſt her tares out when they <hi>appear,</hi> or the whole church is leavened.<note n="*" place="bottom">Windham aſſociation letter. p. 10.</note>
               </q> The miniſters of that county would have it that no body denied this, and yet go on to accuſe Mr. <hi>Paine</hi> with <hi>abuſing</hi> and <hi>perverting</hi> the ſcriptures, becauſe he held that our Lord's prohibition, <hi>not to root up the tares,</hi> reſpected the <hi>world</hi> and not the <hi>church.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 11.</note> Thus like the Jewiſh teachers, they <hi>turn things upſide down.</hi> Iſa. 29.16. And now Mr. <hi>F.</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it that my argument is, <q>That the ſaints ſhould ſeparate from the ſinners, while they are ſuch, and deprive them of the benefit of their prayers, holy example and other means of their converſion.—From a religious <hi>aſſembly,</hi> and ſet them elſwhereto worſhip.</q> p. 114.115. when I ſaid not a word of that nature, and had no more thoughts of ſuch a-ſeparation, than I had of coming into the practice of his party, of ſending men to jail if they would not conform to the pariſh miniſter.</p>
            <p>However all his attempts to <hi>darken counſel</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide the real ſtate of our controverſy, for he ſays, <q>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> reads 2 Cor. 6.14.—17. wrong. Be ye ſeparate from UNBELIEVERS, ſays Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Paul ſays, <hi>come out from among</hi> THEM, and be ſeparate. From whom? Anſwer, from
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012655_0055_0F8BBF274AAD17E0"/>viſible <hi>heatheniſh idolatry.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> is ſo far from theſe ſentiments, that in order to juſtify his applying Iſa. 50.4. to human learning, he now calls that learning, <q>This gift of the ſpirit;</q> and ſays, <q>Human learning is AS MUCH the gift of God as grace.</q> p. 87, which diſcovers what violence ſome men will offer to language and common ſenſe, rather than yield to conviction.

            <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> tries hard to perſuade his readers, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> was for him, and againſt us, but you may now judge whether the caſe is not truly the reverſe, ſince the Doctor has ſo fully proved from the word of truth, that the apoſtles and elders acted <hi>with the brethren</hi> in all theſe affairs, and not in a <hi>diſtinct juriſdiction</hi> from them. But mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Maſſachuſetts made a formal attempt to introduce ſuch a juriſdiction about 70 years ago; and tho' it did not ſucceed as they wiſhed there, yet in Connecticut a political governor, who had been a miniſter, introduced the ſcheme; and a learned miniſter who was trained up among them ſays, <q>This platform by implication veſts a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter with a negative on the church in all her
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012655_0060_0F8BBF2ADE03D298"/>acts. And in council it has thrown a very great light in their ballance of power into the hands of the miniſters, even to more than a negative on the meſſengers.—Taken literally, it in the firſt place ſtipulates the abſolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubordinate power of particular churches. It afterwards veſts the <hi>conſociated council</hi> with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative final deciſion on all matters of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ſubmitted to it by the churches of the circuit.

            <p>It was for oppoſing and withdrawing from this juriſdiction, that the repreſentatives of Norwich, were cenſured by the miniſter and his party, and by that means were excluded from their place in the general aſſembly. Ex. p. 29. And this was the juriſdiction that exerted all its power to rob Branford of a good miniſter, becauſe he ventured to preach among the <hi>baptiſts</hi> againſt theſe miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wills. Ex. p. 30, 31. And the ſame that gave "ſpecial direction" to the <hi>pariſh</hi> in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury to call and retain one of their candidates, againſt the minds of the <hi>church,</hi> which occaſioned our firſt ſeparation. Ex. p. 42. Hence</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>conſtitution</hi> which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> pleads for, has given the <hi>world</hi> a power over the <hi>church,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inconſiſtent with goſpel <hi>liberty;</hi> and tho' he has exerted all his art to blind this caſe (as I ſhall ſhew in my addreſs to him) yet by his own account it appears, that miniſters ordained their candidate at Canterbury, contrary to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greater part of the church; and that when they knew that if they did it, it would not be
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012655_0061_0F8BBF2B6C1395A8"/>in their power to prevent the pariſh from <hi>forcing</hi> the church to ſupport him; and tho' they got the ſociety then to vote their <hi>willingneſs</hi> that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral court ſhould ſet them off; yet it appears that when the caſe came there, <q>The ſociety's attorney objected and ſaid, That it would ſpoil the ſociety, for if theſe people were releaſed, the charges would be ſo heavy upon the reſt, that they would forſake the miniſters.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Paine's view of the churches. Apology p. 7.</note>
               </q> Which objection the court heard to, and left the church in the hands of the pariſh, who impriſoned their perſons, or ſpoiled their goods, to maintain that miniſter, for more then fifteen years; and then they would not releaſe them only on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they ſhould pay their part <q>of the tax, or taxes already granted, to the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed miniſter in ſaid ſociety;</q> and all that voted for his ſettlement they refuſed to releaſe at all as long as he continued their miniſter. He was ordained in 1744, and this pariſh vote (as appears from under their clerk's hand) was on April 21, 1760. Yet Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays of this pariſh, <q>As to their religious conduct in the whole affair, there is nothing appears in <hi>them</hi> to denominate them the <hi>world,</hi> any more than in their brethren that are called the <hi>church.</hi>
               </q> p. 79.</p>
            <p>But if to pretend a willingneſs to releaſe the church till they had got their miniſter ordained, and then to treat them as they did, be not like the <hi>wicked world,</hi> I deſire to know what can be! Yea, and as thoſe miniſters then joined with the world in ordaining that miniſter againſt the choice of the church, ſo Mr. <hi>F.</hi> now plainly juſtifies the world
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012655_0062_0F8BBF3048E0FAD0"/>in proſecuting the churches paſtor for marrying; and ſays, <q>Setting up in oppoſition to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing churches, their paſtor was not an officer known, either in church or ſtate.</q> p. 80.</p>
            <p>Now kind reader ſee where we are. This was a regular church till the clergy and the world obliged them, either to take a miniſter contrary to their judgments, or to leave the meeting-houſe; and becauſe they never petitioned the <hi>civil</hi> powers to form them into a "religious ſociety," but only to be exempted from oppreſſion from others, Mr. <hi>F.</hi> calls them <hi>ſeparates, irregular,</hi> &amp;c. p. 76. 79. Therefore if theſe miniſters did not <hi>cauſe diviſion and offences, contrary to the goſpel.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know whoever did! and we are commanded to <hi>mark and avoid</hi> ſuch. Rom. 16.17.</p>
            <p>I before quoted Dr. <hi>Owen's</hi> obſervation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing national churches, that tho' they talk of <hi>liberty of conſcience,</hi> yet when it comes to the iſſue, all choice is prevented, and in the church where a man was <hi>baptized in infancy,</hi> and in the <hi>pariſh</hi> where his habitation falls, in that <hi>pariſh-church</hi> he muſt worſhip, or be dealt with as a <hi>ſchiſmatick.</hi> Then I produced this caſe at Canterbury, and proved, that two members of that church were dealt with and expelled Yale-college as ſchiſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks, only for meeting for worſhip with the church they belonged to, in a place ſeparate from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh meeting-houſe; and thoſe who expelled them declared to the world that, <q>Neither the major part of the members in full communion, nor <hi>any other perſons,</hi> in any pariſh, have <hi>any right</hi> to appoint any houſe or place for worſhip on the ſabbath, <hi>ſeparate</hi> from, and in oppoſition to the meeting-houſe, the public place appointed
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012655_0063_0F8BBF329AA63848"/>by the general aſſembly and the pariſh.</q> This I obſerved, makes the general aſſembly lawgivers for the church, and the pariſh executors of it. Ex. p. 83.84.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays <q>That relates ONLY to the <hi>placing</hi> of meeting-houſes,—and ſo is a matter of a <hi>civil</hi> nature; but don't ſo much as <hi>touch</hi> the principles, the order, diſcipline and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the churches;</q> and he aſſerts that my laſt ſentence is "evidently void of TRUTH." p. 103, 104. What! does the <hi>pariſh's</hi> forcing the <hi>church</hi> to hear a man they were not edified by, or elſe to leave the meeting-houſe, and then miniſters and colleges, treating them as ſchiſmaticks for ſo doing, not <hi>touch</hi> the <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>government</hi> of the churches! What amazing blindneſs is here diſcovered!</p>
            <p>By Mr. <hi>F's</hi> own account, a certain quantity of worldly eſtate gives every inhabitant power, by their conſtitution, to vote for miniſters, and all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that the members in full communion have above the reſt is that they may vote with the world if they have no eſtate; and he ſays <q>All vote in our pariſhes, as men <hi>qualified by law;</hi> and as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> brings in the <hi>clergy</hi> with the <hi>world,</hi> with a deſign to do them a miſchief, he makes a terrible overthrow; ſlaying clergy and laity, ſtanding churches and ſeparates, all with one ſtroke: but no matter for that—if the miniſters &amp;their churches may but fall, he ſeems willing that he and his brethren, <hi>Sampſon-like</hi> ſhould die with the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
               </q> p. 83, 84. This is a ſort of <hi>rhetoric</hi> that ſome bring in to ſupply the want of argument. I well know that in civil affairs, chriſtians vote with others by virtue of their
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012655_0064_0F8BBF32C6EF5460"/>civil and <hi>worldly</hi> qualifications; but as the goſpel miniſtry is a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> office, men ought to have <hi>ſpiritual</hi> qualifications in order to vote for them; and this <hi>confounding</hi> of church and world together in ſuch affairs, is a <hi>Babel</hi> which muſt and will come down. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſays, <q>Where the <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> of religious worſhip are corrupted or overthrown, it is abſolutely <hi>unlawful</hi> to join unto, or <hi>abide in</hi> any church.</q> And the firſt of theſe <hi>fundamentals</hi> that he names is, <q>That all miniſters or officers of it, be duly choſen by the <hi>church itſelf.</hi>

               </q> And Dr. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Mather</hi> ſays, <q>It would be <hi>Simonical</hi> to affirm that this ſacred privilege (of voting for a paſtor) may be purchaſed with <hi>money,</hi> or that contributions can entitle to it.<note n="†" place="bottom">Vindication of the order of the churches. p. 67.</note>
               </q> And he names a number of principles, which if we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe, he ſays we then give away the <hi>whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational cauſe;</hi> on of which is,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Preface. p. 8.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Here note, under the Maſſachuſetts firſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, none were allowed to vote for officers, either in church or ſtate, but members in full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but a turn of times in that reſpect happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little before theſe words were written; and the apoſtacy had now prevailed ſo far, that we were obliged to ſeparate from the <hi>world,</hi> who had uſurped ſuch a power over the <hi>church,</hi> or elſe give away the <hi>whole congregational cauſe.</hi> And as the heads of the college declared, That the pariſh in
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012655_0065_0F8BBF33D798B1F8"/>Canterbury had <q>the ſpecial direction of the aſſociation,</q> in keeping that miniſter. Ex. p. 42. therefore it was not I that <hi>yoked</hi> the <hi>clergy</hi> with the <hi>world,</hi> as Mr. <hi>F.</hi> terms it; for I only remarked what they had done themſelves. And now he aſſerts, that the divine command, <hi>Be not unequally yoked,</hi> but <hi>be ye ſeparate,</hi> means from <hi>heathens,</hi> and not from <hi>unbelievers</hi> in general, p. 115. We therefore could not be free from that <hi>yoke</hi> which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear, without ſeparating from them. We have often heard them talk of ſeparating <hi>godlineſs</hi> or religion by theſe means, but the evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is <hi>gain;</hi> and the command is <hi>From ſuch withdraw thyfelf.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.5. The above were the main cauſes of our ſeparation, tho' other points that are connected therewith had their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</p>
            <p>Unwarranted ways of worſhip, is one reaſon that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> gives for ſeparation. This Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, <q>I never heard objected even by our ſeparating brethren (as I remember) nor is their any ſhadow of reaſon for the charge.</q> p. 104. Yet he did inform us that his brethren urged the <q>Half-way covenant as a ſufficient reaſon for their ſeparating.</q> But tells us that they <hi>improperly</hi> called it <hi>half way,</hi> and ſays, <q>it is <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> binding them to <hi>obſerve all things whatſoever the Lord our God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
               </q> While his next words ſhew, that he leads perſons thus to covenant to <hi>obſerve all,</hi> when he knows they do not mean <hi>all;</hi> that they do not mean to come to the Lord's table, for want of ſufficient improvement in <q>experimental godlineſs.</q> Ser. p. 92. And what can this
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012655_0066_0F8BBF344CF2E548"/>be but <hi>falſe worſhip?</hi> yea lying to God! Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of worſhip he tells us that his brethren did object againſt, and he owns he did practice, which is, <q>writing down <hi>all</hi> that he judged expedient to deliver at that time, and then <hi>praying</hi> for aſſiſtance.</q> Ser. p. 149. Theſe ways of worſhip he has told the world that his brethren did object againſt, and yet now he can't remember any ſuch thing, which ſhews how hard it is to remember or retain in mind, any thing that condemns ſelf.</p>
            <p>Neglect of <hi>evangelical</hi> diſcipline in the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and turning it into a <hi>worldly dominion,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon for ſeparation. Ex. p. 87. But Mr. <hi>F.</hi> aſſerts that it is not applicable to his church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. p. 101—104. Whether the foregoing facts do not prove the caſe to be otherwiſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his witneſs in his own cauſe, the reader muſt judge.</p>
            <p>The next article is Dr. <hi>Franck's</hi> ſaying that, <q>Carnal preachers under the influence of pride and ambition, interpret whatever is done to their perſons, as an aſſault againſt their <hi>holy function,</hi> pouring forth their malice and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon all thoſe, who, they ſuppoſe have affronted them,</q> &amp;c. Ex. p. 84. And I produced the words of ſixteen of our author's brethren in the miniſtry, in what he now calls an <hi>excellent letter,</hi> wherein they accuſe thoſe who ſeparated <hi>from them,</hi> with holding a principle which implied, <q>That there is NO <hi>inſtituted mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> or order of men, peculiarly appointed to that work in the chriſtian church.</q> While the ſame men exerted all their power, to prevent our churches having <hi>ordained miniſters.</hi> Ex. p. 47.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012655_0067_0F8BBF350A9146C8"/>89. <note n="*" place="bottom">In the ſame <hi>letter</hi> p. 42, 43. they compare the going to worſhip, with ſuch as they call <hi>lay-teachers,</hi> to following thoſe who worſhip <hi>other gods,</hi> Deut. 13, and ſay <q>The arguments againſt your compliance is the ſame—and if there ſeem to be never ſo many appearances of God's power attending it, you may not go after it, any more than for the like reaſon, you may not go after a <hi>falſe god.</hi>
                  </q> If this be not a forbidding thoſe who <hi>follow not them,</hi> what can be ſo called! Mark 9.38.</note> I alſo referred him to ſeven other miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his own county, who in a printed <hi>alarm</hi> to the world, compare our withdrawing <hi>from them,</hi> to <hi>Core's</hi> gainſaying <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were called immediately from heaven. Ex. p. 23. And now Mr. <hi>F.</hi> declares that the <hi>paſtor</hi> of the church in Canterbury, <q>was not an officer known, either in church or ſtate,</q> only becauſe he was not ſet up <q>according to the <hi>conſtitution,</hi> of the country.</q> p. 80. Though by the way, the honorable juſtices of the ſuperior court in the Maſſachuſetts province, have often, in caſes bro't before them, determined that ours are as truly <hi>ordained miniſters</hi> as theirs are.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all the evidence that I produced, Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, <q>Our real character is <hi>as different</hi> from that which he has ſet up, as the true proteſtant churches are from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian; or as the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was from the <hi>Pope</hi> of Rome.</q> p. 102. But the reader will judge, whether accuſing us with holding to, NO <hi>inſtituted miniſtry,</hi> and with being guilty of the <hi>gainſaying of Core,</hi> only becauſe we <hi>followed not them,</hi> be as far from interpreting what is done to their <hi>perſons,</hi> as an aſſault againſt their <hi>holy function,</hi> as Peter was from the Pope or not; or whether our ſeparation, as above deſcribed, was
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012655_0068_0F8BBF3630FB5A38"/>not truly from the <hi>world</hi> &amp; <hi>falſe worſhip;</hi> for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuch a ſeparation do I pretend to juſtify.</p>
            <p>A few remarks ſhall cloſe this head. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not doubted but that many have come out from thoſe called ſtanding churches in our land, who did not act upon theſe principles, but have been influenced by ourward appearances, or unreaſonable impreſſions, rather than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding regard to divine truth? and which has cauſed a great deal of trouble and ſearching trials among us, and given occaſion to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Yet all the errors in the world cannot overthrow the truth, nor excuſe us if we do not obey it; and it is ſo far from being <hi>truce-breaking,</hi> to withdraw from miniſters and churches, when we ſee that they groſsly ſwerve from the truth, and will not be reclaimed, that we can not keep covenant, either with God or them, but by ſuch a withdraw.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This our opponents allow, but deny our having any ſuch cauſe to withdraw from them. And to try to ſupport their argument, they col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all the good things, or good pretences that they can find on their ſide; and then all the errors and evils that they can ſee or hear of among ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. But what work would it make, if we ſhould requite them in the ſame way, and draw their character to the world from the falſe-teaching. lying, whoredoms, drunkenneſs and other abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that in fact have happened among their miniſters and churches! yet there would be as much juſtice in ſo doing, as in a very great part of what they have done to us in theſe affairs. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> told the world, that his deſign was to draw the ſeparates <hi>pictures to the life,</hi> that they
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012655_0069_0F8BBF36BA494F78"/>might be aſhamed. Ser. p. 130. In doing of which he collected the worſt things that he could find among any that bore the name; yea, I am told by a gentleman of note in Stonington, that one inſtance of ill treatment to him which he has publiſhed, was from a woman that never was of either the ſeparate church or ſociety, only as ſhe happened to live then at one of their houſes. At the ſame time he ſays, <q>I know not of <hi>one</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or practice among them, that is agreable to the goſpel, but what they <hi>learned in our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>" Ser. p. 113. Whatever good things they have among them, they have them not <hi>as ſeparates,</hi>—the things that I have told you of above, are their <hi>characteriſticks.</hi>
               </q> Ser. p. 160.</p>
            <p>Since he talks ſo much about learning, I think to make a little trial of what ſome of their rules of logic will do in this affair; as thus,</p>
            <p>Every cauſe will produce its own effects. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> gives a dreadful account of how roughly the ſeparates treated him, ſoon after they came out of the ſtanding churches. But when they had been out above 20 years, he ſays <q>They are now, much more moderate and civil, than they were in that day; are very peacable, kind, obliging good neighbours.</q> Ser. p. 157, 158.</p>
            <p>Ergo, they have received better teaching ſince they came out than they had before. Again,</p>
            <p>Take away the cauſe, and the effect will ceaſe, Mr. <hi>F.</hi> tells the world, that the ſpecial occaſion of publiſhing his ſermons, was <q>The revival of the ſpirit of ſeparation and annabaptiſm.</q> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. p. 3.</p>
            <p>Ergo, the ſpirit of our ſeparation when revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was a ſpirit of civility, peace and good nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012655_0070_0F8BBF3B31B61AD0"/>and all his repreſentations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary are unjuſt and abuſive, for which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned out of his own mouth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The only way to bring this controverſy to a fair iſſue, is to examine the true nature and effects of our profeſſed principles, or ſhew wherein we do not act agreable to them. This I have aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in all theſe labours, and deſire others to do the ſame with me. If any man can ſhew us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we hold any wrong principle, or in a friendly manner correct any diſagreable practice, he will do us a real kindneſs; but to charge us with any thing that we are conſcious we do not hold, can never convince us that we are wrong, or they right.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It has ever been ſatan's method, when he could no longer keep people eaſy with the dead carcaſe of religion, than to promote in ſome, great pretences of ſpirituality which are not true; which formaliſts have never failed to improve as an argument againſt reformation. How much have papiſts uſed this argument againſt proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and epiſcopalians againſt puritans and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters? And is not the ſame now uſed againſt us? That there has been much enthuſiaſm, and many falſe pretences to ſpirituality in our day, is a melancholy fact; but it is quite as injurious to lay the blame thereof to the main principles, or chief leaders of our ſeparation, as it would be to the chief inſtruments of the revival of religion in 1741; for there were as bad or worſe things of that nature, that happened before our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than have ſince. Therefore it appeared needful thus to trace matters up to their original, and to ſet principles and facts in as clear light
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012655_0071_0F8BBF3D93D7F0D8"/>as might be, not only to vindicate our ſentiments and characters, againſt our learned opponents, but alſo to detect the falſe pretences of ſome, who are ready to ſeparate from their brethren upon every turn of affairs, yet pretending to ſtand and act in the ſame cauſe we firſt came out upon. And this is no new thing; for even in the apoſtles days, after they had earneſtly appeared for truth and goſpel liberty, and for deliverance from Jewiſh and heathen bondage, ſome took occaſion under the name of <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>diſpiſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> who notwithſtanding their great <hi>ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words,</hi> were really <hi>ſervants of corruption.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10—19. And it will ever be found, that licentiouſneſs is as real an enemy to liberty, as tyranny; nor is their any great difference between them.</p>
            <p>Government is for every one to act toward others, in their ſeveral ſtations and relations, by known laws and eſtabliſhed rules; tyranny and licentiouſneſs are the following our own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without due regard to ſuch rules. But as ſuch a way of acting muſt look odious to all rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal minds, when it appears in its own colours; therefore men have always tried to cover it with ſome ſpecious pretence or another, which yet may be detected by ſuch marks as theſe. 1. Where ſelf prevails, it will try to excite in others ſo high an opinion of our deep inſight into things that they do not underſtand, as to yield implicitly to us; while a humble teacher abhors ſuch a dominion over others faith, and labours to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the truth to every man's conſcience, and exhorts all ſaints to walk in Chriſt <hi>as they have been taught.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.24. and 4.2. Col. 2.7.—
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:012655_0072_0F8BBF3EA664DF68"/>18.2. Whatever garb pride is covered with, if it is croſſed it will diſcover bitterneſs, and often moves its ſubjects to become falſe accuſers, and fierce deſpiſers of thoſe who are good. Micah 3.5. 2 Tim. 3.3, 5. While the humble ſoul is patient, and in meekneſs labours to inſtruct thoſe who oppoſe themſelves. 2 Tim. 2.24, 25. Jam. 3.1, 13—18. It appears by Jotham's parable, that worthy minds, like the olive, fig-tree and vine, prefer uſefulneſs and the yielding of ſweet fruit to others, to any promotion and power over them; while worthleſs creatures, like the bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are forward for dominion; and if any refuſe to ſubmit to them, they are preſently for fire to come out and devour the beſt charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that will dare to oppoſe their ambition. Judges 9.7—15. Hence 3. True love unites tenderneſs with faithfulneſs, labouring to gain mens perſons, while it uſes boldneſs againſt their ſins; but a proud temper wants to get rid of all who refuſe to gratify it, and is ready to ſay, <hi>Am I my brother's keeper!</hi> Gen. 4. 1 John 3.12.</p>
            <p>As I am willing to have all I have ſaid and done in theſe affairs, tried by theſe marks, and no further regarded than it agrees there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; ſo I earneſtly intreat all my friends and brethren, carefully to examine their conduct thereby. If we do not deſpiſe government, we have a conſcientious regard to Chriſt's authority, and to act in our ſeveral ſtation and relations as he has commanded us. He has commanded us to <hi>hold faſt our profeſſion,</hi> and to conſider one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to provoke unto love and good works; not forſaking the aſſembling ourſelves together, &amp;c. Heb. 10.23—25. But do not ſome let go
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012655_0073_0F8BBF3ED458F430"/>their profeſſion, inſtead of holding it faſt; and forſake their brethren becauſe they ſay they are fallen, inſtead of conſidering their weak and tempted ſtate, and labouring to ſtir them up, or to reſtore them in a ſpirit of meekneſs, as the command is! Gal. 6.1. The ſame authority ſays, Take heed to yourſelves, if thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, rebuke him; and if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent forgive him: and ſays, All things that are reproved are made manifeſt by the light. Luke 17.3. Eph. 5.13. But do not ſome accuſe their brethren, of having fallen out of the teſtimony, of not coming up into the witneſs; of ſome ſuch <hi>general</hi> phraſes, without and <hi>light</hi> to <hi>manifeſt,</hi> wherein they have advanced any <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> error, or broken any particular precept? Yea, do not ſome hover in general or figurative words, and tell their brethren, that they cannot ſee where they are, unleſs they come up into the witneſs, &amp;c.? which is a practiſing the very ſame iniquity under the pretence of ſpiritual teaching, as others have done under the name of great learning. Whereas our Lord ſaid to his apoſtles, A candle gives light to all that are in the houſe; <hi>let your light ſhine before men, that they may ſee,</hi> &amp;c. Such perſons are very ready to condemn the learned for keeping their people in ignorance; though ſome of them are as groſsly guilty of <hi>darkening counſel</hi> with <hi>words without knowledge,</hi> as any ſophiſter of the age.</p>
            <p>True paſtors feed God's people with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding, not with unintelligible noiſe. We have a glorious promiſe, that when ſcorners are conſumed, who have made ſuch uſe of <hi>words</hi> as to turn aſide the juſt for a thing of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012655_0074_0F8BBF3F85086038"/>nought, that then, <hi>They</hi> that erred in ſpirit ſhall come to <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and they that murmured ſhall <hi>learn doctrine.</hi> Iſa. 29.20—24. And it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords great comfort and encouragement to my ſoul, to ſee how much this promiſe is now fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our land; notwithſtanding ſome are ſtill afraid freely to exerciſe their underſtandings for fear of getting legal; and ſeem to think that to <hi>learn doctrine,</hi> and the diſtinct nature and connection of things, would lead them off from ſpirituality: whereas we have no more of ſpirituality than we have of likeneſs to God, in whom is <hi>no darkneſs at all;</hi> and the very reaſon why it is impoſſible for God to lie, or to be tempted of evil, is becauſe he <hi>knows better.</hi> I John 1.5. James 1.13—17.</p>
            <p>One important queſtion is yet before us, which is; How ſhall we know when we have juſt cauſe to ſeparate and when not? The rule is perfect, but the beſt of men, or of churches, are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and ſome will join with no church, becauſe they can't find a perfect one; while others ſeem as if they would ſwallow any thing, if it did not croſs their own inclination. The rule requires condeſcention and forbearance, but how ſhall we know its true limits and extent? I confeſs that this has been as difficult a point heretofore in my mind, as any point in practical godlineſs. The cleareſt light that I have obtained in it is this. It is eſſential to acting rationally that we have ſome deſign or end in what we do. Now the leading deſign of the goſpel, is to turn men from ſin to God. Act. 26.18. And ſo far as conforming to circumciſion, and other Jewiſh rites, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this end, Paul condeſcended to the Jews, (and ſo to others) but when thoſe things were
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012655_0075_0F8BBF405267CAC0"/>brought up in ſuch a way as to croſs that deſign, he would not give place an hour longer, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againſt them with a fixed reſolution. Gal. 2.5. and 5.2.</p>
            <p>Another great deſign, is the edification of the ſaints; and we are all required to follow the things which make for that end. Rom. 14, 19. And every member of Chriſt, is required to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the gift that he has given for that end; and liberty ſo to do, is of importance to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Yet while this liberty has not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, (as we have ſeen) in the churches we came out of, ſome have ran to the other extreme, and have been ſo zealous for the liberty of ſpeaking, as not duly to regard others liberty of judging; and inſtead of being <hi>ſubject</hi> one to another, and <hi>cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humility,</hi> have ſadly diſcovered a contrary behaviour. 2 Cor 14.1 Pet. 5.5. Once more; the wiſdom that is from above, is <hi>firſt pure,</hi> then <hi>peaceable;</hi> and ſo far as peace can be had conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with purity; it is to be purſued with all men: but we are never to ſell the truth for peace, no not to ſave natural life. Jam. 3.17. Heb. 12.14. Prov. 23.23.</p>
            <p>Now if our eye be ſingle in any of theſe affairs to the end for which God has appointed them, he will ſurely guide us in judgment in our uſe of the means; for Chriſt's word is, If thine eye be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle thy whole body ſhall be full of light: but if evil, how great will be our darkneſs? Mat. 6.23. And it is very neceſſary that we well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh, between what are the divine commands, and the forbearance that is allowed in ſome caſes towards perſons who do not fully conform to them. For want of this diſtinction, ſo great a
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012655_0076_0F8BBF411419FF00"/>man as Mr. Bunyan, improved the inſtance of forbearance in 2 Chron. 30.18—20, to eſtabliſh the cuſtom of communing at the Lord's table with unbaptized perſons. Whereas the perſons who then partook of the paſſover <hi>otherwiſe than it was written,</hi> had not enjoyed the free uſe of thoſe writings for a long time; and we have no account of their ever partaking ſo again. What a great miſtake then was it, to bring an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſe, to eſtabliſh a general rule? Yet ſome have gone further ſtill; for they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved inſtances of forbearance as an argument againſt the authority of expreſs commands.</p>
            <p>How have many improved inſtances of God's viſiting, and uſing further means with degenerate churches before he caſt them off; as an argument that we ought to continue with them, even after it is evident to us that they refuſe to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Again, Paul's foregoing his right of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral communications from ſome of his hearers, for particular reaſons that he gives, 1 Cor. 9. ſome have improved as an argument that hearers are under no obligation to communicate to any on account of their teaching, but only on account of poverty; and if they are not poor, then not at all. Tho' there is not a plainer command in the bible, for miniſters to preach the goſpel, than there is, for <hi>him that is taught in the word,</hi> to <hi>communicate unto him that teacheth in</hi> ALL <hi>good things.</hi>" Gal. 6.6. I truſt it has been ſufficiently proved, that the authority of King George does not extend to this caſe; but ſhall that make us to diſregard the authority of King Jeſus! If he be duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, I believe it will be found that both mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people, are but <hi>ſtewards</hi> of what they
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:012655_0077_0F8BBF41CF11D190"/>poſſeſ and therefore that avoiding all unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable cenſuring of each other, their great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſhould be, that in their ſeveral ſtations and relations they may be found <hi>faithful,</hi> ſo as at laſt to receive <hi>praiſe of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1—5.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE you accuſe me with, <q>ſetting up my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as <hi>Cenſor general</hi> of the preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with ſending abroad a book, full of invectives, bitterneſs, clamour and evil-ſpeaking againſt Chriſt's miniſters.</q> p. 124, 126. I know of no better method to anſwer it, than by a little imitation of the apoſtles example in like caſes. Acts. 11.4—17. and 21.1—21. Namely to give a plain narrative of what I have done, and the reaſons of my doing ſo.</p>
            <p>As to ſetting up myſelf, I freely appeal to all that knew me, that from my cradle to my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on preaching, I diſcovered a diſpoſition, the reverſe of ſetting up myſelf, as head or leader of any company whatſoever. And my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bears me witneſs in the ſight of God, that
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012655_0079_0F8BBF43A72020E8"/>the only reaſon of my engaging in that work, was becauſe I was ſo clearly convinced, that He had given me a <hi>gift,</hi> which He called me to improve in that way, that I durſt not neglect obedience to Him therein; for I believed then, and do to this day, that there was a <hi>wo unto me if I preached not the goſpel:</hi> therefore I heartily devoted myſelf to that work, and was freely received therein by God's people; in which I went on for a number of years, before I had any thoughts of appearing to the world in print. But being called to preach in various places, that old queſtion was often put, by thoſe called ſtanding miniſters, <hi>by what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doſt thou theſe things?</hi> and the darkneſs which they diſcovered about it, at laſt moved me to attempt to hold up to the world, the light that was given me therein, which was accordingly done in 1754, under the title of, <q>The nature and neceſſity of an internal call to preach the goſpel.</q> And your learned brethren were ſo far from attempting ro confute it, that ſome of them expreſſed ſuch charity as this; that <q>
                  <hi>I. B.</hi> never wrote that book, but got his name ſet to the works of ſome other man; for (ſaid they) ſcarce one to ten of our college-learnt men could write ſuch a diſcourſe.</q> Whereas it is known to Him who will judge us all, that no perſon on earth, either wrote or indited one line of it, but he whoſe name ſtands in the title page.</p>
            <p>As to baptiſm, after long and ſore exerciſes of mind, occaſioned as I ſee now, chiefly by the falſe repreſentations which tradition had handed down to us, both concerning principles and facts, I was at laſt favored with a comfortable eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After which I was publicly declared, to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:012655_0080_0F8BBF443459DEE8"/>be a <hi>covenant-breaker,</hi> for turning from infant baptiſm, notwithſtanding our covenant, like that of the fathers of this country, expreſſed an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, to embrace further light as God ſhould open it to us. When this cenſure came abroad, in the reſult of a council of elders and brethren, who had profeſſed and acted in fellowſhip with baptiſt churches, it naturally cauſed a general difficulty; and which at length occaſioned a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral meeting of the ſeparate and baptiſt churches in your town, in May, 1754; where I remember ſir, that you was among the ſpectators; when, inſtead of attending to the point in hand, which was, whether a declaring, that turning from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm was covenant breaking, did not give juſt occaſion of offence to the baptiſts? I ſay inſtead of that, much time was taken up in expoſing my imperfections about theſe affairs; which had the ſame effect with many, that ſuch-like treatment of the baptiſts has often had, ever ſince the firſt reformations from popery; viz. to prevent their ſeeing things in their true light. But tho' my character was thus injuriouſly treated, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty miles from home, before an aſſembly, from at leaſt three of the four governments of New-England, yet I choſe as much as poſſible, to avoid all perſonal conteſts, and only publiſhed, as clearly as I was enabled, the true ſtate of the argument concerning baptiſm, in a diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>bond-woman</hi> and the <hi>free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I never engaged in a printed controverſy with any particular perſon, for ſeventeen years after my call to the public miniſtry; till in 1764, the gentleman under whoſe miniſtry I was born, and from whom I ſeparated, with ſix others, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012655_0081_0F8BBF48A4CC9010"/>a piece, wherein, after mentioning the order to blow the <hi>trumpet,</hi> and to ſound an <hi>alarm</hi> in Zion, they went on to alarm the world, with a repreſentation that the <hi>late ſeparates</hi> and <hi>baptiſts,</hi> were <hi>going faſt</hi> into a <hi>dreadful apoſtacy;</hi> and that it was, <q>hid from them, or rather, that they <hi>will not ſee,</hi> that they have fell into the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> and are in danger of <hi>periſhing</hi> in the <hi>gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying</hi> of <hi>Core.</hi>
               </q> Upon a ſight of this, and other things of like nature, from my old miniſter, I ſent a printed <hi>letter</hi> to him, upon the injuſtice of ſuch conduct. And what is there in all this, of ſetting up myſelf? Tho' I know I am a very imperfect creature, yet I can freely ſubmit, both the occaſion, and the temper of theſe writings, to the judgment of every chriſtian reader.</p>
            <p>When you ſir, three years after, publiſhed a large piece, in the ſame ſtrain with the miniſters juſt mentioned, and I was prevail'd with to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, I thought ſomething further was called for, than what I had before done. And as there is a rule in ſome caſes, to <hi>rebuke ſharply,</hi> and to uſe a <hi>rod,</hi> which is diſtinguiſhable from a <hi>ſpirit of meekneſs.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.21. I thought it right to make a little trial of the <hi>rods,</hi> which you and others have furniſhed us with, to ſee if miniſters had not ſome feeling, as well as the people that they have been threſhing theſe twenty years. The temper and manner of my executing this deſign, is further to be conſidered. You tell me that if I had reproved you with <hi>meekneſs</hi> of ſpirit, had a temper good and kind, you ſhould <hi>doubtleſs</hi> have underſtood my inoffenſive language, and <hi>given a ſerious attention</hi> to it. p. 124. Could I have believed that, I aſſure you I would have
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:012655_0082_0F8BBF4AF667B818"/>taken that method; for tho' a little ſalt and vinegar may give food a good reliſh, even with healthy perſons; yet I think it was a very juſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a noted author, in his <hi>eſtimate</hi> of the manners and principles of the times, that people's being much more taken with things that <hi>tickle</hi> and <hi>irritate,</hi> than with thoſe which are <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>nouriſhing,</hi> clearly proves the <hi>diſtempered taſte</hi> of our age.</p>
            <p>I wiſh you had now given me reaſon to think, that you was diſpoſed to give due <hi>attention</hi> to mild and fair reaſoning, upon the affairs between us; for that is my choice: and ſince we ſeem to agree in two general heads, I think to make a little trial of what can be done under them.</p>
            <p>Friſt I obſerved, that let us talk what we may, of defending <hi>truth</hi> and of promoting its cauſe, if at the ſame time we advance <hi>falſe arguments,</hi> or diſcover a wrong <hi>temper</hi> and behaviour, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by contract guilt to ourſelves, and injure our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-men. This obſervation you concur with, p. 125. And let us ſee what can be done under it.</p>
            <p>And,</p>

Now ſir, in order to convince me of my faults you ſay, <q>You ſaw me every where friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the work of God; and while I expoſed &amp; reproved the falſe principles, ſpirit and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my erring brethren, you heard me fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and <hi>ſufficiently</hi> expreſs my charity, love and <hi>tenderneſs</hi> for their <hi>perſons</hi>
               </q> p. 126. This is what you ſay; now for the proof of it.</p>

You ſir, in your ſermons, began your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, againſt the ſeparates with allowing, that they held a number of <hi>truths,</hi> and had ſome <hi>orders</hi> among them that were good, but ſay, <q>I know not of one principle or practice, among <hi>them,</hi> that is agreable to the goſpel, but what they learned in OUR churches.—But THEY have done much to weaken and pull down <hi>the church of God,</hi> rather than to build it up.</q> p. 113. Of learning you ſay, <q>Though <hi>all</hi> OUR teachers have not an equal degree of learning; yet HERE the treaſure lies, in THESE churches of Chriſt."<note n="*" place="bottom">Now Sir, is learning limited to the churches of your own town! p. 12.</note> p. 168. "The body of the ſeparates are <hi>truce-breakers,</hi> for—<hi>they</hi> openly renounced communion with US, when WE the ſtanding churches were daily attending the ordinances of Chriſt, agreable to his inſtitution.</q> p. 17. But you ſay, <q>Such is the conduct of our ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate brethren, in this grand affair, of caſting off a <hi>learned, able miniſter,</hi> and ſetting up ſuch as are <hi>unlearned</hi> in their room; 'tis really affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and I ſpeak it with concern) to ſee how they are beguiled and led aſtray, by the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>ſatan</hi> in this <hi>intereſting</hi> affair; and how manifeſtly they <hi>join with</hi> the <hi>gates of hell,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt THE church of Chriſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">Note Sir, you forgot this paſſage when you complained of my title. p. 16, 17.</note>—Satan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them.</q> p. 177. Yea, as as if you had had been inſpired to tell men's hearts, you ſay of theſe brethren <q>
                  <hi>They</hi> held faſt <hi>their deceit,</hi> they <hi>refuſed</hi> to return.</q> p. 128. <q>Surely we have
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012655_0084_0F8BBF4C4CC8EB30"/>as full evidence, as the nature of the caſe can admit of, that it was a <hi>falſe ſpirit,</hi> and a falſe religion that made the ſeparation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, a device of ſatan, that old ſerpent the devil, to injure THE church of God.</q> p. 161. <q>The <hi>luſts</hi> of ſpiritual-pride, ſelf-love, vain-confidence or ſelf-ſufficiency; theſe <hi>luſts</hi> do evidently appear <hi>in</hi> and run <hi>through</hi> the WHOLE affair of ſeparation (though <hi>all</hi> are not equally guilty).</q> p. 164. And to deſcribe what a <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>calm</hi> temper you went with, to the firſt ſeparate ordination in your town, you name the two worſt enemies the chriſtian has in earth or hell, and then add the ſeparates as the third; ſaying, <q>The great Searcher of hearts, knows the ſevere conflict that I had with SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAN, SELF and the SEPARATES (for ſeveral hours before the engagement) and the ſenſible victory that he gave me over <hi>them all.</hi>
               </q> p. 156.</p>
            <p>Now ſir, when through your ſermons I ſaw you thus labouring to confine the work of God to your own party, and heard you in ſtrong terms, not only declare your brethren to be governed by their <hi>luſts</hi> and <hi>deluded</hi> by the <hi>devil,</hi> but alſo to rank them with the worſt of <hi>your</hi> enemies; how was it poſſible for me to ſee <hi>you friendly</hi> to God's work, or <hi>tender</hi> to his people, while you was ſo doing!</p>
            <p>This reminds me of another inſtance of your late <hi>tenderneſs.</hi> From your attempts in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to draw our picture in odious colors, I took occaſion to obſerve, that Ward's daughter being taken from her huſband, and John Smith's wife being poiſoned, had often been caſt upon us from
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012655_0085_0F8BBF4D1438F0E0"/>pulpits for the ſame end; although the former never was received as a member of any of our churches, and the latter was excommunicated for his corrupt principles before he committed that fact. You now tell your readers, that I have omitted ſome material and <hi>intereſting</hi> circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces relating to Smith, and the church at Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, which keep the <hi>bad tendency</hi> of their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating principles out of ſight; which therefore you have publiſhed; tho' you ſay, <q>It grieves me to relate theſe things, for I feel <hi>tender</hi> for the cauſe and people of God.</q> p. 112, 113. Theſe <hi>intereſting</hi> circumſtances are, That he had been a very vicious man, but was looked upon by that church a remarkable inſtance of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and that after his excommunication, and the great crimes he committed. <q>Yet ſo tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly did they hold to their darling principle of a <hi>certain knowledge of chriſtians,</hi> that they retained their opinion of him as a chriſtian ſtill: and many of them brought the inſtance of the fall of David, Peter, &amp;c. to juſtify their ſentiments.</q> You have not been ſo fair as to tell us which members they were that talked ſo, nor from whom you had your information. I know that their paſtor and ſome others talked otherwiſe to me; and their conduct evidenced to the world, that they were earneſt to have juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice done him for his ſin, both in church and ſtate. But ſuppoſe that every word you have related was truth; I could produce an inſtance of one of your fathers in the miniſtry, who publicly declared his opinion that one of his members was gone to heaven, that put an end to her own life; how then is the bad <hi>tendency</hi> of our ſeparation diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:012655_0086_0F8BBF4DC4564290"/>by what you have related? Rather, does not the <hi>intereſting</hi> matter lie here; that you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that your brethren if not yourſelf, have from your pulpits reproached the ſeparate chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with theſe two inſtances of ſcandal, one of which never was among them, and the other they had cleared themſelves of in a goſpel manner; and ſo it ſhould appear that you have been guilty, as Dr. <hi>Franck</hi> ſays, <q>In your ſermons of wholly <hi>perverting</hi> God's ordinance, by rejecting and calumniating thoſe who deſire to govern their lives by the goſpel of Chriſt.</q> Ex. p. 84.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has taken him ſmartly to taſk for thus meddling with him, in a piece called, The <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer examined:</hi> and on this particular, tho' he owns that the controverſy was about <hi>human learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that he took the prophet in that text, to be ſpeaking of the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> yet he ſays, <q>The <hi>manner</hi> of his receiving this <hi>learning</hi> or knowledge, does not alter the <hi>nature</hi> of it; 'tis <hi>human learning</hi> ſtill: and Chriſt <hi>as man,</hi> had all that is contained therein.</q> And he takes up half a page to ſhew to us, that Chriſt was eminently furniſhed with <hi>grammar, logic</hi> and <hi>rhetoric;</hi> 
               <q>in all which (ſays he) the excellency of <hi>human</hi> learning conſiſts.</q> then he ſays, <q>Tho' I know not what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> intends, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by <hi>divine</hi> learning (for his ideas are very ſingular)—yet, I freely concur, that the phraſe alſo imports an <hi>ability</hi> of ſpeaking in all points, as becometh a perſon TAUGHT OF GOD, and filled with all <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>heavenly wiſdom</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and a ſingular <hi>ſkill</hi> of <hi>winning ſouls,</hi> and working upon men's HEARTS and CONSCIENCES. Theſe things I own are included or ſuggeſted to us, by the prophet
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012655_0088_0F8BBF4F45674D00"/>in this ſcripture, though more remotely: the FIRST and <hi>moſt obvious</hi> import of the word, is in favor of <hi>human</hi> learning; which is AS MUCH the GIFT of GOD, in its place, as GRACE to improve it to the <hi>glory</hi> of the giver. And it's highly worthy of our reſpectful notice, in this day of reproach and contempt caſt upon this <hi>gift</hi> of the SPIRIT, even <hi>learning,</hi> that our Lord in ſpeaking of miniſterial accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he had an infinite fulneſs of, ſhould uſe ſuch a ſtriking <hi>phraſe</hi> as this, <hi>The tongue of the learned.</hi>

            <p>It appears plain, that this writer had ſome thoughts about him; for he ſubmits his <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>honeſty,</hi> in all this, only to "the <hi>learned</hi> or judicious reader," and tells us, If <hi>modeſty</hi> be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he <hi>thinks</hi> it would lead Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to enquire whether he did not, <hi>exerciſe himſelf in things too high for him!</hi> I ſay, it appears plain that he had ſome thoughts about him: for 'tis a wonder if ſome people who are not maſters of arts, do not prove themſelves to be ſo deſtitute of <hi>modeſty,</hi> and ſo "ſingular in their ideas," as to judge, that this miniſter had not lately read that old queſtion, <hi>How knoweth this man letters, having never</hi> LEARNED? nor the <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> ſentence of the <hi>learned</hi> miniſters of that day, who ſaid, <q>Are ye alſo <hi>deceived!</hi> have <hi>any</hi> of the <hi>rulers,</hi> or of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> believed on him! but THIS PEOPLE who KNOWETH NOT <hi>the</hi> LAW, <hi>are</hi> CURSED!</q> John 7.15, 47—49.

But truly Sir, if I am rude in ſpeech, I mean not to be ſo in knowledge; and I can freely refer it to all chriſtian people among us, let them be learned or unlearned, whether your argument for the neceſſity of <hi>human</hi> learning, from that ſtriking phraſe, is not as falſe as his was, who took the ſtriking phraſe, <hi>Go with him;</hi> without due regard to the character of the perſons we ſhould go with? For my part I confeſs, that for you to call it a <hi>ſingular idea,</hi> to ſpeak of <hi>divine</hi> learning, as diſtinct from all that man can teach, when yet in the next breath you are forced thus to diſtinguiſh, and call the former, a being <hi>Taught of God,</hi> and filled with the <hi>divine ſkill</hi> of <hi>winning ſouls,</hi> and working upon men's <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>conſciences;</hi> and then to hear you declare that this <hi>divine ſkill,</hi> is more <hi>remotely</hi> included in Iſa. 50.4. than the <hi>human</hi> learning of grammar, logic and rhetoric, which you aſſert, is <hi>as much</hi> the gift of God as <hi>grace;</hi> and that you do not <hi>freely</hi> ſubmit your <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>honeſty</hi> in theſe matters to any but the <hi>learned;</hi> I own that all theſe things are too wonderful for me, unleſs I ſuppoſe, that as thoſe who formerly made <hi>heart</hi> religion a <hi>remote</hi> thing, and ſought deep to <hi>hide</hi> their <hi>council,</hi> in righteous judgment, <hi>wiſdom</hi> was <hi>hid</hi> from them, Iſa. 29.13—15; ſo that ſomething of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has taken place again: For when miniſters ſtand as they ought, they renounce ſuch <hi>hidden things,</hi> and by <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of the TRUTH, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended themſelves, not only to the learned, but to <hi>every man</hi>'s CONSCIENCE <hi>in the ſight of God.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For a diſputant to take any truth which his opponent holds as much as he does, and blend it
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012655_0091_0F8BBF55C37A3E58"/>with that which is not true, in order to gain his argument, this you ſay is <q>falſe and ſophiſtical reaſoning.</q> p. 99. A proof by the way, that your temper can bear with hard names, when you think them applicable to your opponent. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe be ſo here or not, is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The caſe is thus. In trying to prove that the ſeparates <hi>heaped</hi> to themſelves teachers, you ſaid, <q>According to one grand principle of their churches, <hi>every one</hi> muſt exerciſe his gifts in <hi>public</hi> as he is impreſſed or moved by the ſpirit.</q> In anſwer I obſerved, that for you to pretend that we hold <hi>all</hi> to have the gift for <hi>public</hi> teachers is not true.

<pb n="93" facs="unknown:012655_0092_0F8BBF5811E8EE30"/>upon him who began the argument. That I freely leave to others, and only remark, that this was the firſt time of my hearing of <hi>canons</hi> in our churches, except the canon of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>Now to come to what is mainly here aimed at, I would note, that the general plan of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was to give the characters of Chriſt's church, and then to apply the ſame to the churches of our day. In doing of which you endevoured to prove, that thoſe you call <hi>ſtanding churches,</hi> are upon the Rock, and ſo near like the firſt church in Plymouth, as to claim a <hi>right</hi> of relation as <hi>ſiſters</hi> or <hi>children</hi> thereto. And though you was forced to own that they, and the authors of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge platform, profeſſed that the power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is in the church, yet you tried to prove that they did not act according to that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This I proved ſo plainly to be a miſtake, that you have not attempted to refute me in it; though you now ſay <q>the <hi>practice</hi> of the churches is generally if not univerſally as I have ſaid it ought to be.</q> But leſt the reader by this ſhould ſee a real difference between you and our fathers, you ſlip in a clauſe from Cambridge platform, concerning the churches improving <hi>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in ordinations where they can conveniently be obtained. p. 46. This point I twice over de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that we ALL hold to, and practice upon. Ex. p. 17.63. To what end then, can it be here mentioned but to hide the truth?</p>
            <p>In the ſcond place I clearly proved, that our fathers way of admitting members, was by a <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal relation to the church,</hi> of <hi>a work of God's Spirit on their hearts;</hi> which has ſince degenerated into <hi>written</hi> relations, and from that to <hi>none at all,</hi> in
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:012655_0093_0F8BBF5930E0B5E8"/>many places. This you cannot deny, but try to evade it by ſaying, you was not treating of a <hi>particular</hi> church; and then you ſlip in a clauſe, that in caſe of <hi>exceſſive fear,</hi> our fathers varied from their common method. p. 51. And who ever denied that?</p>
            <p>This led me down to open a third article of difference between you and our fathers, which is the root of all, namely the <hi>matter</hi> of the goſpel church. And I produce full teſtimonies from ſuch as you allow to be ſome of your moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fathers. <q>That if it ſhould paſs for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent doctrine in New-England, that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>orthodox</hi> in judgment, as to matters of faith, not <hi>ſcandalous</hi> in life, ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to partake of the Lord's ſupper, without an examination concerning the <hi>work of ſaving grace in their hearts,</hi> it would be a real <hi>apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy</hi> from former principles.</q> Then I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>letter</hi> publiſhed againſt us by ſixteen miniſters (and you now call it an excellent <hi>letter.</hi> p. 54.) which ſays, <q>It is the will of Chriſt, that all thoſe who make an <hi>outward credible profeſſion of chriſtianity,</hi> ſhould be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his church, and though <hi>unconverted</hi> BE THERE.</q> Ex. p. 18.20.</p>
            <p>Thus I proved, that our fathers held the power of ordination to be in the church; but that you hold it to be in miniſters. That they held to admitting members by verbal relations; you to written ones, or none at all: And thirdly that our fathers declared, That a <hi>general profeſſion</hi> would be real <hi>apoſtacy;</hi> and I proved that your chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have got into it: yet you ſhuffle along, till from our fathers writing, you bring out the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012655_0094_0F8BBF59D0FB55F8"/>materials of the church to be <hi>profeſſing believers,</hi> and <hi>their children,</hi> and then ſay, <q>Surely here is <hi>diſtinction</hi> without difference—And yet he is ſhewing an <hi>eſſential</hi> difference between the ſtanding churches, and the firſt in the land. ALL the difference is they EXACTLY agree.</q> p. 52.</p>
            <p>Whether this is moſt properly called <hi>ſophiſtry,</hi> or <hi>lying,</hi> I leave with God and your own conſcience, praying that you may be brought to true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Having as I concieved, fully proved and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference between your churches and our fathers, and meeting with that glaring perverſion of the parable of the tares, viz. applying what Chriſt ſpoke of the <hi>world,</hi> to the <hi>church;</hi> I took occaſion to point out the nature of his order, <hi>Let both grow together;</hi> and how it has been violated among us, by depriving thoſe of their <hi>worldly</hi> liberties and enjoyments, who would not conform to the pariſh miniſters. Upon which I gave it as my mind that there may and ought to be, a <hi>ſweet harmony</hi> between civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rulers, but not <hi>ſuch a union</hi> as had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; for which I gave my reaſons, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured diſtinctly to run the line between them, Ex. p. 20—32. yet you aſſert this part of my book to be <q>mixed, inconnected and without order,</q> and that I have got <hi>beſide</hi> my <hi>profeſſed</hi> deſign, and alſo that I fault your churches for <hi>a connection</hi> with the ſtate, which you ſay, <q>is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently warranted by the holy ſcriptures.</q> p. 55. 56. But take notice; the firſt part of my profeſſed deſign was, to <hi>open the conſtitution</hi> of your churches. Ex. p. 15. and in this place I
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012655_0095_0F8BBF5A9130A280"/>was not beſide it, but upon it, and proved the <hi>conſtitution</hi> to be ſuch, that if the pariſh miniſter diſliked another's preaching near him, or called for his ſalary, the ſecular powers muſt exert their <hi>force</hi> to remove thoſe he was offended with; and to anſwer his demands: And if you Sir, thought <hi>ſuch a connection</hi> to be warranted by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, your buſineſs evidently was to bring your proofs. And have you done it? No.—Indeed you have proved that there was <hi>a union</hi> between the church and ſtate in Iſrael, (which I held as much as you) but not a word of <hi>ſuch a connection</hi> as I had faulted. p. 56. 57. Then you ſhew that Iſa. 49.23, and 1 Tim. 2.1, 2. imply <q>Not only that the magiſtrate ſhould not himſelf lay hands on us, nor ſend his officers and ſervants to ſpoil us of, or interrupt us <hi>in,</hi> the enjoyment of our religious rights; but alſo that as he has it in his power, he would reſtrain and puniſh thoſe that ſhould moleſt or trouble us in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>godlineſs</hi> or <hi>religion,</hi> as well as in matters of <hi>honeſty,</hi> which we have a right to, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other men.</q> p. 58.</p>
            <p>And where is ſophiſtry now! dare you Mr. <hi>Fiſh,</hi> before him whoſe eyes are like a flame of fire, pretend that I have wrote a word, or formed the leaſt argument againſt <hi>ſuch</hi> an exerciſe of the magiſtrates power towards the church as you have deſcribed! No: if thoſe powers had not been moved by <hi>your</hi> brethren in the <hi>miniſtry</hi> to act the very contrary part, to what you have proved from the word of God that they ought to have acted, I aſſure you I would not have troubled you in this affair. I obſerve that inſtead of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with me that the <hi>worſt miſtake</hi> that our
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012655_0096_0F8BBF5B4A5EFBC8"/>fathers brought to this land, was their confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing church and ſtate together, you reckon one of their worſt miſtakes was, allowing the church the power of ordination; on which you ſay, <q>Jeſus Chriſt is head and king; and none may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dare to ſet up any practice, or eſtabliſh any order in his houſe, but what he has direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to: to be ſure none contrary to his direction. The holy ſcriptures, not the platform, are to guide us in this important queſtion.</q> p. 47. Yet in the important queſtion, whether magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates have any warrant to uſe force to ſupport miniſters or not? here <hi>the caſe is altered.</hi> Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has ſound no warrant for that in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, therefore he flies to the platform, and tells of the <hi>rules</hi> our <hi>pious fathers</hi> laid down therein, which he ſays, <q>Is done with ſo much <hi>caution,</hi> judgment and <hi>excellency of ſpirit,</hi> that, tis pity Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had not contented himſelf with the rules <hi>there.</hi>
               </q> p. 59. And what are theſe rules? why one of them contains theſe words. <q>If any church ſhall rend itſelf from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of other churches;—in ſuch caſe the magiſtrate is to put forth his <hi>coercive power.</hi>
               </q> Another of them is; <q>The magiſtrate is to ſee that the <hi>miniſtry</hi> be duly provided for</q> which you explain as meaning that he ſhall <q>
                  <hi>oblige</hi> the people that won't do their duty without.</q> p. 63.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, come up like an honeſt man. Theſe rules were firſt drawn by miniſters, and thou art the miniſter who haſt blamed me for not being <hi>contented</hi> with them, declaring them to be laid down with <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>excellency of ſpirit;</hi> and I can freely appeal to your conſcience, that it
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012655_0097_0F8BBF5C0D07E830"/>was really according to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of theſe rules that the magiſtrate acted, when to prevent our firſt ſeparate ordination at Mansfield, they ſent their ſervants, when the old gentlemen that was elected for their paſtor, was at worſhip with his church the day before he was to have been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and LAID HANDS on him, and carried him to priſon, for preaching without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of ſuch <hi>miniſters</hi> as thou art. This my eyes ſaw; and the next day I ſaw more than a dozen of ſuch miniſters come up after the <hi>ſhepherd</hi> was thus <hi>ſmitten,</hi> to ſee if they could not <hi>ſcatter that flock,</hi> which, as your rules expreſs it, had <hi>rent itſelf</hi> from your communion. Ex. p. 47.</p>
            <p>So openly were thoſe doings of the civil powers (which you have proved was the reverſe of what they ought to have acted) countenanced by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who were moſt if not all of them, ſigners of that which you now call an <hi>excellent letter;</hi> and ſo openly did they ſay in practice, that if theſe people would withdraw from their <hi>churches,</hi> they ſhould not peaceably <hi>grow together with them in the world.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>F.</hi> thou art the man, who haſt declared to the world, that <q>It is wholly out of rule, and quite injurious, for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to charge the <hi>churches</hi> or their <hi>miniſters</hi> with ſending men to jail for rates, or other <hi>like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions</hi> (as he rudely talks, and unreaſonably complains, throughout his book) for <hi>theſe</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are evidently the acts of the civil ſtate, done for its OWN utility.</q> p. 56. <q>The doings of the civil authority, and of that ALONE.</q> p. 59.</p>
            <p>I hope our honorable rulers will take warning by this, and never more exert their power till
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:012655_0098_0F8BBF5D250D9C68"/>they know who it is for; and never uſe any more <hi>force</hi> to ſupport miniſters, till miniſters can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce divine rule for it, and alſo will own that it is <hi>for them.</hi>

I come,</p>
            <p n="4">4. To obſerve, that all arguments which are founded upon a violation of the <hi>golden rule</hi> are certainly falſe ones. That your arguments againſt us were ſo founded. I before attempted to prove by three witneſſes, out of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; the firſt of which I introduced thus: No man or community can think it reaſonable, to have their <hi>character</hi> drawn only from their <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> without any of their <hi>virtues:</hi> yet ſhewed
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012655_0099_0F8BBE90C7D47888"/>that you had done ſo with the ſeparates. Ex. p. 5. In reply to which, you now ſay, <q>It was not my proper buſineſs to draw their character as <hi>men</hi> nor as <hi>chriſtians,</hi> but only as <hi>ſeparates,</hi> (ſermon, p. 160.)—Whatever virtues they had as men or as chriſtians (which I frequently allow them) yet I knew of none they had <hi>as ſeparates.</hi> Therefore I had properly to do with nothing but their <hi>imperfections,</hi> errors or faults.</q> p. 19.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>F.</hi> permit me to tell you one thing, and that is; as much as you think I am prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt your order of miniſters, yet I would not have ventured to believe, much leſs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to declare, that you knowingly held to ſo groſs things as you now expreſs, both concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a learned tongue, and the golden rule, not upon the verbal teſtimony of the beſt friend I have on earth. No, I ſhould have thought they ſome way miſtook your meaning: but what is written is written. And though ſome peculiar circumſtances that I have paſſed through, have (through divine goodneſs) taught me more how ſelf can blind us, than perhaps many others know; yet your book has taught me more of it than I ever ſaw before, and in that reſpect has done me good; and I ſhould be glad to do you a like kindneſs, though not in a like manner.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, according to your own account, you know of many virtues that theſe people had as <hi>men</hi> and as <hi>chriſtians,</hi> but ſay, <q>I knew of <hi>none</hi> they had as <hi>ſeparates.</hi>
               </q> That is, as they ſtood oppoſite to <hi>yourſelves,</hi> neither <hi>manhood</hi> nor <hi>chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity</hi> muſt go into their <hi>character.</hi> What a

I attempted to favour you with a glaſs to ſee him in before; but as it was from a <hi>biſhop,</hi> you paſs it by as not to the purpoſe. p. 22. I am now favoured with another that is ſo much clearer, and from ſuch as you own to be worthy hands, that I can't but hope for better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs than the other met with. It is this. Three years after our fathers publiſhed thoſe rules in the Cambridge platform, which you ſay 'tis pity I had not been contented with, Mr. John Clark, paſtor of the baptiſt church in Newport (and who was learned both in Greek and Hebrew) went with two of his friends to viſit ſome breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in Lynn; but as they were peaceably wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God together, on Lord's day, July 20, 1651, a magiſtrate was ſo zealous to follow the miniſters rules, that he put forth his <hi>coercive power,</hi> and had thoſe three men ſeized before they had finiſhed their forenoon exerciſe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the afternoon to the pariſh worſhip; and afterwards ſent them priſoners to Boſton. There they were all fined, and for not paying it, one of them was whipped thirty laſhes, and two of his friends, for openly taking him by the hand, and praiſing God for his courage and conſtancy in ſuffering, were carried before the general court in Boſton, and fined 40<abbr>s.</abbr> each, or to be whipped.<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's hiſtory of New-England, vol.

            </p>
            <p>When news of this reached to London, Sir Richard Saltonſtall, one of the Maſſachuſetts firſt: magiſtrates, wrote to the miniſters of Boſton in this manner.</p>

It doth not a little grieve my ſpirit to hear what ſad things are reported daily of your tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and perſecutions in New-England.—Truly friends, this your practice of <hi>compelling</hi> any in matters to worſhip, to that whereof they are not <hi>fully perſuaded,</hi> is to make them <hi>ſin,</hi> for ſo the apoſtle (Rom. 14.23.) tells us, and many are made hypocrites thereby, conforming in their outward man for fear of puniſhment. We pray for you, and wiſh you proſperity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, hoped the Lord would have given you ſo much light and love there, that you might have been eyes to God's people here, and not to practiſe thoſe courſes in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which you went ſo far to prevent.— Theſe rigid ways have laid you very low in the hearts of the ſaints. I do aſure you I have heard them pray in the public aſſemblies, that the Lord would give you meek and humble ſpirits, not to ſtrive ſo much for <hi>unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> as to keep the <hi>unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi>

Righteous judgment will not take up reports, much leſs reproaches againſt the innocent. The cry of the ſinners of Sodom was great and loud, and reached up to heaven; yet the righteous God (giving us an example what to do in the like caſe) he would firſt go down to ſee whether their crime were altogether according to the cry, before he would proceed to judgment, Gen. 18.20, 21. and when he did find the truth of the cry, he did not wrap up all alike promiſcuouſly in the judgment, but ſaved ſuch as he found innocent. We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe whom (if you know us better) you would account peaceable in Iſrael.—Yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we ſo vaſt in our indulgence or tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to think the men you ſpeak of ſuffered an unjuſt cenſure. For one of them (Obadiah Holmes being an excommunicate perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, out of a church in Plymouth patent,<note n="*" place="bottom">He was excommunicated for ſeparating from the church in Rehoboth.</note> came into this juriſdiction, and took upon him to baptize, which I think himſelf will not ſay he was compelled here to perform—The inpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of either of them was no detriment. I believe they fared neither of them better at home.—But be pleaſed to conſider this point a little further. If the worſhip be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the magiſtrate compelling him to come to it, compelleth him not to ſin, but the ſin is in his <hi>will</hi> that needs to be compelled to a chriſtian duty.—Better to be hypocrites than profane
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012655_0103_0F8BBE954D530E78"/>perſons; hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man; but the profane perſon giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God neither outward nor inward man.— You know not, if you think we come into this wilderneſs to practiſe thoſe courſes here which we fled from in England. We believe there is a vaſt difference between men's inventions and God's inſtitutions; we fled from men's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, to which we elſe ſhould have been compelled; we compel <hi>none</hi> to men's inventions. If our ways (rigid ways as you call them) have laid us low in the hearts of God's people. yea and of the ſaints (as you ſtile them) we do not believe it is <hi>any part</hi> of their <hi>ſaintſhip.</hi>— Nevertheleſs, I tell you the truth, we have tolerated in <hi>our</hi> church ſome <hi>anabaptiſts</hi>—and do ſtill to this day.—We are far from arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating infallibility of judgment to ourſelves.

                  <item>2. When they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that they did not mean to hold any wrong principle or practice, but were in earneſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the right way, they argued that ſurely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to go in that way too; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</item>
                  <item>3. That it muſt be their <hi>will</hi> that kept them therefrom, which <hi>will</hi> ought to be <hi>compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>

                  <item>6.

Perhaps if you again look over our Lord's treatment of the ſeven churches of Aſia, you will find your <hi>ſurely,</hi> to be a miſtake as to the manner of reproving; but Sir, that was not the work that you was about, by your own account the principal deſign of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was to draw the ſeparates <hi>character before others</hi> inſtead of reproving <hi>them:</hi> and a principal article of advice and exhortation in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, given out to the world is, <q>Go not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter THEM nor follow THEM.—<hi>keep your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>

            <p>Should you Sir, try again to evade conviction by pretending that I have forgot my ſubject, and inſtead of opening the <hi>difference,</hi> have ſhewn an <hi>exact likeneſs,</hi> between you and our fathers. I reply that this is a great miſtake; and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſhort view of the difference, I would refer you to Ezek. 43.7, 9. And whatever may be the primary meaning of the text, I believe there is no injuſtice in accommodating it to the caſe in hand. A houſe filled with the <hi>carcaſes</hi> of fathers and rulers, cannot prove that it is <hi>the ſpiritual houſe</hi> which they built with <hi>lively ſtones.</hi> And to examine whether ſomething of this nature does not appear in New-England, let the following points be conſidered.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Dr. Owen, who for ſome time was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and always was much eſteemed here, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed the ſentiments of our moſt eminent fathers, as to the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of miniſters, when he obſerved, that it is <hi>ſufficiently</hi> ſecured, by our Lord's erecting that office, and giving warrant for it's continuance to the end; and by his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance according to his promiſe, to communicate <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gifts</hi> unto men for the edification of his church; whoſe duty it is to chuſe, call and ſolemnly <hi>ſet a part</hi> unto the office of the miniſtry ſuch as Chriſt <hi>by his ſpirit</hi> has made meet for it, according to the rule of his word; and then he ſays, <q>Thoſe who plead for the continuation of a <hi>ſucceſſive miniſtry,</hi> without reſpect unto <hi>theſe things,</hi> without reſolving both the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>office</hi> of it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,</hi> do but erect a <hi>dead image</hi> or imbrace a <hi>dead</hi> CARCASE, inſtead of the <hi>living</hi> and <hi>life-giving</hi>

               <item>2. Our fathers had ſuch a <hi>ſpirit of faith</hi> in preaching,<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 4.13.</note> that the ſame Mr. Cotton whom we were but now treating of, declared, that the <hi>difference</hi> will ever hold between the word <hi>read</hi> and <hi>preached,</hi> they are <hi>two diſtinct</hi> ordinances. Herein we hold with him; but you do not. Ex. p. 72.73.</item>
               <item>3. In the effect of ſuch preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which brought perſons before all the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to declare the <hi>workings of God's ſpirit in their hearts,</hi> we hold with our fathers, while many of your churches have not even the <hi>carcaſe</hi> of that cuſtom left. Ex. p. 54, 55.</item>
               <item>4. Tho' our fathers held to the uſe of compulſion in religion, yet they did not entruſt ſuch a power with any but <hi>brethren</hi> in their churches; but you Sir, put this compelling power into the hands of many who are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any church at all.</item>
               <item>5. As I have already ſhewn, they allowed none to <hi>vote</hi> for rulers or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters but members in full communion, and your beloved Mitchel declared, that it would <hi>ruin</hi> the churches if <hi>election of miniſters</hi> were carried by a <hi>looſer ſort</hi> of members, Ex. p. 51. How then are they now <hi>ruined,</hi> when you are forced to own that <hi>worldly</hi> eſtate makes voters in ſuch affairs! p. 83.</item>
               <item>6. Though the firſt fathers of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land held to infant-baptiſm, yet they were ſo far from holding of it upon the footing you do, that though ſome tried hard to bring it on to that footing when Cambridge platform was compoſed, yet they were prevented the doing of it, as Dr.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012655_0108_0F8BBE9CC682D6F0"/>Mather tells us, by <hi>many worthy men.</hi>

               <item>8. While our fathers were ſo much blinded as to think force was to be uſed in religion, they were in earneſt to force men to <hi>conform</hi> to what they eſteemed the right way, as well as to ſupport it: but how little pains is now taken with men's perſons, if they can but get their money!</item>

            <p>In ſhort, the greateſt likeneſs that I can ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween many of the preſent generation, and thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is in a <hi>tenderneſs</hi> for <hi>ſelf,</hi> and a want of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for its oppoſites. Mr. Cotton could readily ſind a divine example, where ſelf was affected, for not proceeding upon <hi>report,</hi> without a full examination whether they were <hi>altogether</hi> true or not; and alſo for not wrapping up the guilty and innocent together: yet how contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is his treatment of the baptiſts in the ſame letter? And you ſir, complain much of me for publiſhing many things concerning your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, which you do not diſpute the truth of (though I gave you a fair opportunity to do it, by naming perſons and places, giving dates and quoting my vouchers) while you have treated
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:012655_0109_0F8BBE9D8ABFD0D8"/>us quite otherwiſe; and how have you now raked the ſtreets of Canterbury for ſomething againſt that church, and then you inſinuate that we are not <hi>honeſt</hi> to own our principles, nor <hi>humble</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to confeſs and put away our <hi>errors,</hi> becauſe we do not own all that you are pleaſed to accuſe us with! p. 113. As to the principle you there refer to, I did confeſs the truth concerning it, Ex. p. 50, and you muſt anſwer it to our great judge, for your inſinuating the contrary here againſt me.</p>
            <p>I am now prepared to anſwer your query, whether I had not forgotten my ſect, when I expreſſed my concern for the fall of New-England from her ancient diſcipline? Ex. p. 92. And you ſay, <q>Why did not his heart ſmite him, and his pen blot out that expreſſion, of his deep concern for New-England, as fallen from its ancient purity and glory, becauſe her mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to now teſtify againſt the corruptions of <hi>ſeparation</hi> and <hi>anabaptiſm,</hi> juſt as the fathers in the firſt churches did?</q> p. 111.</p>
            <p>Anſwer 1. The forgoing account plainly ſhews that they were ſo much blinded by <hi>ſelf,</hi> as to try to juſtify ſuch treatment of diſſenters from <hi>them,</hi> as one of their chief magiſtrates calls <hi>Tyranny, perſecution</hi> and <hi>rigid ways;</hi> and as learned ſaints on the other ſide of the water, veiwed to be ſo, even in their moſt ſolemn exerciſes. Yea the learned Mr. Neal (whom none, that have read his hiſtory of the <hi>puritans</hi> can ſuſpect of being prejudiced in favour of the baptiſts) he does not ſcruple to declare, that in dealing with Mr. Clark and his brethren, they <q>Broke in upon the <hi>natural rights</hi> of mankind, puniſhing men,

               </q> And when Dr. Mather attempted to excuſe a like treatment of the baptiſt church in Boſton, which was formed May 28, 1665, by declaring it to be a violation of the law of the <hi>commonwealth</hi> relating to the <hi>orderly</hi> gathering of churches: which <hi>order</hi> was, not to do it without the approbation of <hi>magiſtrates</hi> and neighbouring <hi>miniſters.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. While they accuſed the baptiſts of <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> they moſt evidently diſcovered a great <hi>bias</hi> and <hi>prepoſſeſſion</hi> againſt them in their own minds. I noted before that Mr. Hooker, and from him Mr. Mitchel, <hi>reſoved</hi> to have an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument able to <hi>remove a mountain,</hi> before they would recede from infant baptiſm. Ex. p. 98. And Mr. Cotton, in a piece he wrote on that ſubject, againſt ſuch as he owns did not, <q>deny magiſtrates, nor predeſtination, nor original ſin; nor maintain free-will in converſion, nor apoſtacy from grace: but only denied the lawful uſe of the baptiſm of children, becauſe it wanteth a word both of commandment and example from the ſcripture.</q> Yea that he was bound to believe that they did this <q>out of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:012655_0111_0F8BBE9F07047E58"/>conſcience, as following the example of the apoſtle:</q> yet he goes on to declare, that he alſo believed, that <hi>ſatan</hi> had <hi>yielded</hi> ſo far in theſe ſtirring times of reformation, as to plead no other argument than what may be urged from that main principle of reformation, <q>That no duty of God's worſhip, nor ordinance of religion is to be adminiſtered in the church, but ſuch as hath juſt warrant from the word of God.</q> And (ſays he) by urging this argument againſt the <q>baptiſm of children, ſatan transformeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf into an angel of light.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Cotton or the <hi>grounds and ends of the baptiſm of children.</hi> Printed 1647. p. 3, 4,</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time a miniſter at Lynn, wrote againſt a number of baptiſt authors; but before he came to any of their arguments, he compares the admitting any <hi>ſcruple</hi> about infant baptiſm, to mother Eve's <hi>admitting</hi> the ſerpent's queſtion, <hi>Hath God ſaid it?</hi> and ſays, <q>Let my advice be grateful to thee thus far, chriſtian reader, to take heed of unneceſſary diſcourſes and diſputes with <hi>ſatanical ſuggeſtions.</hi>—It is not the firſt age and time that ſatanical ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, <hi>Thus it is written,</hi> and <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> hath been propounded.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Thomas Cobbet's <hi>vindication of the covenant, and church eſtate of children.</hi> Printed 1648.

            <p>Thus people were taught, to guard againſt the plaineſt ſcriptures that could be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt infant baptiſm as being from ſatan; and Mr. Cobbet, near the cloſe of his book<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 295.</note> calls it a <hi>a profane trick,</hi> for any to turn their backs
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:012655_0112_0F8BBEA01ADF3620"/>when an infant was going to be ſprinkled, and <hi>blaſphemy</hi> to ſtile that practice antichriſtian.<note n="*" place="bottom">It was doubtleſs in conſequence of ſuch teaching as this that the following law was made in Boſton, 1644, viz.

<p>It is therefore ordered and declared by the court; that if any chriſtian within this juriſdiction, ſhall go about to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and deſtroy the chriſtian faith and religion, by broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maintaining any damnable hereſies: as denying the immortality of the ſoul, or reſurrection of the body, or any ſin to be repented of in the regenerate,—or denying that Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for our ſins,—or ſhall openly condemn or oppoſe the baptizing of infants, or ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely depart the congregation, at the adminiſtration of that ordinance,—or ſhall endeavor to ſeduce others to ANY of the errors or hereſies above mentioned; every ſuch perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing obſtinate therein, after due means of conviction, ſhall be SENTENCED TO BANISHMENT.

            <p>But alas! how dreadfully had ſatan <hi>yielded</hi> when he had <hi>prevailed</hi> with thoſe fathers, to take his weapons of <hi>ſlander</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi> to ſupport an ordinance that they could not find a <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi> for!

            <p n="3">3. Our moſt noted fathers owned themſelves to be <hi>imperfect</hi> (and left us evidence enough of it's being ſo) therefore they ſolemnly charged
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:012655_0113_0F8BBEA26B75C350"/>us, not to ſtop in what they had attained. This I before proved, Ex. p. 102. To which I ſhall now add the words of Mr. Devenport, who fled into Holland from perfecution before he came to our land; and where he <q>Bore witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their <hi>promiſcuous baptiſms,</hi> which (in his account) bordered very near upon a <hi>profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that holy inſtitution. He obſerved, That when a <hi>reformation</hi> of the church has been brought about in any part of the world, it has rarely been afterwards carried on any ſtep farther than the <hi>firſt reformers</hi> did ſucceed in their <hi>firſt</hi> endeavours. He obſerved that as eaſily might the <hi>ark</hi> have been removed from the mountains of <hi>Ararat,</hi> where it firſt grounded, as a people get any ground in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, after and beyond the firſt remove of the reformers. And this obſervation quickned him to embark in a deſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, wherein he might have opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to drive things in the firſt eſſay, as near to the precept and pattern of ſcripture as they could be driven.<note n="*" place="bottom">Magnalia, B. 111. p. 53.</note>
               </q> No wonder then that he bore witneſs here alſo, againſt their degenerating into <hi>promiſcuous baptiſms</hi> in 1662. The effects of which were ſo great by the year 1700, as to cauſe Dr. Mather, (as I before noted Ex. p. 19) to declare, that <q>If the begun <hi>apoſtacy</hi> ſhould proceed as faſt for thirty years,—ſurely it will come to that in New-England, that the <hi>moſt conſcientious</hi> people therein will think themſelves concerned to <hi>gather churches out of churches.</hi>
               </q> How then could my heart ſmite
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012655_0114_0F8BBEA30C1BEA20"/>me for having ſuch a concern! Rather muſt not your's ſmite you for ſaying, <q>The glory of New-England departs, as the modern ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevails; our <hi>fathers being judges?</hi>
               </q> p. 112.</p>
            <p>However, though our difference in ſentiments is great, yet tis time to come to the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral head that we agree in; which is of relating <hi>facts.</hi> You ſay, <q>If they are <hi>true,</hi> he has not <hi>ſlandered</hi> us; but if they are <hi>falſe</hi> he <hi>has:</hi> and upon this hypotheſis I am ready to join iſſue.</q> p. 111. With this I concur, only with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, that a due regard be paid to the golden rule in the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it; which naturally brings us to my ſecond <hi>witneſs,</hi> to prove your doing the contrary before: which was; that None can be willing to have the character of their <hi>whole</hi> denomination taken from evil perſons and things which may be pickt out among them. Then I quoted a paſſage out of your ſermons, to ſhew that you had done ſo to us. Ser. p. 142. Ex. p. 5. You now ſay the quotation <q>Shows that I was not giving the character of the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, but only of individuals.</q> p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. Had you Sir, but have named the individuals, there would have been ſome ſenſe in this anſwer, but ſince you have not done it, we muſt have recourſe to a ſcripture inſtance. It is well known that when an open breach happens, either in church or ſtate, perſons of various characters and ſentiments will reſort to the new party. When the breach between Saul and David came to be known, <hi>every one that was in diſtreſs, and every one that was in debt, and diſcontented, gathered themſelves unto</hi> David, <hi>and he became a Captain over
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:012655_0115_0F8BBEA7E73B26E0"/>them.</hi> Yet when ſuch a character of his party as this was given, viz. <hi>There be many ſervants now a days that break away, every man from his maſter,</hi> it is called <hi>Railing;</hi> and we are told that the perſon who gave it, therein acted according to his name, which ſignifies, a <hi>fool</hi> or <hi>madman.</hi> 1 Sam. 22.2 and 25.10, 14, 25.</p>
            <p>My third witneſs was to ſhew how you had tried to deprive people of hearing and judging for themſelves, and had condemned us without a fair hearing. Ex. p. 5, 6. The ſum of your reply to it is, That what you delivered was by way of warning and advice to your own people, and ſay, <q>As for ſtrangers,—the whole fraternity of ſeparates—they are entirely out of the preſent queſtion</q> p. 20, 21. Yet Sir, you firſt ſpread printed propoſals of ſubſcription for your ſermons, through the country, notifying what you had therein written againſt the <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;</hi> and then the books were publiſhed and diſperſed into all the four governments of New-England, and improved againſt our denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general, before I wrote againſt them, and I never heard of any one man, that took what you had ſaid, in the <hi>limited</hi> ſenſe you would now put upon it, till your reply came out. Which limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſenſe you alſo now fly to, for a ſcreen from my charge, of your injuring the truth in relating of facts. p. 6. We muſt therefore come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. You are forced to own yourſelf guilty of two miſtakes about the ſeparate miniſter in your own town. One is, you ſaid the church ſilenced him: when in truth he ſilenced himſelf. The other is concerning the length of
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012655_0116_0F8BBEA818504DE0"/>time that he was with them. You ſaid, <hi>Leſs than a year;</hi> which ſaying you are now forced to own was more than a year from the truth; tho' you try hard to make out that I was as much or more miſtaken than you was. p. 108. What you advance from the records of that church is entirely in my favour, excepting the date of Mr. Smith's excommunication, and you appear wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to render them doubtful, calling them, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> or <hi>minutes;</hi> and what you chiefly rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a narrative you ſay, <q>Taken from Mr. Smith's own <hi>mouth,</hi> as near as could be <hi>related</hi> by a gentleman of integrity (whoſe letter is in hand, and the <hi>ſubſtance of</hi> it is as follows.</q>) p. 106. So that your chief authority to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine theſe <hi>facts,</hi> by your own account, is what was taken from an aged gentleman's memory, after above 20 years changes in this confuſed world, then wrote as near as another could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and a third gives the public the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of what the ſecond had written. Now I will give you my authorities. One of Mr. Smith's brethren in the miniſtry, who lived by the way between Stonington and Mansfield, in giving me an account of the ſtate of religion in thoſe parts, wrote thus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As for Stonington, brother Smith hath for ſome time denied to adminiſter among them, and <hi>now</hi> hath concluded to return to Mansfield, and hath proceeded <hi>ſo far</hi> as to ſell at Stoning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and bought at Mansfield; but the church unanimouſly againſt his going.</q> This was written on April 17, 1749. Your account makes it a year after his removal before his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunication. Well my account of that is from
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012655_0117_0F8BBEA8F1B25DC8"/>one of the council in which are theſe words. <q>When we were come, and had heard the charge againſt him, as being a covenant-breaker, in that he had forſaken the work God had ſet him to do, namely, of preaching the goſpel, and adminiſtring the ordinances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; he was deſired to give his reaſons why he had ſo done. He gave this anſwer, That there was a want of fellowſhip, but to charge it to the church, or any particular brother he could not: and that was all, as I remember. And then the church declared how they had taken the ſteps preſcribed in the goſpel for his recovery, and all proved ineffectual. We all agreed that it was duty to proceed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic cenſure and excommunication.—The day was the 20th of July; but as to the effect, God has it in his hands, and he orders all things well.</q> This was written the laſt of September, 1750; and I have both of theſe letters in their authors own hand-writing, to ſhew to any who deſire to ſee them. And let it be noted, that they were then wrote in way of intimate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, containing our own language concerning theſe affairs, and not with any deſign of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the world.</p>
            <p>And by theſe accounts it appears, that he was ordained on <hi>December</hi> 10, 1746; but that after he had broken his ſolemn covenant to feed that flock of God, they took the goſpel ſteps with him, and as he did not <hi>hear the church,</hi> he was excommunicated <hi>July</hi> 20, 1750. Yet you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in print, that <q>Him <hi>they</hi> choſe, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>ſilenced,</hi> caſt out of the church, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:012655_0118_0F8BBEA988728190"/>up to ſatan, in <hi>leſs</hi> than <hi>a year.</hi>
               </q> Ser. p. 145. And now, twenty years after, you have collected a reproachful account of that affair from this dilinquent; and yet at the end of it (to avoid the charge of <hi>ſtigmatizing</hi> your breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren) you ſay, <q>I have ONLY rehearſed their deeds—I have ONLY publiſhed their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſpirit, practices, &amp;c. which THEY <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> PROFESSED and acted over in the open view of the world.</q> p. 110 Though but two pages back you was forced to own to the world, that you had publiſhed things againſt them that were not true; and that you was led to do it by <q>Relying upon the <hi>information</hi> of <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> and your own <hi>underſtanding</hi> of that affair.</q>
            </p>
            <p>O Mr. <hi>Fiſh!</hi> how much guilt and trouble would you have eſcaped, if you had honeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all that you have done againſt your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, through a <hi>leaning to your own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and acting contrary to the character of Zion's citizens? Pſal. 15, 3. Iſa. 33.15. May this be a warning and inſtruction to us all, in our future treatment of others!</p>
            <p n="2">2. You Sir charged us with <hi>deſpiſing learning,</hi> and ſaid we had <hi>None</hi> but <hi>unlearned teachers,</hi> and that we did not <hi>uſe means</hi> for obtaining <hi>any better accompliſhments.</hi> Ser. p. 165. And now in order to maintain your charge, you would li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the controverſy to the word <hi>college;</hi> whereas the words in your charge were, ANY <hi>means; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,</hi> AND <hi>ſuperior ſchools.</hi> And when I named two ſons of Mr. Joſiah Cleaveland of Canterbury, that he ſent to college, you aſſert that he did it
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012655_0119_0F8BBEAA5F42C308"/>
               <q>As one of the ſtanding order, long enough <hi>before</hi> he ſeparated.</q> p. 14. while yet you tell us, that the <hi>part</hi> of the church he was of, on Jan. 27, 1743, <q>Declared againſt and went <hi>off from</hi> their former uſage.</q> p. 76.<note n="*" place="bottom">The truth I ſuppoſe is, that the church had not <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly</hi> declared for either platform till then, when a majority voted for Cambridge, and againſt Saybrook, which was a cauſe of their ſeparation.</note> And if you examine you may find, that he did not ſend the laſt of his ſons to college till September, 1744: and as they were both expelled that fall, for meeting with the church they were members of in a place <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the pariſh meeting-houſe; and which the heads of the college de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared in print, that they were obliged to do by your laws. Ex. p. 42, 43. who could be ſo ſtupid as to ſend more ſons there to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled! When that expelling temper was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle over, I mentioned no leſs than ſix inſtances, out of but two towns, of ſeparates ſending their ſons to college. Ex. p. 43. But you preſume to queſtion their doing of it from right motives: and becauſe your party have prevailed to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice ſeveral of thoſe ſons againſt their fathers principles, you advance that as a great proof that their fathers are erroneous, p. 15. And as I ſpoke of ſome of our paſtors having ſkill in the learned tongues, you name one of them, who at his earneſt requeſt was diſmiſſed from Norwich, and you ſay he has <q>Diſtinguiſhed himſelf, to the honor of truth &amp; <hi>goſpel order,</hi> by a public reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon himſelf for his error, in promoting ſeparations from the ſtanding churches, ſo much as he has done; and was ſome months
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012655_0120_0F8BBEAB0D666798"/>ago ordained by regular miniſters, over a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular church and congregation in Plainfield.</q> p. 15.</p>
            <p>Reply, I learn that the miniſters did extort from him ſome general reflections upon ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet the <hi>order</hi> that he was ſettled in was; dropping the old <hi>conſtitution,</hi> and beginning anew by a verbal relation of experiences; not uſing the civil law for his ſupport, and not uſing notes in his preaching. And I am informed, that he lately aſſiſted in ordaining a miniſter in your vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who appears to be a man of <hi>ſpiritual gifts,</hi> though he has no more of college-learning than we had. And whether this can convince us that we were wrong in ſeparating from <hi>your conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that we might introduce <hi>ſuch goſpel order</hi> (and which now ſpreads in your colony) let the reader judge! You cloſe this article with telling your readers, that you had <hi>ſufficiently proved</hi> your charge againſt us, but if any thing more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>language</hi> of my book may ſupply the place of <hi>many witneſſes.</hi> p. 15. I am content to refer the matter to that teſt; for I truſt it has appeared, and will appear to the end, that God has given me a real regard for <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> but a hatred of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>ſophiſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In opening your conſtitution I mentioned the trouble that Norwich repreſentatives met with for their oppoſing their miniſters attempts to bring in the Saybrook ſcheme, and ſaid that, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many councils, and much fatigue, a <hi>ſum of money</hi> prevailed with that miniſter to quit his place. Ex. p. 29. You now ſay, The ſum of money was <hi>only</hi> for his temporal intereſt in the town. p. 72. To which I reply, that I had no
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:012655_0121_0F8BBEABCCFAC4E8"/>thought of blaming him for felling his eſtate there, thought I had an account of that from the ſame hands that I had the other; but as I find from the town records, that upon reſigning his office, he made a demand of old arearages, beyond what the town judged to be any ways his due, I ſuppoſe that from thence it was taken that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſum was given him to quit his place. This is the cleareſt light I can as yet gain in the caſe. I am willing to have every miſtake rectified, and that things may appear as they are. Had that been your temper Sir, would you have ſaid A <hi>council.</hi> p. 72? as if he had been diſmiſſed by the calling only of <hi>one</hi> council; when in truth they had them year after year, from ſoon after the introduction of the Saybrook plan in 1708, till that miniſter reſigned his office on Auguſt 31, 1716. And would not an impartial diſpoſition alſo have prevented, a long deſcant that you there add, upon Mr. Tennant's <hi>language,</hi> in order to turn it againſt us; when I expreſsly told you, that it was his <hi>reaſoning</hi> and not his language that I approved of? Ex. p. 33. At the ſame time you paſs over in ſilence what I brought againſt you from Mr. Edwards, which I as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told you I preferred before the other. Is this the <hi>learning</hi> you plead ſo much for!</p>
            <p n="4">4. You ſpend ſix pages upon the facts that I related concerning Canterbury, on which you reflect that <q>'Tis ſad that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> lays no reſtraint on his pen!</q> p. 79. And you ſay, <q>This may ſerve as a general caution to his readers, how they receive and rely upon his account of things in other parts of his book,</q> p. 80. And give no hint that I
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012655_0122_0F8BBEAC8658CD38"/>took every article which you controvert, from an author in that town, who was acquainted with all theſe affairs, and publickly appealed to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and courts for the truth of his narrative; and which I never heard diſputed till your reply came out, while you keep your author's name concealed, who condemns me upon his preſent <hi>rememberance.</hi> p. 77. As far as I could now gain light from the ſeveral accounts that are given, I have corrected and opened the true ſtate of that ſeparation; but whether I can with ſafety retract any particular circumſtance that is now diſputed, which was publiſhed 20 years ago, by a man of credit that I was acquainted with, only upon the <hi>memory</hi> of one that I knew not, let the reader judge! And I ſhall cloſe theſe facts with remarking, that you catch at my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>After</hi> the church withdrew, the conſociation was called and ordained Mr. Cogſwell, Ex. p. 38. as a proof that they did not <hi>cauſe that diviſion.</hi> Rom. 16.17.18. p. 84. But Sir, I proved by the plain teſtimony of the heads of your col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, that his <hi>preaching to the pariſh</hi> (which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the church to withdraw) was <hi>with the ſpecial direction</hi> of thoſe miniſters. Ex. p. 42. And what a miſerable ſhift is it, for you to catch at the word <hi>after,</hi> to prove that they did nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!</p>
            <p>And now Sir, let us ſum up the whole affair. You have accuſed me with uſing falſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but how have you proved it? The firſt that I obſerve, is from my naming ſome of our miniſters, who had been men of note in the places where they lived; you repreſent that from thence I argued, that they had college learning
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012655_0123_0F8BBEADAE518758"/>(as if all learning was confined to colleges) and you form a ridiculous ſyllogiſm for me according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. p. 13. But whether you or I are rendered moſt ridiculous by it, let the reader judge. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when I obſerved that you <hi>miſtook</hi> the rule itſelf through your book; my argument from it was, That nothing leſs could be expected, than falſe actings upon a falſe rule. Ex. p. 5. That is when a man is ſeduced into a <hi>crooked</hi> way, it cannot be expected that he will go <hi>ſtrait</hi> in it. But you repreſent my argument to be, that you could not have an <hi>honeſt heart.</hi> p. 19. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I expreſsly ſaid, <q>I deſire always to avoid the evil of judging the <hi>counſels</hi> of others <hi>hearts,</hi> and to judge righteouſly according to what is made manifeſt.</q> And I went on to tell what I ſuppoſed it was that <hi>blinded</hi> you. Ex. p. 5, 6. And I ſtill ſuppoſe that you have been thus blinded, and moved to uſe ſhifts and evaſions to try to clear yourſelf, and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to cenſure your opponent. Thus when I ſaid, you had condemned <hi>us</hi> without a fair hearing; you reply <q>They were out of my juriſdiction. I had no buſineſs to call <hi>them</hi> to a hearing.</q> p. 21. As if I had ſpoken of a <hi>perſonal audience:</hi> when you know that I expreſsly referred to what we had <hi>publiſhed</hi> to the world, which you had paid no regard to. Ex. p. 6. So when I mentioned what the falſe teachers at Corinth <hi>gloried</hi> in, and (to confirm it) what the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>ſuffered</hi> from them. Ex. p. 25, 26. You ſhuffle the matter over, till you would make your readers believe, that I held, that thoſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>glorying</hi> was in what the ſaints <hi>ſuffered</hi> from them. And though you will not allow that
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012655_0124_0F8BBEAE35292180"/>Chriſt gave any orders to his apoſtles to preach freely, yet you have proved that Paul did preach ſo; and you carry it, that his deſign therein was to "cut off occaſion of <hi>offence.</hi>" p. 68, 69. But I have no thought of his being afraid of <hi>offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> thoſe teachers; for what he was evidently concerned about was to prevent any occaſion or handle for them to do miſchief. Once more, When I obſerved that the epiſtles to Timothy and Titus were to direct miniſters concerning their behaviour <hi>in the church,</hi> not <hi>over it.</hi> I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went on to explain my meaning; and that by <hi>over it,</hi> I meant a diſtinct power or juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>above</hi> the church, inſtead of acting <hi>with</hi> them in trying miniſters. Ex. p. 39, 41. But you Sir, quote ſeveral texts wherein the word <hi>over</hi> is uſed to deſcribe miniſters work as <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> or <hi>guides</hi> to the church, which perfectly agrees with my ſenſe of the word <hi>in</hi> it, as being <hi>leaders</hi> therein; while you go on, (as before obſerved) to aſſert, that what the <hi>Spirit ſaith unto the churches</hi> was "ſpoken to and <hi>of</hi> the miniſters;" and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed till you repreſent, that I held that letters of commendation went <hi>to</hi> and <hi>from</hi> the <hi>brotherhood</hi> and <hi>not</hi> the <hi>miniſters,</hi> though I plainly ſaid the church <hi>with</hi> them. p. 80—83.</p>
            <p>And ſo I think it is lamentably evident. that you have proceeded in a crooked way through theſe writings, both as to arguments, and facts: while I have not been able to diſcover that I have uſed one falſe argument againſt you; and the chief miſtakes that I have found are, my writing The form, inſtead of A form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and my being miſinformed about one circumſtance at Norwich.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:012655_0125_0F8BBEB551181558"/>
As for temper; you talk much of my want of <hi>modeſty,</hi> but the two plaineſt inſtances to ſhew what you mean by it, that I have obſerved, are my appearing ſo boldly as I have, againſt you about the learned tongue, and againſt the Windham miniſters upon the parable of the tares. p. 55.87. which caſes as they have been plainly ſtated I leave with the reader. But you ſay, I have uſed <q>Unſufferable PERTNESS, ſurpriſing CONFIDENCE, and a haughty air of ASSURANCE.</q> p. 123. To which I reply, that I have ſo often ſeen people loſt in a wilderneſs of words, ſo as to take wrong for right, and right for wrong, that I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to come as <hi>pert</hi> and direct to the caſe in hand as I could; and as the ſufferings of Chriſt's ſervants formerly, cauſed many of the <hi>brethren</hi> to wax <hi>confident,</hi> boldly to ſpeak the word <hi>without fear;</hi> I ſhall not derry my belief, that this unworthy creature has been freely favoured with ſomething of the ſame influence; and alſo with a meaſure of that <hi>aſſurance</hi> of <hi>underſtanding</hi> in goſpel myſteries, which the apoſtle was earneſt we ſhould have, to guard us againſt <hi>philoſophy and vain deceit.</hi> Phil. 1.14. Col. 2.1—8. If my confidence has in any inſtance gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my evidence, I am ſorry you had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of it. You add, that <q>This offence is aggravated by a total want of <hi>good manners,</hi> and <hi>civil language,</hi> through a great part of your book.</q> p. 123. To which I ſhall ſay, that though I never thought myſelf a pattern of manners, yet in theſe affairs, I'll venture to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare notes with you. In your appendix where you profeſſedly ſet yourſelf to collect out of my whole book, <hi>expreſſions</hi> moſt <hi>void of decency,</hi> the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:012655_0126_0F8BBEB62BF2CB20"/>hardeſt names you have found are theſe, viz. I cloſed my remarks upon your applying the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our Saviour received by the holy Ghoſt, Iſa. 50.4. to what is <hi>learned</hi> in your colleges, with ſaying, Did any <hi>Phariſee</hi> ever abuſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to impoſe upon people, worſe than this? Ex. p. 44. And when you appealed to the <hi>Lord of conſcience,</hi> whether it was not <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> and <hi>diſobedience,</hi> all founded on <hi>weakneſs,</hi> rather than <hi>pure conſcience</hi> that induced the ſeparates to refuſe to pay your ſalary? Ser. p. 164, I ſaid, Does he or his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren take Paul's advice and direction, about dealing with <hi>weak brethren?</hi> or rather is not the liberty which they would allow, juſt the ſame with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s,—<hi>Go ye, ſerve the Lord; only let your flocks and herds be ſtayed?</hi> Ex. p. 80.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the two plaineſt proofs, in their "native dreſs," of my want of good manners, that you have found in my whole book, and both of them delivered by way of query: whereas I have already referred you to one paſſage (among many) in your ſermons, wherein you Sir, as a public miniſter, deliver it not as a queſtion, but a ſtrong aſſertion, that <q>'Twas a <hi>falſe ſpirit,</hi> and a <hi>falſe religion</hi> that made the ſeparation among US, a device of <hi>ſatan</hi> that old <hi>ſerpent</hi> the <hi>devil.</hi>
               </q> And in your preſent piece, which tells us in its introduction, that <q>There is not the leaſt need of one <hi>bitter word,</hi> nor unkind <hi>reflection,</hi> nor can there ANY <hi>purpoſe</hi> be anſwered thereby, but <hi>venting the corruption of nature,</hi>
               </q> p. 3. Yet in order to ward off the ſentences I had quoted from thoſe eminent authors, Owen and Franck, you ſay,— <q>Our real character is as different from that which he has ſet up, as the true
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:012655_0127_0F8BBEB656FDDD40"/>proteſtant churches are from the antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian: or as the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was from the <hi>Pope</hi> of Rome; or the gentle <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Backus.</hi> And I know not of a more ſtriking contraſt.</q> p. 102. Rather you ſhould have ſaid, you did not then think of any; for a more ſtriking contraſt came afterwards to mind, and then out it comes; which is that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Arch-angel</hi> and the <hi>devil.</hi> Yea, and all this has not <hi>vented nature</hi> enough; but (as if the witch of Endor was come again, to bring up the dead to condemn the living) you aſſert that, <hi>I am compared</hi> BY Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> to animals, too nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for dogs! And you go on to tell me, that all this <q>correction is <hi>gentle</hi> compared with the offence.</q> p. 124, 125.</p>
            <p>If all theſe <hi>words</hi> are gentle, I know not what you would have more but <hi>blows</hi> from the ſecular arm. However it all ſerves ſtill further to open the caſe we are upon. It had got to be cuſtomary in our land, to have miniſters <hi>perſons</hi> ſo much in <hi>admiration,</hi> as to allow them almoſt all the power in the admiſſion both of miniſters and members, and to treat them with ſuch reverence as ſcarcely to oppoſe them in any thing. Therefore when ſome were raiſed up to appear boldly againſt their corruptions, they had recourſe to many ſhifts and evaſions, to hide the true ſtate of the controverſy, while they <hi>vented their natures</hi> as you have done, by calling the worſt names, and uſing the moſt odious compariſons, that their <hi>learning</hi> afforded. And I am bold in it, that ſuch kind of <hi>manners</hi> from men of your ſort of education, was not only a great cauſe of our ſeparation, but alſo has done more towards prejudiceing peoples minds againſt college-learning, than all thoſe you call lay-teachers could have done if they had
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:012655_0128_0F8BBEB70931BE98"/>tried. And had I not been clearly convinced hereof, and ſeen what ſtumbling-blocks had been laid thereby, and alſo found the weight of that command, <hi>Go through, go through the gates,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 62.10. I ſhould by no means have purſued theſe matters ſo far as I have done. But here you tell us, you will leave it to the judicious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <q>whether he has ſkilfully and faithfully done the ſervice; or whether he has not caſt <hi>twenty ſtones</hi> at the <hi>prophets</hi> of the Lord, his <hi>miniſters,</hi> to <hi>one</hi> that he has removed out of the way of <hi>his people?</hi>
               </q> p. 17. As I have ſeriouſly conſidered of this affair, I freely join in referring of it to all chriſtian people; and if any can ſhew me that I have caſt one ſtone at any ſuch perſon, my concern ſhall be to improve the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that preſents, to make them the beſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I can. I know that my aim has not been againſt any human perſon, but againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel</hi> which calleth herſelf a <hi>propheteſs,</hi> that has been <hi>ſuffered</hi> to <hi>teach</hi> among the churches, and to <hi>ſeduce Chriſt's ſervants.</hi> And I deſire never to ſpare her in the leaſt, till ſhe ſinks like a <hi>ſtone,</hi> never to <hi>riſe</hi> more. Jer. 51.64. Rev. 2.20. By which I underſtand all that <hi>myſtery of iniquity</hi> by which any are <hi>ſeduced,</hi> to ſet up or gratify ſelf under the cloak of religion, with methods of <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> towards others. Which methods are uſed by ſome to as bad purpoſes, under the name of Great <hi>ſpirituality,</hi> as they are by others under a pretence of <hi>learning.</hi> And if a Peter or a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, are carried away with <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> they ought to be withſtood <hi>to the face,</hi> and the ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, argues not any want of reſpect, either to their perſons, or their office, but the contrary.

You Sir, talk much of how you and your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſtood by the work and cauſe of God when we ſeparated, and ſay, The breach of <hi>peace</hi> began on our ſide, p. 18, 126. But ſurely the nature of his work, is to bring ſouls to the knowledge of their loſt condition, and of the only way of help through Jeſus Chriſt, and to follow him in all his ways, and not to follow the <hi>voice of ſtrangers.</hi> And we followed the miniſters who were friends to that work, till they turned and ſaid a <hi>confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi> with the enemies of it, and joined in the manner you have done, to bear down all that would not conform to the <hi>conſtitution</hi> which I have now expoſed; ſo that we were bro't to the neceſſity, of either yielding to that <hi>yoke of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> or elſe to ſeparate from them. And the ſame argument was often uſed then that you uſe now, viz. That the ſeven churches of Aſia were as corrupt as your's, who ('twas ſaid) were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to reformation, but not to a ſeparation. But how falacious is this argument? We know they were firſt called to a reformation; to <hi>repent and do their firſt works,</hi> and not to ſuffer <hi>deceitful</hi> teachers among them, who like <hi>Balaam</hi> loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs. And their Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them, that if they did not <hi>repent quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he would <hi>remove the candleſtick out of his place,</hi> and <hi>fight againſt them with the ſword of his mouth.</hi> Rev. 2.5, 16. Which I believe he has done, and is now doing to your churches.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX, Containing a few remarks upon the controverſy about baptiſm; occaſioned by Mr. <hi>Eliſha Fiſh</hi>'s late ſermon from Gen. IX. 27.</head>
            <p>DR. <hi>Gill</hi> obſerves, that there has been ſcarce any thing wrote by us theſe fifty years but in our own defence; our Pedobaptiſt brethren being continually the aggreſſors, and firſt movers of the controverſy; they ſeem as if they were not ſatisfied with what has been done on their ſide; and therefore are always attempting, either to put the controverſy upon a new foot, or to throw the old arguments into a new form; and even ſay the ſame things over and over again, to make their minds, and the minds of their people eaſy, if poſſible. But this is our caſe; if we reply to what is written againſt us, then we are litigious perſons, and lovers of controverſy; though we only riſe up in our own vindication, for which ſurely we are not to be blamed; and if we make no reply, then what is written is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable by us, and we are triumphed over.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dr. Gill's anſwer to a piece called,</hi> The baptiſm of in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fants a reaſonable ſervice, founded upon ſcripture and apoſtolic tradition. <hi>p. 3, 4.</hi>
               </note> Which obſervation is as applicable to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:012655_0131_0F8BBEB9C38CD040"/>as to that in which it was wrote; for Mr, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Fiſh firſt began the controverſy with us in his nine ſermons; yet becauſe I, at the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of friends, made ſome reply to him, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes me with ſetting up myſelf as cenſor gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, &amp;c. And 'tis likely the ſame temper will renew the accuſation, for my yielding to a like importunity, in taking ſome notice of the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet before me; which is intitled, <q>Japheth dwelling in the tents of Shem; or infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm vindicated, in a diſcourſe, the ſubſtance of which was delivered in Upton, January 5, 1772; with objections anſwered, by <hi>Eliſha Fiſh,</hi> A. M.</q> I ſay, ſome notice; for I ſhall not go over all the arguments again, which I have already anſwered in the foregoing diſcourſe, but refer the reader thereto, and ſhall now only make a few remarks on their general manner of managing the controverſy.</p>
            <p>After Job's long diſpute with his friends, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah appeared with this ſolemn demand, <hi>Who is this that darkeneth counſel by</hi> WORDS <hi>without</hi> KNOWLEDGE! Job. 38.2. And a very great evil that the Corinthians were reproved for, was their uttering <hi>words</hi> that were not <hi>eaſy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,</hi> but like a trumpet which gave an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſound.</hi> 1 Cor. 14.8, 9. Yet one of the greateſt maſters of learning in our nation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that commonly the moſt <hi>material words</hi> in controverſy, upon which the argument turns, are ſo uſed; though ſays he, <q>one who ſhould ſpeak thus, in the affairs and buſineſs of the world, and call 7 ſometimes 8, and ſometimes nine, as beſt ſerved his advantage, would preſently have clapped upon him one of the two names
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:012655_0132_0F8BBEBA4C0AE6A8"/>men conſtantly are diſguſted with; and yet in arguing and learned conteſts, the ſame ſort of proceeding paſſes commonly for wit and learning: but to me, it appears a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, than the miſplacing of counters, in the caſting up a debt, and the cheat the greater, by how much truth is of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and value than money.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lock's eſſay on underſtanding, B. 3. C. 10. S. 5.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>With grief of heart we often ſee this to be the caſe, with the advocates for infant baptiſm. Could they once be brought to a diſtinct and ſteady meaning in three words, the controverſy would ſoon come to an end. I mean the words, covenant, grace and promiſe. It is evident that in the old teſtament, to be in Abraham's <hi>covenant,</hi> meant the ſame as to be members of that church, and under obligation to conform to all its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Natural birth brought his ſeed into the church, and being in, all their males muſt needs be circumciſed as ſoon as they were <hi>clean.</hi> Levit. 12, 2, 3. <hi>And all their males</hi> were requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep the paſſover in the firſt month, if <hi>clean</hi> and not in a journey; and if that were the caſe, they might not neglect it any longer than the next month, upon the penalty of being <hi>cut off from their people,</hi> Gen. 17.14. Num. 9.9—13. Deut. 16.16. and do any hold the <hi>covenant</hi> to be ſo with us? Indeed ſome of our moſt noted fathers ſay, <q>We know of NO ſtronger argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for infant baptiſm than this, That <hi>church members</hi> are to be baptized.<note n="†" place="bottom">Magnalia B. 5. p. 79.</note>
               </q> And from the ſcriptures juſt now cited, 'tis evident,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:012655_0133_0F8BBEBF777FA828"/>that Abraham's ſeed <hi>born in the church,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be <hi>cut off</hi> from it, if they were not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed at the appointed time; and muſt we then take our opponents, by <hi>grace</hi> to mean <hi>nature;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Directly contrary to having, NO <hi>confidence in the fleſh.</hi> Phil. 3.3.</note> and that <hi>nature</hi> brings their ſeed into the covenant of <hi>grace!</hi> And that though the goſpel church was firſt conſtituted of members who were <hi>born not of blood</hi> nor of the <hi>will of man</hi> but OF GOD. John. 1.13! yet that ſince the eſtabliſhment of chriſtianity, <hi>blood</hi> and the <hi>will of man,</hi> can bring members into the church! But why then do not all theſe members come to the ordinance of the ſupper, as the Jews did to the paſſover? our author's anſwer is, That the paſſover was temporary and <hi>legal,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Circumciſion was as <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> as the paſſover, and is much oftener ſpoken of as ſuch. Rom. 2.25. Gal. 5.2, 3. and 6.13.</note> and he ſays, <q>If it had been the will of the great Head of the church, not to have appointed any goſpel paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or holy ſupper for his church, that would not have altered the privileges of the <hi>promiſes</hi> relating to baptiſm in Abraham's covenant, one way or the other.</q> p. 37. 38.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, that if he had not appointed baptiſm nor the ſupper, it would not have altered the <hi>promiſes</hi> to Abraham, for there is no mention of either of thoſe ordinances therein; but 'tis certain that the promiſes to him did inſure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the church in the line of his poſterity till the <hi>ſeed Chriſt</hi> ſhould come, <hi>to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were made.</hi> Gal. 3.16. And till then their eſtabliſhment in all the <hi>legal ceremonies</hi> was
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:012655_0134_0F8BBEC207B8FD60"/>
               <hi>as God promiſed</hi> him. Deut. 29.13. But when Chriſt came, all the children of Abraham's <hi>fleſh,</hi> who believed not in him, were broken off from the church of God, while the <hi>children of promiſe,</hi> the <hi>election of grace</hi> were retained therein; and a <hi>new covenant</hi> was made with them <hi>not according</hi> to that made with their fathers; and many of the children of Japheth were <hi>perſuaded,</hi> and graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in among them, and <hi>ſtood</hi> there <hi>by faith.</hi> Rom. 9.7.8 &amp; 11. and 5.17.20. Heb. 8. All which may plainly teach us, that to be in <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> means the ſame as being in the church, both in the old teſtament, and in the new; and that <hi>grace</hi> means <hi>free ſalvation</hi> by Chriſt, whom Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and other believers looked to, through the ſhadows of the law, and who is now beheld with open face through the glaſs of the goſpel; and that the bleſſings that God <hi>promiſed</hi> to Abraham, which are come on the Gentiles, are <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins,</hi> and the influences of the holy <hi>ſpirit;</hi> which <hi>promiſe is given to them that believe.</hi> Acts 2.38, 39, 41. Gal. 3.13, 14, 22.</p>
            <p>This is evidently the ſtrait line of truth, but the crooked way of <hi>deceitful</hi> philoſophy and men's <hi>traditions,</hi> as it carried Peter and Barnabas away with <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> ſo it has carried this author (let him be ever ſo pious) into the following evils.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>add</hi> to God's word; for that word calls the covenant that formed Abraham's family into a church, <hi>The covenant of circumciſion.</hi> Acts 7.8. And as all know that circumciſion is out of date, it would appear the evident conſequence, that the covenant which it gave name to is alſo <hi>taken away,</hi> and a better one <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in it's room. Heb. 8, 6. and 10.9. Had not men preſumed
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:012655_0135_0F8BBEC2EA6E55D0"/>to add the name <hi>grace</hi> to it, on which addition moſt of their arguments for infant baptiſm turn. And to ſupport this they make another additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for where the word ſays of Abraham, <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> the <hi>ſign</hi> of circumciſion, a <hi>ſeal</hi> of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>the faith which he had.</hi> Rom. 4.11. This writer is ſo daring as to aſſert, that Abraham <q>has ſet us the moſt public example in <hi>applying</hi> the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſeed, at God's command; which ſeal now is baptiſm.</q> p. 29. In which, unleſs he can make Abraham's <hi>receiving</hi> what <hi>he had</hi> faith in, to be the ſame as <hi>applying</hi> to others what they had no faith about, he will be found guilty of adding to God's word. Yea he not only adds what is not there, but 2. He alſo denies what is there; for he over and over denies, there being any <hi>expreſs</hi> word againſt bringing infants into the church now, as they did among the Jews. p. 13, 33, 39, 40. Notwithſtanding God's expreſs declaration, That the new covenant is <hi>not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to the covenant that took in profeſſors by <hi>houſholds,</hi> and that the extent of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, that ALL ſhall <hi>know him,</hi> from the LEAST to the greateſt. Heb. 8.11. Which declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our great author tries to evade by aſſerting, That the apoſtle here did not refer to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Abraham, <q>which had the token of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion annexed to it.</q> p. 15. And though he owns that the uſual language of the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, repent and believe and be baptized, yet he ſays, <q>We do not diſcover the leaſt oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the practice of infant baptiſm, which takes place and follows upon our viſible and credible profeſſion.</q> p. 34. But ſtay; how
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:012655_0136_0F8BBEC318F22390"/>does it follow? Abraham had no warrant to circumciſe one perſon, but ſuch as were either <hi>born in his houſe,</hi> or <hi>bought with his money.</hi> Gen. 17.13, 23. The firſt order that was given to bring <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to circumciſion by <hi>houſholds,</hi> was on <hi>the day</hi> that Iſrael came out of Egypt, Exod. 12.48. and the covenant which Jeremiah propheſied of, and which Paul applies to the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is placed in <hi>expreſs</hi> oppoſition to what was done on <hi>that day.</hi> Therefore all thoſe who bring any family to baptiſm upon the faith of the head of it, act directly againſt theſe ſcriptures; and in order to keep themſelves in countenance in that way, they go on, 3. To abuſive treatment of thoſe who will not go with them. This writer repreſents that our ſentiments, would make Paul to contradict himſelf, which none but a <hi>prejudiced</hi> or <hi>infidel</hi> mind will admit. p. 16. He tells us of <hi>incredible preſumption;</hi> of oppoſing the <hi>exact ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment</hi> of his text, and that thoſe who <q>oppoſe infant baptiſm, are in danger of <hi>fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God</hi> (at unawares).</q> p. 23.24. Of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unanſwerable objection in the minds of the Jews; and of too much reſembling <hi>them</hi> in <hi>their unbelief.</hi> p. 25. Of offering <hi>violence to the ſcriptures.</hi> p. 28. Of <hi>horrible</hi> ſentiments. p. 38. And all to enforce his advice, to <hi>ſhun</hi> the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and practices of ſuch as <hi>oppoſe</hi> his opinion about <hi>children.</hi> p. 39. Nay all this is not enough, but 4. He muſt add one of the worſt errors of popery; I mean that of the ſacraments <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring grace by the operation or work done.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Here note, I don't charge Mr. <hi>F.</hi> with knowingly holding this error; he declares the contrary. p. 38. and would have it, that when the fathers called baptiſm <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> they uſed the thing ſignified for the ſign. p. 43. But the caſe is evidently not ſo. I readily own that circumciſion under the law, and baptiſm under the goſpel, were both ſigns of Chriſt's death, and of regeneration by his grace; and as Abraham had the thing ſignified before he received circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, it was a ſeal to him of the faith he had; and at God's command he applied the ſign of what was then future, to ſuch as had not the thing ſignified wrought in them: but 'tis in vain for any to ſay. They ſtand to act for their children as Abraham did for his, unleſs they can prove that a <hi>national church</hi> is to ſpring from them, and that a Saviour is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to come out of it. Baptiſm is not a type of a future crucifixion of the Saviour, but a token of that great event which is paſt, and that we <hi>are crucified with him,</hi> and HAVE <hi>put him on.</hi> Gal. 2.20. and 3.27. And to put this ſign upon our children, unleſs we imagine with Origen, that BY it the inward change is wrought, is to do ſo much toward making our children hypocrites. The Weſtminſter-catechiſm calls baptiſm, a ſign of our <hi>engrafting into Chriſt,</hi> therefore to put this ſign on any before we have ſome goſpel evidence that they have been made <hi>dead to the law,</hi> what is it but <hi>adultery!</hi> Rom. 7.3.4.</note> For
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012655_0137_0F8BBEC3CB044060"/>as a full evidence for infant baptiſm, he from Mr. Boſtwick, gives us Origen's words that <q>It is becauſe <hi>by</hi> the ſacrament of baptiſm the <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of our birth is taken away,</hi> that infants are baptized.</q> p. 44. Origen is the firſt man that any of them have ever been able to produce, who expreſsly appeared for infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and his argument to ſupport it is, becauſe he ſays, BY it the <hi>pollution of our birth is taken away.</hi> But Tertullian in the ſame age oppoſed the practice, as our author owns, p. 45. And yet in p. 47, he would have his readers believe, that there was "No diſpute about the point," for more than a thouſand years after the apoſtles. And then to bind the whole he ſays, <q>Infant baptiſm is valid, and agreeable to the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012655_0138_0F8BBEC48CFD5910"/>of Chriſt; or elſe there neither is nor CAN BE any regular baptiſm in the church, to the end of the world. p. 48.</q> That is, If in times of antichriſtian darkneſs, they did <hi>change the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi> and the change did prevail ſo far that <hi>none uprightly and openly appeared</hi> againſt it,<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 24.5. Micah 7.2.</note> then we can never reform and come right again! Whether a ſtronger argument than this againſt reformation, was ever brought out of the ſmoke of the pit or not, is left to the readers judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>myſtery of iniquity</hi> began to work in the apoſtles days, 2 Theſ. 2.7. and had prevailed ſo far when infant baptiſm was introduced, as alſo to bring infants to the Lord's ſupper, as a <hi>ſaving ordinance:</hi> and likewiſe to uſe the ſign of the croſs, Godfathers, renouncing the devil and his works, exorciſms, dipping the head thrice in reference to the three perſons in the Trinity, conſecrating the water, anointing with oil, &amp;c. at baptiſm; for all which Dr. Gill has produced plain and <hi>expreſs</hi> preofs, out of the ſame fathers that are quoted for infant baptiſm, and of as <hi>early</hi> date; and he obſerves, that the reaſonings for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm that are uſed <q>From the teſtimony of the antients, the <hi>difficulty</hi> of an innovation, and the <hi>eaſineſs</hi> of its detection, may be applied to all and each of theſe rites. Wherefore, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever receives infant baptiſm upon the foot of <hi>apoſtolic tradition,</hi> and upon ſuch <hi>proof</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> as is given of it, if he is an <hi>honeſt</hi> man; I ſay again, if he is an <hi>honeſt</hi> man, he ought to give into the practice of ALL theſe rites

            <p>Dr. Owen tells us, that the proteſtants in their ſeparation from the church of Rome, proceeded upon theſe <hi>general principles.</hi> 
               <q>1. That the word of God is a perfect rule of faith and religious worſhip. 2. That chriſtian people were not tied up to blind obedience unto church guides, but were not only at liberty, but alſo obliged to judge for themſelves, as unto all things that they were to believe and practiſe in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the worſhip of God. 3. That there was not any catholic, viſible, organical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing church, traduced by <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> into that of Rome, whence all power and order was to be <hi>derived.</hi>—They could acknowledge NO ſuch church ſtate in the Roman church, nor the derivation of ANY power and order from it. So far as there is a <hi>declerſion</hi> from <hi>this principle,</hi> ſo far the cauſe of <hi>the reformation</hi> is weakned,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:012655_0140_0F8BBEC676C28248"/>and the principal reaſon of <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the Roman church is rejected.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Owen on the <hi>original of evangelical churches.</hi> p. 291, 294, 297.</note>

            <p>From whence I leave the reader to judge, what cauſe we had for a new ſeparation; and ſhall cloſe the whole with obſerving, That denying the intire depravity of nature, and the abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of grace, and holding that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes threof are connected with the deſires and doings of natural men, and that their final ſtate turns upon their well or ill improving their free-will power, and that a man may finally fall from grace received, are the dregs of popery, which ſince the reformation have been called Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm; while excluding, or diſregarding the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the divine law, is Antinomianiſm: both of which names the principle of beliver's baptiſm has often been reproached with; while yet we are conſtantly complained of becauſe we will not be either Arminians or Antinomians, or both of them. For what is all the noiſe we hear, of our children's being in covenant, or elſe that if they die in infancy we can have no hope of them, without it be from the unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted (i. e. ſovereign) mercy of God? And that (either by birth or by men's <hi>works</hi> in baptizing of them) they are in the <hi>covenant of grace</hi> and children of <hi>promiſe,</hi>

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with Peter's limitation of the <hi>promiſe</hi> to <hi>even as many as God ſhall call,</hi> and what warrant can we have from all this, to baptize any till we have ſome evidence that they are <hi>called</hi> ſo as to <hi>receive the promiſe of the Spirit,</hi> unleſs we will dare to add to God's word!</note> till by their own

Gal. 3.10, 13, 14. I believe God can and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does ſanctify infants from the womb: but evidence that they have faith is neceſſary before baptiſm.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, our apponents hold it to be the law of Chriſt, that all believers ſhould bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize their children, and yet will call thoſe <hi>regular</hi> baptiſts, who will join in their churches, without bringing their infants, or acting in the baptiſm themſelves, as they believe the law of Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects. And though our opponents hold with us, that it is the law of Chriſt, that all ſhould be baptized before they come to the Lord's table; yet many of them accuſe us of rigidneſs, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching all but ourſelves, &amp;c. only becauſe we
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:012655_0142_0F8BBECC1DC07098"/>will not meet ſuch perſons there, as we cannot believe in our conſcience to be baptized accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Lord's direction. If any on our ſide are found to uſe any deceit or violence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the other denomination, or any method con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſpeaking the truth in love, let them be corrected or puniſhed according to the demerit of their crime; but if the truth breaks up chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it highly concerns all that belong to them, to awake and conſider what churches they are. We have two ſorts of ſeparation deſcribed in holy writ: One is produced by an exalting of ſelf above others; the other by ſuch an adherence to divine rule as to part with thoſe who will not conform to it. Iſa. 65.5. Pſalm 119.115. And unleſs our pedobaptiſt fathers and brethren can convince us that HE who was <hi>faithful</hi> in his houſe, and worthy of more glory than Moſes, has yet left things at ſuch looſe ends, as only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the uſe of water in the ſacred name, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out determining whether it ſhould be by ſprinkling, pouring or burying, but has left that to be determined by men's conſciences: I ſay till they can convince us of this, all their noiſe about the evil of re-baptiſing and cloſe communion, cannot ſatisfy our minds, that we can duly regard the law of Chriſt, if we come to his table with any who have not been <hi>buried with him in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that this author, after owning that in ſcripture we <q>Have <hi>no expreſs</hi> account about the baptizing of the infant ſeed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:</q> p. 32. yet tells us of <q>ſtraining at a gnat and ſwallowing a camel,</q> becauſe we will
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:012655_0143_0F8BBECEAEB44C80"/>not admit that practice upon the covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. p. 33. But as 'tis evident to us, that men have <hi>changed the ordinance,</hi> from burying to ſprinkling; and, from thoſe who are taught and believe, to applying it to ſubjects before they are capable of being taught, without any divine warrant at all; let this change be called a gnat or a camel, or what elſe they pleaſe, yet I truſt it will ever appear too big to be ſwallowed, by thoſe who duly attend to the orders of our great Lord and Maſter, which are; <q>Go ye and <hi>teach</hi> all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt; teaching them to OBSERVE ALL THINGS, WHATSOEVER I HAVE COMMANDED you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. AMEN.</q>

            <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> Where (Ex. with figures added thereto occurs) it refers to pages in my examination of Mr. <hi>Joſeph Fiſh</hi>'s nine ſermons, where the ſame points as here are treated of.</p>
            <p>A Reply to Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> under theſe heads. 1. Of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of Chriſt's viſible church; which are proved to be only profeſſing believers: and his arguments for infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm are diſtinctly anſwered. p. 4—17. (Ex. p. 12, 13, 97—129.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the manner of building churches. Chriſt has inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted none but particular churches, which are tobe built up by perſons giving a verbal account of a work of God's Spirit on their ſouls, to the church, in order to their being received as members. p. 17—23. (Ex. p. 17—19, 31, 49, 50. Teſtimonies to confirm this, from Dr. Owen, p. 18, 58—60. Capt. Clap, p. 54. Mr. Eliot, p. 55. Mr. Shepard, p. 57, 95. Mr. Mitchel, p. 19, 51, 56. Dr. Mather, p. 17—19.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of organizing churches. The power both of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating and ordaining miniſters proved to be in the churches, and none have a right to act therein only as they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereto by the church. p. 23—33. (Ex. p. 16, 24, 40, 41, 60—63. This confirmed by the example of our fathers, p. 16, 52. and by Dr. Owen, p. 64, 69, 70.)</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of the difference between civil and eccleſiaſtical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. p. 33—51. (Ex. p. 20—32.)</p>
            <p>The goſpel method of ſupporting miniſters opened, and the evils of uſing force in the caſe deſcribed. p. 35, &amp;c. (Ex. p. 20, 24—27, 29, 30, 46—48, 74—82.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of ſeparation; the cauſe and nature of our's. p. 51.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was becauſe church and world were confounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. p. 52—56. (Ex. p. 20, 50, 51, 94. This confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr. I. Mather, p. 19. Dr. Cotton Mather, p. 37. Mr. Mitchel, p. 51. Dr. Owen. p. 85—88.)</p>

               <pb n="146" facs="unknown:012655_0145_0F8BBECFD52B01A0"/>
2. Becauſe human learning was put in the place of the gifts of the Spirit, to qualify miniſters. p. 56—59. (Ex. p. 41—45. This confirmed by Mr. Tennant, p. 33. Mr. Edwards, p. 34, 68. Mr. Prince, p. 52. Dr. Frank, p. 53. Mr. Porter, p. 68, 69. Dr. Owen, p. 86.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe goſpel liberty in ſuch affairs was denied. p. 59—66. (Ex. p. 38—41, 46—48, 50—53. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from Mr. Tennant, p. 34. Mr. Edwards, p. 34. Dr. Owen, p. 83, 86, 88. Dr. Frank, p. 84, 90.)</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe unwarranted ways of worſhip were practiſed among us. p. 66. (Ex. p. 72, 102, &amp;c.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe goſpel diſcipline was neglected and changed into a worldly dominion. p. 67. (Ex. p. 20, 28—31, 51. Dr. Owen upon it. p. 85—87.)</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe of miniſter's ſetting up themſelves, and inſtead of preaching to ediſication, treating thoſe who would not ſubmit to them with a great deal of abuſe. p. 67, &amp;c. (Ex. p. 35, 84, 90, 91, 94.)</p>
            <p>An addreſs to Mr. <hi>Joſeph Fiſh,</hi>—giving the reaſons for my writing, p. 79. And ſhewing to him that he has in his arguments to ſupport the ſtanding churches, been guilty,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of ſetting <hi>themſelves</hi> up as a ſtandard inſtead of divine truth, p. 83.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of uſing ſcripture words without duly regarding their meaning, p. 87.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of blending truth and error together in many inſtances, in order to gain his argument, p. 91.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of violating the golden rule ſo much as to endeavor to draw their own character only by their virtues or good pretences; and that of their opponents only by their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, p. 99.</p>
            <p>Our fathers like conduct will condemn, and not excuſe him herein, p. 101.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> in theſe proceedings has groſsly miſrepreſented ſeveral facts, p. 116.</p>
            <p>And has ſhewn a wrong temper: ſo that according to his own conceſſions he is guilty both of ſophiſtry and ſlander, p. 126.</p>
            <p>APPENDIX, ſhewing that the advocates for infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm proceed in an obſcure and unſteady uſe of words, which carries them away into additions to God's word, and a denial of what is therein; alſo to abuſe their neighbours, and countenance popery, Arminianiſm and Antinomianiſm.</p>

HAVING thus ſummed up the matter in ſhort terms, the author has one earneſt requeſt to make to all his readers; and that is, That they would always be careful to diſtinguiſh between the characters of men and the truth of God. He deſires to be far from ſetting himſelf up in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, much leſs in competition, with many great and good men, who have practiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm, and other things which he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. If thoſe practices cannot be vindicated from divine truth, the characters of men can't do it, but only ſerve to perplex and keep ſouls in bondage. The goodneſs of David's character could never make that proceeding of his to be right, which he was moved to by <hi>ſatan;</hi> neither could the badneſs of Joab's character, make it wrong for him to look upon that conduct to be <hi>abominable.</hi> 1 Chron. 21.1, 6. <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> was no better in Peter than it was in Judas; therefore Paul called it by it's proper name, to prevent others being enſnared thereby. Gal. 2. 13. Yet as one or two actions do not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly form a man's character, David is far from having the character of ſatan's ſervant, or Peter from having that of a hypocrite or a traitor. So let all take notice, that what I mean to appear againſt, is the particular evils that I have named, and not againſt the characters, or any of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of thoſe who have been enſnared by them. Hence there is no need for any to take pains to prove that learned men, or good men have hold thoſe things; for that is not diſputed. The turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing points of our whole diſpute may be reduced to theſe four queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="148" facs="unknown:012655_0147_0F8BBED148AA79B0"/>
1. Whether Abraham's believing, and being juſtified by the <hi>covenant of grace in Chriſt before</hi> he took the <hi>bond-woman,</hi> can give us warrant to confound that <hi>grace</hi> with the covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion (which included the children both of the <hi>bond-woman</hi> and the <hi>free</hi>) ſo as to bring the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our <hi>fleſh</hi> to baptiſm, before we have any goſpel evidence that they are <hi>made free in Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Gal. 3.17, and 4.22—31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since the chief advantage that the Jews had by the covenant of circumciſion was, that unto them were committed the <hi>oracles of God;</hi> which were ſo much limited to them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt by his death had taken that covenant out of the way, his apoſtles might not preach to any but to them who were in it. Rom. 3.2. Mat. 10.5.6. Is it not an abſolute falſhood, for any to aſſert, that the covenant is the ſame with our children, as it was with theirs? and ſince our children have the means for converſion uſed with them, in ſo much clearer light, than theirs had under the law; what an abuſe is it to accuſe us with leſſening our children's privileges, only becauſe we dare not put the outward ſign of regeneration upon them, before we have evidence that the inward change is wrought?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though the primitive churches employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elders in ordaining others over them, which doubtleſs is an example for us to follow; yet how can that prove, that the conferring of office-power is inherent in officers, and not in the church as a body, ſince Chriſt expreſsly warned his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, againſt having any ſuch ſuperiority among them as there is in civil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaying, <hi>He that
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012655_0148_0F8BBED208AB6BE0"/>is greateſt among you let him be as the younger:</hi> and the apoſtles were but the churches <hi>ſervants for Jeſus ſake?</hi> Luke. 22.26.2 Cor. 4.5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Since in the Jewiſh church, where a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part or proportion of the peoples income, was by expreſs command to be given to the miniſters of the ſanctuary, while yet neither precept nor precedent can be found for rulers uſing any <hi>force</hi> to collect it; what warrant can any earthly power have now, to aſſeſs any perſons, and uſe force to collect the ſame, for the ſupport of any religious worſhip whatſoever?<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader will not wonder that ſuch care is taken to have this queſtion truly ſtated, when he is informed, that ſince theſe ſheets were in the preſs, the author has ſeen a diſcourſe that bears ſo ſine a title as this; <q>Catholiciſm: or, chriſtian charity,</q> publiſhed at the particular requeſt of a <hi>convention</hi> of thoſe called ſtanding miniſters at Briſtol, on <hi>May</hi> 20, 1772, in which the writer mentions our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he calls a ſect well known, and ſays, <q>It is worthy of notice, that many of the leaders of that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſchiſm, who were for pulling down miniſters, and rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up churches in their great zeal (rather fury) for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed hereſy, particularly in the article of giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving miniſterial ſupport; I ſay many of thoſe very perſons are as fond of ſupport from their people, as thoſe they once anathematized. The conſiſtency and honeſty of ſuch a temper and conduct is far beyond me to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, and is, I apprehend, as irreconcilable as light and darkneſs.</q> p. 38. Thus their charity prompts them to repreſent us, as not only inconſiſtent, but alſo <hi>diſhoneſt;</hi> and the way they take to do it, is by inſinuating that our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with them was about <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>receiving;</hi> whereas the truth is, it was about <hi>aſſeſſing</hi> and <hi>forcing;</hi> and they are welcome to produce one inſtance if they can of any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency and diſhoneſty as they here ſpeak of, unleſs it be in two or three teachers who have deſerted the cauſe that they once profeſſed to be in, in order to get into fellowſhip with theſe miniſters. And ſince they have given this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet the name of <hi>charity,</hi> I would juſt remark that they ſay, <q>There is doubtleſs a ſort of natural, as well as chriſtian charity. The ſource of this kind of charity is ſelf; here it begins and ends.</q> p. 25. and they ſay, <q>Liberty and candor are the great baſis of human happineſs: we often hear perſons extolling the advantages of both, who yet ſeem to be really acquainted with neither. For if they have any deſign on foot, if you entertain different views, and with freedom ſpeak your mind, you are inſtantly deemed an enemy, and you muſt be treated as ſuch, ſo that if you eſcape without the ſword, it is not ſo much owing to a generous ſpirit of liberty, as a want of power.</q> p. 65.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now the reader may form ſome judgment of what ſort of perſons they are, who extol liberty, charity and a catholic temper, while their own charity begins and ends in <hi>ſelf,</hi> by the two following notes. Speaking of our ſeparation the writer ſays, <q>Such uncharitable principles have led them to exclude themſelves from the communion of THE ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic church.</q> p. 38. And ſpeaking of occaſionally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting miniſters to preach he ſays, <q>I cannot ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety nor the expediency of inviting the aſſiſtance of ANY man, be his profeſſion what it may, that denies ME the rights and privileges of the church of Chriſt. If we cant eat and drink of one bread and one cup, in token of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fellowſhip; I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould encourage ſuch perſons in their <hi>uncharitableneſs,</hi> ſince charity is the great criterion of real chriſtianity.</q> p. 65.</p>

If any can fairly anſwer theſe queſtions; or can ſhew that this is not the true ſtate of our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, they will do ſomething to the purpoſe: but to neglect this and fill up volume after volume with other things, evidently tends to confuſion and not to peace. And if any with Abner, chuſe now to call it <hi>play;</hi> they like him, will ſurely find it to be <hi>bitterneſs in the latter end.</hi> 2 Sam. 2.14, 26.</p>
