            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003379_0004_0FF82176E1E00EE0"/>the Holy of Holies, with blood, and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the Sins of the People; and was a <hi>Type</hi> of Chriſt; and venerable on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the wiſdom and excellent Spirit, which was in him; his eminency in his Office, and the great Service, which he did among his People: and our <hi>Text</hi> ſignifies the honour done him in his burial, and the reaſon of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The honour done him in his burial: They buried him in the City of David among the Kings:</hi> A ſingular honour this, that he ſhould make his grave with the Princes and ſupream Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of his People. <hi>David,</hi> when he was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in his Kingdom, took from the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> the ſtrong hold of <hi>Zion,</hi> and call'd it after his own name; made it the place of his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Seat of his Kingdom; in ſome part of which he was interr'd at his deceaſe, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>King.</hi> 2.10. <hi>So David ſlept with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David;</hi> which afterward became the burying place of the Kings: for this is the account generally given concerning the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> that they ſlept with their fathers, and were buried <hi>in the City of David:</hi> And this was the honour done to <hi>Jehoiada</hi> when he died; they buried him in this City, and laid him among the Kings: an honour denied to ſome of the Kings, who had by their miſmanagements, forfeited the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards due to their Character: It is Reported of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> that he departed without being deſired: <hi>howbeit they buried him in the City of David, but not in the Sepulchres</hi> of the Kings,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003379_0005_0FF821A14E2B78D0"/>2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.20. and of that ungrateful and barbarous King <hi>Joaſh, that his Servants conſpired againſt him, for the blood of the Sons of Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and ſlew him on his bed, and he died, and they buried him in the City of David: but they buried him not in the Sepulchres of the Kings,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.25. which imports that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a great honour to any one to have his Corpſe lodg'd in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The reaſon of it, becauſe he had done good in Iſrael?</hi> By <hi>Iſrael</hi> here, is meant the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Judah,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.2. <hi>All theſe were the Sons of Jehoſhaphat King of Iſrael;</hi> who was King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and not of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when we ſpeak of them in contradiſtinction: <hi>Had done good in Iſrael:</hi> This is a <hi>Meioſis,</hi> more is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than expreſs'd; for if he had only done ſome ſmall Service, and in as ſmall a degree, it might have been ſaid, that he had done good in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but this is far beneath' the lofty Intention of the expreſſion, which is, that he had been E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently Serviceable, and had done very much good.</p>

                  <hi>That honour and reſpect is due, and ought to be paid, to the Remains and Memory of ſuch as have been eminently Serviceable, and done much good among their People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such are rich bleſſings while they live, and thoſe whom God is pleaſed to honour, by furniſhing of them, making them Eminent, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003379_0006_0FF82178F43DC398"/>great and good Inſtruments, in his Providence, all men ſhould honour and acknowledge; which is a clear dictate of natural reaſon, and ſtrictly juſt; becauſe exactly agreeable to the reaſons and proportion of things. Such ought alſo to be honoured after their Deceaſe, in ſuch ways as the ſtate of the matter gives room for.</p>
               <p>Honour is due to all men on account of the Dignity of human nature, becauſe man was made in the Image of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all men.</hi> A greater degree of honour is due unto rèligious, holy and vertous men; and by how much the more they excel in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſhine in vertue, by ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Regard is due unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. <hi>He honoureth them that fear the Lord.</hi> But more eſpecial honour ſtill is due to them, who are placed on high, and bear Offices of diſtinction among Mankind, according to the degree of improvement and exaltation which they are advanced to, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Honour the King.;</hi> and the greateſt honour is due to them who are eminently Serviceable, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Let the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which rule well, be accounted worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour, eſpecially they who labour</hi> (more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, and exert themſelves) <hi>in the word and doctrine;</hi> neither doth the obligation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ceaſe, when their breath goeth forth; but honour is due to their remains and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.13, 14. <hi>And Aſa ſlept with his fathers, and they made a very great burning for him.</hi> This Doctrine may be conſidered in two Propoſitions.</p>

PROP. I. <hi>Some men are eminently Servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and do much good among their People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not a greater diverſity and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the World of things, than there is in the World of men. Some things are very hurtful and deſtructive to the nature of man, as the poiſon of Aſps; ſome things are of the middle kind, and do neither good nor hurt; ſome are ſalubrious and very ſerviceable, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, ſtrengthening, reſtorative, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
               <p>So among <hi>men,</hi> ſome are very hurtful and pernicious, tyrannical and oppreſſive, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unrighteous, turbulent and unpeacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vicious and debauch'd; they are of little benefit to mankind, while they live; nor is it any loſs to the world, when they die. They ſeem to be ſent in Judgment, and are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away in mercy; not to themſelves, but to mankind. Others are as the Twilight, in the middle between good and evil, uſeful, and pernicious; they have a being upon the earth; but none are much oblig'd to them, neither have we any great complaint to advance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, they ſerve to ſwell the number of mankind, and this is well nigh all; that they are harmleſs &amp; inoffenſive finiſheth their Character.</p>
               <p>Others exceed in their uſefulneſs, and are rich Bleſſings in their day. God doth well furniſh them, and well ſpirit them: and they are as the light of the morning, even a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Clouds, and as a clear ſhining af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rain: They expand their Beneficence as
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003379_0008_0FF8217A879B9220"/>the rays of light, and men in every Order, Condition and Degree are the better for 'em; all men eſteem and love them; becauſe all men, at one time or other, are oblig'd and ſerv'd by them, and when cruel death doth forcibly take them away, all hearts are oppreſt with ſorrow, and all eyes are full of tears, and are ready to look upon it, that a great part of their comfort is buried in the ſame grave. Such were <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> among the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and almoſt in every ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration God. raiſeth up, and beſtows ſome ſuch men.</p>
               <p>We may expatiate a little and illuſtrate this in ſome inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some do much good with their Eſtates.</hi> The God from whom doth come Riches, as well as Honour, doth honour them, in making 'em his <hi>Stewards</hi> of much worldly ſubſtance, and with all doth give them an heart to do good with their abundance: They are of a publick Spirit, and when there is opportunity, they diſcover a laudable generoſity and openneſs of hand: It doth not ſuffice them to give to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every man his due, and to owe no man any thing but love; and to pay without grudging (which many do not) what the Support of the Publick doth require: but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they deviſe liberal things, and by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things they ſtand; and are of the ſame publick and generous ſpirit with the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on well reſpected among the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe he loved their Nation, and built them a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,

When any matter is ſet <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which may be for God's Glory, the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> of Religion, and the good of men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth money for the carrying on and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the ſame, you ſhall never find them oppoſing, declining, and drawing back; but always ready, forward, chearful, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at the opportunity.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some do great and good Service in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Stations, which they are exalted into.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doth call them forth from a private to a publick Capacity, having antecedently fitted and qualified them therefor; and they do worthily, and become famous, in the wiſe and faithful attendance to, and diſcharge of the Truſt, which they have received from God by men. If it be a civil Office which they ſuſtain, that they bear Rule over men, they are juſt and rule in the fear of the Lord: when they ſit upon the ſeat of Juſtice, they take heed what they do; becauſe they account, and conſider that they judge not for men, but for God. <q>
                     <hi>That the power of judgment is God's Right, that the matter of Judgment is God's Cauſe,

                  </q> and deſire nothing more than that God would be with them in the Judgment; they are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over themſelves, that they be impartial, and do not decline after many to wreſt Judgment; nor countenance a poor man in his cauſe; nor favour the great and the Rich, becauſe they are ſo; neither do they bear the Sword in vain; but by the prudent execution of juſt Laws, they become <hi>a terror to them that do evil;</hi> and if the Sons of vice, and inſolence will not otherwiſe be reclaimed, they uſe a juſt ſeverity, and bring <hi>the wheel over the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;</hi> nor are they leſs conſcientious as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Precepts of the firſt Table; they are a ſwift witneſs againſt the Prophane. againſt vain Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, and ſuch as dare boldly affront the Majeſty of Heaven; and they ſpeak comfortably to thoſe that teach the good knowledge of the Lord.</p>
               <p>They are indued with wiſdom, and a ſpirit of Government, and by the application of their Wiſdom and Power, they keep all in peace and good order about them; they defend the Righteous, and protect the Innocent, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſets under his own vine, and under his own fig-tree, ſocure in his juſt Rights, and enjoying the fruits of his own labours.</p>
               <p>In like manner ſome in the ſacred Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do eminent Service for Chriſt, his Truth, and the Souls of men, and <hi>are the Chariots of Iſrael, and the Horſemen thereof:</hi> and others, who move in a lower ſphere of publick Order,

They are exemplary in their Families, walking in the midſt of their houſes in a perfect way; and hereby they have a good influence upon thoſe that are under them, who inſenſibly fall into imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and grow up into a likeneſs and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Parents: They are patterns in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards

O how rich bleſſings are ſuch! and how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the people, who are favour'd with them! when any trouble doth begin to ariſe, they ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably obviate the ſame, lay the ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and quench the ſpark before it breaks out into a flame, and have ſo ſtrong and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive influence; that they maintain peace and truth, decency and good order, in their day.</p>

               <p>PROP. II. <hi>Honour and Reſpect is due, and ought to be paid to the Remains and Memory of ſuch men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Death prevails over ſuch as well as others: tho' they may ſuſtain a Divine Character, and <hi>are Gods by Office;</hi> yet not in immutability; <hi>for they die like other men;</hi> tho' they are very uſeful, much needed, and can be very difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpared; yet death is cruel and ſpares 'em not: for in the Grave are <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of the earth,</hi> as well as others, <hi>Job</hi> 3.14. and ſuch, whether they come to their grave in a full age, like as a ſhock of corn cometh
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003379_0014_0FF82181A606E8B8"/>in, in his ſeaſon; or, whether they are taken away in the midſt of their capacity and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, honour is due, and regard to be paid to the name and memory of ſuch, after their ſpirits are removed, and they are no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant among us: and that ſo to do is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and fitting, juſt and grateful, appears to be a clear dictate of natural reaſon, and what hath been the tho't and practice of mankind generally; we ſhall not therefore labour in the demonſtration of that which we preſume all will readily acknowledge; but ſhall proceed to ſhew <hi>in what way,</hi> honour and reſpect ought to be paid unto ſuch, and aſſign ſome <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Doctrine, which will invite into the Application.</p>
               <p n="1">I. As to the firſt, <hi>ſome of the ways in which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reſpect ought to be paid unto ſuch,</hi> are theſe which follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By a ſuitable and honourable Burial.</hi> It is a practice, which hath obtain'd in the world, when perſons die, to return back their Bodies, earth to earth as it was; and the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath guided moſt, if not all nations, to pay ſome reſpect to perſons of Diſtinction &amp; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by ſome peculiar <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> in their <hi>Obſequies;</hi> and it's decent that ſuch ſhould be honour'd in their Interment, according to the decent rites and cuſtoms, which have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd among their people.</p>
               <p>Different modes of doing honour to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, have obtain'd in different Times and Countries. Among us we give honour to ſuch, by Titles of Diſtinction, by uncovering of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003379_0015_0FF821AA41F70958"/>head, by riſing up before them, by bowing of the knee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it is equal and juſt that men of worth and improvement, have reſpect ſhewn them in ſuch ways as are cuſtomary; and not to do it, is neglect and contempt; ſo likewiſe when they deceaſe, honour'd they ſhou'd be in their burial. Thus they honour'd <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> by laying him among the Kings; and it was a cuſtom in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to do honour to men of worth, by making odoriferous burnings for them. It is ſaid concerning the good King <hi>Aſa,</hi> that <hi>when he died they made a very great burning for him,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. and not to do this, was a token of neglect and diſreſpect; for it is ſaid of that wicked King <hi>Jehoram,</hi> who departed without being deſired, <hi>that his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.19.</p>
               <p>This burning of ſweet odours, was a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of reſpect, and an emblem of a good reputation, that they gladly were at coſt to manifeſt their Regards to ſuch a worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that his name was ſweet, &amp; as oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poured forth, which gives a delightful ſenſation to all that are near; and this may probably, let us into a right underſtanding of the wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1. <hi>A good name is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of ones birth:</hi> for when a man comes to die, it is better and more elegible, to leave a good name and reputation behind him, than to be honour'd with a great burning of ſweet odours and coſtly perfumes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:003379_0016_0FF821843664F510"/>
Another cuſtom of reſpect to the worthy Deceaſed, was the erecting of Monuments over their graves; after <hi>Rachel</hi>'s death, <hi>Jacob</hi> erected a monument over her grave, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for a long time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.20. <hi>And Jacob ſet a Pillar upon her grave, which is the Pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.</hi> King <hi>David's</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre remain'd in the Apoſtles day, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Men and Brethren, let me freely ſpeak unto you of the Patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his Sepulchre is with us unto this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By lamenting and mourning for them, and attending the decent rites and cuſtoms thereof:</hi> As, where there is a juſt eſteem of, and regard to worthy and uſeful perſons, there will be deep ſorrow and hearty mourning, when they are removed; ſo it is becoming, and a doing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſuch, that this ſhould be made manifeſt in proper expreſſions, according to the lawful modes and cuſtoms of the time and place; both ancient and extenſive hath been the uſage of mourning Apparel; putting on of Sackcloth, and an attire ſignificative of ſorrow &amp; regard, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thy ſelf with oyl, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead.</hi> As <hi>Joſiah</hi> was an excellent Prince, ſo, great and laſting was the mourning for him, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 35.24, 25. <hi>And all Judah and Jeruſalem</hi> (not his near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only, but all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Joſiah:</hi> And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> lamented for <hi>Joſiah:</hi> and all the ſinging men and ſinging women ſpake of <hi>Joſiah</hi> in their lamentations
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003379_0017_0FF821ABD28D30F8"/>to this day, and made them an Ordinance in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and, behold, they are written in the lamentations: the omiſſion of which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of diſregard. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.18, 19. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim, the ſon of Joſiah King of Judah, they ſhall not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him, ſaying, Ah my Brother! or ah Siſter! they ſhall not lament for him ſaying, Ah Lord! or ah his Glory! He ſhall be buried with the burial of an Aſs &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By acknowledging their worth, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth their amiable qualities, and great and good Services.</hi> Praiſe is one of the juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of vertue, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>and if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe.</hi> It is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bleſs God, and adore his infinite perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and praiſe his beneficence and goodneſs to his creatures: So we ought likewiſe to ſee and acknowledge the gifts and grace which he doth beſtow upon men, &amp; give them the honour of their good Services, by a ſuitable acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.30. <hi>A woman that feareth the Lord, ſhe ſhall be praiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is juſt and right that we do, in our minds eſteem, and account of every man, according to the vertues and good qualities, which are manifeſt in him. If a man be truly eminent, and manifeſt himſelf by worthy actions to be ſo; not ſo to account of him, is unjuſt, and a with-holding of that which is his due; and as we ought thus inwardly to eſteem good and deſerving men; ſo it is but juſt to acknowledge it in words, &amp; ſpeak it forth to their honour;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003379_0018_0FF82186633D7C00"/>and as this is a regard due unto them, while living; ſo it is an honour due to their name and memory, when they are dead; for it hath pleaſed the moſt High in his Wiſdom to order upon record in his word, the excellent ſpirit, and great and good Services of many eminent and holy men in this way. The Righteous ſhould be had in laſting remembrance; and we ſhould bleſs the name of the Juſt: This is to embalm them indeed, and better than the moſt coſtly &amp; the moſt precious Aromatick burning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By ſhewing a proper regard unto theirs, whom they leave behind them.</hi> A man who is ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and honourable, reſpect is due to <hi>his</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his account; and every man eſteemeth that which is done to his Children, as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is natural to every man to deſire, that his Children may be eſteem'd, lov'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in the World, and a dying man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſire this for this Children when he hath left them; and a paying of reſpect to his neareſt Relations whom he leaves behind, is gratitude, &amp; a doing honour to the departed.</p>

                  <hi>Jonathan</hi> begs this favour of <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 20.14, 15. <hi>And thou ſhalt not only, while yet I live, ſhew me the kindneſs of the Lord, that I die not; but alſo thou ſhalt not cut off thy kindneſs from my houſe for ever: no not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: When he came to be ſettled in the Kingdom, he made inquiry, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.1. <hi>And David ſaid, is there yet any that is left of the

               <p n="5">5. <hi>By following of their Example, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating what was excellent and worthy in them.</hi> Imitating and copying after another is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of eſteem: we are inclin'd to copy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe whom we eſteem conſiderable; and think, that we ſerve and recommend our ſelves in doing ſo: and therefore, hereby we honour them; for honour is an inward eſteem, made manifeſt externally by ſignificant expreſſions, whether in word or action. We glorify God by the tranſcript of his moral perfections into our hearts and lives; and this is one of the ways in which it is our duty to honour him: and in this way we ſhould do honour to the name and memory of thoſe who have done good in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

The good ſpirit which was in them we ſhould covet and labour for: the piety and vertue, the truth and goodneſs, the kindneſs and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, the faithfulneſs &amp; publick ſpirit, which ſhew'd forth themſelves in them, we ſhould think of, for our own direction and quickning. Were they exemplary in their regards to things ſacred? this ſhould be a motive to us to be ſo too: were they regular and vertuous in their converſation? we ſhould aim to be like them: were they kind and neighbourly, affable and courteous to all? we ſhould think hereupon, and ſay within our ſelves, ſuch will we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be: were they always forward to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear againſt ſin &amp; diſorder, and bear their teſtimony againſt evil, according to their place? it ſhould be our reſolution, that we will do the ſame thing: did they always diſcover a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to promote that which might be for the publick intereſt and good? we ſhould determine within our ſelves, that we will be like them in this: were they always for peace? let it be our hearts deſire and purpoſe that if it be poſſible we will live peaceably with all men, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental unto love and peace, as much as in us lieth: ſo ſhall we honour the dead who were good &amp; exemplary while they liv'd.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As to the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Doctrine, we may offer as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Not that it is any benefit to them who are departed.</hi> What we do in this World hath no influence, as to thoſe who are departed into the world of ſpirits. Manifeſting eſteem &amp; regard
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003379_0021_0FF862E6E8DCF000"/>may be of advantage to ſuch, when alive; may be an encouragement to them in their duty and work; may be a quickning to them to exert themſelves, that they may be more abundantly ſerviceable: and doubtleſs, it is ſometimes of ſervice to publick men, to know that their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is well accepted, and that they have an intereſt in the eſteem of their people, when they are well ballanced, and have grace to make a right improvement of it; but the doing honour to their name is of no ſervice directly to them who are departed. The great &amp; good departed, need not any farther ſervice of ours; they hear not our commendations; they are exalted above our praiſes; neither can our <hi>enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums</hi> augment their beatitude.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is in it ſelf juſt and right.</hi> There is a certain dependance of things one upon another, and references and relations of things one unto another, which is the foundation of juſt and right. Such a being as man, a creature endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch powers, ſituate in ſuch relation to, and dependance upon, the only uncreated and eternal mind, it is in it ſelf juſt and right, that he ſhould think of, be affected and act toward God according to <hi>his</hi> nature and perfections; and his own relation to, and dependance upon Him: and ſuch is the relation of men one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, as that it is in it ſelf juſt &amp; right, that every man ſhould enjoy what is his own, his life, reputation, worldly poſſeſſions, without infringement or moleſtation; ſo it is in its ſelf juſt and right, that reſpect ſhould be paid to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003379_0022_0FF8218A1F5ADEE8"/>them who have been uſeful and ſerviceable; tho' they being now placed at ſuch a diſtance from us, can receive no benefit by it; for this is no reaſonable objection againſt the equity of the thing: for it is juſt and right, and our bounden duty, to honour and glorify God, tho' he be exalted above all bleſſing and praiſe, nor can we be profitable to Him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It may be profitable to the Living:</hi> And by means of the living, the dead may yet ſpeak, and be an occaſion of good after they are laid in their graves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It may be ſome ſupport and comfort to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved and mourning Relations.</hi> It muſt needs be ſome alleviation of their grief, and lightning of their burden, to find that their dear rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, whom death hath ſeparated from them, had a good intereſt in the eſteem and love of others; and to obſerve that many do feelingly condole in their loſs and ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It may be profitable to others, as it may be <hi>a motive and an incentive to goodneſs and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> A thirſt and deſire to be well tho't of, both while living, and when dead, is natural. For no man of tho't and ſenſe, is willing that his name ſhould be utterly forgotten: men would be remembred, which is one cauſe of their deſire to children, that ſince they are mortal in their own perſons, they may obtain a kind of immortality in their deſcendents; and hence men of no religion will engage in, and vigorouſly proſecute great &amp; worthy enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes; yea, ſacrifice their lives in the ſervice of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003379_0023_0FF821B0388EAEF8"/>their Country, that they may (as the phraſe is) die in the bed of honour; that their names may live, &amp; be renowned when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not: nor is this a meer <hi>Chimera,</hi> and vanity; tho' it muſt be acknowledged as of ſmall value and light, when laid in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt the better bleſſings of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal World; for it is mention'd in holy Writ as one of the rewards of goodneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.7. <hi>The Memory of the juſt is bleſſed.</hi> Now the paying of reſpect, and doing honour to pious &amp; uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, when they are gone, evidently ſets before the living the way of honour, and how they muſt live and improve themſelves, as they would be reſpectfully mention'd, when they ſhall be no more ſeen among the living.</p>
               <p>USE I. <hi>Hence learn that there is little regard, after their departure, due to thoſe who have been vicious in their lives, and have done little ſervice among mankind.</hi> Tho' they have been bad, yet humanity doth require that they be put into the ground; but, as there is but little reſpect due unto them while they live, ſo there is as little when they come to die, it is juſt &amp; beſt that they ſhould paſs off in ſilence, and that little ſhould be ſaid of them: barbarous it ſeems to rake in their duſt, &amp; to blaze their reproach, when they are gone to receive the juſt deſerts of an ill-ſpent life; and there is little good to be ſaid of them, and therefore it's beſt that they ſhould lie in ſilence; and agreeably the wicked are threatned in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.7. <hi>The name
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003379_0024_0FF8218BDB1DD948"/>of the wicked ſhall rot;</hi> and it is beſt that it ſhould be ſo: Some are ſo very vicious and wicked, pernicious and hurtful in their lives, as that, when they are gone, it's pity their name ſhould be mention'd any more, except in way of admonition and caution; it would be well, if ſuch bad examples, might be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten; and therefore when ſuch die, there is commonly much ſilence as they are carried to the place of ſilence; when good and uſeful men die, every one is ſpeaking in their praiſe and commendation; but when the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed die, there is ſilence, and men return from their grave as thoſe who are aſhamed.</p>
               <p>USE II. <hi>Hence we may be inſtructed that to reproach and vilifie ſuch worthy men, when they are dead; or any ways to treat ill</hi> theirs, <hi>whom they have left behind, is highly criminal and faulty, ingratitude and baſeneſs:</hi> Of which we are preſented with a ſad inſtance in our <hi>Context: Jehoiada</hi> was an excellent man; had done great ſervice in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had done abundance for King <hi>Joaſh;</hi> he and his wife had ſav'd him from death, from the hands of that wicked woman <hi>Athaliah,</hi> who deſtroyed all the ſeed Royal of the houſe of <hi>Judah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003379_0025_0FF821B2501BC398"/>to him to his dying day: and what was the gratitude of <hi>Joaſh</hi> to <hi>Jehoida</hi> after his death? He was ſo barbarous and baſe, that he ſlew his Sons, tho' they were his near kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; he forſook the Lord, &amp; thus requited his benefactor.</p>
               <p>But how did he proſper? accordingly the Judgments of God followed him; his enemies came upon him, &amp; prevail'd againſt him; ſore Diſeaſes ſeiz'd upon his body; &amp; his own Servants had ſuch an abhorrence of his ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude &amp; barbarity, that they conſpired againſt him &amp; ſlew him; and the people had ſuch a deteſtation of him, that they would not ſuffer him to be buried in the Sepulchres of the Kings: and this is written for admonition and warning.</p>
               <p>USE III. <hi>Let this be an argument and motive to us, to do all the good and ſervice in the world that poſſibly we can.</hi> Let us live Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as profeſs it, and be concerned for the things of CHRIST JESUS; let us be ſolicitous for the publick weal, and ſeek the welfare of our <hi>Iſrael</hi> all the days of our lives; let us be ſubject to thoſe above us, and good to thoſe about us; faithful in our families, and exemplary in our lives.</p>
               <p>This will procure us an honourable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance when we are gone, and give us a name in ſome reſpects better than the name of Sons and of Daughters; will give us a laſting name that ſhall not ſoon be cut off; and thus
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003379_0026_0FF8218F09D78418"/>it will be in corrupt and degenerate
times; It was not a very good time in <hi>Iſrael</hi> when <hi>Jehoiada</hi> died;
yet what Honour was put upon him. There was not much true godlineſs in
<hi>Joſiah</hi>'s day; yet how greatly was his Death lamented. It was a corrupt time
in the days of <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> yet when <hi>Abijah</hi> his Son died, all
<hi>Iſrael</hi> mourned for him, and buried him, <hi>Becauſe there was found in him
ſome good thing toward the Lord God of Iſrael, in the houſe of Jeroboam,</hi> 1
Kings, 14.13.</p>
               <p>Conſider we alſo, that if we, from a right Principle and ſincerely, live thus, this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to God's approbation, who, as he is Goodneſs it ſelf, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, ſo he delights in thoſe who are good and do good. This alſo will give us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace, ſweet Reflections, and cordial Supports and Views, in a dying hour, if then with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> we have the Teſtimony of our Conſciences, that we have walk'd before the Lord in truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in his ſight: this alſo, of Grace, will intitle to glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Eternal World.</p>
               <p>USE IV. Of Exhortation, <hi>To pay all due Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reſpect to the Remains and Memory of ſuch as have been ſerviceable, and have done good in Iſrael.</hi> Theſe, when Providence doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, are not ſuddenly to be forgotten, or their names be ſuffered to ſink into oblivion; which directly leads to ſpeak of that worthy
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003379_0027_0FF821B3DCD8A4C0"/>and uſeful Man,<note n="*" place="bottom">John Hall, <abbr>

                     </abbr>
                  </note> whoſe removal from us hath given occaſion to theſe Meditations: I am well aware that Funeral Sermons are too often ſtuff'd with Flatteries; but there is not ſuch danger of this, when the Perſon lamented, was eminent, &amp; eminently ſerviceable, which is the preſent caſe, as you yourſelves know: to paſs over ſuch a man in ſilence, would be great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; wherefore Men and Brethren, let me freely ſpeak unto you of this Honourable Counſeller, and Juſt Judge, who is now both Dead and Buried and his Grave is with us.</p>
               <p>If we look to his déſcent, he was born of credible and worthy Parents, who approv'd themſelves well in their day; and having ſerv'd God and their generation by his Will in a various capacity, are fallen aſleep.</p>
               <p>If we conſider him in his Natural abilities, the Father of lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift, had well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; of which there needs no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than his riſing to be ſo conſiderable under ſo ſmall advantages: He had a large underſtanding, a ſingular diſcretion, and a good temper; But yet, when prudence juſtified him in it; could diſcover that he had ſpirit, tho' he held the ſame under agood regimen &amp; command.</p>
               <p>And as the Moſt High, who gives Gifts to every man as he pleaſeth, had accompliſh'd him for ſervice, and given him a right ſpirit therefor; ſo in the ordering of his Providence, he call'd him forth thereunto; and in every
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003379_0028_0FF821915626CE90"/>imployment of Life, he diſcharg'd himſelf well and worthily, to the general ſatisfaction of thoſe concerned with him, and to his own honour. While he was pleas'd to continue in a military capacity, how well accepted! how much eſteem'd! and in a civil capacity, he was one of the beſt of Men, and did Govern in the integrity of his heart, and by the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his hands; in matters of controverſy between plea and plea, it may be ſaid, that he made Judgment to run down as waters and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream; and in cauſes of delinquency, he was in a great degree a terror unto evil doers, and was ſo fear'd as well as lov'd, that he ſcatter'd the wicked with his eye: in the executive Court he was a skilful and righteous Judge; and in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative, a wiſe and able Counſeller: He had an extended foreſight, a clear diſcerning, and an uncommon dexterity in the management of affairs, and was truly fitted for Government and Publick Service; therefore he was not long in the <hi>General Court,</hi> before his excellent talents were obſerved, and the Wiſdom of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Aſſembly hath often improved him in controverſies and difficulties in Towns and Societies; which, he (with other worthy Gentlemen) hath done good ſervice, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and bringing to a peaceable and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory iſſue.</p>
               <p>And as in this regard he hath been a great and bleſſed Inſtrument of Publick Service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; ſo in the ſame way he hath done much
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003379_0029_0FF821B6F77904F0"/>good among his own people: many differences he heal'd; many contending parties he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd; ſcarce ever a man more applyed to for Counſel and Advice in matters and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of every nature and kind; or that did more good (according to his ſphere) in ſuch a way than he: his Houſe was as <hi>Abel;</hi> here they ask'd Counſel and ſo ended the matter. And here, I cannot but mention to his honour, the uncommon talent he had, not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine controverſies according to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtice; but alſo commonly in ſuch a manner as would be to the good ſatisfaction of all parties, that they were wont to go away contented, pleas'd, in perfect amity one with another; and admiring the man that had done them ſo great ſervice; that it may be in a good meaſure ſaid of him, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of himſelf: <hi>Unto him men gave ear, and waited, and kept ſilence at his counſel. After his words they ſpake not again, and his ſpeech dropped upon them, and they waited for him as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. He choſe out our way and ſat chief, and was one that comforted the mourners,</hi> Job 29. 21, 22, 23, 25.</p>
               <p>Neither may I omit to Recognize ſome ſpecial vertues, in which he did ſhine with a particular luſtre. He was courteous and very obliging to all, and had a particular ſweetneſs of Converſation: his riches and exaltation did not render him offenſively aſſuming, but gave him the opportunity of recommending himſelf
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003379_0030_0FF82193830E12F0"/>ſo much the more by his affability and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions; he was as free from ſourneſs and moroſity, as almoſt any man living; natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed to an innocent and moderate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs; and yet had a particular skill in commanding reverence from all that convers'd with him.</p>
               <p>He was pitiful and compaſſionate to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures in their diſtreſſes, and troubles, and always ready as well as able to help them; often hath he delivered the needy, when they came to him, the poor alſo and him that had none to help him. How often and how glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath he aſſiſted the fatherleſs, and made the widow's heart to ſing for joy: <hi>He put on righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and it clothed him, his judgment was a robe and a diadem, he was eyes to the blind, and feet was he to the lame; he was a father to the poor, and the cauſe which he knew not, he ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, he brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the ſpoil out of their teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was of a peaceable and quiet ſpirit, and watchful and diligent in maintaining and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving peace and quietneſs among his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and among his people: he had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular greatneſs of ſoul, and was of a right publick ſpirit; and as God bleſſed him with a plentiful Eſtate, ſo he gave him an heart to do good with the ſame; for he was truly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, as he made manifeſt on all inviting oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; liberal both in publick contributions and donations, as alſo in private charities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the world knew any thing of.</p>

Amiable alſo he appears if we view him in every relation; a dutiful Son, very reſpectful to his aged Parents, neither of which have been many, and one of which hath not been two years dead; a moſt kind and loving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; a wiſe and a tender Father; a good Neighbour; a faſt Friend; a faithful Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; Miniſterial; a hearty Lover of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and of all good men.</p>
               <p>In Religion, he was ſound in the faith, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and conſcientious in the practiſe, as well as in the profeſſion of it: he was not a talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but a real Chriſtian: never admired the noiſe, but always the thing: great was his regard to the houſe of God, and very exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a conſtancy, ſeaſonableneſs, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of attending upon the publick Worſhip: in leſſer and controverted points, he was of a moderate and charitable ſpirit, and was mainly concerned for the great things of God's law, mercy, judgment and faith: to practiſe them himſelf, and to promote them in others. His converſation, was pure, and blameleſs, and unſtain'd from his youth up: and I am perſwaded that he acted under the governing influence of the fear of God, and a ſincere aim to honour and pleaſe him in the conduct of himſelf, both in a publick and a private capacity; and as he viſibly liv'd the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſo he had the advantage thereof in his laſt hours; patient, reſign'd, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a comfortable hope: his tho'ts and his ſpeech were much of Religion, and the things
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003379_0032_0FF8219669DD3960"/>of another world: and among other ſavoury expreſſions, he ſaid, <q>He hop'd God would not gather his Soul with Sinners, when he ſhould die; for he had not lov'd their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when living, and that above all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had lov'd the habitation of God's houſe, and the place where his honour dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</q> And ſome of the laſt words which I ever heard him ſpeak, at the concluſion of ſome religious diſcourſe, were, <q>That after all he could venture himſelf upon the Goſpel way of acceptance and Salvation.</q> And the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of charity is, that he is gone to the <hi>Hades</hi> of the bleſſed.</p>
