            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS I am this day called to adminiſter the ordinance of baptiſm among you, in a way different from what you have been acquainted with, it is proper for me to give you our reaſons for ſo doing<note n="*" place="bottom">Since this year began, the ſpirit of God has been evidently and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully working, by his convincing, converting and comforting influences, upon many ſouls in Bridgewater. The perſon now baptized was Mr. Seth Howard, in his 78th year; and though ſome raged againſt it before, yet a large aſſembly that met behaved very decently.</note>, eſpecially ſince this way has every where been ſpoken againſt, even ſo much as to make ſome pious people ſuppoſe, that we hold the virtue of the ordinance to be in much water; and that we are not only cruel to our own children, but alſo ſo rigid as to exclude many good Chriſtians from our communion, only for their want of compliance with one particular mode; notwithſtanding the apoſtle ſays, "Neither cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature."</p>
            <p>This, my friends, is a plain ſpecimen of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation about theſe matters, which has been received by tradition from our fathers; but whether it be any better than vain converſation, a brief ſtating of the caſe may enable you to judge. The faculty of ſpeech was given us for the more eaſy communication of our ideas to each other, for mutual benefit. But, after a long and tedious debate of old, the great giver of this faculty ſaid, "Who is this that darkeneth counſel by WORDS WITHOUT KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE!" And one of the greateſt maſters of reaſon and language in the Engliſh nation obſerves, that the way of many diſputants, even with regard to the WORDS upon which their arguments turn, reſembles a trader, who, in caſting up his accounts, ſhould take the figure 8, and call it ſometimes ſeven, and ſometimes nine, as would beſt ſuit his advantage. Yea, that many expoſitors, both of divine and human laws, by the time they have done
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:016196_0003_0F9BD40EED18B168"/>explaining them, make the WORDS to mean either nothing at all, or what they pleaſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Locke on human underſtanding, b. 3, c. 10, p. 5—12.</note>. Which vain deceit God has expreſly warned us againſt, as what he ſaw would be uſed, to impoſe ordinances upon us "after the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and commandments of men;" with a ſhow of wiſdom, though in reality only "to the ſatisfying of the fleſh." Gal. vi. 12, Col. ii. 8, 22, 23. For remedy againſt which, he commands us to "hold faſt the form of ſound words;" and to turn away from ſuch as have "a form of godlineſs, but deny the power thereof." The form is to be held faſt "in faith and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus." A form is aſſumed to cover thoſe who are lovers of their own ſelves: Yea, "lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God." 2 Tim. i. 13, and iii. 2—5. A form of man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention often calls the natural offspring of profeſſors, heirs of promiſe. The form calls them "children of wrath, even as others." Eph. ii. 3. Yea, the form ſays, "that which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh;—ye muſt be born again." John iii. 6, 7. Compare theſe things with what the word of truth ſays of circumciſion, and it will bring us directly to the caſe in hand. Many believing Jews were not only zealous for the continuance of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to their children, but alſo to have the ſame impoſed upon the Gentile converts. To whom therefore the apoſtle ſaid, "In Jeſus Chriſt neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love—but a new creature. Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the commandments of God." Gal. v. 6, and vi. 15, 1 Cor. vii. 19. Once that was his command; and while it was ſo, obedience thereto muſt be yielded by every Iſraelite, or elſe he muſt be cut off from that church. But now that command is out of date, which made their attempt ſtill to obey it of no avail, to be nothing; yea, in ſome reſpects, worſe than nothing. And how can any token of church-memberſhip, that is founded upon the covenant of circumciſion, be any better now than it was in the apoſtles days? For when many who were born in that covenant, and had received the token of it, came to the firſt adminiſtrator of baptiſm, he ſaid, "who hath
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016196_0004_0F9BD4100ACFAF58"/>warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance; and think not to ſay within yourſelves, we have Abraham to our father; for I ſay unto you, that God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham." Matt. iii. 7—9. And our Lord's commiſſion to his miniſters is, to "teach and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize," to "preach the goſpel to every creature: He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved." Matt. xxviii. 19, Mark xvi. 15, 16. Which order of things they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on the day of Pentecoſt, when "they who gladly received the word were baptized.—And the Lord added to the church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved." Acts ii. 41, 47. Or, as an excellent author renders it, "the ſaved<note n="‡" place="bottom">Edwards on a right to ſacraments, p. 53. Yet a noted miniſter in Boſton has preſumed to deny that ſaving grace is a qualification, without which perſons may not come to the Lord's table. And of the viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt he ſays. "The inſtitutions of this kingdom are all of them ſo contrived, as to be, at once, equally and powerfully adapted both to begin and carry on the work of ſanctification in the ſouls of all that are members of it. The divinely appointed way, in which perſons become members of the viſible church of Chriſt, is utterly inconſiſtent with the ſuppoſition, that, in order to their being ſo, they muſt be the ſubjects of ſaving faith, or judged to be ſo." Chauncy's five ſermons on breaking of bread, 1772, p. 95, 105, 106. This is one fruit of confounding the Jewiſh and Chriſtian covenants together.</note>." And this form, this order of things, appears in all their after proceedings. And the divine promiſe to the church, "that all her children ſhould be taught of God," is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by our Saviour, as meaning ſuch a teaching and learning as draws every man of them to "come unto him." Iſai. liv. 13, John vi. 45. We therefore would uſe every goſpel means to draw children and others to Chriſt, and then into his church; but know of no warrant for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to baptiſm "before they come to Chriſt." Many will allow that this was neceſſary in the firſt planting of Chriſtianity, who yet will have it, that the members of the Chriſtian church brought their infants afterwards to baptiſm upon their faith, becauſe they ſay they are in the ſame covenant of grace which was made with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in Gen. xvii. But we ought to remember that Abraham had no warrant from that covenant to circumciſe any one but ſuch as were born in his houſe, or bought with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016196_0005_0F9BD410C5776618"/>his money. The firſt warrant which was given to that church to admit ſtrangers by houſholds, was on the day when they came out of Egypt. Exod. xii. 48. And the form of ſound words is expreſs, that Chriſt is mediator of a better covenant, that is, not according to the covenant which God made with Iſrael on that day. The one he calls "the firſt and the old covenant," the other the ſecond and the new covenant, and ſays, "he taketh away the firſt that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond." Heb. viii. 6—13, and x. 9. And one of the plaineſt points of difference betwixt thoſe two covenants is this, that the firſt took in great numbers that did "not know God, nor his forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy;" the other requires that knowledge in every member, "from the leaſt to the greateſt." Deut. xxix. 10—13, Heb. viii. 10—12. And though many would have it, that this diſtinction is only in the efficacy of the adminiſtrations, and not in the covenants; yet it is certain that the efficacy of the "covenant of circumciſion" was the ſame to Abraham, as that of the new covenant is to believers now; as he looked by faith through that ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Acts. vii. 8, Rom. iv. 11. And if men had not daringly taken away theſe names which the book of God calls the covenants by, and added thereto words of their own invention, this controverſy would doubtleſs have ceaſed long ago.</p>
            <p>And had it not been for the like practice concerning the manner of baptiſm, we apprehend we ſhould never have heard ſprinkling called a mode of baptiſm, any more than we ſhould have heard ſprinkling called a mode of dipping: This being the very meaning of the word baptiſm<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Ruſſell, in the Portſmouth diſpute, p. 105. And Dr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> body of divinity, vol. 3, p. 333.</note> For the word of truth ſays, we are "buried by it, buried in it;" and all know that to be buried is to be covered. And the great deſign of that goſpel inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is well deſcribed by the before named excellent author, who ſays,</p>
            <p>"That baptiſm, by which the primitive converts were admitted into the church, was uſed as an exhibition and token of their being viſibly "regenerated, dead to ſin, alive to God, having the old man crucified," being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016196_0006_0F9BD411D14A1620"/>from the reigning power of ſin, being made free from ſin, and become the ſervants of righteouſneſs, thoſe ſervants of God that have their "fruit unto that holineſs whoſe end is everlaſting life," as is evident by Rom. vi. throughout.—He don't mean, only, that their baptiſm laid them under ſpecial obligations to theſe things, and was a mark and token of their engagement to be thus hereafter; but was deſigned as a mark, token and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, of their being viſibly thus already<note n="‡" place="bottom">Edwards on a right to ſacraments, p. 20.</note>."</p>
            <p>This is an exact deſcription of our ſentiments concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, and muſt we not act accordingly, for fear it ſhould condemn the practice of others? We abhor the thoughts of interrupting the worſhip of any who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us; or of uſing any ſort of violence, to enforce our ſentiments upon them. And though there have been Baptiſts formed into church ſtate in this land for theſe 140 years, yet our adverſaries have been forced to go above 100 years further back, and over to a country 3300 miles off, in order to get any ſuch thing to reproach us with, that ever was done under the Baptiſt name. And this mean and ſcandalous practice toward us was repeated in the Boſton Gazette, no longer ago than the firſt day of laſt month. But that is ſo far from being our caſe, that in 1644 a law was made in Boſton, to baniſh any man out of their juriſdiction, that ſhould only oppoſe infant ſprinkling, or that ſhould depart from the place where any were going to adminiſter it. In 1651, two Baptiſt miniſters were ſeized, only for peaceably worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God with a Chriſtian brother at Lynn, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned and fined at Boſton, where one of them was moſt cruelly ſcourged. Four years after, a pious member of the church in Charleſtown was convinced that he had no divine warrant to bring his child to baptiſm; yet was ſtill deſirous to continue in the communion of that church; but only for his refuſing to bring his child, or to ſtand up and look on when they ſprinkled infants, they cenſured and excluded him therefrom. And for his join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others in forming the firſt Baptiſt church in Boſton, he was disfranchiſed, fined, impriſoned and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016196_0007_0F9BD4124EDCCF40"/>baniſhed. And no tongue can deſcribe all the deceit and cruelty that Paedobaptiſts have been guilty of towards our denomination, from that time to this. No longer ago than the 26th of laſt June, the worſhip of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of Chriſtians, in this State, was violently interrupted, and a horrid mockery of this divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was committed, in order to prevent their acting in it according to their conſciences.<note n="*" place="bottom">The proofs of the former part of theſe facts may be ſeen in our Baptiſt hiſtory, p. 150, 216—237, 359, &amp;c.
<p>An account of this laſt affair was publiſhed Oct. 15, 1778, Pepperell's anſwer thereto on Nov. 12, and our reply on Dec. 3. All in the Boſton Independent Chronicle.</p>
               </note>. And the two great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt complaints that our opponents make againſt us at this day are, becauſe we refuſe tamely to yield to ſuch burdens, as they are not willing to touch with one of their fingers.</p>
            <p>I challenge their whole party to produce an inſtance, if they can, of their communing at the Lord's table with any perſon that they did not think was baptiſed; yet they have no better ground to accuſe us of rigidneſs upon, than becauſe we refuſe to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Again, the greateſt plea for our preſent war againſt Britain, is becauſe ſhe claimed a power to tax us where we were not repreſented; yet our opponents here have claimed and exerciſed ſuch a power over us for theſe 140 years. And they have no other colour for their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt our denomination, of diſobeying govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or diſturbing the peace of it, than our refuſal of any active obedience to that uſurpation, and our plainly expoſing the evil thereof to the public. And had not the Britons as good a pretence to call the Americans rebels upon, as any here have for the above accuſation againſt us? Nothing prolongs controverſy more, than a miſ-ſtating and miſrepreſenting of the queſtion in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. The word of truth plainly ſpeaks of thoſe who get into the Chriſtian church without ſaving faith, as thieves who did not come in by the door, but that they crept in unawares. John x. 9, Gal. ii. 4, Jude iv. Therefore the queſtion in hand is not whether thieves do not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times creep into houſes, or into churches; but it is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when we ſee them we may conſent with them, or
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016196_0008_0F9BD4181FDD97C0"/>whether it is not our indiſpenſable duty to turn away from thoſe who do ſo? Pſal. l. 16, 18, 2d Tim. iii. 5, 6. Yea, and to attend cloſely upon the means and ways that God has appointed, for the guarding his church againſt and purging it from all ſuch evils. Matt. vii. 6, 15, 16, Luke vi. 42—45, Rom. x. 10, 1ſt. Cor. v. 7—13. We are far from ſuppoſing the efficacy of baptiſm to lie in much or little water. It is wholly in obedience to God, and in his bleſſing thereon. But how many are there of our accuſers, who will ſcarcely allow that infants can be ſaved without it? And I intreat you to conſider what tendency it muſt have, to tell perſons that they were born in the covenant of grace, and that they had the ſame ſealed to them in their infancy. For it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that natural birth, and all that parents and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can do for us, can never raiſe one ſoul above the power of ſelf-love; and what dreadful work has that principle lately made among us? It has plainly verified the words of HIM who ſays, "this know alſo, that in the laſt days perilous times ſhall come; for men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God; having a form of godlineſs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the power thereof; from ſuch turn away."</p>
            <p>And as it is certain, that Chriſtianity was firſt planted and was propagated through the world, for 300 years, by TRUTH and LOVE, without, and often againſt, the uſe of ſecular force; can the power thereof be more plainly denied in any way, than by declaring that natural birth and the doings of men can bring us into it, and that it would ſoon fail if it was not ſupported by tax and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion?</p>
