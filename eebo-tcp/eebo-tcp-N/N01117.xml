            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Inhabitants of <hi>New-England</hi> had for many Years before the Late Happy <hi>Revolution,</hi> Enjoy'd the Liberty and Property of as Free and Eaſy a <hi>Charter</hi> as a People could Deſire; and this too, with as much Satisfaction and Loyalty on their part, as Malice and Envy on that of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; who, from a Perſecuting Spirit, looking upon this their <hi>Charter</hi> with an evil Eye, took up an Implacable Reſolution of Robbing them of it. They had no ſooner Effected this, but a vaſt Scene of Miſery appear'd; and they found among the Principal Inſtruments of this Miſchief, <hi>One,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, J. Dodley, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is a Native of New En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Born at or near a place call'd Roxbury, 2 Miles from Boſton.</note> 
               <hi>whom their own Womb had brought forth, and whoſe Breaſts had Nouriſh'd!</hi> But the Unhappy (or rather Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py) Reign of the Late K. <hi>J.</hi> running Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly upon its own Ruin, made well for the Deliverance of <hi>New-England;</hi> without which, doubtleſs the People had fell a Sacrifice to <hi>French</hi> and Popiſh Slavery:</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:001331_0007_0FB27CAC11C15190"/>We ſhall not Recriminate here the Miſmanagements of the then Governour Sir <hi>Edmond Androſs,</hi> ſince that Gentleman is now in a Future State; but by the way, we think it highly Neceſſary to ſay ſome Matters of Fact, of the preſent Governour <hi>Dudley,</hi> who, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaid Sir <hi>E.

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the firſt Opportunity to diſcover him of a Mercenary Intereſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the People were ſomething Surpris'd to ſee the publick Offices and Places of Truſt ſnatch'd from them, and Conferr'd on Strangers on one hand, and the Avarice and Beggary of a Crew of Mercenary Fellows, Supported by Extortion on t'other. But, when the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was pleaſed, out of an Active and Paſſive Principle, to tell our Countreymen, in open Council, <hi>That the People in</hi> New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>were all Slaves; and that the</hi> only <hi>Difference between Them and Slaves, was their not being</hi> Bought <hi>and</hi> Sold: <hi>And that they muſt not think the Priviledges of</hi> Engliſhmen <hi>would follow them to the end of the World.</hi> I ſay, when the People heard this, they lookt upon themſelves in a manner Loſt. On one Hand they ſaw their Enemies inveſted with a full Power in the Government; on t'other they ſaw themſelves not only turn'd out of the Publick Miniſtry, but under a Neceſſitous Fear of being Quiet, leſt their Eſtates ſhould be Siezed, and themſelves Impriſoned. On this ſide they ſaw their Wives and Children, their Fathers, Mothers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Butchered daily by a Handful of Barbarous Indians; on t'other ſide, little or no Reſiſtance made by their Armies, which were Commanded by thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; inſomuch that it ſeem'd rather an intended Maſſacre, than a Deſire of putting an End to a Diabolick and Bloody War. They ſaw then, that they had to their Coſt, brought forth a <hi>Prophet,</hi> who told them they were Slaves; and they then ſaw his Prophecy fulfilling; In fine, they ſaw all this, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd no way to Eſcape; till throwing up their Cryes to Heaven, they were animated by Divine Power, to Reſcue themſelves and Children from the approaching Ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001331_0008_0FB27CAEDA27ADC0"/>Under the Preſſure of all theſe Grievances, they Unanimouſly aroſe, upon the coming in of the late King <hi>William,</hi> of Bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Siezed the Government for His Majeſty's Uſe; and, amongſt the reſt of the Authors of their Miſeries, not unjuſtly Impriſon'd this their preſent Governour.</p>
            <p>From that time <hi>New-England</hi> took Heart, and concluded that Heaven was removing from them all the Plagues in their Land. They indeed Thankfully Rejoyced to ſee themſelves Reſtored to their Ancient Liberty, as afterwards in a great Meaſure they were by another Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the former Actions of the Author of the following Matters of Fact, which has rendred His Love to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, His Veneration for the Liberty and Property of a Free People, His Fidelity, Juſtice, and Loyalty, in delivering the Oppreſſed, and detecting the Queen's profeſs'd Enemies, but the Reverſe of Good Mens Actions, and ought to be Remembred only as ſo many Monuments of Infamy.</p>
            <p>But to come down to our Memorial, and inform the World of the modern Miſmanagements of this unhappy Gentleman, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Declare, That</p>
            <p>THE Trade with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> being ſo countenanced by the Governour, that without ſpeedy Remedy, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is in great Danger of being Ruined, which will plainly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In the Year 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>5. The Governour ſent his Son, <hi>William Dudley</hi> with Captain <hi>Vetch,</hi> to <hi>Canada,</hi> under a pretence of Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Captives; but brought very few back to <hi>Boſton</hi> of thoſe that were there, and them of the Meaneſt ſort, leaving the Principal of the ſaid Captives behind, to give them occaſion of going again, that they might have a Pretence to Colour their Treacherous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Trading, as Appears by the ſaid <hi>Vetch</hi>'s Acknowledgment, of going to Settle a Correſpondency with the Enemy, and carrying a Cargo out with him of 800 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> which, according to their Diſpoſal,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001331_0009_0FB27CAFC90A7FB8"/>
might amount to near 3000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> as particularly Shot, which was Sold at 13 <hi>Sous per</hi> Pound; whereof they carried a conſiderable Quantity, alſo Rigging, Pitch, Iron, and other Neceſſaries, fit for ſupplying the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> and this done under a Colour, of the ſaid <hi>Vetch</hi>'s going to get in a Debt due to him, from the <hi>French,</hi> of 800 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> with the Governour's Approbation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For Settling a Correſpondency with the <hi>French</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> for Exchange of Priſoners; Whereas, it was indeed, only a Cover for an Illegal Trade; when, at the ſame time, the <hi>French</hi> there, were drove to ſuch extream Hardſhips, for want of Ammunition, Proviſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that moſt of their Principal People were forced to go out a Privateering on our Coaſts, who were afterwards taken and brought into <hi>Boſton;</hi> particularly one <hi>Battis,</hi> a Man of great Note and Service among the Enemy, who had been a Barbarous, Murdering Fellow, to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> He, with all the other <hi>French</hi> Priſoners, were ſent to <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and Diſcharged; but great part of our People that were Priſoners, were left behind at the ſame time, and that, becauſe our Governour had been falſe in his Promiſe, to the <hi>French</hi> Governour, who had reſtrained the <hi>Indians</hi> from diſturbing our Fiſhery, and indeed would not allow them any Ammunition for a conſiderable time, till our Governour taking that Opportunity of the <hi>Indians,</hi> great Want countenanced a Trade with them, and ſupply'd them by the Veſſels that were ſent as Tranſports (as aforeſaid) to fetch Priſoners; when at the ſame time they were made Veſſels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, as appears by the <hi>Indian</hi> Traders on their Tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Country are at a vaſt Charge, in maintaining an Army Yearly, to March ſeveral Hundred Miles up into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to Deſtroy the <hi>Indians</hi> Corn, the better to diſinable them to Subſiſt; for they have been ſo Reduced (as by Information of the Captives) that a great part of them would Periſh for Want, were it not for the Supply they had from the ſaid <hi>Indian</hi> Traders; who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Sold about Eight Quarts of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn for one large <hi>Beaver</hi> Skin; which Trade has been all along countenanced by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which ſufficiently Appears, by his being always Unwilling
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001331_0010_0FB27CB5D93BAFB0"/>
the Priſoners taken in that Trade ſhould be Fined, or Puniſhed, even owned by <hi>Vetch,</hi> as in his Petition more at large, is ſet forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Country was at a great Expence, in Erecting a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification at <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> and maintaining a number of Soldiers for ſecuring the ſame, thereby to ſuppreſs the Enemy, and keep ſure Footting in that part of the Country; and the Governour, through ſome Deſign or Neglect, did ſuffer thoſe Soldiers to remain there without any Commiſſion Officer, to the great Diſſatisfaction and Dread to the Soldiers; inſomuch, that they Declared to Captain <hi>Cally,</hi> (a Member of the Aſſembly at <hi>Boſton</hi>) that when the Enemy came upon them, they would Surrender the Fort, and dare not Reſiſt for want of a Commiſſion. Then Captain <hi>Cally</hi> made Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Aſſembly, which he found Sitting when he came to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and they repreſented to the Governour, that ſpeedy care might be taken, that ſome Perſon might be Commiſſionated to Command that Fort, which, with a great deal of Difficulty, was at laſt Obtained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And further, as to the Governour's countenancing this Private and Illegal Trade, the Country has been at vaſt Expence, occaſioned thereby; inſomuch, that at one Seſſions the laſt Summer, the Aſſembly were forc'd to raiſe 33000 Pounds, for Supporting and Maintaining the Charge they were put to, by the Enemies In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions, after they had a Supply; that whereas, if things were rightly Managed, and the Enemy kept back for want of thoſe Supplies, one Third Part of the ſaid Sum might have anſwer'd the End. The <hi>Indians</hi> that were Supply'd by thoſe Traders, are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People that Deſtroyed our <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts, the Fiſhery, and the Coaſt of <hi>Accady;</hi> and alſo the very ſame that were at Deſtroying of <hi>New-found land;</hi> particularly one <hi>Eſcombu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> a Principal Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among them, who is generally one that Heads the <hi>Indians,</hi> when they come to Deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Governour, with his Son <hi>Paul,</hi> not being Content with what Money they come fairly by, and over greedy of Gain, are very Screwing and Exacting upon the People, particularly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſundry Inhabitants, taking away their Priviledge in catching
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001331_0011_0FB27CB821168138"/>
of Whales, a Priviledge they have Enjoyed many Years before; that is, (under Pretence of Drift Fiſh) what Whales are taken by Her Majeſty's Subjects, he takes from them by Force, not giving them the Liberty of a Tryal at <hi>Common-Law,</hi> but for his own Ends, decides the Matter in the Admiralty, where his Son <hi>Paul</hi> is the Queen's Attourny and Advocate, thereby Encroaching the whole to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a thing never heard of before, and very much to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Her Majeſty's good Subjects there, and that without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> As to the Addreſs the Governour Obtained, pretended to come over from the General Aſſembly at <hi>Boſton,</hi> in his favour, for his Continuance, it was no more than what he Clandeſtinely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, by ſending to his particular Friends; ſuch, who being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Related to him, or bore Commiſſions under him, dare not deny his Requeſt, and was never approved nor allowed of by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; but on the Contrary, had not the Majority of the Country, waited in Expectation of Her Majeſty's Favour, in ſending another Governour, they would largely have ſignified their Reſentments and Diſſatisfaction, in the Adminiſtration of <hi>Dudly</hi>'s Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> While the Great and General Aſſembly at <hi>Boſton</hi> were Sitting, there arrived a Flagg of Truce from <hi>Canada,</hi> with a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Demand of the Governour, for all the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him with breach of Promiſe, which was the occaſion of the <hi>French</hi> Governour's not ſending ſeveral of the Priſoners, particularly a Miniſter that was taken Captive at <hi>Derefield,</hi> detained by the <hi>French,</hi> who might have been Diſcharged with ſundry others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The Lower Houſe, miſtruſting the <hi>French</hi> Flagg of Truce coming upon a Trading Deſign, as well as for Priſoners, ordered the Flagg of Truce to be diligently Searched, who found on Board their Veſſel ſundry new Arms and Ammunition, hid in Private Places, particularly new Bullets, hid among Peaſe, and yet denied by the Commander, who was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Renagado, which Ammunition being brought before the Aſſembly, were generally concluded to be Bought in <hi>Boſton;</hi> whereupon, the Governour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001331_0012_0FB27CBB10385030"/>
the Matter was huſhed up and Conniv'd at, to the great Diſſatisfaction of the Aſſembly, and Country in general.</p>
            <p>This being realy the State of <hi>New-England,</hi> and its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, it may very well be called Deplorable, when it is render'd the very Scene of Arbitrary Power, with all that's Miſerable: But to proceed, before I come down to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Affidavits upon theſe Heads, it is Convenient to Recite ſome Letters from the Inhabitants of that Place, who, under a deep Senſe of their Approaching Ruin, have breath'd forth their Complaints in the following Words.</p>

                  <p>INaſmuch, as you have Expected from me, a true and brief Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of ſeveral Matters, relating to this Province, I ſhall, with all poſſible Faithfulneſs, endeavour it. Our preſent Governour is not without a number of thoſe, whom he has by Promotions and Flatteries made his Friends; but this hinders not a much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number, from wiſhing, that we had a Governour, who would put an end unto the horrid Reign of Bribery, in our Adminiſtration, and who would not infinitely Incommode Her Majeſty's Service, by keeping the People in continual Jealouſies of his Plots, upon their moſt Valuable Interests.</p>
                  <p>What the diſpoſition of the People towards him is, you may gueſs by this: There was lately prepared an Addreſs from hence, to the <hi>Queen,</hi> upon many important Articles; but by certain Arts there was got into it a Clauſe, to deſire of the <hi>Queen,</hi> that this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our might be continued, the Repreſentatives Voted all the reſt of the Addreſs, but this Clauſe they abſolutely Rejected; they could not get above Five or Six Votes for it, ſo the whole Addreſs, (which was contrived by a Party for nothing but that Clauſe) fell to the ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001331_0013_0FB27CBC9C8DC8B0"/>There happened lately a number of Perſons, namely, <hi>Boreland Vetch, Rouſe, Lawſon, Philips</hi> and <hi>Cauplin</hi> to be taken manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unlawful Trade with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein they Traded, were ſuch, that the late Act of Parliament made their Crime to be <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> and we had no <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Province</hi> relating to that Matter, but was defectively Expreſſed: Our merciful Aſſembly was mighty loathe to proceed unto ſo ſevere a Judgment as that of Death, upon theſe Offenders. The Offenders Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning for it, the General Aſſembly were (very much by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours influence) drawn into it, to take the Tryal of them into their own Hands; and as only Guilty of an High Miſdemeanour, the Vote for it was obtained in a Thin Houſe, upon an hurry at breaking up; and ſome Clauſes in the Charter were ſo Conſtrued, as to Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon their coming together again, they would fain have revoked their Votes, as fearing, that the very Perſons who had been their Tempters into it, would turn their Accuſers, and improve it by way of Complaint, for the Enemies of our Charter to work upon; but the Governour would by no means permit the Revocation of that wrong Step, (if it were one) ſo the Tryal proceeded, and the Offenders were Fined in ſeveral Sums, by an <hi>Act</hi> of the Governour and Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>It is now ſaid, that the ingrateful Men who were ſaved from the Gallows, by the Tenderneſs of the Government, are now cutting our Throats, and Petition home against the Government, for Fining them inſtead of Hanging them; yea, it is alſo ſaid, that the very Perſon who was the chief Cauſe of drawing the Aſſembly into this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Proceeding, intends to make an ill uſe of it, against the Country; if you are ſenſible of any thing of this nature carrying on, we pray you to add unto the reſt of your Offices, that of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, that an harmleſs People, ſurpriz'd into any Error, may not be Puniſhed any otherwiſe, than by the removal of ſuch as have been the Cauſes of it; and ſo much for that.</p>

                     <hi>Sir,</hi> You would do a vast Service to the Crown, if you would ſet forward the deſigns of reducing <hi>Canada,</hi> and poſſeſſing <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> a much leſs Fleet than what annually goes into the <hi>Indies,</hi> coming early enough in the Spring, may eaſily do the former, even in the way thither; and a <hi>Scotch Colony</hi> might be of good Conſequence to do the latter; but if any aſſiſtance from <hi>New-England</hi> ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this matter, it is of abſolute neceſſity that the Country have a Governour whom the People may ſomewhat Rely upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> You are Born to do the <hi>Queen</hi> and the Nation Service; you are ſpirited for great undertakings; you are highly beloved and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among our People in this Land, and where-ever you have come, 'tis wiſhed that you may do ſome conſiderable Action in this Affair.</p>
                  <p>I have been earneſtly Sollicited to Addreſs one of the most Illuſtrious Patriots of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, my Lord High Treaſurer, with ſome of theſe Intimations: That Noble Perſon is known to be ſuch a Patron to all good Men, and ſuch a defence of Oppreſſed Innocence and Liberties, that we all fly to him as our unqueſtionable Refuge. I am well ſatisfied there would need nothing (to ſpeak Humanely) to make this Country Eaſy and Happy, but for that excellent <hi>Perſon</hi> to have an exact Repreſentation of our Circumſtances; nothing hinders me from attempting it, but the hazard of doing what may be thought a preſumption in one ſo much a ſtranger to him, nevertheleſs, I am deſired by ſome conſiderable <hi>Perſons</hi> to move you, that you would wait upon his Lordſhip, and fully acquaint him with the Matters now laid before you,</p>

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001331_0015_0FB27CC7DF68A640"/>
the extream Diſtreſs whereto the <hi>French</hi> Invaſion had brought St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> and <hi>Nevis,</hi> the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> in a moſt Chriſtian manner expreſſed their Charity towards thoſe, who perhaps would have hardly done the like for them, on a like Occaſion. We made a Collection for the Relief of their Neceſſities, the Collection was, as I am told, between 7 and 800 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> in this Collection, there were two Churches in <hi>Boſton,</hi> the <hi>South</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> one gave ſomewhat above a 100 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> the other gave a little under it. Certainly, a Country ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſerve Her Majeſty, and to help their fellow Subjects, ought to have a room in the Thoughts of all good Men in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>The foregoing Letter carrying with it ſo many undeniable Truths, the World muſt of conſequence concede with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Exclamations of the now Diſtreſſed <hi>New-Englanders.</hi> Indeed the Publick had not been allarm'd with theſe Diſtant Calamities, had the inexorable Authors of them adhered to reitterated Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, from thoſe who too ſeverely ſuffer'd under their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.

            <p>In the foregoing Letters we find ſeveral things Worthy our Remark; but I ſhall only mention the Three following:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That without Money, there is no Juſtice to be had in</hi> New-England; So that the meaner ſort, doubtleſs, is in a Deplorable Condition; the faces of their Poor being ground to Duſt; their Widows Houſes laid Waſte, and the hopes of their Offspring cut off. From whence we may infer, that <hi>New-England</hi> having a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, whoſe God is the Mammon of this World; whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples act Counter to the Deſign of his Power; and whoſe Drift is the Ruin of his own Country; the Inhabitants thereof have nothing but Juſtice on their part to Petition Her Majeſty to throw him aſide.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>A general uneaſineſs under, and oppoſition to this Governour, thro' the whole Country.</hi> And this, methinks, might ſtop the Mouths of ſome People here, (who, not knowing the Nature of this affair, no otherwiſe than as their Intereſt leads them to ſide with the Governour, or by Virtue of a bare Friendſhip Contracted with him whilſt he Reſided in <hi>England</hi>) and put a Period to all their Objections in his Behalf; eſpecially One, unhappily let ſlip from the Mouth of a Gentleman too well known for his great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Parts, to be thought ſo over-ſighted, and that is to this Effect. <hi>If a Governour must be removed for every trivial Complaint, there wou'd be no End of ſuch Removals; and Her Majeſty's Miniſtry would be wholly taken up with turning out, and putting in.</hi> I will not pretend to affirm the Reaſon that produc'd this haſty Plea for our Criminal Governour; but ſure I am, the Author of it knows too much Law, than to extenuate the like Crimes in others. And a weak Argument I take it to indeavour the influencing our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors in Redreſſing Grievances of the Subject, when the ſeveral matters of Fact Sworn to, are laid down before them: But,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001331_0017_0FB27CCCD7F0AD68"/>
to ſay no more, this Gentleman has not been the firſt that has over-ſhot himſelf in Defending things of this Nature. And,</p>
            <p n="3">(3dly,) <hi>A fervent Deſire to be eas'd of Oppreſſion, i: e.</hi> That they might be capable of acknowledging with Reſpect and Gratitude, the mighty advantages of ſuch a Deliverance to the <hi>Queen</hi> of Great Brittain; to a <hi>Queen</hi> who is all Juſtice and Piety, Peace and Union; and a Queen who will not only hear the Petitions of her Subjects, but maintain them in their Rights and Priviledges. Let not <hi>New-England</hi> doubt then of finding Redreſs, from ſo Great and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Miſtreſs, notwithſtanding the ſubtle Deſigns and Evaſions of Evil-minded Men. And ſo we come to preſent the Reader with a further Account of the ſaid Miſmanagements, by another Hand.</p>
            <p>SOmetime in the Spring of the Year, 1706. Mr. <hi>Dudley,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Governour of the Province of <hi>Maſſachuſets Bay,</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> writ a Letter from <hi>Boſton,</hi> Directed to Mr. <hi>Richard Waldron,</hi> and my ſelf, to uſe our Intereſt to prevail with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at an Aſſembly, to Draw up an Addreſs to the <hi>Queen,</hi> That Her Majeſty would pleaſe to continue the ſaid <hi>Dudley</hi> in the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire:</hi> Whereupon the ſaid <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron</hi> (after he had Communicated the Letter to me) drew up an Addreſs, and ſhew'd it to the Aſſembly, and prevailed with them to paſs it in Both Houſes, with little Alteration. And this is the Addreſs that is now come over from the Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> The Aſſembly was much againſt it, but we thought it would be beſt for us to do any thing that would pleaſe the Governour at that time; conſidering, that we were always in danger of the Enemy, and concluded, it was much in his Power, under God, to preſerve us, having often heard him ſay, that he would ſtop the Courier of the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> (when he pleas'd) in a Month or Six Weeks time; and I did then, and do ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he could prevent the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> from coming upon us, and Killing us as they did; for I know that he had Correſpondence with a <hi>Fryer</hi> or <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> or one ſo called, a <hi>Frenchman</hi> that Lives among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and hath great influence over them, who Writes himſelf <hi>Galen Emeſary.</hi> The Governour, to my certain Knowledge, did order ſundry things that were ſent him;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001331_0018_0FB27CCDCA8275D0"/>
and, conſidering the great Correſpondence (he told me) he had with the Governour of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> it cauſed a firm belief in me, that he could do what he would with the Enemy: Theſe, with other Motives, preſs'd us forwards to get the Addreſs paſſed, concluding all theſe things would add to our Peace, if rightly improved; and the <hi>Indians,</hi> about that time, and for many Months before, had done little or no Miſchief, and for my part, I did really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it was the Governour's Intereſt that cauſed our quiet, but ſoon found we were Miſtaken, finding out, that much about the ſame time that <hi>Waldren</hi> and my ſelf were forwarding the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to Her Majeſty, to continue Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> Governour, he was countenancing a private Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> our Enemies, as we found by woful Experience: For ſoon after thoſe Traders went to the <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> came ſharply down upon us about the latter end of <hi>June</hi> laſt, Killed Six People, Wounded two, and carried away two from the Town of <hi>Almsbury,</hi> and a little before they Killed Lieutenant <hi>John Shapleigh,</hi> at the Town of <hi>Kittery,</hi> and a whole Family, as a Man, Wife and Children, all Killed and Scalped out of the Townſhip of <hi>Dover;</hi> and one Man Killed with Swan-ſhot out of the Townſhip of <hi>Hampton;</hi> and Nine Killed, one Wounded, and one carried out of the Townſhip of <hi>Exeter.</hi> All theſe Barbarities were committed before I came from thence, which was about the beginning of <hi>September</hi> laſt; God knows how many have been thus Barbarouſly Murther'd ſince. Captain <hi>Vetch,</hi> and Captain <hi>Lawſon,</hi> oftentimes told me, that they had oftentimes acquainted the Governour with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of going to the <hi>Eastward</hi> upon Trade, and had the conſent of him, and did ſolemnly proteſt they would not have gone without it: And I do believe, and it is generally believed in <hi>New-England,</hi> that the Governour did know of this Trade, and no doubt but he was to have a ſhare of the Profit. When theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders came from the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> one of their Veſſels ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the Iſle of <hi>Shoals,</hi> near the Province of New <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> the Maſter's Name was <hi>Rouſe,</hi> who brought to that place from <hi>Port Royal</hi> Seven Priſoners; and Capt. <hi>Jethro Furbur</hi> being at the ſaid Iſles of <hi>Shoales,</hi> at the ſaid time when the <hi>Veſſel</hi> came in, heard the ſaid Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners affirm, That the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Indians had no Shot, nor Bullets, nor Lead to make any, and it was very ſcarce with the <hi>French,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they could not ſupply them, ſo that the <hi>Indians</hi> were
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001331_0019_0FB27CD1FA3B5558"/>

               </gap>; and that if this Trade had not been incouraged by the Governour, we ſhould have had no Men Killed, nor indeed any Diſturbance amongſt us. It is my Belief, and it ſeems very plain to me, that the Governour intends to forward the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all they can, and keep the Country allarm'd, thereby to put them to ſuch vaſt Charges, as will Ruin the whole Government, by Killing ſome and Impoveriſhing the reſt. There was never ſuch Taxes on the Poor People as now; 33000<abbr>

I was credibly Informed that ſome Perſons were forced to cut open their Beds, and Sell the Feathers to Pay their Taxes. I do'nt remember that ever there was any of the <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy Kill'd or Taken ſince Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> came over Governour, except an Old Woman, and two others I took to be Girls by their Scalps; and ſome few taken near <hi>Port Royal</hi> taken by Major <hi>Church.</hi> So that inſtead of being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, I wiſh they be not preſerv'd: For, Six Months before it came to paſs, the Governour Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> told me, what Methods the <hi>Indians</hi> would take when they came again, and it proved accordingly. He told me, That the <hi>Indians</hi> would not come in any great Body as they uſed to do, but they would come in ſmall Numbers, no Number above Thirty, and ſo Line the Woods from <hi>Dearfield,</hi> which is the South-Weſt ſide of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Government, and all along the Woods, juſt without the Towns to <hi>Casko</hi> Bay, which is the North-Eaſt Part of Inhabitants at this time. And this Method I am afraid will be continued till the Country is for a great part Deſtroyed, if Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> be continued Governour. As for the Addreſs he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent further ſaith, that the Houſe of Repreſentatives, Inſiſted not only upon far greater Fines to be laid on the foreſaid Traders, and others Concerned: but alſo that they ſhould ſtand upon the Gallows, and ſuffer Twelve Months Impriſonment, and continued inſisting upon the ſame about Three Weeks, but Governour <hi>Dudley,</hi> not conſenting thereto, by his Wearying out the ſaid Houſe, and perſuading them to Moderate

Deponent further informed the ſaid Governour, that there was great Fleet of Engliſh and Dutch Men of War in the Straits, and if his Maſter could Sail before they came out, his Ship would be out of Danger of being taken, but if the Maſter was Detained, he ſhould Loſe his Ship and Cargo: And that if the Maſter had done any thing Amiſs he ought to be Tryed at <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> and not at <hi>Boſton;</hi> but this Deponent could get no Relief from the Governour; and thereupon went to the ſaid <hi>Paul Dudley,</hi> the Queens Advocate, of the Court of Admiralty, and Offered Ten Thouſand Pounds Bond, with good ſecurity to Pay whatever the Courts Sentence ſhould be; Provided his Maſter and Ship might go: But all in vain, and his Veſſel was Detained above Three Weeks, and when ſhe came into the Straights, the Men of War was come out Seven Days before ſhe Arrived there, and afterwards was taken, and further ſaith not.</p>

and indeed the Only Inducement to which, was the Apprehenſion they were then under, that it was better for them to do any thing that would Pleaſe the Governour; and that it was in his Power to Contribute much to the Advantage and Security, or to the Miſchief and Prejudice of that Province; and not any Opinion they had of the Conduct and Integrity of the ſaid <hi>Dudley,</hi> who is generally Diſliked and Ill-Thought of in both <hi>Provinces,</hi> where he is Governour; and has given too much Reaſon and Occaſion to Suſpect his Regard to the Good and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of thoſe Places, eſpecially when his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſtands in Competition, or a fair Opportunity offers, for his Profit and Advantage.</q>

            <p>Thus far the Affidavits of the Illegal and Diſloyal Practices of our Governour. Can any Man that loves not a <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, call thoſe Trivial; or ſay, they are not worthy of the ſevereſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? With what Face Men now a-days can go about to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify Crimes that have ſo near an affinity to High Treaſon, is a wonder to me; and yet pretend at the ſame time to be Loyal and True to their Country. Crimes of the moſt pernicious Conſequence to a State; and which, among all Nations, have been Puniſh'd with the utmoſt Severity. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> notwithſtanding the Liberty they gave to ſome of their Rulers, yet they appointed a Reckoning Day among them; ſo that thoſe that thought themſelves not accountable whilſt in Authority, found at laſt a very ſtrict Account to be given to certain Auditors, and a worſer Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted on them if Criminal, than the abuſed Clemency of this Age can produce: To do Juſtice and Right is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Jewel in <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and a Bleſſing which no People in the World can boaſt of, like thoſe of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Nation. The <hi>New-Englanders</hi> are of the ſame Tribe; have the ſame Liberty to, and the ſame Property in the Enjoyment of the many Legal Priviledges in that Charter contained: They are <hi>not Slaves,</hi> as their conceited Governour once told them; but have ſtill a right Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally to oppoſe his Pride and Covetouſneſs; have ſtill a Right to Petition for a Better, that will not be Brib'd to do Evil; they have a Right to tell the World, and that loudly, That for a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to furniſh the Enemy with Powder and Shot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to deſtroy his own Country-men, is a Wretch not only fit to be Diſcarded, but to be for ever forgotten among Mankind.</p>
            <p>The Cryes ſent up to Heaven, by the many poor Souls lately moſt inhumanely Butchered by the Mercileſs <hi>Indians,</hi> with our own Inſtruments, have reached the Ears of the Almighty, and will certainly draw down Redreſs from him, who is not only <hi>Rex Magnus &amp; Rex Solus,</hi> but <hi>Judex Supremus,</hi> who hath <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium fine fine,</hi> as well as <hi>fine Limite,</hi> to whom we commit all that hath been already ſaid.</p>

            <head>An Account of ſeveral Barbarities lately committed by the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> Intermix'd with ſome Memorable Providences.</head>
            <p>AStoniſhing Deliverances have been ſent from Heaven, to many of our Captives. They have been many a time upon the Point of Deſtruction; but, <hi>Theſe poor ones have Cryed unto the Lord,</hi> and He has Remarkably delivered them.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Wonderful Reſtraint from God upon the Bruitiſh Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, that no <hi>Engliſh Woman</hi> was ever known to have any Violence offered unto her <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> by any of them.</p>
            <p>'Tis wonderful, that no more of the Captives have been Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, neither when they were Drunk, nor when the Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio's, and the Cruelties of their Diabolical Natures were to be Gratified.</p>
            <p>'Tis Wonderful, that when many of the Captives have been juſt going to be Sacrificed, ſome ſtrange Interpoſition of the Divine Providence has put a ſtop to the Execution, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their being made a Sacrifice. The Stories are numberleſs. Take a few of them.</p>

               </gap>e of Indians had been three Days without any manner of Suſtenance. They took an Engliſh Child, and hung it before the Fire to Roaſt it for their Supper; but that theſe Canibals might Satiate their— I want a Name for it,—as well as their Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they would Roaſt it Alive. The Child began to Swell. A Cannow arrived at that Inſtant, with a Dog in it. The leſſer Devils of the Crue, propoſed their taking the Dog inſtead of the Child; they did ſo, and the Child is yet Living! Her Name is <hi>Hannah Parſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man had Valiantly Killed an Indian or two before the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages took him. He was next Morning to undergo in horrible Death, whereof the Manner and the Torture was to be aſſigned by the Widow <hi>Squa</hi> of the Dead Indian. The French Prieſts told him, they had indeavoured to divert the Tygres from their bloody Intention, but could not prevail with them; he muſt prepare for the terrible Execution, His cries to God were hard, and heard; when the Sentence of the <hi>Squa</hi> was demanded, quite contrary to every ones Expectation, and the Revengeful Inclination ſo uſual and well-known among theſe Creatures, ſhe only ſaid, <hi>His Death won't fetch my Husband to Life; Do nothing to him!</hi> So nothing was done to him.</p>
            <p>A Woman was carried aſide, by her Monſter of a Maſter; he faſtned a Rope about her Neck; it was in vain for her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, the Hatchet muſt preſently have diſpatched her, if the Halter had failed; ſhe had no Remedy but to Cry unto God: Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter throws up the end of the Rope over a Limb of a Tree; he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to hale her and tye her up; and then a fine Exploit for the Wretch! a <hi>memorable Name!</hi> However the Limb happily breaks down he falls; full of madneſs he goes to repeat his brave action: An Indian Commander juſt in the Nick of Time comes in upon him; Reproaches him very bitterly; Takes her away from him; and ſends her to <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we ought not to paſs over the marvellous Diſplay of the Power of God, in ſupporting and preſerving the poor Captives when they Travelled thro' the horrid Wilderneſs, oftentimes much more than a ſcore of Miles in a day, and thro' very deep Snows;
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001331_0038_0FB27D0B52AFDBF8"/>
and with vaſt Loads on their Backs, and grievouſly pinched with Hunger, having ſcarce one bit of any Refreſhment, for whole days together. Poor, Weak, ſick Women have done ſo!</p>
            <p>One cannot well imagine any other than Supernatural and Angelical aſſiſtances, in ſome of the inſtances.</p>
            <p>The Indians came upon the Houſe of one <hi>Adams</hi> at <hi>Wells,</hi> and Captivated the Man and his Wife, and aſſaſſinated the Children; whereof one, who had an Hatchet ſtruck into his Skull, and was left for dead, was ſtrangely recovered. The Woman had Lain in about Eight Days. Thay drag'd her out, and tied her to a Poſt, until the Houſe was rifled. They then looſed her, and bid her walk. She could not ſtir. By the help of a Stick ſhe got half a ſtep forward. She look'd up to God. On the ſudden a new ſtrength entred into her. She travelled that very Day Twenty Miles a Foot: She was up to the Neck in Water ſix times that very Day in paſſing of Rivers. At night ſhe fell over head and ears, into a Slough in a Swamp, and was hardly got out alive. She got not the leaſt Cough nor Cold by all this: She is come home alive unto us.</p>
            <p>Many more ſuch Inſtances might be mentioned. We will ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fede them all, with a Relation of what befel Mrs. <hi>Bradley</hi> of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly. Ab una Diſce omnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Vertuous Woman had been formerly for Two Years together a Captive in the Hands of the Barbarous Indians; a ſubject of wondrous Afflctions, of wondrous Deliverances. Her Husband at length found her out, and fetch'd her home, and their Family went on happily for ſix years together after it. But, <hi>the Clouds return after the Rain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>February</hi> 6, 1703-4. She with her Siſter, and a Maid or two, and ſome Children, (a Man being alſo in the Room,) were talking about the Indians, and behold, one of the fierce <hi>Tawnies</hi> looked in, with a Gun ready to fire upon them. The <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> pull'd him in, and got him down, and Mrs. <hi>Bradly</hi> took the opportunity to pour a good quantity of ſcalding Soap, (which was then boyling over the Fire) upon him, whereby he was kill'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, Another of the Tawnies follow'd at the Heels of his
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001331_0039_0FB27D0CC6719110"/>
Brother, who ſtabb'd the Engliſhman to the Heart. Unto him ſhe diſpenſed alſo a quantity of her Sope, which not killing him, ſhe with the other Women and Children ran into the Chamber. The Houſe was fired by the Indians, and Mrs. <hi>Bradly</hi> with her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions found it neceſſary to retire behind the Houſe. One of the Women fell into the Hands of the Indians; and they that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned were Mrs. <hi>Bradly</hi> and her Siſter; each of them having a Child of Mrs. <hi>Bradlies</hi> with her. The Siſter was diſcerned by the Indians, who commanded her to come out unto them, and threatned that they would elſe cut her to pieces. Mrs. <hi>Bradly</hi> very generouſly bid her ſit ſtill, and wait for a better time to eſcape; and offered her, that inaſmuch as the Indians knew of but one there, ſhe would be that one, and go out in her ſtead. She did ſo, and thereby her obliged Siſter and the Child with her were preſerved; but Mrs. <hi>Bradly</hi> was no ſooner come to the Salvages, but they employ'd a Head-breaker on the Child that ſhe brought unto them.</p>
            <p>She was not entred into a Second Captivity; but ſhe had the great Encumbrance of being Big with Child, and within Six Weeks of her Time! After about an Hours Reſt, wherein they made her put on Snow Shoes, which to manage, requires more than ordinary agility, ſhe travelled with her Tawny Guardians all that night, and the next day until Ten a Clock, aſſociated with one Woman more who had been brought to Bed but juſt one Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here they Refreſhed themſelves a little, and then travelled on till Night; when they had no Refreſhment given them, nor had they any, till after their having Travelled all the Forenoon of the day Enſuing; and then too, whatever ſhe took, ſhe did thro' Sickneſs throw it up again.</p>
            <p>She underwent incredible Hardſhips and Famine: A <hi>Mooſes</hi> Hide, as tough as you may Suppoſe it, was the beſt and moſt of her Diet. In one and twenty days they came to their Head-Quarters, were they ſtayed a Fortnight, But then her Snow-ſhoes were taken from her; and yet ſhe muſt go every ſtep above the Knee in Snow, with ſuch wearineſs, that her Soul often Pray'd, <hi>That the Lord would put an end unto her weary Life!</hi> until they came to another Place, where they ſtay'd for three Weeks together,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001331_0040_0FB27D10A12D7C08"/>Here in the Night ſhe found her ſelf ill, and having the help of only one Woman, who got a little Hemlock to lay about her, and with a few ſticks made ſhift to blow up a little Fire, ſhe was in half an Hour Delivered of the Infant, that ſhe had hitherto gone withal. There ſhe lay till the next Night, with none but the Snow under her, and the Heaven over her; in a miſty and rainy Seaſon. She ſent then unto a French Prieſt, that he would ſpeak unto her <hi>Squa Miſtreſs,</hi> who then, without Condeſcending to look upon her, allow'd her a little Birch-Rind, to cover her Head from the Injuries of the Weather, and a little bit of dried Mooſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boiled, ſhe drunk the Broth, and gave it unto the Child.</p>
            <p>In a Fortnight ſhe was called upon to Travel again, with her Child in her Arms; every now and then, a whole day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without the leaſt Morſel of any Food, and when ſhe had any, ſhe fed only on Ground-nuts and Wild-onions, and Lilly-roots. By the laſt of <hi>May</hi> they arrived at <hi>Coweſick,</hi> where they Planted their Corn; wherein ſhe was put unto a hard Task, ſo that the Child extreamly Suffered. The Salvages would ſome times alſo pleaſe themſelves, with caſting <hi>hot Embers</hi> into the Mouth of the Child, which would render the Mouth ſo ſore, that it could not Suck for a long while together. So that it Starv'd and Dy'd.</p>
            <p>There they ſtaid until they Wed their Corn, but then ſome of our Friend-Indians coming on them, kill'd Seven of them, whereat away they fled for <hi>Canada,</hi> and never ſaw their Corn-field any more. But they made a Forty-days Ramble of it, before they reach'd thither, in which, if at any time, her Heart began to faint, her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs would be ready to ſtrike the Mortal Hatchet into her Head,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:001331_0041_0FB27D13C0FAC350"/>The <hi>French</hi> being thought more Civil to the Engliſh than to the Indians, her Miſtreſs thereat Provoked, reſolved, that ſhe would never Sell her to the <hi>French.</hi> Accordingly ſhe kept her a Twelve-month with her, in her Squalid <hi>Wigwam:</hi> Where, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Winter, ſhe fell ſick of a Feavour; but in the very heighth and heat of her Paroxyſms, her Miſtreſs would compel her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Spend a Winters-night, which is there a very bitter one, abroad in all the bitter Froſt and Snow of the Climate. She reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; but Four Indians died of the Feavour, and at length her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs alſo. Another Squa then pretended an Heirſhip unto her, with whom ſhe lived, and ſaw many more ſtrange Deliverances. They had the Small-Pox in the Family; but ſhe never had it. She was made to paſs the River on the Ice, when every ſtep ſhe took, ſhe might have ſtruck through it if ſhe pleaſed Many more ſuch Preſervations might come into her Story.</p>
            <p>At Laſt, there came to the ſight of her a Prieſt from <hi>Quebeck,</hi> who had known her in her former Captivity at <hi>Naridgewock.</hi> He was very Civil to Her, and made the <hi>Indians</hi> Sell her to a French Family, for Fourſcore Livers, where tho' ſhe wrought hard, ſhe Lived more comfortably and contentedly.</p>
            <p>She poured out her continoal Supplications to Heaven; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Two or Three of her own Sex, would by Stealth, come to joyn with her in Supplicating to the Glorious LORD. She had her Mind often Irradiated with Strong Perſwaſions and Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that ſhe ſhould yet <hi>See the Goodneſs of God,</hi> in this Land of the Living. Her tender and Loving Husband, accompanied Mr. <hi>Sheldon,</hi> in his Laſt Expedition. He found her out, and fetch'd her home, a Second time; She arriv'd with thoſe of the Laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Captivity; and affectionately calls upon her Friends, <hi>O magnifie the LORD with me, and let us Exalt his Name to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Occaſion of my now Writing to you is becauſe I lye under a Vow and Promiſe to the Great and Almighty God, to declare and make Known his wonderful Goodneſs and Mercy to me, and livewiſe to have His Name Bleſſed and Praiſed in your Congregation on my Behalf. I ſhall briefly Inform you.</p>
            <p>Being taken a Priſoner ſome time laſt <hi>January</hi> by the <hi>French:</hi> in going to <hi>Port-Royal</hi> we met with very Tempeſtuous Weather, and were faſt in an Harbour near Cape <hi>Sables.</hi> And here two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from their Captain to take me with them, and go to <hi>Port-Royal</hi> by Land. They took with them but little Bread; and we Travelled one Night in the Woods in a miſerable Condition. I had my ſelf no Shoes nor Stockings, but a piece of Skin wrapt about about my Feet; and the Snow being very deep, we could not Travel, being Weak for want of Proviſion, and loſt in the Woods, not knowing which way to go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:001331_0044_0FB27D201D513FC0"/>One of the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> Loaded his Gun, and Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it at me, telling me, <hi>That it was impoſſible to find</hi> Port-Royal, <hi>I muſt Dye, and they muſt Eat me.</hi> Then I begged leave to Pray unto God, before he Kill'd me, and he Granted it. As I was at Prayer, it ſtruck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Mind, That I had formerly heard your ſelf declare in your Pulpit, what Great and Wonderful Things hath been done by Prayer; particularly, <hi>That it had ſtopped the Mouths of Lions, and that it had Quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Violence of the Fire.</hi> So I earneſty begged of God, that he would manifeſt his great Power to me, by turning the Hearts of thoſe that were about to take away my Life.</p>
            <p>The Words were no ſooner out of my Mouth, but the <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſeeming to have Tears in his Eyes, bid me riſe up; he would try one Day longer. And he bid me go and get Wood for a Fire. It preſently grew Dark; and then I made an Eſcape from them, and hid my ſelf in the Woods, until the next Day that they were gone; and then I found the way out of the Woods, unto the Water-ſide, where I got <hi>Clams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>French-men</hi> found the way to <hi>Port-royal,</hi> and there told what they had done. The Governour put them in Priſon, and ſent out Two Men, and Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not to return, until they had found me, Dead or Alive. In Four Days after theſe <hi>Frenchmen</hi> left me, they found me Alive, and brought me Proviſion, and a Pair of Shoes, and carried me to <hi>Port-royal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:001331_0045_0FB37DC9512C31C8"/>Theſe and many other Favours have I received from my Good God in the time of my Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment; Bleſſed and for ever Praiſed be his Holy Name for it. Pray, Sir, give me Directions what I ſhall do for the Great and Good GOD.</p>

            <p>OUr Eaſtern Indians had no ſooner, with all poſſible Aſſurance renewed their League of Peace with us, but being moved by the Inſtigation of the <hi>French,</hi> they Perfidiouſly and Barbarouſly Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized Seven more of our naked and ſecure Plantations; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at once into the ſcattered Families, they did, on <hi>August</hi> 10, 11. 1703: Reward the Hoſpitable Civilities that were ſhown them, with the Murder of above Seventy <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, and the Captivity of near an Hundred. Upon this there Enſued Leſſer Depredations, and Captivations, as the Treacherous Enemy found Opportunity for them.</p>
            <p>About half a year after theſe Calamities thus begun on the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> Parts of the Country, the <hi>Weſtern</hi> had a taſte of the ſame Cup given to them. On <hi>Feb.</hi> 29. 1703 4. An Army conſiſting, as it was judg'd; of about 400 <hi>French</hi> and Indians, made a Deſcent upon the little Town of <hi>Deerfield,</hi> the moſt Northernly Settlement on <hi>Connecticut-River,</hi> which had long been a watchful and an uſeful Barrier for the reſt of the Plantations in the Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>They Surpriſed the Place about an Hour or Two before Break of Day, and in a little time, not without Loſs to themſelves, Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered and Captivated above 150 of the People.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Williams,</hi> the Worthy Miniſter of that Pious and Holy Flock, was carried into Captivity, with Five of his Children; two of which were Slain; and his Deſirable Conſort beginning to Faint at about a Dozen Miles of the doleful Journey, they there, like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, cruelly Murdered her, and left her for the Funeral which her Friends afterwards beſtow'd on her. Before they reach'd unto <hi>Mont Real,</hi> a Journey diſpatch'd by the Parcels now divided in Twenty Days, more or leſs, near Twenty more of the Captives loſt their Lives; for the manner was, that if any found themſelves not able to Travel thro' the Deep Snows now on the Ground, the Salvages would ſtrike their Hatchets into their Heads, and there leave them weltring in their Blood.</p>
