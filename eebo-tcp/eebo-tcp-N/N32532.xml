            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT mankind ſhould in any caſe, be voluntarily active, in taking away the lives of thoſe of their own ſpecies, is a lamentable evidence and conſequence of human depravity.—If man had retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his integrity, and continued in a ſtate of peace with heaven, no part of this earth would ever have been a ſeat of war: Angels would have been his friendly gueſts, ſentitive creatures his willing ſervants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the whole human race knit together in mutual love. Apoſtate angels however inimica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſpoſed, might have envied, but could not have impaired his happineſs, or diſturbed his peace. But human beings, by joining with thoſe degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſpirits, in an impotent rebellion againſt God, the rightful, righteous and good ſovereign of the univerſe, have introduced ſuch calamity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that there is ordinarily more danger from the injurious attempts of fellow-creatures, than from all the beaſts of prey. And however the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:042802_0004_101C94BC0656CD80"/>
excellency of man conſiſts, not in bodily ſtrength, but mental endowments; yet ſuch diſputes do ſometimes ariſe, as muſt be decided, not by ſtrength of argument in deliberative aſſemblies, but by force of arms in the field of battle.</p>
            <p>Human affairs, on ſome occaſions, come to be in ſuch a ſituation, that we muſt either ſubmit to death, or intolerable injuries ourſelves, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inflict death on the aggreſſors. In a word, an equitable and honorable peace, can, at times, be obtained on no other condition, than that of engaging in a bloody war; and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes a neceſſity of taking ſuch a method as muſt inevitably remove ſome out of this world, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that thoſe who ſurvive may be the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; hence making war, or ſhedding the blood of thoſe of our own kind, comes to be a neceſſary buſineſs; and it is then as much our duty to go to the field of battle, as at ordinary times, to go to the field of labour.</p>
            <p>And as the Jewiſh ſtate was a theocracy, in which God gave them a compleat body of laws, reſpecting things both civil &amp; ſacred; ſo in our text and ſucceeding context, we have a part of their martial law, or divine directions reſpecting their militia. However different the weapons of war, whether offenſive or defenſive, may have been in different ages and countries; and conſequently the art or manner of war, variable; yet what is recommended in our text, namely, <hi>courage,</hi> has always been a neceſſary qualification in an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed ſoldier. Intrepidity is as eſſential to the character of a good warrior, as a diſpoſition for diſpaſſionate enquiry and cool deliberation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily contained in the idea of a good judge. And as all ſcripture has been given by inſpiration of God, and is in one reſpect or another profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; ſo the conſideration of the paſſage which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:042802_0005_101C94BF1B7CF4F0"/>
I have now read, cannot appear in preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances unſeaſonable,—We are reduced to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a war, which will perhaps be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and is certainly more diſagreeable in its nature, and extenſive in its effects, than any in which, either the whole or part of the American Britiſh colonies have heretofore been engaged.—Since then, we know not, how ſoon even the huſbandman, however agreeable their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to themſelves and uſeful to others, may be obliged to change the implements of huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry for the weapons of war, and march forth to battle; it will certainly be comfortable for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hopeful for others, that they take the field with that temper preſcribed, and having the encouragement contained in our text.—For this purpoſe therefore, I ſhall ſhew

univerſe has implanted in our natures, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other living creatures.—That war was lawful under the Old-Teſtament diſpenſation is ſo evident, that none who acknowledge the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Bible, can deny it.—The apprehenſion that Chriſt has under the New-Teſtament intirely prohibited the uſe of the ſword, has ariſen from a miſunderſtanding and wrong application of ſome of his precepts, which were evidently deſigned by him to injoin meekneſs and a forgiving temper upon his followers, and to prevent private retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and revenge.—I will, however, grant to thoſe profeſſing Chriſtians, who declare againſt the uſe of the ſword in every caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, as Chriſt's kingdom is ſpiritual and erected for heavenly purpoſes;—ſo no coercive meaſures ought to be uſed in promoting it, under any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.—The ſubjects of Chriſt's kingdom, as ſuch, or conſidered in that capacity, ought to uſe no other means, in propagating Chriſtianity, but ſuch as were uſed by Chriſt himſelf and his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; the weapons of whoſe warfare, was not carnal but mighty.—If we conſider the Chriſtian, as ſuch, purely with reſpect to his ſpiritual and eternal intereſts, his panoply or compleat armour is deſcribed in the ſixth chapter of the Epiſtle to the Epheſians; nor is he to repel injuries which only affect his ſpiritual good, with any other, but theſe ſpiritual weapons.—But as perſons becoming Chriſtians, does not ſupercede their being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Mathematicians, Aſtronomers, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nicks or Labourers; ſo neither does it nullify the relations and rights as men and civil ſubjects Now, although the Mathematician may not pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

quiries; ſo neither is it true, that becauſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as ſuch, may not uſe the ſword, in promoting Chriſtianity, or defending themſelves againſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which only reſpect their ſpiritual intereſts, that therefore they may not, as men and civil ſubjects, uſe it in defence of their country.—It muſt alſo be granted, that probably the abuſe of warlike inſtruments, by profeſſing Chriſtians, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending therewith to ſubſerve the intereſts of Chriſt's kingdom, in which caſe, they were indeed unhallowed weapons; and the almoſt infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs thence accruing, have given occaſion to running into the other extreme, and concluding that they were not to be uſed at all.</p>
            <p>It is alſo to be admitted, that making war, merely for the purpoſe of inlarging an empire, kingdom or commonwealth; or for acquiring fame by conqueſt, is altogether unlawful.—Hence Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the great, rather deſerves the name of an invincible murderer, and ſucceſsful plunderer, than that of an illuſtrious hero.</p>
            <p>It will therefore follow, that all the particular caſes, in which a war can be lawful, will come under one or other of theſe generals, <hi>viz.</hi>—It muſt if it be offenſive, be undertaken by ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God, who has a right to employ whom he pleaſes, as the executioners of his juſtice; or it muſt be defenſive, occaſioned by ſome injury which reſpects our temporal intereſt, either at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted or inflicted.—As to the firſt of theſe, no war ſince immediate revelation has ceaſed, can be in this reſpect, legitimate: Since no nation can now produce a commiſſion from God, to invade any other nation, from whom they have received no injury.—With regard to the ſecond, it may take place either between ſeparate independent ſtates, or different parts of the ſame ſtate.</p>

1. When one ſtate invades the lives, liberty or property of another, and perſiſts in the injurious conduct; or refuſes to make reparation for inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries already committed, then is it not only lawful but duty, for the invaded nation, to go forth to battle againſt them; and commit the event to the Almighty God, the judge of the univerſe.—But here perhaps it will be queried—Since it belongs to the Supreme power, or governing part of a nation, to make war and peace, how ſhall all of the nation, who may be called to bear arms, be certain that there is cauſe ſufficient to legitimate a war? To which it may be anſwered, That or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the injuries committed are ſo notorious, that all may be acquainted with them: Or if this is not the caſe, unleſs it appear evident that the war is not defenſive, but offenſive, the ſubjects muſt confide in the integrity and equity of their rulers; and if the war be even unjuſt, on account of ſome circumſtances, well known to the rulers, but concealed from the ſubjects, the rulers alone, in ſuch a caſe, are chargeable with guilt.—As one man is not called to act in the ſphere of another; ſo neither is he to be accountable for another's miſmanagement, further than he approves of, or knowingly joins with him, in his culpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.—Notwithſtanding, as the avowed deſign of war, is the ſhedding of human blood: ſo it will tend much to the ſatisfaction of a conſcientious ſoldier, to have clear evidence, in his own mind, that the war, in which he is engaged, is juſt and neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A war may commence, betwixt different parts of the ſame ſtate, and this is uſually called, civil-war; and it may be lawful and neceſſary to go forth to battle againſt thoſe of the ſame body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, in two particular caſes.</p>

Firſt, when part of a nation violate the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal compact, break laws made agreeable to the conſtitution of the ſociety, throw off their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the executive power of the ſtate, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſet up rulers of their own, or to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in a ſtate of anarchy. This is uſually called ſedition or rebellion, and when the inſurgents are ſubdued, it is generally thought juſt, to treat them with greater ſeverity, than conquered enemies, when the war is with a foreign ſtate. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when the attempts, of part of a ſtate, are really rebellious, it appears equitable, not only to go to war againſt them, but to make ſuch as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, at leaſt, the principal leaders, examples of juſtice, as being guilty not only of injury, but of perfidy and ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Second, when the governing part of a nation, attempt to abuſe the power committed to them, and inſtead of ſubſerving the intereſts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, endeavour to ſubvert the conſtitution, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their influence and authority, not for the good of the ſubjects, but to promote their own ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and tyrannical deſigns; then is it, not only lawful, but duty, to oppoſe them, and if they perſiſt, to uſe the ſword againſt them. I ſhall not enter deeply into the proof of this poſition, which has not only been clearly illuſtrated, in theory, but was found neceſſary in practice, in our own nation, at that critical and memorable aera, the revolution; ſince which time, the doctrine of unlimited paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance has been exploded by Britons.—I ſhall, however, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a few things to prevent the abuſe of it.—And, in the firſt place, agreeable to what has been before ſaid, I think it is evident, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as ſuch, or conſidered as Chriſt's diſciples, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:042802_0010_101C94CD8CCB9AB0"/>
of Chriſtianity.—If, in the nation, where, by the providence of God, Chriſtians are caſt, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers are even Infidels, or being profeſſing Chriſtians ſhould apoſtatize from the faith; yet it appears evident to me, from the nature of Chriſt's kingdom, and the ſcope of the New-Teſtament, that while the nation as ſuch, acquieſce in their government, Chriſtians, as ſuch, are both to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their authority, in civil things, and obey them in all things, not contrary to Chriſt's laws; and where conſcience forbids a compliance with the precept, they muſt run the hazard of enduring the penalty, if that ſhould even be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and ignominious death.—Chriſtians, as ſuch, have no king or head of their ſociety, but Jeſus, and their attempting to dethrone kings, merely for their being unfavourable to Chriſt's cauſe and kingdom, and attempting to ſet up others to head and protect themſelves, as members of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church, is high-treaſon againſt king Jeſus, as well as rebellion againſt the ſtate.—Chriſt, as Meſſiah, and head of his church, has no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed civil magiſtrates to be his vice-gerents, over his church, than he has appointed the pope of Rome to be Peter's ſucceſſor, or his vicar.—If civil rulers, inſtead of profeſſing and practiſing Chriſtianity, perſiſt in rejecting it; by the ſtatute law of king Jeſus, they will forfeit a throne with him in heaven, and incur damnation; and do not by this, forfeit their earthly preferments.—Theſe will belong to them, ſo long as their conſtituents chooſe to continue them; and Chriſtians, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in that capacity, conſtitute no civil rulers.—As Chriſt's diſciples, perſons are ſtill to declare, that they have no king but Jeſus, and at the ſame time declare, that he is ſo far from having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them from ſubjection to civil magiſtrates, that he has ſtrictly injoined it upon them.</p>

In the ſecond place, it is not every tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or defect, in civil government, either with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to legiſlation, or execution, that will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant reſiſtance.—That civil rulers, ſhould univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally and uninteruptedly act for the common good, is indeed, agreeable in theory and very deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but like Plato's republic, will no where be found, except in idea.—And here I would obſerve, that there is a great difference betwixt ſuch wrong ſteps in government, which although they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the ſubjects, yet are not ſubverſive of the conſtitution; and their bad effects but tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and ſuch as have not only hurtful, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent effects; and if ſubmitted to, will entail evil upon ſucceeding generations, E.

their character is, at leaſt, more odious than that of ſuch foreign invaders, as by their invaſion vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate no league or expreſs ſtipulation; becauſe ſaid civil rulers are guilty, not only of cruelty, but of ingratitude and perfidy.—And therefore, by the laws of nature, which never can be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded, they deſerve puniſhment, and it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſary to remove them as intolerable nuiſances.</p>
            <p>II. There will be ground for a people to expect God favourably with them in a war.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When they have clear evidence, that the war on their ſide is lawful and neceſſary—when it is not with ambitious, or avaricious veiws, of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring honour, or wealth, by the deſtruction or poverty of others, who have not injured them; but only to repel injurious attempts, or obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for injuries received. This is abſolutely neceſſary, in order to having any ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from God. For if any interprize be a violation of the rights of our fellow-creatures, and conſequently a breach of God's law, as it would be vain to expect his approbation and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in ſuch a caſe; ſo it would be daring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, if not blaſphemy, to aſk his preſence. If we would expect the Lord graciouſly to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany us, we muſt carefully obſerve not to turn aſide from what his holy law preſcribes. If in any undertaking we deviate from this, we have juſt reaſon to expect, that God, in that affair, will forſake us; nay ſet himſelf againſt us. If the Iſraelites, contrary to the expreſs command of God, will aſcend the hill, to ſight with the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites and Canaanites, they ſhall return ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beaten; as may be ſeen Numb. 14th chap. latter part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When thoſe who in a lawful and neceſſary war go out to battle, are themſelves engaged in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:042802_0014_101C94DA4F91A820"/>
earneſtly ſoliciting the divine preſence. However prayer is neither to be ſuppoſed to produce any change in God, nor to have any thing in it meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of the favours aſked, nor to convey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to God of things with which he was unacquainted; yet it is a powerful medium, for the obtaining of bleſſings, both temporal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. There is little reaſon to conclude, that God will give, what perſons don't think worth while humbly and importunately to aſk; and we are not only unworthy of, but alſo unfit for, the enjoyment of thoſe ſpecial favours, which we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to ſeek to God for. It is indeed an awful and mournful reflection, that even in the Britiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whether land or ſea forces, in which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, few would be found who have not by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm been inliſted under Chriſt; yet few of either officers of ſoldiers, but what are more remarkable for curſing and ſwearing than praying.—God forbid that our American armies, who have at this day to be their oppoſers, ſhould, in this thing, be their imitators!</p>
            <p>It would be impoſſible, in the time proper for this part of the diſcourſe, to produce all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in which God in anſwer to prayer, has manifeſted his preſence in deciding battles.—You, have two remarkable inſtances, recorded in 1 Sam. vii. chap. and 2 Chron. xx. chap.—In the firſt of theſe, you have an account of a monumental pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, raiſed in the field of battle and victory, and inſcribed to the honour of a prayer-hearing God, and for the encouragement of future officers and ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond, you find that God was ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, by a powerful prayer, that he did not merely grant auxiliary aid, but was the ſole effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, leaving nothing for Jehoſaphat and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to do, but to carry away the ſpoil. Allow me
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:042802_0015_101C94DD724FF588"/>
to add, the inſtance of David, who truſting more to a prayer-hearing God, than to Saul's coat of mail, went out with a ſling and ſtone; but return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Goliah's head, and thereby obtained a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral victory. In ſhort, thoſe are moſt likely to be ſucceſsful combatants in battle, who are the moſt importunate wreſtlers in prayer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When an army maintains a reverence of a holy God, and are afraid to venture on any of the ways of known ſin. Thoſe may expect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God when fighting againſt the enemies of their bodies, who are irreconcileable, in their war, againſt the enemies of God and their own ſouls. And without this, the foregoing will be nothing but ſolemn mockery of God; in words ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting his preſence, and by our actions telling him to depart from us. It may, perhaps, ſeem unſuitable to ſpeak of a ſoldier being afraid of any thing; but I would ſay, wo to the man, who is above the fear of ſin, and does not tremble at the word of God.—Shocking to think that any ſhould value themſelves for their fighting againſt God! Let the potſheards of the earth, ſtrive with the potſheards of the earth; but wo to him, that ſtriveth with his Maker. You have an example of this, in the above-mentioned 7th of 1 Sam. from the 3d verſe. <hi>And Samuel ſpake unto all the houſe of Iſrael, ſaying, if ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the ſtrange Gods, and Aſtaroth, from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and ſerve him only; and he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you out of the hand of the Philiſtines. Then the children of Iſrael did put away. Baalim and Aſtaroth, and ſerved the Lord only.</hi> But it is needleſs to multiply quotations on this head, ſince it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from reaſon, and the whole tenor of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that ſin is the very cauſe, why God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits enemies to invade a people; there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:042802_0016_101C94E2716DE288"/>
no encouragement, to expect that God will appear for us, unleſs we abandon our ſins, which have provoked him to ſend war upon our country. And however wicked ſoldiers may, indeed, be inſtrumental of gaining a victory; yet unleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance prevent, they ſhall at laſt find, it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, when their oppoſition, will only increaſe their miſery.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When thoſe who go out to battle manifeſt an humble temper, neither boaſting of their number and abilities; nor ſcornfully deſpiſing their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but committing the event to God. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that he reſiſts the proud, but ſhews favour to the humble. It has ordinarily been found, that thoſe who went to the field of battle, magnifying their own ſtrength and warlike-accompliſhments; and contemning their enemies; thus as it were anticipating the victory, have either fallen by theſe ſame deſpiſed enemies, or returned with a different tone, and inſtead of their laurels, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Humility belongs to us as creatures, and is a dreſs that becomes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in every ſtation and condition. There is a great difference betwixt oſtentatious bragging and couragious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

5. When thoſe on whoſe behalf the army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the field of battle, are alſo employed in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayer to God, in confeſſing their ſins and caſting away every abomination; not boaſting of, nor confiding in, the number, proweſs, diſcipline and armour of their troops; but humbly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the event to God, who can ſave, by many or by few.—Doubtleſs we may venture to ſay, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to ſome it might appear a paradox, that thoſe who remain at home, and never go out to battle, have notwithſtanding, a great hand in the victory or defeat. If we fight againſt the Lord at home, how can we expect that he will fight for our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad? There may be Achans in the city and country, as well as in the ſoldiery; by whom God may be ſo provoked, as to refuſe to go forth with our armies; on the other hand, perſons may as truly be inſtrumental of an happy campaign in their fields and cloſets, as thoſe who charge upon the enemy in the line of battle. When Iſrael fought with Amalek, as recorded in the 17th of Exodus, neither Moſes, Aaron, nor Hur, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther field-marſhals or common ſoldiers, but were at a diſtance upon the top of an hill; yet none who read this part of ſacred hiſtory, can exclude them from a ſhare in obtaining the victory. Thoſe whoſe lives are a counter-part to their prayers, and are employed in ſtorming heaven with their importunate ſupplications, may be as uſeful to their country, when a ſeat of war, as thoſe who bombard caſtles and ſcale walls!</p>
            <p>In a lawful war, when any of theſe things is found, it is ſo far a good ſymptom, when they are all found, there is full evidence of God's favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſence.—But I am now to proceed to ſhew how this inſpires with true courage.</p>
            <p>III. True courage is a temper or diſpoſition, by which a man, with firm reſolution and boldneſs
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:042802_0018_101C94E74E9DF568"/>
encounters the dangers, which occur in the path of his duty, repelling or reſiſting to his utmoſt, all intervening difficulties.—As this temper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the character of a ſoldier, it is oppoſed to what is commonly called cowardice; which either influences a man to ſhrink and flee from, even thoſe dangers, which lie in the way of his duty; or cauſes him to make but a feeble and ineffectual reſiſtance.—And I might obſerve, that an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the favour and aſſiſtance of even falſe gods, had a tendency, in heatheniſh armies, to produce ſomething which had ſundry of the ingredients and much reſembled true courage; and this how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ill-founded, had after a great influence in procuring victory.—When the ſoldiers were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, with what they counted a lucky omen, or by a favourable anſwer from an oracle, they would ordinarily exert themſelves, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vigor.—It has alſo been often found, that a falſe apprehenſion, of the favourable preſence of the true God, has produced ſuch effects, as in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpects were ſimilar to true heroiſm.—With what irreſiſtible violence and rapidity, did the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Mahomet over-run many of the eaſtern countries, when poſſeſſed with the notion that they were fighting the Lord's battles?—With what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic fortitude, did hundreds of thouſands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert themſelves in the cruſades, or the wild project of recovering the Holy Land from the Infidels? In which enterprize, they thought that God was undoubtedly upon their ſide, and therefore were fearleſs of danger. None can therefore doubt concerning the powerful operation of a well-grounded apprehenſion, of the favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the true God. But I am to ſhew how this inſpires with true courage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is contained in it, an evidence of the divine approbation in the undertaking, which
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:042802_0019_101C94EA66C0D660"/>
affords peace of mind, let the iſſue be as it will; without this there can be no rational, manly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; becauſe a view of the unlawfulneſs of the enterprize, whenſoever it occurs muſt make the man quake, leſt God himſelf ſhould meet him as a bear robbed of her whelps.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It contains divine aſſiſtance and protection; and if God be for us, who can prevail againſt us? What general or army ſhall be able to circumvent in counſel, one who is omniſcient and infinitely wiſe; or exceed in ſtrength and proweſs, one who is Almighty? Who has an arm like God, or can thunder with a voice like him? All the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth are but as graſshoppers before him; yea all the ſquadrons of hell quake before him; and ſhrink into the burning pit, to hide from his majeſtic and terrible countenance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſenſe of the divine preſence, in a war gives occaſion to conſider all the deliverances God has wrought for his people, in former times; and to improve theſe as an encouragement to expect his interpoſition at that time; for he is the ſame ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, to-day and forever.—Thus the people of Iſrael, when invironed with new difficulties, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recount old deliverances, and particularly the wonderful deliverance mentioned in our text, <hi>viz.</hi> bringing them up out of the land of Egypt. In reſpect of that colony which is at preſent the ſeat of war, it may be alſo ſaid, that God did great things for their anceſtors, which I cannot but think affords encouragement to hope, that he will not now forſake that people.—They were brought from a land, then groaning under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in regard of religious liberty, and ſtained with the blood of perſecution, not through the Red-ſea, but acroſs the Atlantic; and preſerved through all the difficulties and dangers attending a ſettlement among wild beaſts and ſavages.—A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

who read the hiſtory of the planting and progreſs of the colony of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, may find great inſtances of God's goodneſs, to that people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, of which I cannot at preſent give even a general account.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If we have the preſence of God when going to battle, and are intereſted in his favour, then we may reſt aſſured, that whether we ſurvive the engagement, or die in the field, all ſhall be well. If our ſouls are poſſeſſed of the fear of the Lord, we need not fear them, who can only kill the body. A ſoul prepared for Heaven, will as eaſily and joyfully (perhaps I may ſay more ſo) find its way thither, from a field of battle, as from a bed of down; will as chearfully aſcend from amidſt roaring cannon, as weeping friends. As God is with his people in danger, ſo alſo in death, which is to them an end of all danger. Can then, any thing ſo effectually inſpire a ſoldier with true courage, as that which raiſes him above the fear of death; nay makes death itſelf appear a deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able event? <hi>For bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, ſince they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi> I now proceed to make ſome practical improvement.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As, agreeable to what was ſaid in the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, we are at preſent in a ſtate of war, it will be very proper to enquire, whether, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the doctrine, it be on our ſide a lawful and neceſſary war, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether it be, indeed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. As time will not admit of prolixity, I ſhall only attempt a brief view of the matter, which I hope, notwithſtanding, will contain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſufficient to ſatisfy every competent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, who is free from invincible prejudice.</p>
            <p>I therefore obſerve, that all the late acts of the Britiſh Parliament, which by their united opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have at length brought on a civil war, have
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:042802_0021_101C94F26EF11318"/>
flowed from a declaratory ſtatute, made ſome years ago; or at leaſt are built upon it, as their true foundation. In which ſtatute, there is this remarkable clauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That all his Majeſty's Colonies and Plantations in America have been, are and of right ought to be, ſubordinate to and dependent upon the Imperial Crown and Parliament of Great-Britain; who have full power and authority to make laws and ſtatutes of ſufficient validity to bind the Colonies and people of America, ſubjects of the Crown of Great-Britain, in all caſes whatſoever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is a baſis, not only broad enough to ſupport all the late acts complained of and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt by the Colonies, but is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient foundation for a ſyſtem of tyranny, both civil and eccleſiaſtic. Since the time may come, when the whole of Great-Britain, may bear no greater proportion to the Britiſh Colonies, either with regard to circuit or number of inhabitants, than one of our counties now do to a province; and yet this vaſt extent of country ſhall have no other ſecurity againſt tyranny and oppreſſion, but the complexion of the Britiſh Parliament, the evils incident to which we can neither prevent nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. As we have no hand in chuſing any of the Members of Parliament, ſo we muſt according to ſaid ſtatute, be, not merely the ſubjects of the Imperial Crown of Great-Britain, but the ſlaves of the Parliament of Great-Britain. As they may drain away our property by heavy taxes, to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in diſcharging the almoſt immenſe nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al debt, or conſumed in court luxury; ſo they may ſend penſioners and placemen to devour the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruits of our induſtry among ourſelves.</p>
            <p>Now, in defence of this act, it is alledged, that, according to a theorem in politics, there muſt, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>very civil ſtate, be a ſupreme power lodged ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:042802_0022_101C94F3F1DD03C0"/>
that it eſſentially belongs to thoſe, who have this ſupreme power, to give laws, in all caſes, to the whole body politic.—That in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Great-Britain, this power is lodged in the Parliament, and that it muſt be ſo in order that theſe Colonies may be a part of the Britiſh empire.</p>
            <p>To which it may be replied, that it is vain to urge any kind of hypothetical maxims againſt plain matter of fact. Tacitus, who was in his day no mean politician, allowed that a mixture of the three ſimple kinds of civil government, had indeed a ſpecious appearance in theory; but was not reducible to practice, or at leaſt alledged that no ſuch government could be laſting.—But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of this ſuppoſition, it is now a well known fact, that the Britiſh conſtitution, which is ſuch a mixture, has exiſted for hundreds of years. It is as well known, that the Colonies and Great-Britain have exiſted as one ſtate, for above 100 years, with mutual concord and proſperity, and with the great augmentation of the wealth and glory of the Britiſh nation, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſuch unlimited power in the Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And it is too likely, that if the Miniſtry of Great-Britain perſiſt in not only claiming but attempting to exerciſe ſuch a power, this will be the very thing that will effect her ruin. Now if ſuch an unlimited power has lain dormant for above a century, and yet every thing as comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the whole body politic as could be wiſhed, what avails it to alledge a metaphyſical axiom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> againſt evident fact. The reducing this political principle to practice, in our nation, if effected, is likely to be a growing rod of iron to the Colonies whereas it might, for any thing that appeared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting theſe Colonies, have been conſumed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, without any detriment to the nation. How ever if Britiſh politicians, have found ſuch a gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:042802_0023_101C94F8E5B44478"/>
knot in politics, as admits of no alternative, but ſubjecting the Colonies, in all reſpects, to the mercy of a Parliament, about which they have no more agency, than they have about the Court of Spain, it is evidently of their own tieing; and it is the intereſt and duty of theſe Colonies, rather than be thus entangled, Alexander-like, to cut it with the ſword. The preſent war is therefore on our ſide manifeſtly in defence of property and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and I may add of life too. It is alſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, that neither before nor ſince the attempts upon our liberty, have we thrown off allegiance to King George the Third, nor attempted to ſet up any form of government, as an independent ſtate; but on the contrary, in an humble manner, been repreſenting grievances, petitioning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating. Beſides the penalties annexed to the injurious laws, armies have been ſent to enforce obedience, who have already proceeded to ſhed the blood of our brethren. The alternative, in ſhort, now is either to wear the chain or the ſword.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As different conduct comes to be duty at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times; ſo it is now the duty of all, who are able, to be in readineſs for going out to battle, and therefore to be making every neceſſary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for that purpoſe. It is now as proper to be diligent in learning the buſineſs of war, as at or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary times to learn the common buſineſſes of life. And for perſons to ſay, they are ſo hurried with ordinary affairs, that they have no time to ſpare that way, is as if a man ſhould ſay, though his houſe was on fire, he had no time to put it out. All capable of going to battle ſhould endeavour to be furniſhed with the weapons of war. If the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency of the caſe required it, we ſhould now, beat our plow-ſhares into ſwords, and our pruning-hooks into ſpears. This is by no means repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:042802_0024_101C94FC1B64FC38"/>
to, nay it is neceſſarily contained in, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lord and expecting his favourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. To truſt in means alone, and neglect ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, is pride and atheiſm; to pretend to truſt in God, and at the ſame time to neglect the uſe of proper means, is fooliſh preſumption and wild enthuſiaſm. Nor are any to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above the buſineſs neceſſary to prepare them for war; the moſt reputable citizens, and thoſe who have endeavoured to maintain a character for piety, ought now to endeavour to diſtinguiſh themſelves as brave ſoldiers. How ſhameful, if the licentious and profane, ſhould manifeſt more forwardneſs and alacrity this way, than thoſe who formerly were of apparent pious deportment? Does it not give occaſion to the wicked, for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either theſe regular profeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, have not that religion they pretend to; or with it all they are but daſtardly cowards? Shall (ſays Nehemiah) ſuch a man as I flee?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Permit me to addreſs thoſe who deſign to go out to battle in defence of themſelves and country, whenſoever there may be a call for that purpoſe; and to this end have aſſociated themſelves and taken up arms. You ſee the buſineſs is not only lawful, but neceſſary, I may add honourable.—Even if you die in the conflict, it will be in a good cauſe. Since therefore, beſides the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which lay upon you in common with others, to ſtand forth in the face of danger and death, in a good cauſe, you have added your own conſent and engagement; to draw back, if you were even before the cannon's mouth, would fix both awful guilt and indelible diſgrace upon you. Would brand you with perpetual infamy. If then you would eſcape deep guilt before God, and laſting contempt among men, forward you muſt go, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:042802_0025_101C94FD9FE859A8"/>
for battle. You have, in a word, no alternative, but either to venture your lives bravely, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſave them ignominiouſly; to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of dying like heroes, or be certain of living like cowards. And here, let me exhort ſoldiers to preſerve the ſtricteſt regard to the authority of their officers, in all their gradations. The more you duly honour and obey them, the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable will you thereby be, yourſelves; and the more fit for, and worthy of, preferment.—None more fit to be advanced to command others, than thoſe who have been eminent for their duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience. A family cannot exiſt without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and diſcipline, much leſs an army. And ſurely if a houſe divided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand, a rebellious and mutinous ſoldiery muſt go to deſtruction. This way they will do the work of the enemy, themſelves. It will avail nothing to ſay your officers were formerly your equals, they are now by your own conſent your ſuperiors. As little to the purpoſe, will it be to ſay, you will not obey theſe, for though they were appointed by a majority, yet you voted againſt them, and for others. Were they not choſen agreeable to the mode agreed upon, and to which you conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or at leaſt, ſhould have conſented, as being generally approved, by your countrymen? Your refuſing ſubmiſſion, on this ſuppoſition, proceeds from a principle, which might lead to as great evils, or worſe, than thoſe which might give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the diſtinction of ſoldiers and officers at this day; for if it does not lead to tyranny, it will certainly end in anarchy. You might as well ſay, you would not ſubmit to the Sheriff of the country, becauſe at the general election you voted againſt him. Permit me alſo in a few words, to exhort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of all ranks.—As your country have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:042802_0026_101C9500AFF16448"/>
diſtinguiſh yourſelves by a conduct in all reſpects becoming your ſtations. Let them not have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, that they were miſtaken in their choice. Exerciſe the authority committed to you with mildneſs and equity; but at the ſame time with inflexible ſtrictneſs. A due mixture of theſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the perfection of any kind of government.</p>
            <p>And, as a matter of the utmoſt moment, let me exhort and beſeech all, both officers and ſoldiers, to conduct in ſuch a manner as will afford encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to expect the favourite preſence of God with us, when we go out to battle.—If we make the Almighty God our enemy, can we expect to ſtand before our enemies? Oh! how monſtrous to hear ſoldiers when about to face death, profaning the name of God.—This is, perhaps a more than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal bravery; for the devils believe there is a God and tremble.—Shocking intrepidity—to ſet their mouths againſt the heavens, and challenge Omnipotence itſelf.—And how ſordid and ſhameful for a ſoldiery to indulge themſelves in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and debauchery? Are theſe like to be cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions in battle, who are enervated, emaciated and inſlaved by their luſts? When Hannibal, the great Carthagenian General, had led an army over the Alps, penetrated Italy itſelf, and after ſundry ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful battles had given the Romans ſuch a ſevere ſtroke at Cannae, that there appeared ſcarce any thing to obſtruct his making himſelf maſter of their metropolis, Rome; yet he delayed at Capua, and indulged himſelf and ſoldiers in luxury and drunkenneſs, after which, it is ſaid, his army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came enervated and diſobedient, and he never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſucceſsful in Italy, nor indeed any where elſe.

               </gap> manly fear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence Jehovah, and be afraid of guilt.—Manly, did I ſay? It is angelic, in proportion as the Angels riſe in dignity, they deſcend in humble reverence of God. Can you venture to go to the field of battle, in ſuch a manner, as will not only endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger your bodies, but your ſouls? Will any leſs hardy, as by their open wickedneſs, to tell their fellow ſoldiers and others, that they neither fear God nor man, death nor damnation? Will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>But however I thus warn and charge you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of fearing God, and being afraid of guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in reſpect of your enemies, I would ſay, in the words of our text, <hi>be not afraid of them.</hi> We fight not for conqueſt or fame, with a deſign of cruelly and prodigally ſhedding human blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but merely in defence of thoſe rights, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us as men and Britons. Go forth then, and while our invaders boaſt of their armour, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, diſcipline and naval force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from the juſtneſs of our cauſe, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confide in the Lord of hoſts; ſaying "the ſword of the Lord and of <hi>Liberty.</hi>" Declare upon the one hand, that if you may enjoy unmoleſted, thoſe rights, which are derived from God alone; you are ready to lay down the arms which you have been conſtrained, as the laſt reſort, to take up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:042802_0028_101C9508997AC420"/>
on the other hand, with drawn ſword, aſſert, that rather than ſurrender that ſacred depoſitum of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which we received from our anceſtors, and are bound to tranſmit to our poſterity, you will ſign the remonſtrance with your own blood. I ſhall only add the words of a great General: <hi>Be of good courage, and let us play the men, for our people and the cities of our God; and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. You, who are either unfit for bearing arms, or on any other account, may be reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from going out to battle; yet much (as you have heard) may depend upon you, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſucceſs of thoſe who appear in the field. And O! how hopeful, if you are engaged in fighting againſt your own and others ſins which are the cauſe why God ſends upon us the calamity of war. On the other hand, how diſcouraging, if many of you, while others are abroad, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to cut the bands of ſlavery, and open a way to liberty with the ſword, ſhould, at home, be ſerving your luſts and ratifying a league with hell? While others are oppoſing the wrath of our enemies; will any of you venture on ſuch conduct as will draw down the wrath of God! You may, (as has been ſaid) be Achans at home and troublers of your country, as well as in the camp. And promiſe not yourſelves ſecurity in ſin, becauſe you do not expect to face death in battle. If God be your enemy, he'll find you out and puniſh you, though you were hid in the bottom of the ſea. You may fall into hell, by the hand of a ſin-avenging God, at home, while your brethren may ſtand in battle and return victorious. But O! how hopeful if the aged and females, who are not called to march forth with ſword and muſket, ſhould, while others are marching or fighting, be much in praying. This way they may ſerve and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:042802_0029_101C950BC630DE90"/>
help to ſave their country, in their houſes and cloſets, as truly as if they were able to appear in the field of battle. Jacob ſingly, conquered an enraged enemy, with 400 at his back, not by fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, but wreſtling with God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let me conclude with an addreſs, which equally concerns you all, whether you are to go to the field or abide by the ſtuff. We are at this day treated as guilty of rebellion againſt man, bleſſed be God this is a falſe charge: But let none of us venture to live under the juſt imputation of a rebellion, far more atrocious in its nature and dreadful in its conſequences. I mean an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rebellion againſt God, by violating his laws and deſpiſing his Goſpel. O ſinners, permit me to uſe, with a little variation, language which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its common acceptation, is juſtly hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but in this caſe proper and emphatical: Let me in reſpect of God charge you to non-reſiſtance, and the moſt unlimited and chearful obedience.—Lay aſide your armour, confeſs your crimes, and ſubmit yourſelves wholly to the mercy of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended King of Heaven and earth. Inſiſt upon no terms of capitulation, but thoſe of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, which are indeed worthy of a God to propoſe; ſalutary and honourable for you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Plead guilty, accept of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and this merciful King will paſs a ſentence of oblivion upon your iniquities, and of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity on your perſons. Come inliſt under Chriſt, and you ſhall be more than conquerors over your enemies, whether terreſtrial or infernal. Do you aſk what bounty he gives? It is beneath his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to encourage you with worldly wealth and honour; theſe he throws out to ſlaves, even to the devil's ſoldiers. What think you of pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſin, of having the honour to be conformed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſufferings in this world, and afterwards
