            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I am now to ſpeak to you on ſome affairs which greatly concern us both, and I expect you will give me your attention, and act a becoming part upon the occaſion.</p>
               <p>You know the treacherous and cruel part acted by ſome of your people at Logſtown and about the Ohio two years ago; you <hi>then</hi> plundered umbers of the traders, who were ſupplying you with goods;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015219_0003_0F9784D094B14590"/>
ſome of them you promiſed to protect and ſave their effects, but you did not keep your words: ſeveral of theſe unhappy ſufferers are thereby reduced to great neceſſity, ſome of whom are thrown into goal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not pay their debts.—This has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to apply to me, and to deſire I would lay before you their diſtreſſes, that you might <hi>give them a tract of land to compenſate in ſome meaſure for their great loſſes.</hi> I need not tell you, how incumbent it is upon you to agree to their deſire, as you muſt all be ſenſible they were ruined by ſome of your people in a time of peace, and when they were ſupplying your neceſſities: this conduct is ſufficient to make the traders very ſhy of going towards your country; and therefore I think it indiſpenſably your intereſt to <hi>grant</hi> their requeſt, which, <hi>though it will be but a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe,</hi> will, however, ſhew the world, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of what is paſt, and, like honeſt men, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of making ſome reſtitution for the damages you have committed. I expect you will, without delay, give me an anſwer, and I wiſh it may be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable one, as it will be for your own credit.</p>
               <p>BRETHREN,</p>
               <p>The next thing I am to take notice of, is at the deſire <hi>of the General,</hi> who commands all the army in this country: —he has repreſented to me the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there is for the troops to have gardens and corn about the forts; and although it is the cuſtom in all other places, that all the ground within cannon-ſhot ſhall belong to the fort, he has yet ſuch a regard for you, that he would <hi>not</hi> make any uſe of it without you were <hi>firſt made acquainted, and approved of it.</hi> This is an inſtance of ſo much goodneſs and condeſcenſion, that I expect you will not heſitate a moment <hi>to give up the ground,</hi> within cannon-ſhot round all the forts, for
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015219_0004_0F9784D14E857010"/>
the uſe of the king's army; and I know you will the readier do that, as ſuch ground ſo near a fort can be of no uſe to you, as it is only intended for the ſervice of the garriſon:—but as the garriſon of Fort Pitt is larger than the reſt, and a great way from our ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I have no doubt but you will give up a larger quantity of ground there for the uſe of the ſoldiers. And if you agree to this, I am perſuaded, they will look upon you in a much more friendly light than formerly: ſo that I expect a ſpeedy and agreeable anſwer.</p>
               <p>BRETHREN,</p>
               <p>The laſt, but the moſt important affair I have at this time to mention, is with regard <hi>to the ſettling a boundary between you and the Engliſh.</hi> I ſent a meſſage to ſome of your Nations ſome time ago, to acquaint you that I ſhould confer with you at this meeting upon it. The king, whoſe generoſity and forgiveneſs you have already experienced, being very deſirous <hi>to put a final end to diſputes between his people</hi> and <hi>you, concerning lands,</hi> and to do you ſtrict juſtice, has fallen upon the plan of <hi>a boundary</hi> between our provinces and the Indians, (which no white man ſhall dare to invade) as the beſt and ſureſt method of ending ſuch like diſputes, <hi>and ſecuring your property to you beyond a poſſibility of diſturbance.</hi> This will, I hope, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you ſo reaſonable, and ſo juſt, on the part of the king, and ſo advantageous to you and your poſterity, that I can have no doubt of your cheerfully joining with me, in ſettling ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion-line as will be beſt for the advantage of both the white men and the Indians, and as ſhall beſt agree with the extent and increaſe of each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and the governors, whom I ſhall conſult upon that occaſion, ſo ſoon as I am fully impowered; but,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015219_0005_0F9784D20CDC3C80"/>
in the mean time, I am deſirous to know in what manner <hi>you would chuſe to extend it,</hi> and what you will agree heartily to, and abide by, in general terms: at the ſame time I am to acquaint you, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the whole is ſettled, and that it ſhall appear you have ſo far conſulted the increaſing ſtate of our people, <hi>as to make any convenient ceſſions of ground,</hi> where it is moſt wanted, that then you will receive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable preſent in return for your friendſhip.</p>

               <p>We have heard what you told us, concerning the intentions of the great king, <hi>about a line</hi> between us and the Engliſh, and we have conſidered, that ſuch a thing will be very neceſſary, provided the white people will abide by it.</p>
               <p>BROTHER,</p>
               <p>The chief cauſe of all the late wars <hi>was about lands.</hi>—We ſaw the Engliſh coming towards us from all parts, and they have cheated us ſo often, that we could not think well of it. We were afraid, that in a little time you would be at our very caſtles; for this reaſon we thank the great king, for his good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and we hope he will make his people keep within bounds, which they have not yet done: we therefore <hi>agree, that a boundary ſhall be made between us,</hi> and that it ſhall run from Fort Edward along to the Mohawks caſtle, and from thence along the great mountain to Harris's Ferry on the river Saſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanna, agreeable to what we have drawn here, on a piece of bark. <hi>A Belt.</hi>

you, it is none of our faults. We were always ready <hi>to give,</hi> but the Engliſh don't deal fairly with us; they are more cunning than we are; <hi>they get our names upon paper very faſt,</hi> and we often don't know what it is for. We would do more to pleaſe the king, but it is hardly in our power, and ſome of us don't like it, becauſe we are ſo often impoſed upon: one of our nations is going to be cheated out of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the land between the Mohawk and the Big River, by people at Albany, <hi>to whom they never publickly made any ſuch grant,</hi> nor never received any thing for it. We ſpoke to you once before about it, and here are their chiefs now, who ſay, That ſince they firſt heard of it, they were promiſed juſtice by the ſeveral governors at Albany long ago.

               <p>You ſee how it is with us; if the Engliſh would be more honeſt, we ſhould be more generous, and there would be peace all through the land; but it is hard, that one of our nations, that live ſo near you<note place="bottom">The Mohawks.</note>, and have ſuffered ſo much on your account, ſhould be ſo greatly wronged.—This makes us apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that the Engliſh will ſoon ſtretch their arm over our lands: we beg then, that you will ſend our belts to the king, and tell him, how it is with us, and that we hope he will ſet us a good example, and give the Mohawks their land ſoon, before we ſettle any other matters; for our necks have been long ſtretched out to hear from him, and if we don't hear ſoon, ſome of our young people's heads will

               <p>Your ſpeech yeſterday much ſurpriſed me:— you appeared deſirous to ſet a <hi>boundary</hi> between the Engliſh and you, and ſenſible of the advantage of it; at the ſame time, you have deſcribed a boundary, which is ridiculous, and which ſhews me, you don't mean what you ſay, and are not deſirous to purſue what has been recommended to you:—neither does it proceed from your ignorance; for you convinced me yeſterday by the remarks you made on the great map, that you are well acquainted with the whole country, and the ſituation of all the places on the frontiers. Notwithſtanding which you have, in your boundary, cut off a large tract of country, which you all knew has been <hi>long ſince purchaſed and ſettled</hi>:— the land is patented one hundred miles beyond <hi>Fort Edward,</hi> and a great diſtance beyond the <hi>Mohawks Caſtle,</hi> and the <hi>line</hi> you make from thence to Harris's Ferry, inſtead of adding to, cuts off ſeveral towns and ſettlements, particularly in Pennſylvania, which
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015219_0009_0F9784D8D4846D18"/>
you know <hi>has been fairly purchaſed and allowed of by you,</hi> and to which <hi>you can make no claim,</hi> and you have taken no notice of the other governments. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the Mohawks is of old ſtanding, and I have never neglected it:—I can prove by papers I have here, that I laid it before Governor Clinton fifteen years ago, and that at the grand congreſs at Albany, in 1754, I did what I could for the Mohawks, who were promiſed to have the matter ſtrictly examined into:—there is a patent for it, and it is not an eaſy matter to break it. The Mohawks have given me infinite trouble about it, ever ſince the report that it was to be ſurveyed; it has not as yet affected their hunting, as it has never been ſurveyed or ſettled; and I have ſtated their complaints, and doubt not but they will be redreſſed. That is the only large tract, which at preſent concerns them, and therefore I am ſorry to find, you ſhould make it any objection to the good work which the king recommends. Theſe things require much time with white people; I have often recommended patience to them, and I wiſh they would follow my advice, and not interrupt a buſineſs which is of ſo great importance. I wanted only at preſent to know your general ſentiments upon this ſubject, and I wiſh they had been more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe it would have been as much for your intereſt, as that of the Engliſh.</p>

               </p>
               <p>At length we have agreed together for ourſelves, our wives and children, <hi>to make a ceſſion to the king,</hi> of the lands we ſhall now deſcribe, beginning at Owegi, on the eaſt branch of Saſquehanna, thence down the eaſt ſide of the river to Shamokin (or Fort Auguſta), and running up the weſt branch of Saſquehanna, on the ſouth ſide thereof, and from thence to Kittaning, or Adigo on the Ohio, thence along and down the Ohio to the Cherokee River, and up the ſame to its head, <hi>on this ſide</hi>; upon condition that you have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for our Warriors, who always paſs through that country, and give them always a free paſſage; and we are very happy in being all aſſembled here, both ſachems and warriors, at this time, and not as has been formerly the caſe, on ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>We can now all act together, <hi>as all ſhould receive a ſhare for what they have ceded,</hi> by which it will be preſerved in our minds. We have never refuſed you lands.

               <p>Hearken to me, who have good words to ſpeak to you, ſuch as are for the benefit of your whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, and of your children yet unborn.</p>
               <p>You all remember, that three years ago I ſignified to you <hi>his Majeſty's deſire to eſtabliſh a boundary line</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his people and yours; and that we then agreed together, how ſome part of that line ſhould run, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſame came to be ſettled.</p>
               <p>You all, I am hopeful, recollect the reaſons I then gave you for making <hi>ſuch a boundary</hi>; nevertheleſs, I ſhall again repeat them:—You know, brethren, <hi>that the encroachments upon your lands</hi> have been always one of your principal ſubjects of complaint; and that, ſo far as it could be done, endeavours have not been wanting for your obtaining redreſs. But it was a difficult taſk, and generally unſucceſsful; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the provinces have bounds between each other, there are no certain bounds between them and you; and thereby, not only ſeveral of our people, ignorant in Indian affairs, have advanced to far <hi>into your country,</hi> but alſo many of your own people, through the want of ſuch a line, <hi>have been deceived in the ſales they have made,</hi> or in the limits they have ſet to our reſpective claims.—This, brethren, is a ſad caſe, which has frequently given us much trouble, and turned many of your heads; but it is likely to continue ſo, until ſome bounds are agreed to, fixed upon, and made public between us.—The great, the good king of England, my maſter, whoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and tender regard for your intereſts I wiſh you may ever hold in remembrance, has, amongſt other inſtances of his goodneſs, after long deliberation on
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015219_0025_0F9784E7D0E01D38"/>
ſome means for your relief, <hi>and for preventing future diſputes concerning lands,</hi> at length reſolved upon fixing a <hi>general boundary line</hi> between his ſubjects and you, and that in ſuch a manner as ſhall be moſt agreeable to you; in conſequence of which, I have received his royal commands to call you together for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; and after conferring with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments intereſted hereupon, <hi>you now ſee before you the governor of the Jerſeys, the commiſſioners on behalf of Aſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regoa, governor of Virginia, and commiſſioners from Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> in order to give you the ſtrongeſt aſſurances on behalf of their reſpective governments, <hi>of their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to pay due regard to what ſhall be now entered into:</hi> the preſence of ſo many great men will give a ſanction to the tranſaction, and cauſe the ſame to be known as far as the Engliſh name extends.—His Majeſty has directed me to give you a handſome proof of his generoſity, <hi>proportioned to the nature and extent of what lands ſhall fall to him.</hi>—Upon the whole, I hope that your deliberations will be unanimous, and your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions ſuch as his majeſty may conſider as proofs of your gratitude for all his favours. <hi>A fine new Belt.</hi>

               <p>The importance of this affair now before us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the moſt ſerious attention; I will not burthen you with any other ſubject until this is generally ſettled; and therefore we ſhall adjourn, that you may have time to think of it, and come fully prepared to give an agreeable anſwer.</p>

We are glad <hi>that ſo many great men are aſſembled to bear witneſs of the tranſaction</hi>; and we are now reſolved to retire and conſult on a proper anſwer to be given to all you have ſaid; and ſo ſoon as we have agreed upon it, we ſhall give you notice, that we may again aſſemble and make it known to you; and we are all much obliged to you, that you have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us to attend to this great affair alone at this time, that our minds might not be burthened or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from it by attending to any thing elſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE writers on juriſprudence agree in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <q>that the original right to all kinds of property aroſe from pre-occupancy, and that in a ſtate of nature every one might poſſeſs himſelf of, and retain any vacant ſubject.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt occupant had a right to grant, cede, or transfer the ſubject he had poſſeſſed himſelf of, to ſuch perſons, and upon ſuch terms, as he thought proper; and if before ſuch grant, ceſſion or transfer the occupant died, his property deſcended to his children. The <hi>right</hi> of tranſmitting property always reſided in the owner, and civil inſtitutions only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the <hi>mode</hi> of carrying that right into effect.</p>
               <p>In that period of ſociety when countries were formed, and their boundaries fixed, we find that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſtricts were appropriated to the native owners, the firſt occupants, or in caſe of vacant or derelict lands, to the firſt diſcoverers. From thoſe original proprietors each country was tranſmitted to other
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015219_0040_0F9784F553C64568"/>
proprietors, by the conſent or by the conqueſt of the preſent owners.</p>
               <p>In the caſe under conſideration, I am of opinion that the Indians of the Six Nations appear to have been entitled to the lands in queſtion from pre-occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy, or from conqueſt, but however their right accrued, they are acknowledged in expreſs words by the deed of ceſſion to the crown, made at Fort Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wix, November 5th, 1768, to have been at that time <hi>the true and abſolute proprietors</hi> of the lands in queſtion; and ſo they were alſo acknowledged to be in the publick negociations between England and France, in the year 1755, and ſo <hi>alſo,</hi> as is ſtated in the caſe, ſeveral treaties of peace and commerce entered into with particular nations or tribes of Indians by the Engliſh nation, conſider and treat the natives or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiers as the lawful poſſeſſors and owners of the countries they reſpectively occupy.</p>
               <p>The deed of ceſſion to the crown, on the 5th of November, 1768, was made in conſideration of £ 10, 460:7:3 ſterling, then paid to the Six United Nations, and for <hi>other conſiderations</hi> mentioned and expreſſed <hi>in that deed and the treaties previous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This deed of ceſſion, the conveyance to Mr. Trent, and the treaties in 1765 and 1768, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered together, as they all tend to illuſtrate the whole tranſaction, and explain the intention of the contracting parties: And taking the whole under conſideration, it appears—That the Six United Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were truly ſenſible of the great loſs the traders had ſuſtained by the treachery and depredations of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015219_0041_0F9784F67A5307C0"/>
ſome of their tributary or dependant tribes—That a requiſition was made to the Six United Nations in May 1765 for a grant of land by way of compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſating in ſome meaſure for the damages the traders had ſuſtained by the depredations of their dependants or tributary Indians—That the Six Nations, after deliberating from the 2d of May, when this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was made, to the 6th of May, <hi>they agreed that the requeſt of the traders ſhould be complied with, and that they would grant</hi> them <hi>ſome lands</hi> near Fort Pitt. That at the congreſs and treaty in November 1768, held at Fort Stanwix, the chiefs and ſachems of the Six United Nations again took this matter under their conſideration, and upon the firſt day of that month expreſsly declared, that <q>
                     <hi>in order to ſhew that they</hi> loved juſtice, they expected, that the traders who ſuffered by ſome of their dependants in the war five years ſince, might have a grant for the lands they then gave them down Ohio, as a ſatisfaction for their loſſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the 3d day of the ſame month of November, the Six Nations, by their ſachems and chiefs, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the conveyance to Mr. Trent; which proceeds upon a recital, that he had been impowered by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral letters of attorney from the ſuffering traders named in the ſaid deed, to aſk, ſolicit, demand and receive from the Six Nations a grant of a tract of land as a ſatisfaction, compenſation or retribution for the goods, merchandize and effects of the ſaid Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Trent, and of the ſaid ſeveral traders which the ſaid Shawneſſe, Delaware and Huron tribes, tributaries of the ſaid Six Nations (contrary to all good faith, and in violation of their repeated promiſes of ſafety and protection to the traders, their ſervants and effects, while trading in their country) did violently
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015219_0042_0F9784F6DCA13940"/>
ſeize upon, and unjuſtly appropriate to their own uſe.—The deed then declares, that in conſideration of the Sum of £ 85, 916:1:8, lawful money of the province of New-York, the ſame being the amount of the goods and merchandize which were unjuſtly ſeized and taken from the traders as aforeſaid, whereof juſt and fair accounts on oath and affirmation had been produced, interpreted and explained to them, and which at their deſire were then lodged and depoſited with the ſaid Sir William Johnſon.—The chiefs and ſachems of the ſaid Six United Nations, for the ſaid conſiderations, and in conſideration of five ſhillings, did give, grant, bargain and ſell unto his majeſty, his heirs and ſucceſſors, to and for the only uſe, benefit and behoof of the ſaid William Trent, in his own right, and as attorney aforeſaid, all that tract of land deſcribed in the conveyance. To hold unto his majeſty, his heirs and ſucceſſors, but to and for the only uſe, benefit and behoof of the ſaid William Trent, in his own right, and as attorney aforeſaid, his heirs and aſſigns for ever. This deed of conveyance ſeems to have been executed in the moſt publick manner, in the preſence of the king's governor of New-Jerſey, and the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners from Virginia and Pennſylvania, and ſeveral other perſons who attended the congreſs, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the execution of this conveyance, which by that means received every degree of ſolemnity and ſanction.</p>
               <p>On the 5th day of the ſame month of November, 1768, the ſaid chiefs and ſachems executed their deed of ceſſion to his majeſty, of a large tract of country upon the river Ohio. In this deed of ceſſion the Indians expreſsly ſtipulate <hi>that their preſent grants</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:015219_0043_0F9784F860D3C730"/>
[which words are explained in the minutes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of November 5th, where the traders deed is mentioned with the other grants then made] <q>ſhould be deemed valid on their parts,</q> and they convey to the king, not only in conſideration of the preſent then made, and the money then paid by the king, amounting to £ 10,460:10:3, but alſo <hi>for the other conſiderations in the deed before mentioned</hi>—And the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum is to the king, his heirs and ſucceſſors, <hi>under the reſervation made in the treaty</hi>—So that the deed of ceſſion to the king <hi>virtually confirms</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance to Mr. Trent. Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that Mr. Trent, in his own right, and as attorney for the traders, <hi>hath a good, lawful and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient title to the land</hi> granted by the ſaid deed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, ſubject <hi>only</hi> to the king's ſovereignty over the ſettlements to be eſtabliſhed thereon, and over the inhabitants, as Engliſh ſubjects.</p>

               <p>I Entirely concur with Mr. Dagge in his opinion on <hi>this</hi> caſe. The property of the ſoil conveyed to Mr Trent, for himſelf and as attorney, was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the Six Nations, and as incident to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, they had a power of alienating and transferring in <hi>any</hi> manner, or to any perſons, unleſs they had been reſtrained by their own laws.</p>
               <p>In this caſe the ſupreme power of the country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015219_0044_0F9784F90E139788"/>
in the ſellers, who had therefore an abſolute power of alienating; and the tranſaction being fair and open, and for the expreſs purpoſe of doing an act of publick juſtice, muſt bind the Six Nations in good faith. If we ſuppoſe, that the ſovereignty of the land ſtill remained in the Six Nations, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ſoil muſt be in the grantee Mr. Trent, and <hi>cannot</hi> without violence and injuſtice be taken from him. The very act however of the ſovereign power of the Six Nations admits a capacity in the grantee, to take under the deed, according to their laws, or uſage, and there is no law, that I ever heard of, that reſtrains the ſubjects of the crown of England from purchaſing in foreign dominions. The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parties here appears to have been to transfer the ſovereignty to the crown of England by the ſame inſtrument <hi>whereby</hi> the land was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed. If that transfer of the ſovereignty is effectual, it paſſed, and is confirmed by the deed of ceſſion to the crown, dated two days after; but ſubject, however, to all the antecedent rights of property, the crown being entitled <hi>only</hi> to the immediate property of vacant and unappropriated lands; but in <hi>this</hi> caſe the lands are abandoned by the proprietors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the grantee.—If the crown had an original ſovereignty, ſtill the ſoil being the property of the Six Nations, they and their alienee ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by that ſovereignty <hi>in their property.</hi> If the crown acquired the ſovereignty by the grant to Mr. Trent, or by the deed of ceſſion, the title of the grantee is then under the protection of the laws of England.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that in every way of conſidering this caſe, the grant to Mr. Trent
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015219_0045_0F9784FA837B9A00"/>
is good, ſufficient and lawful; and is under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the laws of England.</p>
