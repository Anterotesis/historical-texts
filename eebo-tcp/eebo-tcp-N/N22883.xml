            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE POLITICAL CENSOR, <hi>For NOVEMBER</hi> 1796.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>REMARKS</hi> ON CITIZEN ADET's NOTES TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.</head>
            <p>THE moment the Gallic uſurpers had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their ſovereign, and, from the vileſt walks in life, mounted into his ſeat, they aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tone of maſters to the government of the United States. Their ſtyle has ſometimes ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is true; but the general tenor of it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly approached towards that loftieſt note, that <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of inſolence, which it attained in <hi>Citizen Adet's</hi> laſt communications.</p>
            <p>In offering my ſentiments on theſe arrogant effuſions of upſtart tyranny, I feel an unuſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030226_0004_0FE54ADBD29EA1D0"/>
of diffidence: a diffidence that does not ariſe from any fear I entertain of the Citizen or his factious adherents, or even of the "terrible nation," to uſe his own words, of which he was lately the worthy repreſentative; but from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of my inability to do juſtice to the ſubject. The keeneſt ſatire, were I maſter of it, would fall blunted from ſuch hardened impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſuch pure unadulterated braſs, as it would here have to encounter. Terms of reproach are not yet invented, capable of expreſſing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment that every man, who has the leaſt reſpect for the government, ought to feel on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Thus voluntarily to interfere in a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a foreign miniſter and the officers of ſtate, might, under other circumſtances, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear rather a bold intruſion; but, the Citizen's having communicated his papers <hi>to the people,</hi> at the ſame time, if not before, they reached the Secretary of State, happily precludes the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of an apology.</p>
            <p>The notes on which I am about to remark, and to which, collected together, I have affixed the title of <hi>Diplomatic Blunderbuſs,</hi> are intended chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to notify to the people of America, that the French rulers are angry with the Federal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that, in conſequence of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they have ordered Citizen Adet to ſuſpend his functions as miniſter, till the government ſhall alter its conduct, or, in the pedagogue ſtyle, mend its manners.</p>
            <p>In the 44th page of the <hi>Blunderbuſs,</hi> the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen makes a recapitulation of the offences that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030226_0005_0FE54ADD6FC53B98"/>
have brought on us this dreadful chaſtiſement, this political excommunication; and it will not appear a little ſurpriſing, that ſome of them have exiſted ever ſince the birth of the French Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, notwithſtanding the love and eſteem this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh lady has ever expreſſed towards her ſiſter America.</p>
            <p>Theſe offences amounting to ſeven in number, are as follows:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Federal Government <hi>put in queſtion,</hi> whether it ſhould execute the treaties, or receive the agents of the <hi>rebel</hi> and proſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>princes.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. It made a proclamation of <hi>inſidious</hi> neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality.</item>
                  <item>3. By its <hi>chicaneries,</hi> it <hi>abandoned</hi> French pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers to its courts of juſtice.</item>
                  <item>4. It eluded the amicable mediation of the French Republic for breaking the chains of the American citizens in Algiers.</item>
                  <item>5. It <hi>allowed</hi> the French colonies to be declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſtate of blockade, and <hi>allowed</hi> the citizens of America to be interdicted the right of trading to them.</item>
                  <item>6. It eluded all the advances made by the French Republic for renewing the <hi>treaties of commerce</hi> upon a more favourable footing to both nations.</item>
                  <item>7. It anticipated Great Britain, by ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a treaty, in which treaty it proſtituted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030226_0006_0FE54ADF05EB0F78"/>
its neutrality; it ſacrificed France to her enemies, or rather, looking upon her as obliterated from the chart [map] of the world, it forgot the ſervices ſhe had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and threw aſide the duty of gratitude, as if ingratitude was a governmental duty.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the heinous crimes of which the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Government ſtands charged by the ſultans of France. Let us now, if they will permit us, examine theſe crimes, one by one, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Preſident, and Meſſrs. Hamilton, Knox, Jay, Pickering and Wolcot, really deſerve to be guillotined, or not.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Federal Government put in queſtion, whether it ſhould execute the treaties, or receive the agents of the <hi>rebel</hi> and proſcribed princes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Citizen has made a ſmall miſtake in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up this charge, owing, I ſuppoſe, to his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of that excellent rule of the Engliſh language, which requires every thing to be called by its right name. I would have worded it thus: <q>The Federal Government put in queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould execute the treaties, made between America and the king of France, with his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel ſubjects</hi> who had juſt murdered him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the agents of his lawful ſucceſſors, the Princes whom thoſe murderers had had the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity to pretend to proſcribe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With this trifling alteration, I am ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the truth of the charge, but am very far from admitting it to be a crime. The king of France was murdered on the 21ſt of January, 1793. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030226_0007_0FE54AE11AC91610"/>
of this event could not be received here much before the 18th of April, and it was on that day the Preſident ſubmitted to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the queſtions of which the above charge forms the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>The treaties here ſpoken of, were made with Louis XVI. whoſe miniſter, at the time theſe queſtions were propoſed for conſideration, was reſident at Philadelphia. The Preſident knew, indeed, that the king was dead, but he, at the ſame time, knew that the treaties were binding on the United States in behalf of his lawful <q>heirs and ſucceſſors,</q> and he certainly knew that Petion, Danton, Roland, Clavière, Condorcet, Briſſot, and the innumerable horde of bloody uſurpers who have come after them, were not thoſe <q>heirs and ſucceſſors?</q> He alſo knew, that even the whole French nation, could not, in the ſenſe of the treaties, become the "heirs and ſucceſſors" of Louis XVI. and, though treaties, made with a monarch, <hi>may</hi> remain in force with the nation under a new form of government, yet this is, as moſt aſſuredly it ought to be, entirely at the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other contracting party. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can government had, therefore, an indiſputed right to refuſe to execute, in behalf of the French nation, treaties made with their ſovereign alone.</p>
            <p>If we turn back a little, we ſhall find this very audacious and unprincipled Convention, whoſe miniſter was coming to Philadelphia, publicly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating, <q>whether the treaties, made with the <hi>tyrant Louis,</hi> were binding on the <hi>regenerated nation,</hi> or not.</q> This queſtion was determined <hi>in the negative,</hi> and accordingly the treaty with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030226_0008_0FE54AE4EE324758"/>
Holland was immediately violated. And yet they will not permit the poor government of America to debate about any ſuch thing, nor even to talk of it in ſecret, though the reſult be in their own favour! Let it be remembered too, that Genet came authorized to make <hi>new treaties,</hi> a pretty certain proof, that the Convention did not call in queſtion the right of the government to refuſe to adhere to the old ones. It is a proof of more; it is a proof that they expected that it would make the refuſal. Would to God their expectation had been realized!</p>
            <p>I will not go ſo far as to ſay, that the Federal Government was fully juſtified in its <hi>deciſion</hi> on this important ſubject; but I inſiſt that its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct evinced the utmoſt partiality for the new <hi>Republic.</hi> When Genet arrived here, it was far from being aſcertained that the whole, or even a majority, of the French nation, approved of the murder of their ſovereign, or had abandoned the cauſe of his ſucceſſors. The government of America, had, but a few months before, beheld them raiſing their hands to heaven, and ſwearing to die, if neceſſary, in defence of their king. Their conſtitution, eſtabliſhing a <hi>hereditary monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> had been voluntarily formed, and ſolemnly ſanctioned by the whole nation, amidſt feſtivals and <hi>Te-Deums,</hi> and had been officially communicated to the world. Each member of the Aſſembly, as well as every individual Frenchman, had repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſworn <q>to maintain this conſtitution with all his might.</q> Laws had been made, puniſhing with tranſportation all who refuſed to take the oath, and till then unheard-of cruelties had been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on the non-jurors. After all this, was it
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030226_0009_0FE54AE7AAA315B8"/>
aſtoniſhing that the Federal Government ſhould, for a moment, heſitate to believe, that the nation was really become a Republic, and that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, about which there had been ſo much noiſe and rejoicing and feaſting and ſinging and ſwearing ſhould be ſo completely deſtroyed as to leave neither remnant nor rag viſible? Muſt they be looked upon as the enemies of France, becauſe they did not yield implicit credit to him who firſt told them, that the very men who had declared the king's perſon to be <q>ſacred and inviolable,</q> had dipped their hands in his blood; and that the people, who had ſolemnly vowed to maintain the decree with their lives, had baſely applauded the ſanguinary deed?— It is not the final <hi>determination</hi> of the American government, for that was in favour of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but it is its <hi>heſitation,</hi> of which Citizen Adet complains; as if he had ſaid: <q>How could you, for a moment, doubt of the faithleſsneſs of my countrymen? How durſt you heſitate to think them, what they have ſince ſo fully proved themſelves, a horde of traitors, perjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and aſſaſſins?</q>—If the Citizen will but forgive the government this time, I will anſwer for them they will never doubt on this ſubject again.</p>
            <p>But, if it was ſo very natural for the Federal Government to view the French in their true character, was not that a reaſon, on the other hand, for deliberating whether their republican miniſter ſhould be received in preference to the agents of the Princes? The government had the intereſts of America to attend to in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant deciſion, as well as thoſe of France. A
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030226_0010_0FE54AE9436D9BF8"/>
weighty debt was due from this country, not to the regenerated nation nor to its bloodthirſty ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, but to Louis XVI <hi>his heirs and ſucceſſors.</hi> A miniſter from the Republic once admitted, a claim of the intereſt of the debt could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; and if the volatile and perjured nation, had recalled the ſucceſſor of their ſovereign, would not that ſucceſſor have demanded, and with juſtice, a ſecond payment of ſuch intereſt? This has not <hi>yet</hi> happened, but it does not follow that it might not have happened. In the common affairs of men, he who has been once convicted of perjury, is never after looked upon as credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the ſame rule is applicable to ſocieties. It is entirely owing to the want of good faith among the allies, and to the daſtardly conduct of the Princes themſelves, neither of which could well be foreſeen at the time, that a Bourbon is not now on the throne of France: ſo that, the Federal Government, inſtead of diſcovering a hoſtile diſpoſition towards the Republic, certainly hazarded much in its favour.</p>
            <p>But, conſiderations of this nature have no weight with the new ſovereigns of France. Their object in bringing forward the charge at this time, is, not to impreſs on the minds of the people that their government acted unjuſtly or unwiſely, but that it leaned to the ſide of <hi>monarchy</hi> rather than to that of <hi>republicaniſm.</hi> That this is falſe is clear from the reſult; but were the inſinuation juſt, had the government expreſſed a wiſh to ſee ſuch a monſter of a republic as that of France cruſhed in its birth, the wiſh would have been a moſt pious one.</p>

               <hi>Republicaniſm</hi> is become, for what reaſon I know not, ſynonymous with <hi>freedom and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and there are thouſands among us who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to believe, notwithſtanding the terrible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before their eyes, that men cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved under a form of government that is called republican. Mr. Adams, in his <hi>Defence of the American Conſtitutions,</hi> Vol. I. page 87, ſays: <q>Our countrymen <hi>will never run delirious after a word</hi> or a <hi>name.</hi> The <hi>name republic</hi> is given to things in their nature as different and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory as light and darkneſs, truth and falſehood, virtue and vice, happineſs and miſery. There are <hi>free republics,</hi> and <hi>republics as tyrannical as an oriental deſpotiſm.</hi>
               </q>—How fully is the truth of theſe obſervations exemplified in the republics of America and France! But even this wiſe and deep-ſighted civilian could not imagine that his countrymen would ever run delirious after a name; much leſs could he imagine, that he ſhould live to ſee many of them extolling, as the paragon of republics, a ſyſtem of tyranny that has all the appearance of being an inſtrument of the wrath of heaven.</p>
            <p>I ſhall diſmiſs this firſt charge againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with obſerving, that the meanneſs equals the impudence of making it. We have ſeen the French murder their king, whoſe greateſt fault was his confidence in <hi>their</hi> fidelity; we have ſeen them drag his headleſs and bloody carcaſs from the ſcaffold, throw it into a pit without the rites of ſepulture, and, to deprive it of even the privilege of rotting, conſume it with hot lime. Yet, after all this, they are not aſhamed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that they were not, without heſitation, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030226_0012_0FE54AEF53EBD698"/>
as heirs his ſucceſſors! They are not aſhamed to enjoy the benefits reſulting from a contract, made with the very man the anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of whoſe murder they celebrate! Like the treacherous labourers, they firſt ſlay the lord of the vineyard and then ſeize on his poſſeſſions, his titles and his deeds.—Men may be unjuſt and tyrannical, they may even be cruel and ferocious, without being <hi>mean.</hi> There are many aſſaſſins who would ſcorn to dreſs themſelves in the robes of their victim. But, to unite vices ſeemingly incompatible, is the characteriſtic of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated French: in all they ſay and do, there is ſuch a mixture of licentiouſneſs and ſervility, of frivolity and ferocity, of duplicity, inſolence and meanneſs, that we know not whether to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe or hate them moſt.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>2.</hi> The government made a proclamation of <hi>inſidious</hi> neutrality.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This charge is as falſe as it is rude. I would beg this well-informed and polite citizen, to name one ſingle inſtance of the inſincerity of the Federal Government, in enforcing this proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As applied to the conduct of ſome part of the people, indeed, the neutrality might be called <hi>inſidious;</hi> but then, this inſidiouſneſs operated in favour of the French and not againſt them. There were many who highly approved of the proclamation, and who at the ſame time actually made war upon the enemies of France. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Americans, under the authority of Genet, invaded the Spaniſh territories, while privateers were fitted out to cruize on the Britiſh; cargoes of ammunition and arms were ſhipped off, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030226_0013_0FE54AF257B2D948"/>
thankſgivings, and other public demonſtrations of joy, were heard from one end of the Union to the other. The bells of the good old Chriſtian church, oppoſite me, fired rounds to celebrate the inundation of the Atheiſtical barbarians into Holland; and the Engliſh flag was burnt at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, on the public ſquare, as a ſacrifice to the goddeſs of French liberty. Theſe latter cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are trifling in themſelves, 'tis true, and certainly excited nothing but contempt and ridicule, in the minds of thoſe whom they were intended to inſult; but, the queſtion is (and it is to aſk this queſtion that they are here mentioned), what would the French, that "terrible nation," have ſaid, had theſe inſults, theſe marks of an <hi>insidious</hi> neutrality been offered to them? Would they not have ſent their fleets and knocked down our towns and burnt our ſhips? No; the enemy would have ſtopped them on the way; but they would have ſtirred hell to ſeek for the means of vengeance. What they had wanted in deeds, they would have made up for in words. Every opprobrious term in their new-fangled vocabula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would have been heaped on our heads. How many <hi>sacres mâtins</hi> and <hi>jean-f—tres</hi> and <hi>f—tus chiens</hi> and <hi>libertécides</hi> and <hi>neutralitécides</hi> would they have called the poor <hi>Anglo-Americans,</hi> in the courſe of a <hi>Decade!</hi> Inſtead of bell, book and candle, they would have curſed us with all the gods of their heatheniſh calendar; and, which would have been infinitely worſe, they would have curſed us with the teazing remonſtrances of an impertinent miniſter.</p>
            <p>Where a breach of neutrality, cognizable by the laws, appeared, the Federal Government al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030226_0014_0FE54AF3EBE7C2E8"/>
did its utmoſt to bring the offenders to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and it is for this very reaſon, that the late diplomatic Mounſeer has dared to accuſe it of an inſidious neutrality. After the proclamation was iſſued, and Genet ſaw that there was no hope of ſetting it aſide by inciting the people to rebellion, he feigned an acquieſcence, and declared that the Convention did not wiſh the proſperity of their dear brethren of America to be interrupted by a participation in the war. It entered into his delirious brain, that the proclamation was to be a mere cloak, under which he thought to enliſt as many ſoldiers and arm as many privateers as he could pay for. Such a neutrality would, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, have been more advantageous to France than an open declaration of war on the part of the United States; but when he found that the government was reſolved to enforce the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; when he found that his pirates were not permitted to rob and plunder with impunity, and that the American harbours were not to ſerve them as hiding places, whence they might ſally out upon poor old John Bull, as their great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor did upon the beeves of Hercules; then he began to foam and <hi>sacre dieu</hi> againſt the <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>técide</hi> government, for <q>neutralizing the zeal of the citizens, and puniſhing the generous children of liberty, for flying to the relief of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when ſhe was upon the point of violation by a horde of crowned monſters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As Citizen Adet ſeems to have been furniſhed with memorandums concerning the conduct of all the State Governments, with reſpect to the veſſels of the belligerent nations; as he muſt be in poſſeſſion of the <hi>French archives,</hi> thoſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

records of poor Mr. Randolph's precious confeſſions, and of the ſervices of all thoſe who have deſerved well of the terrible Republic, it was rather ungrateful of him, to overlook the alertneſs of that vigilant and virtuous and chaſte and incorruptible republican, Governor Mifflin, at the time of laying the embargo. That vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old Democrat, the father-in-law of Citizen Genet, who has happily given place to a better man, might alſo have merited encomium on the ſame account. With what care did they watch! With what zeal did they call out the militia, and man whale boats, and run and buſtle about, to prevent the eſcape of veſſels bound to Britiſh ports! Their diligence in the diſcharge of this part of their duty was not a whit inferior to that of thoſe uſeful auxiliaries of juſtice, which the rudeneſs of theſe latter times has ſtyled thief-catchers; while the veſſels bound to the land of <hi>Meſſidor</hi> and <hi>Floreal</hi> and <hi>Vendimaire,</hi> &amp;c. ſlipped off "in a dark night;" and while, in another quarter, a whole fleet ſailed for this land of ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, though the embargo had been laid ten days before. Had the Britiſh miniſter complained of a breach of neutrality here, he might have been heard with patience; but, if even he had had the aſſurance to make uſe of the word <hi>inſidious,</hi> he would have merited a peremptory order to pack up.</p>
            <p>The only breach of neutrality with which the Federal Government can poſſibly be charged, is, the liquidation of the French debt. This favour, as beneficial to France as it was apparently ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous to the United States, would have been acknowledged by Citizen Adet and his maſters,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030226_0016_0FE54AFBC736CD40"/>
had they not been as ignorant of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as of the laws of politeneſs and decency. Citizen Genet, when he opened the negociation, promiſed that every farthing of the debt, if li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidated, ſhould be <hi>expended in the country,</hi> and, for once, I believe, contrary to the German pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, the Frenchman kept his word; for, except what was retained for the unavoidable daily hire of <hi>Poor Richard,</hi> and ſome few other items, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every ſingle ſous of it went among the <hi>Flour-Merchants.</hi>—What think you, Mr. Dallas? Come now, d—n it, tell the truth for once in your life. Be frank with your countryman, and we'll make up all old grievances.—Well, you may be as fulky as you pleaſe: I believe it; or your friend Fauchet never would have ſtood, like a bilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cully, with his pocket turned inſide out, when he could have purchaſed a delicious civil war with a few thouſand dollars.—It is an old ſaying, and all old ſayings are true; that what is got over the devil's back is ſpent under his belly; and ſo it happened with this debt. The givers and the receivers were juſt of a ſtamp, and one had juſt as much right to the money as the other.</p>
            <p>But, to return to my ſubject: whether this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidation were a breach of neutrality, in a rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe, or not, every real friend of America muſt rejoice at its being effected. It was one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort towards ſhaking off a <hi>dependence</hi> that yet hangs about our necks like a millſtone. One of our poets has called a <hi>dun</hi> 
               <q>a horrid monſter, hated of gods and men.</q> Exactly ſuch was Genet, when he firſt arrived, and ſuch would have been his ſucceſſors, had not the clamorous creditors (or rather claimants) been ſilenced by a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030226_0017_0FE54AFD58B38838"/>
diſcharge of the debt. This the government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly foreſaw, and therefore wiſely reſolved to relieve us from their importunities. But there is another debt of enormous magnitude, that ſtill remains; I mean the debt of <hi>gratitude</hi> due from this country to the regenerated French. This we ſhall never liquidate, while there is a Frenchman left to aſk, or an American to give. It is incal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culable in its amount, and eternal in its duration; we will therefore leave it to paſs down the ſtream of time along with the <hi>insidious neutrality.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Government, by its</hi> chicaneries, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>French privateers to its</hi> courts of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>This is, I tremblingly preſume, the "terrible" ſtyle, and is therefore looked upon as ſufferable in a miniſter from a "terrible nation;" but I am pretty confident, it would be ſuffered with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in no other. Some writer on the belles let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, I believe it is Burke, obſerves, that terror is a property of the ſublime, and I am ſure that inſolence is a property of the terrible. I know not preciſely what puniſhment the law of nations has awarded for ſuch language, but I ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it can be nothing ſhort of breaking of bones. A good Iriſh ſheeleley or Devonſhire quarterſtaff ſeems much better calculated for anſwering a charge like this than a pen.—The <hi>chicaneries of the government!—Abandoning</hi> privateers to <hi>courts of Juſtice!</hi>—If this does not deſerve a rib-roaſting, I do not know what does. If this goes off ſo, then I ſay there is no ſuch thing as juſtice on this ſide the grave. Why, I have ſeen many as good a man as Citizen Adet, aye and as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his king too, flogged till the blood ran into
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030226_0018_0FE54AFEEB049A90"/>
his ſhoes, for giving language, a hundred times leſs inſolent than this, to a lance corporal.</p>
            <p>Does the General Government of America then act by <hi>chicane?</hi> Does General Waſhington, whoſe integrity, whoſe inflexible firmneſs and whoſe undaunted bravery have been acknowledged and admired as far as his name has reached, merit to be put on a level with a miſerable pettifogger? And is a cauſe <hi>abandoned,</hi> becauſe it is ſubmitted to <hi>an American court of judicature?</hi> Are both judges and juries in this country ſo very very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, that no juſtice can be expected from their deciſions? Are we ſo nearly like Sodom and Gomorrah that twelve honeſt men are not to be found among us?</p>
            <p>An accuſation may be ſo completely abſurd and impudent, that no one can attempt to refute it, without ſinking, in ſome degree, towards a level with the accuſer; and, as I have no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to do this, I leave the preſent one to be anſwered by the indignation of the reader.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Every one who recollects the anxiety which the Preſident has ever expreſſed on the ſubject of a treaty with Algiers, the innumerable obſtacles he had to ſurmount, and the enormous expenſe by means of which it was at laſt effected, need not be told that this charge is as ill-founded as the preceding ones. But, as it is intended to bring forward to the people a proof of the Friendſhip
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030226_0019_0FE54B0113C08C90"/>
of France, at the moment her hatred and hoſtility are evident to every eye, in this point of view it may be worth while to hear what the Citizen has to ſay in ſupport of it.</p>
            <p>He tells us (<hi>Diplomatic Blunderbuſs,</hi> page 66), that <q>the French government, zealous of giving to the United States proofs of its attachment, had commenced negociations with the regency of Algiers, in order to put an end to the war which that power was making on the commerce of the United States.</q> That the miniſter for foreign affairs inſtructed Fauchet (the very Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet who expreſſed his regret that the Weſtern rebellion did not ſucceed) to communicate to the Federal Government the ſteps which that of France had taken in this reſpect, which he did in the following terms, on the 4th of June, 1794.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I have already had the pleaſure, Sir, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, verbally, of <hi>the intereſt</hi> which the committee of public ſafety of the national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention <hi>had early taken</hi> in the truly unhappy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of your commerce in the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean.</p>
               <p>I now fulfil the duty impoſed on me by the government, by calling to your <hi>recollection</hi> in writing, the ſteps which are to be taken by our agent with the dey of Algiers, for repreſſing this new manoeuvre of the Britiſh adminiſtration, which has put the finiſhing ſtroke to its proofs of malevolence towards free people. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of the miniſter <hi>communicating this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> to me, is dated the 5th January, 1794, and did not come to my hands till fifteen days ago;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030226_0020_0FE54B061A663978"/>
I <hi>do not yet know by what route;</hi> I could have wiſhed it had been leſs tardy in coming to me, that I might ſooner have fulfilled the agreeable taſk of proving to you by facts, the proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of friendſhip of which I have ſo often ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the name of the Republic of France.</p>
               <p>The information which I ſhall receive from Europe in a little time, <hi>will doubtleſs possess me of the success of those negociations</hi> which <hi>were to have been</hi> opened in January laſt. If the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of your affairs is yet ſuch with reſpect to that barbarous regency, as that our interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be of ſome utility, <hi>I pray you to invite the president to cause to be communicated to me the means that he will join to thoſe of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of public safety,</hi> for the greateſt ſucceſs of <hi>the measures already taken.</hi> It is in virtue of the expreſs requeſt of the miniſter that I ſolicit of the preſident <hi>some communication on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> I ſhall be ſatisfied to be able to tranſmit it by a very early conveyance which I am now preparing for France.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The ſecretary of ſtate replied to him on the 6th June, 1794, by a letter of which the following is an extract.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Your other letter of the 4th of June, is a powerful demonſtration of the intereſt which the Republic of France takes in our welfare. I will frankly communicate to you our meaſures and expectations with regard to Algiers; but <hi>as you will so soon receive the detail of those measures,</hi> which your government has purſued in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, it will be better perhaps to poſtpone our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030226_0021_0FE54B0881F93020"/>
interview on this matter, <hi>until the intelligence which you further expect, ſhall arrive.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, obſerve here, that Adet tells the people, that ſomebody in France, no matter who, <hi>had actually commenced negociations</hi> with the regency of Algiers in behalf of their countrymen. To prove this, he quotes a letter of Fauchet, in which this latter begs to call to the recollection of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Government "the ſteps which <hi>are to be</hi> taken," and not the ſteps which are taken. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Fauchet, preſuming upon what has been done ſince his lateſt inſtructions came away, talks in the very ſame letter, about meaſures <hi>already taken;</hi> but is unable to ſay any thing about the nature or ſucceſs of them, until he receives <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information</hi> from Europe, which he makes no doubt is upon the point of arriving.—Now, is it not very ſurpriſing that this further information never came to hand, from that day to this? And is it not ſtill more ſurpriſing, that no traces of this friendly mediation, of theſe ſteps that <hi>were to be</hi> taken, and thoſe meaſures that <hi>were already</hi> taken, ſhould ever be diſcovered by the American En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to Algiers? When the French do what they can poſſibly conſtrue into an act of generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are not very apt to keep it hidden from the world, or to ſuffer the obliged party to remain unreminded of it.</p>
            <p>But, let us hear how Maſter Adet accounts for his worthy predeceſſor's receiving no <hi>further infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> relative to this generous interference in our behalf. Fauchet told the government he was in daily expectation of it, and yet it never came. How will Citizen Adet get out of this? We have
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030226_0022_0FE54B0A0F9476E0"/>
him fairly hemmed up in a corner here, and he has a deviliſh deal more wit than I take him to have, if he gets himſelf decently out of it.— He tells us that the French government had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en meaſures for the relief of the captives, that the mediation was in a charming train, that Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet communicated this pleaſing intelligence to the Preſident, who waited with anxious expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for further information, which Fauchet hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected to receive, and that <q>
                  <hi>then</hi> Mr. Jay was charged to negociate with the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>—Well; and what then?— Why, <q>and <hi>then</hi> Citizen Fauchet did <hi>not receive</hi> any communication on the ſubject.</q>—What? —O, oh! and ſo <hi>then,</hi> it ſeems, Mr. Jay's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed to negociate a treaty of amity and commerce with king George, prevented the <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able information,</hi> 
               <q>the facts proving the ſincerity of the French proteſtations of friendſhip,</q> from being received! And did ſo completely do away all thoſe ſteps which <hi>were to be</hi> taken, and which <hi>were taking,</hi> and which <hi>had already been taken,</hi> that they were never after heard of! Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, that the United States ſhould have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhould have periſhed even, the zealous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that France took in their diſtreſſes, merely becauſe they wiſhed to avoid ſtill greater diſtreſſes, by an amicable negociation elſewhere!</p>
            <p>Let us recur to time alſo. A lie that is bound down to <hi>dates</hi> is difficult to be ſucceſsfully kept up.</p>
            <p>The committee of public ſafety (it ſhould have been called the committee of public miſery) inſtructed Citizen Fauchet on the 5th of January, 1794, to inform the American government, that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030226_0023_0FE54B0C280861F0"/>
they were about taking means for "breaking the chains of our captive citizens in Algiers." This "proof of the proteſtations of their friendſhip" did not come to Fauchet's hands till the 4th of the enſuing June, juſt five months, to an hour; and when it did at laſt arrive, Citizen Fauchet, <hi>could not tell by what route!</hi>—A pretty ſtory this, and a pretty ſort of Ambaſſador to receive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches of ſuch importance, without knowing <hi>by whom</hi> or <hi>by what route.</hi> Let Citizen Adet and his worthy predeceſſor, Father Joſeph, go and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch humbug tales upon the poor ſtupid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved Hollanders and Geneveſe, they will find few ſuch gulls here.</p>
            <p>Again: how could the appointment of Mr. Jay prevent the reception of <hi>further information,</hi> if ſuch information was daily expected? Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpierre and his bloody colleagues, who felt ſuch a tender concern for the captives, could not hear of this appointment ſooner than about two months after it took place; the information, promiſed, as they ſay, on the 5th of January, muſt therefore have been on the way, and what, then, I would be glad to know, prevented its coming to hand? That it <hi>never</hi> did come to hand, Maſter Adet has confeſſed, and we muſt inevitably conclude there-from, that it was never either promiſed on that ſide the water or expected on this.—Theſe dates form a net in which the Citizen has hampered himſelf. He had got the <hi>Meſſidors</hi> and the <hi>Fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> into his brains, and could he have got them into ours alſo, could he have made us adopt the beaſtial calendar of <hi>Poor Richard,</hi> we might have loſt our account too, but by ſticking to the good old June and January we have caught him out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:030226_0024_0FE54B12DFE1AEA0"/>The fact is, the committee of public miſery never took any ſteps towards a mediation, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrote any letter to Fauchet on the ſubject, nor did this latter ever expect any information relative thereto. The whole was a mere trumped up ſtory to induce the Preſident to relinquiſh his purpoſe of a pacific negociation with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by giving him a high opinion of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of France and leading him to depend on her for ſupport. Had the Preſident been the dupe they expected he was, we might have bidden an eternal farewel to <hi>independence.</hi> If Robeſpierre and the Convention had once got a hold of him, he would in vain have ſtruggled to get free: their fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal hug would have been a million times more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to us than the grapples of the Algerine galleys to the crews of our ſhips.—Obſerve how anxious Fauchet was to obtain ſome <hi>overture</hi> on the part of the Preſident: <q>
                  <hi>I pray you to invite the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident</hi> to cauſe to be communicated to me the means which he will join to thoſe of the committee of public ſafety.</q> This was all Fauchet wanted him to do; to aſk ſome favour or other. I doubt not but they would have really interpoſed with their brother barbarians for the liberation of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; but the chains which they would have knocked off from a handful of Americans, would have been rivetted on America for ever. The Preſident ſaw the ſnare, and, with his uſual ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, avoided it; and thus preſerved himſelf and his country from diſgrace and ruin.</p>
            <p>The motive for advancing the charge at this time, is, to inſtil into the minds of the people, that the Preſident felt extremely indifferent as to the fate of the captives. This baſe, this calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030226_0025_0FE54B14C6152100"/>
this inſufferably inſolent inſinuation, I leave to the reſentment of thoſe for whoſe ſake he has undergone every toil and every hardſhip, has a thouſand times ventured his life, and, what is more, has patiently borne the viperous bite of ingratitude. If there be an American, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of the late revolution, and who eſteems himſelf happy under the change which it has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and who yet has not the courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this audacious aſperſion of the character of General Waſhington, he deſerves to be curtailed of the ſigns of manhood: ſuch a puſillanimous reptile ought not to be ſuffered to propagate his breed.</p>

                  <hi>5.</hi> The government <hi>allowed</hi> the French colonies to be declared in a ſtate of blockade, and <hi>allowed</hi> the citizens of America to be interdicted the right of trading to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is a wonder Citizen Adet did not ſwell the liſt here. He might, with equal reaſon, have complained that the Federal Government <hi>allowed</hi> the Britiſh to conquer the half of theſe colonies; that they <hi>allowed</hi> Lords <hi>Howe, Hood</hi> and <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> to deſtroy their fleets; and that they <hi>allowed</hi> Prince Charles to beat and purſue their boaſting army. He might have complained, that they are about to <hi>allow</hi> the ſans-culotte general <hi>Moreau</hi> to be Burgoyened, and the ruffian <hi>Buonaparte</hi> and his wolfiſh comrades to leave their lank carcaſſes in Italy, which I hope and believe will be <hi>allowed.</hi> Had he complained, that they <hi>allowed</hi> it to rain, to ſnow and to thunder, his complaint would not have been more abſurd than it now is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:030226_0026_0FE54B16587E2058"/>But, the government alſo <hi>allowed</hi> 
               <q>the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican citizens to be interdicted the right of trading to theſe colonies.</q>—As to the <hi>power</hi> of preventing this, the ſame may be ſaid as of the prohibitions above ſuppoſed; and as to the <hi>right</hi> of preventing it, if the power had exiſted, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſaid, unleſs we knew the exact ſtate of the blockades, to which the Citizen alludes, but of which his <hi>Blunderbuſs</hi> gives no particular account.</p>
            <p>When a place, or an iſland, is actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in ſuch manner as to enable the beſieger to prevent neutrals from entering, he has a right, according to the immemorially eſtabliſhed law of nations, not only to exerciſe this power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but to ſeize on, and confiſcate, both goods and veſſels; and even to inflict corporal puniſhment on all thoſe who tranſgreſs his prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. That the Britiſh have ſometimes declared places in a ſtate of ſiege, which were not really inveſted, has often been aſſerted, but never prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it is well known, on the other hand, that they never went to the rigour of the law of nations with thoſe who had the temerity to diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their prohibitions, in attempting to enter places which were completely blockaded.</p>
            <p>Numerous complaints of captures, made at the entrance of the ports of an iſland, amount to a pretty ſtrong preſumptive proof, that the captor has formed an actual inveſtiture. If he has done this, he certainly has a right to declare it, and it follows of courſe, that no neutral power has a right to take offence at his declaration. When one of the neutral captains complained, that the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030226_0027_0FE54B1889586138"/>
Britiſh <hi>intercepted, and ſeized on, every veſſel</hi> that attempted to enter the port of St. Pierre's, and, in the very ſame letter, inveighed againſt <hi>the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of their declaring the place in a ſtate of blockade,</hi> he talked like a good honeſt tar; and when we hear a public miniſter echoing the complaint, we may pardon his ignorance, but we cannot help wiſhing, at the ſame time, that he had been ſent to hand reef and ſteer, ſtew up lobſcous, or ſwab the deck, rather than to peſter us with his boor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh grumbling and tarpawling logic.</p>
            <p>Where a merchant, or a mariner, through love to the beſieged, or hatred to the beſieger, through avarice or through indiſcretion, has loſt his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty by an endeavour to elude the prohibition of trading to a blockaded place, it is very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and therefore perhaps excuſable, in him to be vociferous in complaint againſt the injuſtice of the captor; but it is not quite ſo natural or excuſable in his government to participate in his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and plunge the nation into a war to avenge him. Were the harmony of nations to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by the paſſions of individuals, peace muſt take her flight to heaven, for ſhe would never find a reſting place on the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>It is, however, certain, that very many of the captures, made by the Britiſh cruizers, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law of nations, and therefore called for the interpoſition of the general government. And has not that government interpoſed? Yes, and ſo effectually too, that a mode of indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as equitable and as honourable as either party could wiſh for, has been firmly ſettled on. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030226_0028_0FE54B1EF5B321A0"/>
then, for a moment, that France had a right to make inquiries on the ſubject, what more does ſhe want? Strange as it may ſeem, to thoſe who are inattentive to the intrigues of this at once volatile, ferocious and artful republic, it is the ſucceſs of the negociation, by which this very indemnification was obtained, that has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the charge now preferred by her miniſter! The French, or rather the French Uſurpers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at the Britiſh depredations on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of this country: nothing was farther from their wiſhes than to ſee the ſufferers indemnified. They were in hopes of a rupture being produced between Britain and America, and they are now foaming at their diſappointment.</p>
            <p>To this charge reſpecting blockades and the ſeizure of American veſſels, may be added that which Citizen Adet makes with regard to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſment of ſeamen from on board of thoſe and other veſſels.</p>
            <p>The complaint againſt Britiſh impreſſments has ſo often been the ſubject of public debate and private animadverſion, that it would ſeem unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to dwell on it here; yet, as I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect ever having ſeen it placed in a fair point of view, to attempt doing it at this time can be productive of no harm.</p>
            <p>The impreſſed ſeamen were of two deſcriptions; <hi>Britiſh subjects</hi> and <hi>American subjects,</hi> or (if my reader likes the term better) <hi>American citizens.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Every man belonging to a free ſtate, whether monarchical or republican, may be called a <hi>citizen,</hi> as a member of the ſociety; but it is never improper to call him a <hi>ſubject,</hi> when we ſpeak of him as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſubjection to the laws of the ſtate. In the preſent conſtitution of Maſſachuſetts, the people are ſometimes called <hi>ſubjects</hi> and at others, <hi>citizens;</hi> and who is fool enough to believe, or impudent enough to ſay, that they are leſs free than the people of the other ſtates?</note>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:030226_0029_0FE54B208E7A3128"/>
This diſtinction is a very important one, becauſe on it totally depends the legality or illegality of the impreſſment.</p>
            <p>It is an eſtabliſhed and univerſally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principle, that, to the lawful ſovereign power of the ſtate, or, in other words, the ſtate itſelf, in which a man is born, he owes allegiance to the day of his death; unleſs exempted therefrom by the conſent of that ſovereign power. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is laid down by nature herſelf, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by juſtice and general policy. A man, who is not dead to every ſentiment that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes him from the brute, feels himſelf attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his native land by ties but very little weaker than thoſe which bind him to his parents, and he who can deny the one will make little ſcruple of denying the other. For the truth of the former remark, I appeal to the heart of my reader, and for the truth of the latter, to his daily obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.—Who would not regard as a monſter, the ungrateful wretch that ſhould declare he was no longer the ſon of his father? And yet this is but one ſtep from pretending to ſhake off his allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his country. Such declarations may be made, but the debt of duty and allegiance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains undiminiſhed.</p>
            <p>And is it not <hi>juſt</hi> that the ſtate which has bred, nouriſhed and protected you, ſhould have a title to your allegiance? A fool might ſay, as I heard a philoſophical fool lately ſay, with Goodwin's
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030226_0030_0FE54B222C2BE838"/>
political juſtice in his hand; <q>I could not avoid being born in your ſtate.</q> But, ungrateful fool, the ſtate might have avoided ſheltering you under its wings, and ſuffering you to grow up to manhood. It might have expelled you the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, caſt you out to live among the beaſts, or have thrown you into the ſea, had it not been withheld by that law, that juſtice, which now ſanctions its claim on your allegiance. To ſay, that you "never <hi>aſked for protection,</hi>" is the ſame thing as to ſay, that you never <hi>asked to be born.</hi> Had your very firſt cry been a renunciation of protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would not have invalidated the claim of the ſtate; for you were protected in your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's womb. Should the ſtate now withdraw its protection from you, and leave you to the mercy of the plunderer and aſſaſſin, or drive you out from its boundaries, without any forfeiture on your part; would you not exclaim againſt ſuch a ſtep as an act of brutal injuſtice? And yet this is no more unjuſt than for you to withdraw your allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, caſt the ſtate from you, and leave it to the mercy of its foes. The obligation here is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reciprocal; as the ſtate cannot, by its own arbitrary will, withhold that protection which is the birthright of every individual ſubject, ſo no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can, by his arbitrary will, alienate that alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance which is the right of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>general policy</hi> too, the mutual intereſt of nations, in ſupporting this principle, is ſo evident, that nothing but the influence of the wild and barbarian doctrines of the regenerated French can account for its having been diſputed. —If men could alienate their allegiance at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they could alſo transfer it at pleaſure and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030226_0031_0FE54B245A0A65A8"/>
then, into what confuſion would not mankind be plunged? Where ſhould we look for the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mark of nations, and where find the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of right and of duty?</p>
            <p>Let us illuſtrate the excellence of this policy by an example of what might reſult from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and at the ſame time bring the queſtion home to America.—It is very natural that the people of this country ſhould wiſh to draw the ſeamen from other countries and claim them as hers, but let us ſee how this doctrine would ſuit when brought into operation againſt herſelf.—Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a war (which God forbid) ſhould break out between America and Great Britain, and that ſome of the citizens or ſubjects of theſe ſtates ſhould be found on board the enemy's veſſels making war upon their country; in this caſe, America would have no right to puniſh them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the new doctrine, if they declared that they had transferred their allegiance to Britain. We may bring the evil ſtill nearer to our doors, and aſſert, that even deſerters to an enemy, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the country, would alſo claim exemption from puniſhment.—It will not do to ſay, that this would be <hi>treaſon.</hi> If allegiance be transferrable, the transfer may take place for all purpoſes, at all times, and in all places; for war as well as for peace; in the hour of danger as well as in the hour of ſecurity; on this ſide of the ſea as well as on the other; in the camp as well as in the city.—This wild doctrine once eſtabliſhed, <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> would become a duty, or rather there could be no ſuch thing as a <hi>traitor</hi> in the world. The barriers of ſociety would be broken into ſhivers: the diſcontented of every community would be
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030226_0032_0FE54B2ACDA92D58"/>
tempted, and would moreover have a right, to abandon, betray and make war upon their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Applying what has been ſaid to the complaint now before us, we ſhall find, that the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in theſe States at the time their indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was acknowledged, and thoſe who have been born in them ſince that time, are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Great Britain; and that, all who have emigrated from the dominions of Britain ſince that epoch are her ſubjects. It is very certain that nearly all the impreſſed ſeamen were of this latter deſcription, and were therefore ſtill ſubject to the laws of their country and the regulations of their ſovereign, when found in any part of his or his enemy's dominions, or upon the high ſeas. Theſe regulations authorized his officers to impreſs them, and therefore they were impreſſed. That their impreſſment was frequently a very great loſs to their employers might be ſubject of regret, but the government of the United States had no more right to complain of it, than that of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had to complain of their being employed.</p>
            <p>The heatheniſh French are certainly the laſt people in the world to hold up as an example to Chriſtian nations; but, where their practice is ſo exactly contrary to the principles they pretend to profeſs, it is worth noticing.—Let it be obſerved, then, that they have taken thouſands of <hi>their</hi> emigrants, <hi>without the limits of their territory,</hi> who had renounced their protection; yet every ſoul of them were put to the ſword; not as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians, Engliſh or Dutch, but as Frenchmen, who ſtill owed allegiance to France, and as ſuch
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030226_0033_0FE54B2CB423BF70"/>
were dealt with as <hi>traitors.</hi> Now I humbly requeſt the Citizen miniſter of the "terrible" bloody nation to tell me, what claim France had to the allegiance of theſe emigrants, if Britain had none to her emigrated ſailors? It will not ſerve his turn, to ſay that they were found with arms in their hands, that circumſtance alone could not render them ſubjects of France; and beſides, the Britiſh ſailors might have been found in arms too: a neutral allegiance is no allegiance at all.</p>
            <p>But, to come ſtill cloſer to the point; the French ſeized ſeveral of their emigrants <hi>without arms in their hands,</hi> on the high ſeas, purſuing their peaceable commerce, <hi>on board of neutral ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> too, yea even on board of <hi>American vessels.</hi> Every man of theſe they alſo put to death; ſome they dragged on ſhore to the guillotine, others they threw into the ſea alive, and others they hewed down with their ſabres. Therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Citizen Adet will frankly declare, like a good full-blooded ſans-culotte, that it is juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a nation to claim the allegiance and ſeize on the perſons of its Emigrants, only for the purpoſe of cutting their throats, I muſt inſiſt that the practice of his nation gives the lie direct to the principle on which his charge is founded.</p>
            <p>It is a phenomenon in politics for a French miniſter to exert his <hi>humane</hi> influence in behalf of Britiſh ſubjects. How kind it was of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to endeavour to extend their fatherly protection to theſe impreſſed ſeamen! With what a philanthropic warmth they expreſs their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for them! They are deviliſh careful of the bacon of a Britiſh tar, when they want to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030226_0034_0FE54B2E551F0B20"/>
him from being brought into action againſt them; but when they have got him in their clutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they are not quite ſo tender of him. They have ſtarved thouſands of Britiſh priſoners this war. They were fed on rotten herbage for months together. They crammed them into dungeons, or rather charnel houſes, and gave them <hi>limed water</hi> to moiſten their dirty food. Above three thouſand of theſe poor fellows, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with burning entrails, in the different ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the treacherous and inhuman republic, only becauſe they remained faithful to their country and loyal to their king.</p>
            <p>I now come to the other deſcription of impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeamen: thoſe who owed allegiance to America alone. And here I frankly declare, that I believe, many acts of rudeneſs, inſolence, and even tyranny, have been committed by particular offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; for there are ſome of them that would preſs their own mothers, if they were capable of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the maſt. But, I can never credit all the lamentable ſtories that the hirelings of France have ſo induſtriouſly propagated on this ſubject. After a moſt piteous and pitiful picture of the diſtreſſes of the impreſſed ſeamen, drawn by that able painter, the taper-limbed and golden-hued Adonis of New York, who has been aptly enough compared to a poplar tree in autumn; after as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and ſpiteful an inquiry as ever was proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpirit of faction, not more than <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> impreſſed ſeamen, of the deſcription we are now ſpeaking of, could be <hi>named;</hi> and with reſpect to theſe, the report of the ſecretary of ſtate proved, that, where proper application had been made for
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030226_0035_0FE54B30AF42C910"/>
their enlargement, it had always been immediately attended to, and had produced the deſired effect.</p>
            <p>It was in the courſe of this memorable inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that the generous Mr. Livingſton propoſed to furniſh the Britiſh ſeamen, on board American veſſels, with certificates of naturalization. Theſe were intended to operate as a charm on the paws and bludgeons of the Engliſh preſs-gangs, or, at leaſt, it is difficult to conceive for what other purpoſe they were intended. Was there any man in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs fool enough imagine, that the juſt claims of one nation could be annulled by the production of bits of ſealed paper given to her ſubjects by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation? The particular act, or the general law, by which foreigners are naturalized, may admit them to a participation in all the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the citizens of the ſtate adopting them (which is, indeed, the ſole end of naturalization), but can never weaken the claim of the parent ſtate; otherwiſe <hi>traitors</hi> and <hi>deſerters,</hi> by producing <hi>certificates of naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> might bid defiance to the juſt vengeance of their injured country.</p>
            <p>As to the meaſures taken by the Federal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, relative to the impreſſed ſeamen, they were ſuch as the peculiar ſituation of America rendered wiſe. Mr. Jay endeavoured to obtain a ſtipulation, by which Britiſh ſeamen, found on board American veſſels, would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the operation of the impreſs orders. This Great Britain refuſed, for the ſame reaſon that nations as well as individuals generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to make a gratuitous ſacrifice of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030226_0036_0FE54B361E2F4B80"/>
to them. Agents have ſince been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attend to impreſſments, and when their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition is warranted by the ſtate of the caſe, there is every appearance that it will be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the end propoſed, and that both parties will readily co-operate for the preſervation of harmony.</p>
            <p>But, it is this curſed harmony that Citizen Adet and his maſters do not approve of. They wiſh the government of the United States to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them, aſſume the tone of bullies, and ſo get into a war; or, at leaſt, they wiſh Great Britain to be compelled to relinquiſh her claim to her ſailors, while ſhe ſtands in need of them to fight againſt her enemies. The former of theſe will not happen, in ſpite of French envy and malice; and as to the latter, it will never take place while Britain is able to beat France, Spain and Holland, on the ſeas, and that I truſt ſhe will be as long as there are men of war in the world and ſeas for them to fight on.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I proceeded on this ſubject for the ſatisfaction of my reader: what remains to be ſaid on it is intended for the ſatisfaction of Citizen Adet alone.—And now then, you ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Envoy of the "terrible nation," be ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite for once as to tell me, what buſineſs you, or your worthy predeceſſors, had to meddle or make with the impreſſment of American ſailors. Your reading does not, indeed, ſeem to be very deep or extenſive; but, if you have not read Grotius or Puffendorff, or any other civilian that treats of the <hi>ſovereignty</hi> and <hi>independence</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you may probably have dipped into the

               <hi>Mock Doctor</hi> (which is a tranſlation from your own comic poet), and if ſo, you muſt remember the fate of the fool that interfered in the diſputes of other people.—You tell us, that Fauchet, writing to our government, aſked: <q>
                  <hi>What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> do you conceive I can render <hi>to the French government,</hi> of the means <hi>you take</hi> for rendering <hi>your neutrality reſpectable?</hi>
               </q>—This, my good mounſeer, is not language to be uſed to an <hi>independent</hi> nation: it is the ſtyle of a ſchool-maſter to his idle ſcholar, of a guardian to his childiſh or profligate ward, or rather of a ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to the crouching vaſſals of his and their lord and maſter. Yet you have had the aſſurance to repeat the queſtion, couched in ſtill more hector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and menacing terms, and pretend to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended becauſe the government has not deigned to make you a reply.—When your Convention were dragging their ſovereign to a mock trial, and condemning him to an ignominious death, in open defiance of all law and juſtice; cutting off his unfortunate ſiſter and queen, after having drenched them with the dregs of humiliation, ten times bitterer than death; cramming his ſon, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent child, into a dungeon, ordering him to be kept from ſleep, and finally—my pen refuſes to trace the daſtardly, the horrid deed. When they were butchering, by thouſands, the faithful inhabitants of Lyons, and the brave pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants of La Vendée, whoſe names will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with honour and renown, when their aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins will be howling in hell; when they were in the midſt of this baſe and bloody work, what would they have ſaid, had the government of America called on them to hold their hands? Would they not have rejected the interpoſition
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030226_0038_0FE54B3ADB6DFCE8"/>
with ſcorn? Would they not have added the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to the group of an execution or the cargo of a drowning boat?—By what article of <hi>the rights of man</hi> then, do they aſſume to themſelves the office of Dictators to this <hi>free and independent nation?</hi> The aſſumption is an outrage on every principle of nature, of law, of juſtice and of policy: it can be ſurpaſſed by nothing on the annals of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and can be equalled only by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with which it is attempted to be exerciſed.</p>
            <p>Diſmiſſing this charge reſpecting impreſſed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the length of my obſervations on which I am afraid has wearied my reader, I proceed to the remaining ones, on which I promiſe to be more conciſe.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <q>
                  <hi>6.</hi> The Federal Government eluded all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances made by the French Republic for renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>treaties of commerce</hi> upon a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable footing to both nations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What does this learned Citizen mean by <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of commerce?</hi> This country has but one trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>commerce</hi> with France: the other is a treaty <hi>"eventual and defenſive."</hi> Perhaps, indeed, he may regard <hi>war</hi> as a ſpecies of commerce; and it muſt be allowed that this is the only commerce that can be carried on with his terrible republic at preſent. The kind of trucking commerce that ſhe is carrying on in Italy, where ſhe purchaſes a ſtatue or a picture with the lives of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſoldiers, may, to her, be advantageous enough, becauſe ſhe is a <hi>rich</hi> lady and a virtuoſo; but to America, who is a plain homely dame, and has but little taſte for ſuch fine things, this commerce
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030226_0039_0FE54B3D1B2CA270"/>
has but few charms: to her, one live farmer is of higher eſtimation than all the heroes and gods of antiquity.</p>
            <p>I rather think, however, that Citizen Adet, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as he may be, knows that a defenſive treaty is not a treaty of commerce; and if ſo, he muſt know that there was but one treaty of commerce between the countries. But there were <hi>two treaties</hi> to be <hi>renewed,</hi> and, as it has always been held up to the people here, that their dear friends of France did not wiſh their proſperity to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by taking a part in the war, it would not do to talk about renewing a <hi>defenſive treaty;</hi> that would have ſmelt of powder: yet he could not ſay, that the treaty of <hi>commerce only</hi> was propoſed to be renewed, and ſo he has called them both trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of commerce. The Citizen was hemmed in between a lie and an abſurdity, and, to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his morality, he has choſen the latter.</p>
            <p>That the ground work of a new treaty, or a renewed treaty, with France, was to be our going to war with her enemies, has been ſo often and ſo inconteſtibly proved, that the fact is now uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledged, except by the ſtipenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that pure-principled republic. But, were a proof yet wanting, Citizen Adet has furniſhed it, in the laſt page of his <hi>Diplomatic Blunderbuſs.</hi> Here he tells us, that both Genet and Fauchet uſed their utmoſt to draw the government into a negociation, but in vain; that it eluded all their friendly overtures.—Yes, and ſo it did indeed; juſt as the ſheep eludes the friendly overtures of the wolf, and for much about the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:030226_0040_0FE54B457595F0F8"/>After relating the grievous diſappointment of his importunate predeceſſors, the Citizen goes on, and ſays that he himſelf alſo made the ſame over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for a negociation, and adds:</p>
            <p>
               <q>On this ſubject the preſident authoriſed the ſecretary of ſtate, who explained to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſigned the manner in which they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in it. But at what time? <hi>When the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the treaty concluded between Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay no longer permitted the underſigned to purſue that negociation,</hi>
               </q>—And why not?—Why not go on man? If you had nothing to propoſe but <q>
                  <hi>treaties of</hi> commerce, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a footing</hi> more favourable to both nations,</q> how could the treaty with Great Britain prevent the purſuit of your negociation?—The reaſon is plain: this treaty had happily put an end to all the diſputes between America and Britain, and left you no room to hope that your negociation would rekindle the embers of diſcord. It was this conſideration, and this alone, that thwarted your negociations, that has ſince ſet the gall of your maſters afloat, and that has now brought forth your impudent appeal from the government to the people.</p>
            <p>The only queſtion for the people to determine, then, is—not whether they wiſhed the treaties to be renewed, but whether they wiſhed for war, or not; and this queſtion they have already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <hi>in the negative.</hi> There once ſtood a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority in Congreſs ready to ſet the Britiſh treaty aſide, and plunge this country into a war with that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A pauſe enſued: the people, the <hi>real</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had time to rally their good ſenſe and break
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030226_0041_0FE54B470CAFC998"/>
the hoſtile phalanx. Peace was echoed from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarter of the Union. <q>Baffle the projects of our inſidious friends, fulfil our engagements, keep our honour untarniſhed, and preſerve to us the bleſſings of peace.</q> This was the voice of the people of America, and, whatever opinion the Envoy of the "terrible nation" may entertain, his noiſy <hi>Blunderbuſs</hi> will not ſcare them into a revocation of the ſolemn deciſion.</p>
            <p>But, after all, admitting for a moment, that the renewed treaty was not to engage this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the war; nay, even admitting what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that the ferocious tyrants of France were about to confer a favour on us; how long, I pray, has it been a <hi>crime</hi> to <hi>refuse a favour?</hi> Every one has ſurely a right to ſay: <hi>no, I thank you.</hi> Yet this right, that is blameleſsly exerciſed by the beggar at the door, is denied to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of America! There are, indeed, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nameleſs favours that a man cannot refuſe, with any hope of forgiveneſs; and it would ſeem, that the French Republic looks upon herſelf in the light of a battered harridan deſpiſed by a luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty youth, and that ſhe is now fulfilling the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im of <hi>Zara:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>"Heav'n has no ſcourge like love to hatred turn'd,</l>
                  <l>"Or hell a fury like a woman ſcorn'd."</l>
               </q>
And thus ſhe flings off the ſtage, ſhaking her diſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled locks and brandiſhing her bloody dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.—Let the meddling, jealous, blood-thirſty termagant go, and let Citizen Adet follow her in quality of train-bearer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:030226_0042_0FE54B489E5DBE20"/>Thank God, we are at laſt come to the cloſing article of accuſation.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <q>
                  <hi>7.</hi> The Federal Government <hi>anticipated</hi> Great Britain, by <hi>ſoliciting</hi> a treaty; in which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it <hi>proſtituted</hi> its neutrality; it <hi>ſacrificed</hi> France to her enemies, or rather, looking upon her as obliterated from the chart [map] of the world, it forgot the services ſhe had rendered it, and threw aside the duty of <hi>gratitude,</hi> as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude was a governmental duty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a complicated charge, compriſing the crimes of meanneſs, proſtitution, treachery and ingratitude. The meanneſs of <q>
                  <hi>anticipating</hi> Great Britain, by <hi>soliciting</hi> a treaty,</q> ſhall not detain us long.—When two nations form a treaty, it is clear that one or the other muſt make the firſt overtures, or the buſineſs could never be begun, and conſequently never ended. I believe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that making the firſt propoſition for a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and particularly a treaty of commerce, was never before conſtrued into an act of meanneſs. As for <hi>soliciting,</hi> this word, by which the Citizen wiſhes to convey an inſinuation that Mr. Jay was haughtily received, at firſt rejected, and at laſt obliged to approach with humiliating condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nothing can be farther from the truth. His buſineſs was, to demand reparation of the wrongs ſuſtained by America. When theſe were made known, Great Britain had her wrongs to oppoſe to them. Both parties were, as their intereſts dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, equally deſirous of an accommodation; and this deſire was productive of a treaty, ſettling all old diſputes, and making proviſions for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of new ones. Now, I pray, in this ſimple
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030226_0043_0FE54B4ACA18DE90"/>
and natural proceſs, what is there to be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of meanneſs or humble ſolicitation?</p>
            <p>It is ever the fate of an inconſiſtency in words and actions, to expoſe itſelf to detection.—Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Adet accuſes the American government of meanneſs, in anticipating Britain by ſoliciting a treaty of commerce, while, in the very ſame note, he takes a wonderful deal of pains to prove to the people here, that the French government not only <hi>anticipated</hi> America by <hi>soliciting</hi> a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo, that, after two ſucceſſive miniſters had <hi>solicited</hi> it in vain, the <hi>solicitation</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by a third. God forbid I ſhould attempt to juſtify America by the example of France; but, if ſoliciting a treaty be a crime, I beg the Citizen will take it from us and lay it reſpectfully at the feet of his terrible republic.</p>
            <p>The charge proceeds to aſſert, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <q>proſtituted <hi>its neutrality, and</hi> sacrificed France to her enemies.</q>—This is too vague to be taken up as it lies before us; except, indeed, it be the word <hi>proſtituted,</hi> which may be diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once, by obſerving that it muſt have been picked up in the purlieus of the <hi>Palais-Royal,</hi> a place of which the Iriſh-Town of Philadelphia is a picture in miniature. To avoid the indecency therefore of joining it with the American govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall ſupply its place by the word <hi>gave up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the polite Citizen chiefly alludes to then, in ſaying, that the government gave up its neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality and ſacrificed France to her enemies, is, that article of the Britiſh treaty which contains the ſtipulation reſpecting an enemy's goods, found
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030226_0044_0FE54B4E6C4E7BC8"/>
on board the veſſels of the United States, when theſe latter are neutral, with reſpect to Great Britain.</p>
            <p>Want of room prevents me from entering ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into this ſubject, or I ſhould not deſpair of ſtripping off all the million of abſurdities, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations and downright falſehoods, in which the <hi>proſtituted</hi> (here this word ſounds well) partizans of France have diſguiſed it. Perhaps, however, if I ſhould be ſo happy as to place it in a clear light, brevity may be no diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>The ſtipulation of the treaty which we are about to examine, in ſubſtance ſays, that an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's goods found on board the veſſels of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties, ſhall be looked upon as lawful prize. This, ſays Citizen Adet, is a violation of the <hi>modern</hi> law of nations; and this, ſays the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is no ſuch thing. As here is a flat contradiction, ſomebody muſt tell a lie; who it is I know not, but I am ſure it is not the government at any rate.</p>
            <p>Within what limits Citizen Adet means to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe the word <hi>modern,</hi> I cannot exactly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; but as, in another part of his Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſs, he calls France the <hi>ancient ally</hi> of America, and as it is well known that this alliance began but <hi>eighteen years and ten months ago,</hi> it is probable he looks upon that only as the modern law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which commenced its operation at ſome time poſterior to that epoch. Indeed, it is pretty clear that he ſuppoſes the modern law of nations to date its beginning from what he calls the <q>New
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030226_0045_0FE54B511BAA0FD0"/>
Style;</q> and, in that caſe, thank heaven, we are ancients yet.</p>
            <p>But, however cramped the ſignification may be, that this ſon of <hi>Floreal</hi> and <hi>Fructidor</hi> pleaſes to give to the word <hi>modern,</hi> we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> know, that the modern law of nations means, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic law, or rather practice, which the modern nations of Europe have obſerved towards each other. Now, with reſpect to commerce with an enemy, whoever examines the beſt writers on the ſubject, will find that, long ſince theſe nations aſſumed nearly their preſent relative ſtate, it was the <hi>general practice</hi> to prohibit <hi>all trade whatever</hi> with an enemy.</p>
            <p>As the nations grew more poliſhed, and as their relations increaſed by means of maritime commerce, the rigour of this practice was gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſoftened, till confiſcation was at laſt confined to the veſſels and property of enemies, to certain articles termed contraband of war, and to the <hi>property of enemies found on board of neutral veſſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far the relaxation became pretty general about the time of Queen Elizabeth. But ſome powers wiſhed to extend the freedom of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce ſtill further; even ſo far as <hi>to protect ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies' goods found on board of neutral veſſels;</hi> and to do this the Queen of England was one of the firſt to aſſert her right. The right was, however, diſputed, and that too by the United Provinces, even before their independence was fully aſſured. They took ſome of her veſſels laden with Spaniſh property, and condemned the cargoes, without
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030226_0046_0FE54B52AE433748"/>
paying freightage. The Queen at firſt reſented this conduct in an infant ſtate that was chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to her for ſupport; but, notwithſtanding the well known tenacity and imperiouſneſs of her diſpoſition, her wiſdom and juſtice prevailed, and ſhe at laſt acquieſced in the legality of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.—Here then we have an inſtance of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a nation of <hi>modern birth,</hi> a <hi>republic</hi> alſo, and a republic <hi>engaged in a revolutionary war.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have at leaſt a hundred examples of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture now before me. But let us deſcend to ſtill more <hi>modern</hi> times, and that the example may be, if poſſible, yet more ſtrikingly applicable, let us appeal to the practice of the French nation itſelf.—The famous <hi>Ordinance</hi> of 1681, which might be called the navigation act of France, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly declared to be good prize, not only the enemy's goods on board of a neutral veſſel, but <hi>the neutral veſsel alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now got down to the cloſe of the laſt century; but as that may not be quite <hi>modern</hi> enough for our <hi>Decadery</hi> Mounſeer, let us conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to deſcend, ſtill continuing our appeal to the practice of his own country.—The <hi>Ordinance</hi> of 1681 was mitigated by ſucceſſive treaties, in which France, according as her intereſt preſcribed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, or granted, the permiſſion which Citizen Adet now ſets up as a right: but, after theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and even ſo late as 1757, ſhe declared to the republic of Holland, that if any goods <hi>belonging to her enemy</hi> were found on board of Dutch veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſuch goods ſhould be condemned as good prize, and to this declaration her practice was conformable, during the whole war which ended
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030226_0047_0FE54B54E8DB2AE0"/>
in 1763, only <hi>thirty-three years ago.</hi> So that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this man of the "New Style" will abſolutely ſans-culotte us, and inſiſt upon it that our fathers were antediluvians, and that we ourſelves were born in the ages of antiquity, we muſt inſiſt, on our part, that the principle adhered to in the treaty between Great Britain and America, is a principle of the <hi>modern law of nations,</hi> and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over is ſanctioned by the practice of France.</p>
            <p>But, ſays the Citizen, <hi>France adopted a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent principle in her treaty with America.</hi>—France had her intereſted motives for that, of which I could ſay a great deal more if I pleaſed. Let that be as it may; what had her treaty to do with Great Britain? She is <hi>independent</hi> I hope, if Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is not. France did not "work her liberty" too, I humbly preſume; and I preſume alſo, that the treaty between America and France is not the code to which all the modern nations are to appeal for a deciſion of their rights.—The fact is, this principle is either adopted, or not adopted, according to the intereſts and ſituations of the contracting parties: as theſe vary, nations act dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently at different times and towards different nations. It is a matter merely conventional and ſolely dependent on circumſtances, as much as any other ſtipulation of a treaty.</p>
            <p>The Citizen has one more fetch; which I think is the moſt impudent piece of ſophiſtry that ever was attempted to be palmed upon a nation. A nation, did I ſay! Why, a nation of Indians would have tomahawked him, and we ſhould now ſee his ſkin hanging up in the ſhops for ſale, had he offered to chouſe them in ſuch a barefaced man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.—I
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030226_0048_0FE54B5833100580"/>
allude to that part of his Blunderbuſs, where he ſays, that America violated her treaty with France, by <hi>granting</hi> to Britain the <hi>favour</hi> of ſeizure, which ſhe had not <hi>granted</hi> to France, though ſhe was to be treated in the ſame manner as "the <hi>moſt favoured nation.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The ſophiſtry of this conſiſts in confounding <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> with <hi>right,</hi> terms almoſt as oppoſite in ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong.</hi>—America confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>no favour,</hi> when, by treaty, ſhe declared that Great Britain ſhould ſeize enemies' goods on board of her veſſels: ſhe only acknowledged the exiſtence of Great Britain's right ſo to do. Nor was this acknowledgment abſolutely neceſſary: but, ſome nations having retained the exerciſe of the right and others having relinquiſhed it, it was a prudent precaution againſt future diſputes, to declare, by expreſs ſtipulation, whether it was retained or relinquiſhed in the preſent inſtance.</p>
            <p>It is clear therefore, that the ſtipulation in the treaty with France, which ſays, that ſhe <q>ſhall be treated in the ſame manner as <hi>the moſt favoured nation,</hi>
               </q> muſt be totally inapplicable to a caſe, wherein no <hi>favour</hi> is, or can be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. However, as the conſtruction given to this has been the ground-work of much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and even calumny, it may not be amiſs here to explain its true meaning.</p>
            <p>The ſtipulation for <hi>equal favour</hi> then, which is to be found in moſt treaties of commerce now exiſting in the world, extends to the effects of the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal laws and regulations of the contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It implies an <hi>equality in duties,</hi> in <hi>tonnage,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:030226_0049_0FE54B5B119841D8"/>
in the permiſſion <hi>to have conſuls;</hi> all which, and many others, may properly be called <hi>favours:</hi> but, it can never be conſtrued to extend to any one of the great rights of national ſovereignty. If this were the caſe, all the advantageous ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of a treaty made with one power, would be applicable to every other power, in a treaty with which this uſual ſtipulation for equal favour was found: and of this we ſhall ſee the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous abſurdity in a minute.—America, for inſtance, has treaties with Spain, Great Britain and France, in all which the ſtipulation for equal favour exiſts. In the treaty with Spain, America allows to that nation a free navigation on the American part of the Miſſiſſippi; but does ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this to Britain and France? In that with Great Britain, America allows her a free naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and trade on her rivers, lakes, &amp;c. and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain allows the ſame freedom to America on hers; but does either of them extend this permiſſion to France or Spain, or any other nation? Yet they are obliged to do this, if the ſtipulation for <hi>equal favour</hi> admits of the conſtruction, which the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Goths wiſh to impoſe on us, in ſupport of their attack on the commerce of America.</p>
            <p>The ſubject then is thus brought to a cloſe: the ſeizure of an enemy's goods on board of neutral veſſels is a right of national ſovereignty, which every <hi>independent</hi> nation may, in her treaties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or give up, according to the dictates of her intereſts or her will. In the treaty between Britain and America this right is reciprocally retained; in that between America and France it is recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally given up. Great Britain naturally adheres to her treaty; America adheres to hers with both nations; and it only remains for us to ſee how
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030226_0050_0FE54B5CAA040AE0"/>
that between America and France has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to, by the deſpots who have ſeized on the wealth and the power of that unfortunate nation.</p>
            <p>Soon after the commencement of the preſent war, the Convention ordered all enemy's goods on board of American veſſels to be ſeized, notwithſtanding the poſitive ſtipulation to the contrary. This order, dictated by the inſolence of ſucceſs, was conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revoked, when the ſcale of victory turned. After this, the famiſhed ſtate, to which the infernal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution had reduced that once flouriſhing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the farce of friendſhip which it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep up, in order to engage this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the war, for ſome time withheld the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention from further depredations on our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: but, being baffled in their war project by the treaty with Britain, and imagining (vainly I truſt) that America would be terrified by their victories, and the conſequences theſe might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, they iſſued on the 2d of July laſt, a decree for renewing their ſpoliations, and for ſeizing all enemy's property on board of American veſſels, which decree Citizen Adet communicated to the Secretary of State, and to the <hi>people,</hi> on the 27th of October.</p>
            <p>The perfidy and tyranny of this conduct are nothing, when compared to the manner in which they are brazened out.—The Citizen firſt ſends the Secretary of State a Note, encloſing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled decree. The Secretary, in anſwer, expreſſes the uneaſineſs of the Preſident, at ſuch a flagrant violation of the treaty. To this the Frenchman has the aſſurance to reply, that it is <q>
                  <hi>the</hi> resolution <hi>of a government</hi> terrible to its
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030226_0051_0FE54B5ECE89EC80"/>
enemies, <hi>but</hi> generous to its allies;</q> and, as he elſewhere calls the government of America the <hi>enemy</hi> of France, he menacingly leaves us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>generosity</hi> is to be the portion of others, while <hi>dreadful chaſtisement</hi> is in reſerve for us.—We may pardon the threats of a ſimple bully; we may even forgive a ſharper or a robber, but when he has the impudence to juſtify his conduct, and that too with his filthy fiſt at our mouths, there is no degree of reſentment, no mortal means of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, adequate to the inſult.</p>
            <p>Thus have I had patience to go through the mock charges, which the deſpots of France have dared to prefer againſt the free, equitable and beneficent government of America. I ſhall take the liberty of adding a few miſcellaneous obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which would be diſpenſed with, fearing the reader is already too much fatigued, did not the criſis of affairs ſeem to demand them now, or never.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that calls, and moſt loudly calls, for reprobation, is, the contemptuous manner in which the Frenchman treated the government, by communicating his Notes <hi>to the people,</hi> at the ſame time, or before, they were received by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident.</p>
            <p>The ſole right of making communications of this nature to the people of a ſtate, ſo evidently belongs to its government, and is ſo eſſential to the very exiſtence of every government, that it is not ſurpriſing, that the firſt violation of it ſhould have been reſerved for the heatheniſh French. Former barbarians ever reſpected this
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030226_0052_0FE54B6427E84348"/>
right: the laws of decency had ſome influence on their uncultivated minds; but the barbarians, or rather the ſavages, of Paris, have ſet thoſe and all other laws, human and divine, at defiance. They ſeem to lock upon themſelves as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the devil, and to have aſſumed, in virtue of their father, the right of prowling about the earth, diſturbing the peace of mankind, by ſcattering the ſeeds of rebellion and bloodſhed.</p>
            <p>Their agents have long been practiſing their fiend-like temptations on the people of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They have proceeded from one degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to another, till at laſt their late Miniſter Adet (for whom I wiſh I could find a name worſe than his own) makes a direct attempt to inflame the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt the government.—After telling them, that the Convention has ordered their veſſels to be ſeized (contrary to treaty), he proceeds: <q>And now, if the execution of theſe meaſures <hi>gives riſe to complaints</hi> in the United States, it is not againſt France they ſhould be directed, but <hi>againſt those men,</hi> who have entered into nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations contrary to the intereſts of <hi>their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
               </q>—Juſt as if he had ſaid, pointing to the Preſident, the Senate and Officers of State: <q>there they are; riſe on them, cut their throats, and chooſe others more pliant to our will.</q>— His words do not amount to this, 'tis true; but in his country a hint far leſs intelligible, would have been perfectly underſtood, and would not have failed of the deſired effect. Happily he was not haranguing a Pariſian mob. Whatever fooliſh partiality ſome of us may have had, and may yet have for France, nature has been ſo kind as not to make us Frenchmen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:030226_0053_0FE54B65F8F4A870"/>The inſult on the people too; the deſpicable opinion he muſt have of their underſtandings and their hearts, is paſt all bearing.—I know a little Iſland, which America was once proud to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that would ſuffer itſelf to be ſunk into the ſea, rather than patiently put up with ſuch an abominable outrage.—In the reign of <hi>Queen Ann,</hi> when a Tory Miniſtry, aided by an intriguing Frenchman, were treating for a ſeparate peace with Louis XIV. the Imperial Miniſter, <hi>Count Gallas,</hi> in order to prepoſſeſs the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land againſt the peace, cauſed the tranſaction to be publiſhed, <hi>as an article of news,</hi> in one of the daily papers. This ſtep, though it could not be looked upon as an appeal to the people, was ſo much reſented by the Queen, that ſhe ordered him to quit the kingdom immediately; and in this ſhe was ſupported by the unanimous voice of the nation; who, notwithſtanding they diſapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a peace which was to ſacrifice the great advantages obtained by their arms under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Duke of Marlborough, juſtly and manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſented the attempt of a foreign miniſter to ſtep in between them and their own ſovereign, however blameable her meaſures might be.</p>
            <p>And, ſhall it be ſaid of the people of America, that they are leſs attached to a government of their own chooſing, and that has never for a moment loſt ſight of their intereſts? No; it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to ſay this. The people are impatient of the inſult, and their confidence in the wiſdom of their chief is the only thing that could keep them pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:030226_0054_0FE54B678CCE55E8"/>To expreſs a hatred to the <hi>government</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect friendſhip for the <hi>people</hi> who live under it, and thus arraign the former at the bar of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is the unbearable tone which the deſpots of Paris have aſſumed to all the nations of Europe; and at loſt it is come to the turn of America. They did not declare war againſt the Germans, the Engliſh and the Dutch; but againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, the King of England, and the Stadtholder. The Germans and the Engliſh did not believe them; they knew them of old. The Dutch ſucked in the bait, and now they know them too. They have paid dearly for the fraternal hug. God ſend they may ſqueeze them to the ſize of ſhotten herrings; that they may not leave even a frog to ſport in their canals; that they may eat up the very herbage, like the locuſts in Egypt. Theſe poor degraded devils, who never ceaſed their clamours for <hi>liberty and equality,</hi> till they had driven into exile the princely family of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whom they owed the birth and the preſervation of their <hi>real</hi> liberties, their riches and their power, are now obliged to yield their houſes and even their beds to the filthy ragga-muffin ſans-culottes.—This may be truly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>political juſtice,</hi> and I ſincerely hope it may fall on the heads of every people capable of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame treacherous and daſtardly part. That this part will not be acted by America I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and if Citizen Adet had known the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the people, he never would have dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold out the temptation.</p>
            <p>After the perfidy, injuſtice and malice we have been witneſs of, it would ſeem ſtrange to hear any other than a Frenchman talking about French
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030226_0055_0FE54B69C3886758"/>
               <hi>friendſhip.</hi>—I, for my part, had long wiſhed to know in what this friendſhip conſiſted. I had often heard of it and read of it and read about it, eſpecially in <hi>Poor Richard's</hi> gazette; but never could diſcern any thing palpable in it. It all ſeemed to conſiſt in negatives. It appeared ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like platonic love; or like the girl that brought a fortune of twenty thouſand pounds in the excellence of her diſpoſition.—As my mind is too groſs to be ſatisfied with this abſtract kind of friendſhip, I was led to ſeek for ſomething more ſolid in the Citizen's Notes. The reader will ſee how I was diſappointed. <q>The alliance with America, ſays he, was always dear to Frenchmen; they have done every thing to <hi>tighten its bands.</hi>
               </q>—Juſt as the Jack Catch does; and we were one time actually upon the point of ſtrangling.—<q>But the government has ſought to break them.</q>—Here's a fellow for you! They were tucking us up, and he has the conſcience to blame the government for cutting the halter!—Again: <q>
                  <hi>As ſoon as the war broke out between France and England,</hi> American veſſels were permitted to trade to the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and France, upon the ſame footing as French veſſels.</q>—All that is wanting to make this an act of <hi>friendſhip,</hi> is, the permiſſion ſhould have been granted <hi>before</hi> the war broke out. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it broke out, both the Iſlands and France muſt have ſtarved, if an advantage had not been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to draw American produce to them; and even this has been a loſing game; for one half of this produce has never been paid for in Chriſtian coin. So that, the great act of friendſhip amounts to our liberty of keeping themſelves from ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of receiving bundles of aſſignats as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe.—<q>The
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030226_0056_0FE54B6E31C9F4D8"/>
French government heard the complaints of the United States, againſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and immediately gave <hi>the moſt ſtriking repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </q>—It was certainly very gracious in them to hear theſe complaints, and a very ſtriking reparation to ſuffer Genet to remain here to inſult the government by his preſence; but, if I am not miſtaken, this gracious condeſcenſion was in conſequence of Genet's <hi>threatening to do of his own head,</hi> juſt what Adet <hi>has now done, by their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> appeal from the government to the people. Hence we muſt inevitably conclude, that Genet was diſplaced becauſe he did not go far enough, or becauſe he deprived them of the pleaſure of dragooning us; and this I take to be no very great proof of family affection.—We are now coming to the cloſe, the very bottom of the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get of friendſhip; the reception of the American flag, by the Convention.—<q>What joy did not the American flag inſpire, when it waved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furled in the French Senate! <hi>Tender tears trickled from each eye.</hi> Every one looked at it with amazement. There, ſaid they, is the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the <hi>independence</hi> of our <hi>American bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
               </q>—Shameful farce! The flag was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſymbol of voluntary ſubjection, inſtead of independence; and, had I been Preſident, the Embaſſador who dared to give colour to ſuch an idea, ſhould not have had it in his power to degrade his country a ſecond time.</p>
            <p>It muſt have been curious to ſee the <hi>tender tears trickling</hi> from the eyes of Robeſpierre and the reſt of thoſe ſanguinary villains, who were daily employed in butchering the human ſpecies, <hi>tearing out their entrails, biting their hearts</hi> and
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030226_0057_0FE54B7095619E18"/>
               <hi>lapping their gore.</hi> They wept blood inſtead of brine, I ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>When you go home, Citizen Adet, to your "terrible nation," which I hope in God will be very ſoon, I will ſend, to thoſe of your weepers whom the juſtice of heaven has not yet overtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, a copy of the <hi>Bloody Buoy:</hi> they will ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there that has drawn tears from the eyes of <hi>Americans,</hi> and that has made too deep an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on their hearts to be worn away even by the hand of time. This compendium of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, brutality, ferociouſneſs and infamy, is read by the riſing generation of America: it ſinks into the memory as the plummet into the ſtream, and, till the plummet ſhall glide along the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face like a feather, the name of <hi>French Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> will awaken the idea of all that is perfidious and bloody minded.</p>
            <p>The trickling tears of the Convention, at the ſight of a bit of linſy-woolſy, puts me in mind of Mark Anthony and his mob of blubbering ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians. "Kind ſouls!" ſays he, <q>do you weep at the ſight of Caeſar's <hi>garment</hi> only? What will you do then, when you ſee Caeſar himſelf.</q> Upon which he ſhows them the corps, and the raſcals, who would have knocked his brains out if he had not been dead, begin bellowing like ſo many town bulls round a buxom heifer.—The Convention would not have acted this ſilly part by America. If they could have got <hi>"Caeſar himſelf"</hi> under their clutches, they would have completed the farce of the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile; dried up their tears and fell to cracking our bones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:030226_0058_0FE54B72244F70D0"/>Whether the French Convention did really cry, or whether the tears flowed, or rather trickled, from the leaky imagination of Citizen Adet, I know not; but this I know, that the reception of their flag produced juſt a contrary effect here. What makes them weep, makes us laugh; and what makes them laugh makes us weep. Thank heaven, we are exactly their oppoſite in every thing!</p>
            <p>From <hi>French tenderneſs</hi> we naturally turn to <hi>Britiſh barbarity.</hi> They form a contraſt like the gem and the foil, and therefore the Citizen, who is at once a ſtateſman and an orator, has, with great art and judgment, contrived to ſqueeze them cloſe together in the peroration of his Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſs. "Alas!" ſays he, <q>time has not yet demoliſhed the fortifications with which the Engliſh roughened this country—nor thoſe the Americans raiſed for their defence; their half rounded ſummits ſtill appear in every quarter, <hi>amidſt plains on the tops of mountains.</hi> The traveller need not ſearch for the ditch which ſerved to encompaſs them; it is ſtill open under his feet. Scattered ruins of houſes laid waſte, which the fire had partly reſpected, in order to leave monuments of Britiſh fury, are ſtill to be found.—Men ſtill exiſt, who can ſay, here a ferocious Engliſhman ſlaughtered my father; there my wife tore her <hi>bleeding daughter</hi> from the hands of <hi>an unbridled Engliſhman.</hi> Alas! the ſoldiers who fell under the ſword of the Britons are not yet reduced to duſt; the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, in turning up his field, ſtill draws from the boſom of the earth their whitened bones; while the ploughman, with tears of tenderneſs and gratitude, ſtill recollects that his fields,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030226_0059_0FE54B744D103D00"/>
now covered with rich harveſts, have been <hi>moiſtened with French blood;</hi> while every thing around the inhabitants of this country animates them to ſpeak of the <hi>tyranny of Great Britain</hi> and of the <hi>generosity of Frenchmen.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have till now avoided quotations as much as poſſible; but I could not reſiſt the temptation to cull this faireſt flower of the diplomatic poſey. Some imaginations are ſaid to ruſh forward like a flood, others to flow like a ſtream, and others to glide like a current; but poor Citizen Adet's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruſhes, flows, nor glides: it trickles, like the eyes of his maſters; it drains, it dribbles, it drops.—Dear Citizen, if you love me (of which I much doubt, by the bye), never again employ your eloquence to rouſe the paſſions; for it lays them as completely as the cold hand of death. Inſtead of inflaming, you freeze us: inſtead of fire-brands, you turn us into icicles.—No; when you wiſh to excite the vengeful feelings; keep to your inſolence; that is your fort; there your talents will ever enſure you the ſame ſucceſs as they have done on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>And were you ſo vain, ſo completely the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as to imagine, that this taſteleſs, turgid, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical nonſenſe of yours, would make the people of America believe, that <hi>ferocity</hi> is the characteriſtic of Britons? A little reflection might have told you that your malignant endeavours would be in vain. Two-thirds of the inhabitants of theſe States are of Britiſh deſcent: they know that the aſhes of their forefathers ſleep in the iſland of Britain. They know alſo, that only twenty years ago they were juſtly proud of being called Britons
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030226_0060_0FE54B7AAA87BDB8"/>
themſelves; and though a political revolution has rendered that name no longer proper, they know that no revolution has taken place in their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal character. To charge the Britiſh character with ferocity then, is ſaying to the Americans: <q>I do not call you a ſet of ferocious raſcals; but you are of a d—d ferocious breed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To retaliate here would be ſuperfluous; for the ferocity of the French is now acknowledged by themſelves even. But, when I hear a man talk about <hi>whitened bones,</hi> and aſſert that <q>every thing ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the inhabitants of this country to ſpeak of the <hi>tyranny of Britain</hi> and the <hi>generosity of Frenchmen,</hi>
               </q> I am naturally led to look back to the cruel and ſavage war, which theſe <hi>gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Frenchmen</hi> carried on againſt <hi>the inhabitants of this country,</hi> and in which they would have ſucceeded in exterminating the whole of them, had it not been for the protecting <q>tyranny of Britain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the charge of ferocity which Citizen Adet has brought againſt the Britiſh, he contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a flouriſh of mere hyperbole, as deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of novelty and elegance as it neceſſarily is of truth. He has attempted to produce not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle fact in ſupport of his ſlander, and for this beſt of reaſons, becauſe he knew no ſuch fact was to be found. I ſhall proceed in a different manner. I ſhall give ſuch damning proof of the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity of Frenchmen</hi> towards the people of America as will leave no room for denial.</p>
            <p>During the ſavage war of 1757, above alluded to, when the French had formed a chain of poſts
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030226_0061_0FE54B7C6AD85688"/>
ſtretching from the Bay of Funday to the Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi, with the intention of ſubjugating theſe ſtates or elſe driving the people into the ſea, they took ſeveral forts, and, for a long time, had pretty general ſucceſs: what uſe they made of it, how <hi>generous</hi> they were, will appear from the following account of their capture of <hi>Fort Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam-Henry.</hi> I am not about to repeat a vague report. I am not even appealing to the hiſtory of England, or the writings of Engliſhmen. I am going to copy what was ſaid, written and printed, by Americans themſelves. I could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to many American publications of the time; but I chooſe, for many reaſons, to draw this proof of the <hi>"generosity of Frenchmen,"</hi> from <hi>Doctor Franklin</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>In his paper, publiſhed at Philadelphia on the 25th of Auguſt, 1757, after ſaying that the fort ſurrendered by capitulation, with leave to march out with the honours of war, he proceeds thus: <q>The <hi>French</hi> immediately after the capitulation, <hi>moſt perfidiouſly</hi> let their bloodhounds looſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our people. Some got off, the reſt were ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſtark naked; many were killed and ſcalp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, officers not excepted. The throats of the women were cut, their <hi>bellies ripped open,</hi> their <hi>bowels turned out,</hi> and <hi>thrown upon the faces of their yet palpitating bodies.</hi> The children were taken by the heels, and <hi>their brains beat out againſt the trees or ſtones,</hi> and not one of them ſaved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor then obſerves, that this <hi>cruelty of the French</hi> is nothing new; for that, <q>they maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſeveral hundreds of General Braddock's
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030226_0062_0FE54B7E00BF3538"/>
                  <hi>wounded men,</hi> that they murdered their <hi>priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> near Ticonderoga, and all the <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>wounded</hi> of the garriſon of Oſwego, <hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the previous capitulation.</hi>
               </q> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus: <q>To what a pitch of <hi>perfidy and cruelty is the French nation arrived!</hi> Would not an ancient beathen ſhudder with horror on hearing ſo hideous a tale. Could the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage nations ever exceed ſuch <hi>French barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? It is hard for an Engliſhman</hi> to kill his enemy that lies at his feet, begging his life; but will not our armed men in future be obliged to refuſe all quarter? <hi>Conſider of it my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; take advice, and ſpeak your minds</hi>
               </q>—In another place the Doctor exclaims, <q>
                  <hi>The Lord knows what</hi> French treachery <hi>will do.</hi> When ſhall we have revenge!</q>
            </p>
            <p>I do not know Citizen Adet's perſon, I cannot therefore tell whether his cheeks be covered with buff or not. From his notes, I ſhould rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are; but if they are not, he muſt bluſh himſelf to death upon comparing the Old Doctor's account of <hi>French generoſity</hi> with his own.—He will ſay, perhaps, that it was the French <hi>king,</hi> and not <hi>the nation,</hi> that theſe cruelties muſt be attributed to. Well then, it is the <hi>king</hi> and not <hi>the nation,</hi> that the aid this country received laſt war muſt be attributed to. In both inſtances, the king was the director and his people the actors; with this remarkable diſtinction, that, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the troops that came to America were always ſent by him, while it is not certain that he ever ordered them to turn human butchers when they got here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:030226_0063_0FE54B8030310D28"/>Let us now take a view of <q>the <hi>generosity</hi> of Frenchmen,</q> towards America, from the bloody times above mentioned to the preſent day.</p>
            <p>When, by the united valour and perſevarance of America and Britain, they were driven from this continent, they laid in watch, as the devil is ſaid to do when he ſees a happy couple, for an opportunity of effecting a ſeparation between the two countries. With this opportunity the folly of the Britiſh adminiſtration ſoon furniſhed them. Yet they at firſt heſitated whether the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this country would be advantageous to them or not: but, revenge, and that great object of their policy, the humbling of their rival, at laſt got the better; and the alliance with the United States was concluded on. This ſtep, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, did not take place till after the Congreſs had iſſued their Declaration of Independence, and even after thoſe victories were obtained, which gave the deciſive blow to the Britiſh power in America.—Some of their troops landed here; but what did they do? Citizen Adet tells us about <hi>"fields moiſtened with French blood,"</hi> and ſays, that <hi>"the ploughman now ſheds tears of tenderneſs,"</hi> when he is turning them up. This is as ſilly as the talk of the mad wench in one of Gay's farces, when ſhe exclaims: <q>O, dear delightful ſtreams of cream! Rivers of milk and ſeas of honey!</q>— French blood! I would be glad to know how it was ſpilt, unleſs they poked ſpear-graſs up their noſes, like Sir John Falſtaff and his bullies. They did nothing here. They were never engaged. They only ſeemed to come to look on a bit, and go home and brag about <hi>giving liberty to America.</hi> Their fleets were out, to be ſure; but they were
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030226_0064_0FE54B8752E3D0C0"/>
fighting (or rather running away) for France and not for America. Taking Britiſh Iſlands in the Weſt Indies was juſt as ſerviceable to this country then, as robbing the peaſants of Germany now is.—So much for their war-like <hi>generoſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As their object in making war had been to weaken Great Britain, and not to render this country free and independent, ſo, when the terms of peace came to be propoſed, they ſoon made it appear, that they wiſhed to <hi>transfer the dependence</hi> from Britain to themſelves. To this end they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to exclude America from the fiſheries on one ſide, and from the Weſtern countries on the other. This would have at all times expoſed the States to the power of the Britiſh, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence would have been, a continual dependence on France. It was owing to Meſſrs. John Adams and Jay that this was not effected, and this is the reaſon why they are now ſo hated and abuſed by the French faction.—There's <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity</hi> for you!</p>
            <p>Thus far went the <hi>insidious</hi> friendſhip of the old government: that of the mock republic has been a thouſand times worſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt they ſent Genet to raiſe an inſurrection in the country; but finding that he had failed, they pretended to recal him; leaving him here, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to inſult the government. Now they even juſtify all that he did, and complain of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he received.</p>
            <p>Fauchet we find dabbling in the Weſtern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and writing home to the Convention, his
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030226_0065_0FE54B8904197BF8"/>
regret that it had been quelled, and his fear that it might tend to conſolidate the government. Can any man be fool enough to imagine, that Fauchet would have written in this manner, had he not been well aſſured, that the Convention thought like himſelf?</p>
            <p>If any one doubted of this before, he can now doubt no longer. Adet has thrown off the maſk for them. They repealed their firſt decree for ſeizing American veſſels; they pretended to be ſorry for the inſolence of Genet; but now they repeat their decree, and make that very appeal to the people, which they diſplaced Genet for talking about! <hi>Generous</hi> fellows!—Who would have thought, while they were weeping over our flag, and ſending theirs to be wept over here, and writing love letters to the Congreſs, and ſending us their new plan for <hi>weighing</hi> bread and butter <hi>by sines and tangents.</hi> Lord curſe them! Who would have thought, I ſay, while all this loving mummery was going forward; while they were hugging and ſqueezing, and ſlavering over with ſnuff and foam, their dear "American brethren;" who would have thought that no leſs than <hi>seven</hi> heads of accuſation lay rankling in their boſoms! —"A <hi>friend,</hi>" ſays Citizen Adet, <q>injured by a <hi>friend,</hi> may ſafely complain, without fear of giving offence.</q>—Yes; but then he muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain <hi>like a friend,</hi> and not like a bully. He muſt not talk of his horſewhip or his cane. He muſt not come with <hi>terror</hi> in his mouth; or friendſhip takes its flight, and reſentment ſucceeds. Beſides, "a friend injured by a friend," complains at once: he does not treaſure up the injury in his mind, and reſerve it for the day of his ſtrength.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030226_0066_0FE54B8A934011F0"/>
He does not hug, and kiſs, and hang on the neck of his friend, and weep for joy at the ſight of his <hi>garment;</hi> he does not keep up this farce for four long years, and at laſt, when he ſees that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy avails him nothing, come and rip up his grievances, and threaten vengeance. This is not the conduct of <hi>an injured friend,</hi> but that of <q>an inſidious d—d Iago,</q> as Peter Pindar calls the French; and ſuch they have been, and will be, to this and every other country, that has the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to place any dependence in their friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Their audacious interference, too, in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a chief magiſtrate for this country, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mark of their <hi>generosity,</hi> their tender care of us. "Let your government <hi>return to itself,</hi>" ſays the Citizen, <q>and the <hi>Directory</hi> will <hi>temper</hi> the effects of its <hi>resentment.</hi>
               </q>—I wonder what ſort of fellows this <hi>Directory,</hi> as they call it, is compoſed of: whether they are ſhaped like gods or devils, or what they are like, that they ſhould dare to talk in this manner to an independent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they have no more power over than they have over heaven. What a poor beggarly puff, for a man as much fit to be a Preſident as I am to be an Archbiſhop! A man who is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt by profeſſion, a philoſopher by trade, and a Frenchman in politics and morality: a man who has written a paſſport for Tom Paine's <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> and would, if neceſſary, write another for his infamous letter to General Waſhington: a man, in ſhort, who is at the head of the proſtituted party by whoſe intrigues he has been brought forward and is ſupported. If this man is elected Preſident, the country is ſold to the French; and as plantations are generally
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030226_0067_0FE54B8CAFFCD9E0"/>
ſold with the live ſtock on them. I ſhall remove my carcaſs; for I am reſolved never to become their property. I do not wiſh my family vault to be in the guts of cannibals.</p>
            <p>Paine's Letter to General Waſhington is the laſt pretty little proof of French <hi>generosity.</hi> I have no room here to ſay any thing as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this ſuperlatively inſolent and infamous performance; but it is clear that the old ruffian has been ordered to write it by the Convention. It was written nearly about the ſame time that the decree for ſeizing American veſſels was paſſed; it was expected that Adet's communications would ſtir up the people, and theſe ſweepings of Tom's brain were intended to finiſh the work: nor have I the leaſt doubt but they are now enjoying the hope, that General Waſhington's head is kicking about the ſtreets of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Such has been "the <hi>generosity of Frenchmen</hi>" towards the people of America. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of this generoſity I think we have little to hope, and I am certain we ſhall find that we have as little to fear from their reſentment.</p>
            <p>The diſpute between the two countries ſtands thus: France has violated the treaty, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently inſiſts, that ſhe will continue in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it, at the ſame time that her miniſter firſt inſults the government, and then declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuſpended, <q>till the government returns to itſelf.</q>—What then is to be done? Statues and curioſities we have none to ſtop their mouths with; unleſs, indeed, it be the Statue from over the library door. We might alſo ſpare them Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon's
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030226_0068_0FE54B92A6758138"/>
pivot-chair and his great bull Mammoth; to which they might add Mr. Jefferſon himſelf, for it does not appear that he will be wanted on this ſide the water. But this would not ſatisfy them. What is to be done, then? Is the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>return to itself,</hi> beg pardon of the <q>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible nation</q> for having iſſued a proclamation of neutrality; for having declined a treaty with them, and for having formed one with Great Britain? Is this to be the conduct of America, whoſe chief boaſt is her <hi>independence?</hi> Is ſhe to become a poor little twinkling ſtar that is to hide its head at the rays of the <hi>Grande Republique Françoise?</hi> Is ſhe at laſt to be governed by a gang of aſſaſſins with their long couteau at her throat? A pretty kind of <hi>independence</hi> truly! If this is to be the caſe, ſhe has changed a Britiſh parent for a French maſter: from a child in leading ſtrings ſhe has become a grown up ſlave in chains.</p>
            <p>But this will not be the caſe. This government will inſiſt upon the fulfilment of the treaty, or will declare it null and void for ever. They will no longer ſuffer the country to be tantalized with decrees and revocations and ſuſpenſions and threats. They will ſay; <q>Do us juſtice and leave us to manage our own affairs, or we have done with you;</q> and in this they will be ſupported by the voice of the people, however Citizen Adet may flatter himſelf to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The <hi>terrible tone</hi> was the worſt that the Guillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Legiſlators could have aſſumed here. It may do well enough with the Brabanſons, the Dutch, the Savoyards and the Italians; but it will never do with Americans, who of all mankind are the laſt
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030226_0069_0FE5470E24FEFE38"/>
to yield to compulſion. The quarrel with Great Britain which finally brought about the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this country, was merely about the word <hi>force.</hi> The colonies were willing to <hi>give</hi> the amount of the taxes impoſed, but they would not ſuffer it to be ſaid that they were <hi>forced to do it.</hi> When I was a little boy, my elder brother, in order to get my ſhare of the apple pudding, uſed to ſay: "PETER, I <hi>order</hi> you to eat."—That very inſtant my jaws refuſed their functions, and the morſel ſtuck in my throat. To be ſure I was a moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate dog, and I am inclined to think that the Mounſeers will find their dear little Miſs America to be much about of the ſame temper. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this country are the deſcendants of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and Germans, and they are made of the ſame ſtubborn kind of ſtuff as their anceſtors. With good words you may lead them far, but with bad ones not a ſingle ſtep: to their humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you may always appeal with aſſurance of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but never to their fears: like the oak they may be cruſhed and ſhivered to ſplinters, but no mortal power will ever make them bend.</p>
            <p>Some people imagine that France will declare war againſt us. France dares do no ſuch thing. France knows better. No; the moſt ſhe will do, is, to perſevere in the violation of the treaty, and conſequently <hi>break off all connection with the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States;</hi> and this is juſt what is wanted. Then we ſhould get rid of the council of old ones and the council of young ones and the five ſovereigns, that are born and expire in rotation, and Citizen Genet and Citizen Adet, and all the Faro bank and billiard table men, and all the dingy off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of French delicacy, and, which will be
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030226_0070_0FE54B95EF7FE598"/>
the greateſt bleſſing, we ſhall get rid of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous unnatural faction that they keep alive to goad, torment, and weaken the government, and divide the country againſt itſelf. Would they but break off from us, we ſhould avoid that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation of manners, which their impious ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem muſt inevitably produce, wherever it gains ground to any extent. Their diabolical agents are now ſeeking for proſelytes in every ſtate and townſhip of the Union. I believe that Bache's atheiſtical Calendar is paid for by the French, as much as I believe that Paine's Age of Reaſon was. They both come from the ſame preſs, and are intended to anſwer the ſame purpoſe; and that purpoſe is, to corrupt the hearts of the people, make them emulate the French in every thing that is vile and ſavage; to deſtroy the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and throw the country into the power of France. There is much more to be apprehended here than from their direct threats. Their wild and blaſphemous doctrines will have little effect on people of ſenſe; but they may have, and they will have, as they already have had, on igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and youth. Youth is ever caught with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, and ambitious of ſuperior diſcernment. The panders of Paris have always addreſſed themſelves to this part of ſociety: they ſucceeded complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in France, and I am much afraid their ſucceſs has been but too promiſing here. The ſooner, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the country is purged of them, the better. Every year, every month, every day, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more dangerous. Let them then go. A war, generally termed the ſcourge of nations, is a bleſſing, when compared with what we have to expect from their diſorganizing impious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and perfidious intrigues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:030226_0071_0FE54B980EF281F0"/>But, no declaration of war will come from them. They know better than to relinquiſh their hold. They will ſtick to us like a burr. They can be as haughty as Lucifer, and they can be as mean. When they cannot with majeſtic ſtature ſcale the walls of Paradiſe, they can ſhrink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the ſhape of a toad, and creep in at a chink. When they perceive, that we are not to be ſcared, that we laugh at their <hi>"terrible nation"</hi> and their <hi>"tempered reſentment,"</hi> they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as mild as milk-maids, and ſay they <hi>were only joking.</hi> They will repeal their <hi>decree</hi> for ſeizing our veſſels; they will pretend <hi>to cry</hi> again, and their Citizen will tell us about their <q>
                  <hi>ſweet</hi> ſentiments,</q> and we ſhall have another flag ſent, and ſo all will be made up.—The reader who conſults only his own heart will ſay that this is impoſſible; but let him recollect whom we have to deal with: the French Convention; men who make a ſport of the violation of treaties and of oaths; who have baniſhed every idea of ſhame and remorſe, and according to whoſe ſtandard of retrograde refinement, meanneſs is commenſurate with weakneſs and misfortune, and inſolence with power and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>However, though I am certain that the French will not go to war with America, I am as certain that America muſt ſoon go to war with them.—Let not the reader ſtart. He muſt accuſtom himſelf to think and to talk on the ſubject, and the ſooner he begins the better. I am not foretelling the day of judgment nor a ſecond deluge; but am ſpeaking of an object that may be looked at with calmneſs, as I make no doubt it will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:030226_0072_0FE54B9CF8766FF0"/>There is every reaſon to believe, indeed, with me the fact is certain, that Spain has ceded Louiſiana to France. This will put the French in poſſeſſion of all our Weſtern Frontier, give them the free navigation of the Miſſiſſippi, and then I beg any one to caſt his eye over the map of the United States, and ſee the expoſed ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which they will be placed.</p>
            <p>France has had this in contemplation ever ſince the peace of 1783, and the Spaniſh part of Saint Domingo, lately ceded to her, and with which ſhe can do nothing, now furniſhes her with an object of exchange. Beſides, the king of Spain can refuſe the French nothing, or he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would not have entered into a league with the murderers of the head of his family, and have ſupplied atheiſts with troops to carry on a marauding war on the Catholic States of Italy and the defenceleſs head of the church.</p>
            <p>The French, once in poſſeſſion of Louiſiana, will give law to the Miſſiſſippi, and when we conſider the prevalent ſpirit and politics of the Weſtern people in general, the diſtance they are at from the ſeat of government, and the ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive arts of their new neighbours, there is little reaſon to hope, that they will long remain obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the United States. The new inhabitants of Louiſiana will be made up of the profligate French ſoldiery, who will be prevailed on by ſplendid promiſes to tranſport themſelves to this country, but who will be fit for nothing but pillage and war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:030226_0073_0FE54B9EC6F96A68"/>With ſuch a hold on the back countries, and ſuch a party in the Atlantic ones as they now have, a diviſion of the Union muſt be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The ſouthern States, where very little of that independence of ſpirit prevails, which reſiſts the encroachments of an ambitious foe, will ſoon become an appendage to France. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and northern States may, at the expenſe of bloody wars, preſerve their independence for a while; but, at laſt, harraſſed, and fatigued with the burden of defending themſelves, they will call in the aid of Great Britain; and thus the baſis of an empire will once more be cut out into colonies and provinces.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who rely on the friendly profeſſions of the French, I refer to the inſtances of their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which we have witneſſed in the courſe of theſe obſervations. Let any one read the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted letter of Fauchet, and recollect that it was written in confidence to the government, and doubt, if he can, that the counties then in a ſtate of inſurrection would have been ſupported by France, if ſhe had been in poſſeſſion of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory ſhe is now about to acquire. Such opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will continually offer, as long as faction exiſts, and that it ever will do, as long as there is any thing to contend for. To judge of the future by the preſent tranquillity, is to preſume that the billows have ceaſed to roll, becauſe we ſee the ſea in a calm.</p>
            <p>Ever ſince the peace of 1783, France has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the commerce, carried on between America and Great Britain, with a watchful, jealous and envious eye. At firſt ſhe endeavoured to turn
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030226_0074_0FE54BA054698E30"/>
the channel towards herſelf; but that having failed, ſhe fell on the plan of ſubjugation. A French writer in treating of this ſubject obſerves, that <q>it would be a balance againſt the <hi>loans</hi> of England to the <hi>Atlantic merchants.</hi>
               </q> By <hi>loans</hi> he means the <hi>credit</hi> given by the Britiſh merchants, and which is indeed a mine of gold to the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and merchants of America. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing really diabolical in this envy. They would ſooner the country ſhould be torn to pieces than it ſhould trade with their rival.</p>
            <p>They well know, that there is but one check to their ambitious projects; and that is, an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance offenſive and defenſive between Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and America. They know, that by ſuch an alliance they would be deprived of all their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in the Weſt Indies, and would be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Atlantic ſeas. This alliance once formed, America might forbid them to ſet a foot in Louiſiana, or might drive them and their <q>
                  <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> allies,</q> the Spaniards, into the Gulph of Mexico. It is with the conſciouſneſs of this on their minds, that they have been ſo ſedulous in forming a faction to oppoſe every accommodating ſtep, and every advance towards friendſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two countries. They have the Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avellian maxim, "divide and you govern," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in their eye. They wiſh to keep them aſſunder, that they may devour them one at a time.</p>
            <p>The moſt diſagreeable circumſtance at preſent, is, this ceſſion of Louiſiana will not be perfectly aſcertained, till after the general peace; ſo that, though Great Britain is nearly as much intereſted
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030226_0075_0FE54BA2776ADFD8"/>
in the event as America, ſhe can take no ſteps to prevent it, becauſe ſhe will be diſarmed before it be known; and their Myrmidons will be in poſſeſſion of their promiſed land, before any meaſures of prevention can be adopted on the part of America. Something, however, muſt be done to preſerve us from ſuch neighbours, or the independence of this country will go to the grave before us. National precautions muſt be left to the rulers of the ſtate, but every man has it in his power to contribute towards the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faction, that, at any rate, though there ſhould be an enemy on the frontiers, there may be none in the heart of the country.</p>
            <p>Such is the ſituation of America with reſpect to the inſidious, unprincipled, inſolent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Republic of France; and it only remains for the virtue and public ſpirit of the people to determine, what ſort of anſwer ought to be given to her preſumptuous and domineering miniſter. Let it be well remembered, that the Notes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his calumnious accuſations, his contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous defiance and hectoring threats, are not the effuſions of a paragraphiſt or a pamphleteer: they are the official communications of a public miniſter, thrown in the teeth of the nation. In leſs than two months they will be read and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on by half the civilized world. Thoſe who know the American character will not be deceived; but far the greater part, will ſet us down as a nation of ſharpers or poltroons, who have either not honeſty to ſupport our reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or not courage to defend it. If there be a man, who, with this reflection on his mind, can wiſh the government to ſtoop and cringe and ſue
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030226_0076_0FE547121876C1A0"/>
and beg for peace, to court a repetition of the buffet that yet tingles in our cheek, he may boaſt about <hi>independence,</hi> he may even call himſelf a <hi>patriot;</hi> but his independence is an empty ſound, and he knows no more of the animating glow of patriotiſm, where affection, duty and honour unite, than the ſlave knows of the charms of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or the eunuch of the ſweets of love.—No; the anſwer of every man, who loves his country and feels the inſult it has received, yet prefers the bleſſings of honourable peace to the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable calamities of war, is, in the words of a good old Engliſh king that conquered France and all that France contained:
