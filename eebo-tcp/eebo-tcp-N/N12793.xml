            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Buſineſs aſſigned by the honorable, learned and pious Founder for the third in the quadrennial courſe of his Lectures, is "to be for the detecting, and convicting and expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the idolatry of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, their tyranny, uſurpations, damnable hereſies, fatal errors, abominable ſuperſtitions and other crying wickedneſſes in their high places; and finally to prove that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is that myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> that man of ſin, that apoſtate church, ſpoken of in the New-Teſtament."</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen who have preceded me in this Lecture, have conſidered and confuted the arguments urged by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in proof of the <hi>infallibility</hi> of their Church,<note n="2" place="bottom">Dr. Wiggleſworth, A. D. 1757.</note> and of the <hi>ſupremacy</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop

               <note n="c" place="bottom">Dr. Mayhew, A. D. 1765.</note> which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants bring againſt the Romaniſts, has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. The <hi>papal</hi> religion has been ſhewn to be a <hi>complex falſhood.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="bottom">Dr. Mather, A. D. 1769.</note> And the characters of the <hi>man of ſin,</hi>
               <note n="e" place="bottom">Dr. Cooper, A. D. 1773.</note> as they are given by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> have been clearly evinced, to be applicable to the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The part which I ſhall take in this controverſy, will be to conſider one of the grand ſources of the fatal errors, and groſs corruptions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church. The words of my text will naturally lead me to conſider the AUTHORITY which the church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſigns to TRADITION, and to point out ſome of the fatal conſequences of it. They are the reply of our Saviour to the Phariſees, who found fault with his diſciples for ſitting down to their meals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking care previouſly to cleanſe themſelves from any pollutions they might have contracted. This conduct of his diſciples the Phariſees charge with being a tranſgreſſion of the tradition of the Elders. Our Saviour from thence takes occaſion to reprehend them for the ſuperſtitious regard they paid to thoſe traditions. He charges them with tranſgreſſing, by means of that regard, the commandment of God. In ſupport of the charge he inſtances in their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition reſpecting the conduct of children towards their parents. "God, ſaith he, has commanded by Moſes, ſaying, honour thy father and thy mother;" and hath enforced this precept by that awful ſanction, "Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo curſeth his father or mother, let him ſurely die." "But ye ſay, Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his father or
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016171_0006_0F9BCD0814E5AF88"/>his mother, that, by which thou mighteſt be proſited by me, is a gift," devoted to ſome pious purpoſe, and neglects "to honour his father or his mother," either by not paying them that reſpect which is due from children to their parents, or by refuſing to afford them that relief which their neceſſitous circumſtances may require, "he ſhall be free" from the obligation of the divine command. In this manner the Phariſees made the commandment of God of none effect by their tradition.</p>
            <p>To ſhew, that the charge which Chriſt brings againſt the Phariſees, may, with equal juſtneſs, be brought againſt the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhall, by divine aſſiſtance, endeavour at this time,</p>
            <p>Faithfully to ſtate the tenets of that church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting <hi>tradition:</hi>—then,</p>
            <p>Conſider the force of the arguments, urged in ſupport of thoſe tenets:—and laſtly,</p>
            <p>Shew that the ſetting up <hi>oral tradition</hi> as of equal authority with the ſacred Scriptures, has opened the door for the admiſſion of doctrines and precepts into that church, ſubverſive of thoſe delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be done, is ſaithfully to ſtate the tenets of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> reſpecting <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>—Before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Word of God contained in the <hi>canonical</hi> books of ſacred Scripture, was received by the Chriſtian Church, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as the <hi>only</hi> rule of faith and practice. All the doctrines to be believed by Chriſtians, and all the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016171_0007_0F9BCD08D056DC80"/>duties to be practiſed by them, were confeſſedly, either expreſsly contained in the holy Scriptures, or elſe plainly to be proved by them, by juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence. But when the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council of Trent</hi> were reſolved not to reform the errors and corruptions of the church, which were grown to an amazing height before the Reformation; and when they found that their doctrine of <hi>tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> of <hi>purgatory,</hi> of <hi>ſeven ſacraments;</hi> and their practice of <hi>worſhipping ſaints, images, and relicks,</hi> of reading the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>ſervice of God</hi> in an <hi>unknown tongue,</hi> were not to be proved by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they deemed it expedient to ſtretch and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the rule of faith and practice beyond its ancient limits. Such abſurd doctrines and ſuperſtitious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices not being warranted by the Scriptures, they judged it expedient to augment the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the addition of ſeveral <hi>apocryphal</hi> books to the Old Teſtament; books never received by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, to which were committed the ancient Oracles of God; becauſe they were compoſitions merely human, written by uninſpired perſons, after the ſpirit of prophecy had ceaſed in that church. And after the rule of their faith and practice had received this addition, leſt it ſhould not yet be large enough for their purpoſe, they were pleaſed to add to it the <hi>unwritten word,</hi> or <hi>oral tradition.</hi> This the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has declared to be of <hi>equal authority</hi> with the ſacred Scriptures themſelves, and that it ought to be received with the <hi>ſame pious reverence and affection.</hi>
               <note n="f" place="bottom">Pari pietatis affectu ac reverentia ſuſcipit, ac veneratur.</note> To juſtify their ſetting up <hi>oral tradition</hi> as equal in authority with the <hi>written word</hi> of God, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> tell us, that the books of the New-Teſtament
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016171_0008_0F9BCD0990F7FA98"/>were <hi>occaſionally</hi> written, and not with a deſign of making them the <hi>only</hi> rule of faith and practice. Many things, ſay they, were <hi>orally</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Apoſtles, which they did not commit to writing; things of equal authority, and entitled to the ſame reſpect that is due to their writings. That we may not be at a loſs where to find the things <hi>orally delivered,</hi> but <hi>not written,</hi> the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> inform us, that their church, which is the <hi>keeper,</hi> and as occaſion may require, the <hi>publiſher of them,</hi> hath ſafely and infallibly conveyed them down to us by tradition. Theſe traditions, ſay they, were in the church long before ſuch occaſional publications of them. They have, from age to age, been handed down, by the church, from the very Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And the evidence of their being apoſtolical, is as good as that which reſpects the things that the Apoſtles committed to writing. Beſides all this, ſome of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church maintain, that it appears from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves, that we ought to ſubmit to the teſtimony of the church, when ſhe declares what things are to be received as articles of faith. We muſt, therefore, believe ſhe truly diſpenſes the traditions received from the Apoſtles; even though the particulars ſhe declares are not to be proved by Scripture. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> having, in this manner, fitted a rule for their particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, laid a foundation for proceeding with eaſe in confirming and proving whatever doctrines and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices they had a mind to eſtabliſh, let them be ever ſo ſuperſtitious, abſurd or impious.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who embrace the Reformation agree with the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that the Apoſtles taught the Chriſtians
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016171_0009_0F9BCD0A50F1F3A0"/>of their day ſeveral things which we do not find in their writings. Could theſe be aſcertained, they would be equal in authority, and entitled to the ſame reverence and reſpect with the apoſtolic wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: But not being committed to writing, they are now loſt. From the Scripture itſelf it is evident, that ſome things taught by the Apoſtles, were not written by them. From St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s telling the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi>
               <note n="g" place="bottom">2 Epiſt. ii. 6.</note> that "they knew what with-held the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the man of ſin," it is manifeſt that he, or ſome other inſpired perſon, had made known to them what was the obſtacle to his being revealed. But this is no where expreſsly declared in the ſacred Scriptures. It would be vain to imagine this to be the only inſtance of apoſtolic inſtruction, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing: It is highly probable there were other inſtances now loſt. Uncertainty is always the concomitant of thoſe things, which have only <hi>oral tradition</hi> for the means of their conveyance down ſo long a tract of time, as from the apoſtolic age to the preſent day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are alſo ready to acknowledge, that the chriſtian writers of the firſt ages of the church may ſometimes give light, and lead to the probable ſenſe of ſome text of Scripture, which without ſuch help would be quite obſcure. From the writings of ſome of the Fathers it is probable, that it was the ſtrength and greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, which hindered the revelation of the man of ſin. The diſſolution of that empire was to open a door of entrance to him, when he made his appearance in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> allow further, that the <hi>general practice</hi> of the church, where it can be accurately aſcertained,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016171_0010_0F9BCD0B10AC72A8"/>is a good commentary on thoſe texts which treat of the government, diſcipline or practice of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, chriſtian church.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe conceſſions, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are far from agreeing with the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which declares that the <hi>oral</hi> traditions of the <hi>catholic</hi> church meaning the <hi>Roman,</hi> were to be received with equal reverence and reſpect, as the books of the old and new Teſtament; and that he, who deſpiſeth thoſe traditions, is ACCURSED. On the other hand, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> churches maintain the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament to be a PERFECT RULE of <hi>faith and practice.</hi> They do not indeed pretend, as has been noticed already, that every thing which was ſaid or done, by our Saviour or his Apoſtles, is contained in them; or that they lay down particular rules for the management of all the prudential affairs of the chriſtian church. With reſpect to our Saviour, the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> informs us,<note n="h" place="bottom">Ch xx. ver. 30.</note> "that many other ſigns were done by Jeſus in the preſence of his diſciples," which are not recorded in the Goſpel. And from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s direction to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> to "let all things be done decently and in order," it is evident that ſome of the affairs of that church were leſt to be managed as their prudence ſhould direct. In like manner, every chriſtian church is at liberty to provide for itſelt, where no proviſion is made in the Scriptures. Care, however, muſt be taken that ſuch proviſion be <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>orderly;</hi> that it does not tranſgreſs any of the rules of the Goſpel; nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join any thing as neceſſary, either to church commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or to ſalvation, which is not made ſo by Chriſt, the only Legiſlator of the chriſtian church. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016171_0011_0F9BCD0D77799D48"/>only maintain that every thing neceſſary to ſalvation, whether it relates to faith or practice, is either expreſsly contained in the Scriptures, or may by juſt conſequence be deduced from them. As to <hi>oral</hi> tradition, it is eſteemed by them a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, from an age ſo diſtant as the apoſtolic, too uncertain to be depended on; eſpecially in convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the knowledge of ſuch doctrinal truths, or practical precepts, as are <hi>neceſſary to ſolvation.</hi> And though it muſt be allowed that the revelations made in one age of the world have been leſs perfect than thoſe made in another; the earlier revelations containing fewer articles, and being often leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous than the later, yet the neceſſity of adding <hi>oral tradition</hi> cannot, from this cauſe, be concluſively argued. For God has in every age of the church revealed ALL that was <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be believed and practiſed in each particular age. And he has made his revelations with that degree of <hi>perſpicuity</hi> which was neceſſary compleatly to anſwer all his purpoſes in making them. The chriſtian diſpenſation, being the laſt which is to take place in the world, every article of faith, and every rule of duty, is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly contained in the ſacred Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, or may fairly and concluſively be deduced from them. No ſingle perſon, nor any collective bodies of men, have a right to preſcribe any other articles of faith or rules of duty than what are contained in thoſe ſacred writings. Every perſon, whoſe liſe is properly influenced and governed by the doctrine, and precepts of the holy Scriptures, will obtain the mercy of God to eternal life; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he totally diſregards all thoſe <hi>oral traditions</hi> which the church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends ſhe has conveyed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016171_0012_0F9BCD0E152D6EB8"/>down from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, with as much certainty as the ſacred Scriptures have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> churches have ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for abiding by their opinion, reſpecting the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſacred Scriptures,</hi> in every thing that concerns our eternal ſalvation; and for rejecting the <hi>authority of oral tradition,</hi> as it is maintained in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, may be fairly evinced.—For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oral tradition</hi> has, from experience, been found a very uncertain way of conveying the knowledge of doctrinal truths, or matters of fact, through a long ſucceſſion of ages. The longevity of the <hi>Antedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> gave them the greateſt advantage for conveying the knowledge of the doctrines and duties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to poſterity. Two perſons might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it down from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham.</hi> For at the death of <hi>Adam, Methuſelah</hi> was above three hundred years old. And <hi>Methuſelah</hi> did not die, till <hi>Shem</hi> was almoſt an hundred, who lived above an hundred years after the birth of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Beſides their lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity, the fewneſs of religious truths to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, gave them every advantage of doing it, with as much certainty as can attend oral tradition. But notwithſtanding theſe advantages, a diſſoluteneſs of manners had ſpread itſelf univerſally among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tediluvians. And by the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe few things, in which religion was then comprehended, was ſo corrupted, that God ſaw it neceſſary to correct it by making an immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him; And that <hi>Abraham</hi> might not be corrupted by the <hi>idolatry,</hi> which was beginning to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016171_0013_0F9BCD0EDDC6F0A8"/>prevail in his father's family, God commanded him to forſake his kindred and his country.—Further,</p>
            <p>The <hi>moſaic</hi> inſtitution was attended with many advantages, peculiarly favourable to tradition. The law was ſhort; and it was promulged at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with ſolemnities, that excited the wonder and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> There were many rites and ſeveral feſtivals appointed to keep up the remembrance of it. All the main acts of their religion were to be performed in one place, and by perſons of one family, who were devoted to this particular ſervice. And all the males were obliged to attend the ſervice at the temple three times a year, which kept up a conſtant intercourſe among them. But, notwithſtanding theſe and many other advantages in favour of tradition, that were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the <hi>moſaic</hi> inſtitution, God did not ſee ſit certainty of tradition. For the commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to write the <hi>whoſe law,</hi> as he himſelf had, with his own finger, written the <hi>ten commandments</hi> on tables of ſtone.</p>
            <p>The traditional method of conveying a revelation, muſt neceſſarily be liable to much uncertainty, ariſing both from involuntary miſtakes, and from deſigned, wilful and malicious falſifications. The credit of a report which paſſes through many hands, depends on the <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>ſufficiency of all the relators.</hi> Where-ever there is a ſuſpicion that any of them are deſicient in either of theſe qualifications, a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional doubt will be entertained with reſpect to the things reported by them. The effect of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded revelation can neither be extenſive, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent. It can reach but few perſons; and it cannot
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016171_0014_0F9BCD0FA06B1668"/>retain its full credibility, but for a ſhort time. Was the knowledge of religious truths to be communicated <hi>orally,</hi> for many centuries together, by an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude of perſons, differing in their capacities, tempers, deſigns and intereſts, it would be morally impoſſible to arrive at any certainty about them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> further alledge, that the conveyance of the doctrines of Chriſtianity by tradition, would have been attended with difficulties, peculiar to itſelf. The chriſtian religion was not, like the <hi>moſaic,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one country and nation. It was early pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated into countries very remote from each other, whoſe inhabitants, differing in language as well as ſituation, maintained but little intercourſe with one another. In ſuch circumſtances, had hiſtory been ſilent, it might reaſonably have been preſumed, that ſome perſons in thoſe diſtant countries would have corrupted the doctrines of Chriſtianity. When this had taken place, the remoteneſs of the countries, and the different languages of the inhabitants, would have rendered it extremely difficult to have rectified ſuch miſtakes; had the knowledge of Chriſtianity been wholly dependent on tradition. During the lives of the Apoſtles, a remedy might have been had in ſuch a caſe. On application to ſome of them, the queſtion in controverſy, might have been decided. But after the deceaſe of the Apoſtles, had not all the doctrines of chriſtianity been committed to writing, whenever a controverſy aroſe reſpecting any article of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, it muſt have remained undecided; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it could be proved from the Scriptures that Chriſt had veſted ſome one perſon, or ſome body of men, with power to decide all controverſies that ſhould ariſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016171_0015_0F9BCD105366D3D0"/>in the Church, in an authoritative manner. But that he has done ſo, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are not able to find ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence; notwithſtanding all that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have offered to evince that the <hi>Pope,</hi> or a <hi>General Council,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> are cloathed with ſuch authority. Indeed, the proofs of Chriſtianity are of ſo compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated a nature, that, were we altogether dependent on tradition for our knowledge of them, they could not have been made out, in ſo clear and ſatisfactory a manner, as is requiſite to eſtabliſh articles of faith, and perſuade men to embrace them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> further object, that our Saviour and his Apoſtles, in their controverſies with the Jews, do not ever appeal to tradition, but always to the Scriptures. Our Saviour never ſubmitted to tradition, though it was on many occaſions urged againſt him. On the contrary, he reproached the Jews with making the commandment of God of none effect by their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He told them plainly, that they worſhipped God in vain, when they taught for doctrines, the commandments of men. In all his diſputations with them, he invariably referred them to the Scriptures, and enjoined it on them to ſearch the Scriptures; founding his injunction on the juſtneſs of the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they entertained concerning them. <note n="k" place="bottom">John v. 39.</note> "In them, ſaid he, ye think ye have eternal life, and they are" the very books "that teſtify of me." Our Saviour never once appeals to tradition, when he is juſtifying himſelf, or his doctrine, againſt the cavils of the Jews.—In like manner, the Apoſtles conſtantly make their appeal to the Scriptures, in all their diſputes with them. They ſet a high character on the <hi>Bereans</hi> for their examining the Scriptures, and comparing with them
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016171_0016_0F9BCD111C2644B0"/>the very doctrines, preached among them by the Apoſtles themſelves. In the epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Galatians</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> purſues a chain of arguments in oppoſition to the prejudices the Jews had imbibed againſt Chriſtianity. But we do not find him, in theſe epiſtles, deducing ſo much as a ſingle argument from tradition. On the contrary, the merit of the cauſe, conteſted between them, is reſted wholly on evidence, derived from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This ſame Apoſtle, when he is enumerating to <hi>Timothy</hi> the advantages he derived from a religious education, mentions it as an eminent one, <note n="l" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Epiſt. iii. 15</note> "that from a child he had known the HOLY SCRIPTURES, which were able to make him wiſe to Salvation, through faith in Jeſus Chriſt." If the Scriptures have been handed down from the Apoſtles to the preſent time, without corruption in thoſe articles that are neceſſary to ſalvation, either the Apoſtle, or the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt be miſerably miſtaken. The Apoſtle tells <hi>Timothy, they</hi> are able to make him <hi>wiſe to ſalvation.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſays they are <hi>not ſo,</hi> without the help of thoſe <hi>traditional articles,</hi> which ſhe has been ſo happy as to convey down to us with infallible certainty. Which is entitled to the greateſt credit, the Apoſtle or the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will ſcarcely be called in queſtion by any who have not learned the art of believing that an Apoſtle, writing under the guidance of the Holy Ghoſt can commit an egregious blunder.—When the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> knew that his death was approaching, he wrote his ſecond epiſtle for this very end, that his chriſtian brethren "might have theſe things," namely, the doctrines and precepts taught by him and the other Apoſtles, "always in remembrance." But why need he have
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016171_0017_0F9BCD11D53F3198"/>been ſo ſolicitous to commit thoſe things to writing? Perhaps he never heard, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo highly privileged as to be the keeper and conveyancer of thoſe inſtructions which the Apoſtles, either through hurry of buſineſs, or through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſſ, had neglected to commit to writing. But to be ſerious, neither our Saviour, nor his Apoſtles, give the leaſt hint of their having left any "unwritten word," with the Church, to be by her conveyed down to ſucceeding ages by <hi>oral tradition:</hi> Much leſs have they given the leaſt intimation of their having leſt any articles <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> to be in this manner conveyed down by the Church.</p>
            <p>Were theſe the only reaſons for rejecting the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Church of <hi>Rome, Proteſtants</hi> would eſteem themſelves fully juſtified in totally diſregarding them.—But this brings me to obſerve,</p>
            <p>That the very ſuppoſal of a neceſſity of adding <hi>oral tradition</hi> to ſcripture revelation, implies ſome <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection</hi> in the Scriptures. On this ſuppoſition the Scriptures muſt, either <hi>not contain</hi> all things neceſſary to be believed and practiſed, in order to obtain ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe <hi>not deliver</hi> the articles of faith and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice with that degree of <hi>perſpicuity,</hi> which was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary compleatly to anſwer all the divine purpoſes in delivering them. Both of theſe have been openly taught and avowed by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> even in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant country, while they have been attempting to make proſelytes to their Church. In a pamphlet diſperſed in England in the former part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent century, it is aſked, "<hi>Why ſhould not the Scripture</hi> ALONE <hi>be the rule of faith?</hi>" To which the anſwer given is, "<hi>Becauſe ſeveral</hi> NECESSARY ARTICLES
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016171_0018_0F9BCD129322D590"/>
               <hi>are either</hi> NOT AT ALL CONTAINED <hi>in Scripture, or at leaſt are</hi> NOT PLAIN <hi>in the Scripture without the help of tradition.</hi>" But theſe are poſitions, which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> think ought not to be laid down, in order to eſtabliſh the authority of oral tradition.—For,</p>
            <p>It may be clearly evinced, that every article of faith and practice, neceſſary to ſalvation, is contained in the Scriptures; even from a conceſſion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf. For that Church allows, "that the Scriptures are to be received by all chriſtians as the INFALLIBLE <hi>word of</hi> GOD" Now this infallible word declares, <note n="m" place="bottom">1 Tim. iii. 16, 17.</note> "that all Scripture is given by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to all good works." If by the man of God is to be underſtood a <hi>Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Teacher</hi> in the chriſtian Church, then the Scripture is given to <hi>perfect</hi> him for his office; and <hi>throughly</hi> to furniſh him to all good works, belonging to his ſtation. Or ſhould the man of God be ſuppoſed to refer to a <hi>private chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> then the deſign of the Scripture is to make him perfect, and throughly to furniſh him to all good works; compleatly qualifying him for the faithful diſcharge of all the duties of his chriſtian profeſſion. On either ſuppoſition it will follow, that all neceſſary articles of faith and practice are contained in the Scriptures. For they are profitable for <hi>doctrine,</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to form juſt thoughts of the divine Majeſty and of ourſelves. They alſo teach us the way in which ſinful man may become reconciled to God. They are profitable for <hi>reproof,</hi> for all the errors and falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which have at any time been propagated, may
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016171_0019_0F9BCD1350958778"/>be confuted by them. They are profitable for <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> for they lay the ſtricteſt prohibition on every kind of wickedneſs and on every degree of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. By convincing men of their ſins and their faults, they become the means of correcting them. They are profitable for <hi>inſtruction</hi> in <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> teaching all the rules of righteouſneſs, even all the duties incumbent on chriſtians. The Scriptures are ſo perfect for all theſe ends, as fully to anſwer the deſign of God in giving them; which was, that <hi>the man of God,</hi> whether he be a teacher in the church, or only a private Chriſtian, may <hi>be made perfect, throughly furniſhed to all good works.</hi> Now, ſhould it be admitted, that the Scriptures do not contain every article of faith and practice, neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will follow, either that the man of God may be <hi>perfect</hi> without the knowledge of ſome <hi>neceſſary</hi> articles of chriſtianity; or elſe, that God did not know what would be ſufficient to make him <hi>perfect.</hi> The former is a ſelf-evident contradiction. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the latter of Him whoſe underſtanding is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, would be as fooliſh as it is blaſphemous.</p>
            <p>Indeed from the whole current of the Scriptures we are led to conclude, that all the neceſſary articles of faith and practice are contained in them. The Apoſtle John informs us, in the cloſe of his goſpel, <note n="n" place="bottom">Ch. xx. 30.</note> that "theſe things were written, that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God; and and that believing <hi>we might have life</hi> through his name." So again in his firſt epiſtle <note n="o" place="bottom">Ch. v. 13.</note> he ſays, "theſe things have I written unto you—that ye might know that ye have eternal life." Now, ſince the diſign of the Scriptures is to make known the way to eternal life; and ſince from them we may be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016171_0020_0F9BCD140EFBDC78"/>certain that we are entitled to it, it is evident that they muſt contain all the articles neceſſary to ſalvation. There can be no occaſion for the help of <hi>oral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> to add any thing to <hi>their perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should any thing then be taught by a miniſter of the goſpel, or decreed by a particular church, as neceſſary to ſalvation, which is not to be found in expreſs words in the Scriptures, nor to be deduced from them by juſt conſequence, it may ſafely be rejected; it cannot be an article of our holy religion. All ſuch additions are mere perverſions of the goſpel of Chriſt. The goſpel was ſo fully preached by the Apoſtles themſelves, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſcruples not to denounce a moſt ſolemn curſe againſt either an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or an <hi>Angel from Heaven,</hi> who ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to preach a goſpel different from that which had been preached by him. <note n="p" place="bottom">Gal. i. 8.</note> "Though <hi>we,</hi> ſays he, or an <hi>Angel from Heaven,</hi> preach any other goſpel, than that which we have preached unto you, <hi>let him be</hi> ACCURSED." To impreſs this the more, on the minds of the <hi>Galatians</hi> in the firſt place, and then on the minds of all who ſhould read this epiſtle, it is immediately repeated, <note n="q" place="bottom">verſe 9.</note> "As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, if any man preach any other goſpel unto you, than that which ye have received, <hi>let him be</hi> ACCURSED." Surely then thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> communion, who declare there are ſeveral <hi>neceſſary</hi> things, <hi>not</hi> contained in the Scriptures, have reaſon to fear leſt this apoſtolic curſe ſhould come upon them. Till they can prove that ſuch <hi>additional articles</hi> were <hi>orally</hi> delivered by the Apoſtles themſelves; that they ſtand on as good evidence, as thoſe articles do, which the Apoſtles committed to writing; and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016171_0021_0F9BCD14E10CF000"/>that the church has handed them down from the Apoſtles, pure and free from corruption, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will eſteem themſelves fully juſtified in rejecting them.</p>
            <p>Should the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> to free themſelves from the charge of inconſiſtency and ſelf-contradiction, reply, "That the church of <hi>Rome</hi> allows the ſufficiency of Scripture to <hi>perfect</hi> the man of God, provided Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be interpreted as the <hi>catholic,</hi> meaning the <hi>Roman</hi> church, directs; and that there be alſo a holding faſt <hi>thoſe traditions,</hi> to which the <hi>written word refers,</hi>" it will not anſwer their purpoſe. This written word declares, that <hi>as written</hi> it is profitable for all the afore mentioned purpoſes. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affirm there are <hi>other articles,</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, preſerved by the church and handed down by tradition, which are <hi>equally neceſſary</hi> to thoſe ends. Now to aſſert, that the <hi>written word</hi> of God is infallibly true, which declares that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to make men <hi>wiſe to ſalvation through faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to make the man of God <hi>perfect;</hi> and at the ſame time to aſſert, that they are <hi>not able,</hi> without the addition of ſome <hi>other</hi> NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSARY <hi>articles,</hi> carries ſo much the appearance of abſurdity and ſelf-contradiction, that it will require no ſmall ſhare of the art and ſubtilty of a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to free ſuch aſſertions from it.</p>
            <p>To palliate this inconſiſtency, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> plead, 'that the Scriptures themſelves refer to <hi>traditions,</hi> which are to be held faſt, as well as the things that are written.' To this purpoſe they quote a paſſage from the ſecond epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="bottom">Ch. ii. 15.</note> "There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016171_0022_0F9BCD159124DEC8"/>brethren, ſtand faſt, and hold the <hi>traditions</hi> which ye have been taught, whether by <hi>word,</hi> or our <hi>epiſtle.</hi>" Upon this paſſage one of their writers makes this obſervation. "Hence it is clear, that <hi>ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> were delivered to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> by <hi>word of mouth,</hi> and thoſe of EQUAL <hi>authority</hi> with what was <hi>written,</hi> if not more; for the Holy Ghoſt doth name them <hi>firſt,</hi> as they were indeed the firſt in being." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Touchſtone of the reformed Goſpel.</note> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, "that the Apoſtle commands that they <hi>no leſs</hi> obſerve what they had received WITHOUT <hi>writing,</hi> than what they had received by <hi>epiſtle.</hi>" To juſtify their interpretation of this text, and to ſhew its pertinency to the point for which it is alledged, it is incumbent on the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to make it evident, that the <hi>traditions</hi> which the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> were taught by <hi>word,</hi> were different from thoſe taught by <hi>epiſtle;</hi> and that thoſe <hi>verbal tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were never committed to <hi>writing,</hi> by perſons under the guidance of the holy Spirit; but left with the church to be carefully preſerved and delivered down <hi>orally</hi> to ſucceeding ages, as circumſtances may require. To ſet the matter in a juſt point of light, it may be obſerved, that whatever <hi>traditions neceſſary to ſalvation</hi> the Apoſtle delivered to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> by EPISTLE, the ſame he had before delivered to them by <hi>word of mouth. Bellarmine</hi> himſelf is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to acknowledge, "that without doubt the Apoſtle had <hi>fully preached the whole goſpel</hi> to them." The traditions, then, referred to in the text, were ſuch as the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> had been taught <hi>before,</hi> by the ſame Spirit and by the ſame perſon, who indited this epiſtle. Whereas the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> refer to <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of which no traces can be found for <hi>ſeveral hundred years</hi> after the whole canon of Scripture
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016171_0023_0F9BCD164EE63198"/>was compleated. Now it is readily granted, that where the things <hi>ſpoken</hi> are the ſame with thoſe afterwards <hi>written,</hi> they are of equal authority. For the authority of divine truths is not at all affected by the manner in which the knowledge of them is communicated. The Apoſtle, however, by joining <hi>word</hi> and <hi>letter</hi> together, does not deſign to inſinuate that the things taught them by <hi>letter</hi> were <hi>different</hi> from what he had before taught them by <hi>word of mouth.</hi> For in the 5th verſe of this very chapter, wherein he charges them to hold faſt the <hi>traditions</hi> they had been taught, he expreſsly aſſerts that what he was then actually writing, he had told them before. "Remember ye not, ſays he, that when I was yet with you, I told you theſe things." Whereas the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> bring this text to ſupport the authority of ſuch traditions as enjoin things not commanded in Scripture, or elſe ſuch as alter the plain ſenſe of it, and even ſuch as expreſsly contradict it.</p>
            <p>Should it be admitted that the paſſage under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration refers to traditions, which at that time were not committed to writing; yet it will not ſerve the purpoſe, for which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> alledge it. For, at the time the Apoſtle gave this injunction to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> there was but a ſmall part of the New-Teſtament committed to writing. Probably the epiſtle to the church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> recorded Acts XV. the two epiſtles to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and the goſpels of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> were the only books of the New-Teſtament extant at that time. Now, it will not, ſurely, follow becauſe, when things were in ſuch a ſituation, the Apoſtle commanded the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to hold faſt what they had been taught by <hi>word,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:016171_0024_0F9BCD18C4029898"/>that other things, neceſſary to ſalvation, were left <hi>unwritten,</hi> to be handed down by <hi>oral tradition,</hi> after the canon of Scripture was compleat.</p>
            <p>Should the modern <hi>Romaniſt</hi> reply with Cardinal <hi>Perron.</hi> "We muſt not anſwer that <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks here <hi>only</hi> of ſuch traditions, which, though not in his epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> yet were <hi>afterwards writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> and in other books of Scripture; becauſe it is upon occaſion of tradition touching the <hi>cauſe of the hindrance of the coming of Antichriſt,</hi> which was NEVER WRITTEN, that this injunction is laid down;" ſhould the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> make this reply, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is ready to rejoin, that if the tradition there referred to, which the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> had ſuch a ſolemn charge to hold faſt, <hi>be yet</hi> LOST, becauſe it was not committed, to writing, we can have little or no reaſon to pay any regard to other oral traditions, which are no ways concerned in the apoſtolic injunction. This very plea of the Cardinal furniſhes us with a good reaſon why the church of <hi>Rome</hi> or even the <hi>catholic</hi> Church, ſhould not be eſteemed a ſure preſerver of oral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. It is, indeed, a concluſive argument againſt all pretenſions of that kind. This text, then, can never be admitted by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as evidence ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince them, that "the traditions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church are to be received with equal piety and reverence as the books of the old and new Teſtament."</p>
            <p>In like manner the other texts urged by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts in favour of the traditions of their Church, are ſar from proving that any obligation lays on chriſtians to pay the leaſt regard to them. Theſe texts relate <hi>only</hi> to the things <hi>delivered by the Apoſtles themſelves;</hi> and have no concern with the traditions
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016171_0025_0F9BCD19597F5BE8"/>of <hi>after-ages.</hi> The bare reading them is ſufficient to confute the <hi>Popiſh</hi> interpretation of them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note n="s" place="bottom">1 Epiſt. xi. 2.</note> "I praiſe you, brethren, that you remember <hi>me</hi> in all things, and keep the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances [or traditions] as <hi>I</hi> delivered them unto you." According to the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> inſtead of remembering the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> we muſt remember and reverence the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>church;</hi> and inſtead of keeping the traditions which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> delivered, who on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion tells them, that what he delivered to them, he received of the Lord, we muſt keep thoſe traditions which the <hi>Church</hi> delivers.—Again, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,<note n="t" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. iii. 6.</note> "We command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you withdraw yourſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly, and not after the <hi>tradition</hi> which <hi>he received of</hi> US." This US the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> apply to <hi>their Church,</hi> and urge this text in proof that Chriſtians ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>their traditions;</hi> ſuch as were delivered to them; <hi>not</hi> indeed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but by <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi> ſeveral hundred years after the canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſettled — The ſame Apoſtle charges <hi>Timothy</hi>
               <note n="u" place="bottom">2 Tim. i. 23.</note> to "hold faſt the <hi>form of ſound words</hi> which thou haſt been taught of ME, in faith and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus." By the <hi>form of ſound words</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts underſtand all the <hi>traditionary articles</hi> of faith in their Church, though they are not to be found in the Apoſtle's writings. And inſtead of holding them in <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> they are to be held <hi>without love or mercy</hi> to all ſuch as differ from them.—Once more, the Apoſtle directs <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaying, <note n="x" place="bottom">2 Tim. ii. 2.</note> "The things which thou haſt heard of ME among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithſul men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo." Theſe thing the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016171_0026_0F9BCD1A15C92218"/>
               <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend were committed to <hi>them</hi> ONLY. If ſo, either <hi>Timothy,</hi> or the perſons to whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the things which he heard of the Apoſtle, were miſerably miſtaken in making choice of thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, as <hi>faithful men,</hi> fit to be entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the things taught by the Apoſtle. For the <hi>Romiſh</hi> clergy have abundantly proved themſelves quite unfaithful to the truſt repoſed in them. They have done ſo by with-holding what is truly <hi>apoſtolical;</hi> and by delivering for <hi>apoſtolical,</hi> things that are moſt directly <hi>oppoſite</hi> to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Till the Romaniſts are able to produce ſome better evidence than any that has yet been offered by them, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will find it hard to perſuade themſelves, that <hi>ſeveral articles neceſſary to ſalvation are</hi> NOT <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>T ALL CONTAINED IN THE SCRIPTURES: Much leſs will they be convinced by the evidence adduced by them, that the traditions of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> merit equal reverence with the ſacred Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The other reaſon aſſigned by the Romaniſts, "Why the Scripture <hi>alone</hi> ought not to be the rule of faith," is, "becauſe ſeveral <hi>neceſſary articles</hi> are NOT PLAIN in the Scripture without the <hi>help of tradition.</hi>" In proof of this they alledge the authority of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who hath aſſured us, <note n="y" place="bottom">2 Pet. Iii. 16.</note> "there are ſome things in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s epiſties <hi>hard to he underſtood,</hi> which they that are unlearned and unſtable <hi>wreſt,</hi> as they do alſo the other Scriptures to <hi>their own deſtruction</hi>" From this text the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> conclude, that the <hi>unlearned</hi> part of mankind are in more danger of being hurt by having the Scriptures to read, than by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the uſe of them. Such ſtreſs has been laid upon it by ſome of their writers, that on the authority of this paſſage <hi>alone,</hi> they have determined "the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016171_0027_0F9BCD1AD2107748"/>not to be ſufficiently clear in all points wherein our ſalvation is concerned; but that the miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and miſinterpreting them, may endanger our eternal ſalvation."</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Proteſtants allow that an equal degree of <hi>perſpicuity</hi> does not attend all parts of the ſacred Scriptures; that they contain ſome things of a very <hi>abſtruſe</hi> nature, which after all our care and pains, we ſhall not be able fully to comprehend. They do not, indeed, maintain that the articles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation are treated with an equal degree of plainneſs in every place, where they are mentioned. For it ſufficiently anſwers all the purpoſes of religion, if thoſe things which are handled but <hi>obſcurely</hi> in ſome places, are treated of with <hi>perſpicuity</hi> in others. Neither do they pretend, but that perſons of corrupt and vicious diſpoſitions, who ſtudy the Scriptures under ſuch a biaſs, though they do it with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable attention, may fall into ſome ſundamental errors or miſtakes. Neither do they affirm, that the things neceſſary to ſalvation, are delivered in ſo plain a manner, as to be underſtood without uſing ſuch helps as are neceſſary to underſtand other books and things of equal antiquity. — But Proteſtants do, indeed, maintain that every article of faith and practice, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, is delivered in ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi> a manner in the ſacred Scriptures, that every perſon who ſtudies them with a firm reſolution to yield his aſſent to every doctrine, plainly revealed in them, and to practiſe all the duties they enjoin, will be preſerved from every fatal error, and led into the knowledge of all neceſſary truth: Provided he uſes all the helps which God in his providence affords him, and joins his fervent and perſevering prayer to God for a bleſſing on his endeavours.</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:016171_0028_0F9BCD1B965E7C78"/>
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are fully perſuaded they do not aſcribe this degree of <hi>perſpicuity</hi> to the ſacred Scriptures without ſufficient reaſon. For the moral precepts of Chriſtianity contain every thing of the kind to be found in the writings of the Heathen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> without any of the imperfections that attended them; and they are delivered with ſo much plainneſs as to exclude all doubt, reſpecting the duties incumbent on us. Thoſe doctrines of Chriſtianity, which we are able fully to comprehend, are conſonant to our natural notions of the Deity; and thoſe which are too ſublime to be fully comprehended, appear, as ſar as we are able to apprehend them, worthy of God to reveal. Both one and the other have a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to inculcate holineſs; and by that means to qualiſy mankind for the enjoyment of everlaſting felicity. If the articles of faith and practice, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary to ſalvation, are not <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>intelligibly</hi> revealed in the ſacred Scriptures, mankind have yet to learn the way to everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>Proteſtants are alſo fully perſuaded, that the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity</hi> of the Scriptures in all neceſſary articles, may be fairly argued from the <hi>deſign of God in making a revelation of his will.</hi> From a paſſage already cited it appears, that the expreſs deſign of God in giving the holy Scriptures by divine revelation, was "that the man of God may be <hi>perfect</hi> throughly furniſhed to all good works." Now ſhould it be granted that the Scriptures, conſidered as a rule of faith and practice, are <hi>abſolutely perfect;</hi> yet if this rule be delivered in ſuch dark and intricate terms, as to be unintelligible to the very perſons, for whoſe uſe it was deſigned, it certainly can be <hi>no rule to them.</hi> On ſuch a ſuppoſition, neither their faith, nor their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, could be regulated by it. It cannot be imagined
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016171_0029_0F9BCD1C53CA6BE8"/>that God, who is not only our <hi>Maſter,</hi> but our <hi>kind and compaſſionate Father,</hi> ſhould give us a rule of conduct, incapable of being comprehended. To aſcribe ſuch a conduct to him, would be to ſuppoſe him either incapable of revealing the things that concern our ſalvation in an intelligible manner; or elſe, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in thinking he had revealed them with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient clearneſs, when he had done it in a manner above our comprehenſion. The former ſuppoſition would be a direct impeachment of the power of God, and the latter of his wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> further argue the <hi>perſpicuity</hi> of the Scriptures from the <hi>teſtimony of the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves.</hi> To this purpoſe are the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Deut. xxx. II, 14.</note> "This commandment, ſays he, which I command thee this day, is <hi>not hidden</hi> from thee, neither is it far off. But the word is very high thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayſt do it." The royal Pſalmiſt aſſures us, <note n="b" place="bottom">Pf. xix. 8.</note> that "the ſtatutes of the Lord are <hi>right;</hi> the commandment of the Lord is <hi>pure, enlightening the eyes;</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Pf. cxix. 105.</note> that the word of God was a <hi>lamp</hi> to his feet and a <hi>light</hi> to his path; <note n="d" place="bottom">v. 99.</note> and that through meditating on the divine law, he had more underſtanding than all his <hi>teachers.</hi>" The apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="bottom">2 Epiſt. i. 19.</note> enjoins it on us to "give heed to the word of prophecy, as to a <hi>light ſhining</hi> in a dark place, till the day dawn and the day-ſtar ariſe in our heart." The evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> tells us, <note n="f" place="bottom">Ch. xx. 31.</note> that "his goſpel was written that we might <hi>believe</hi> that Jeſus was the Chriſt; and that believing, we might <hi>have life</hi> through his name." And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affirms <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Tim. iii. 25.</note> that "the holy Scriptures are able to make us <hi>wiſe</hi> unto ſalvation." Now unleſs the Scriptures are <hi>clear</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:016171_0030_0F9BCD1D16863858"/>enough to be underſtood, we cannot be the <hi>wiſer</hi> for them; and unleſs they are ſo, in all <hi>neceſſary points,</hi> they cannot make us wiſe unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>From theſe evidences of the <hi>perſpicuity</hi> of ſacred Scriptures, the preſumption is ſtrong that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> make a falſe inference from the words of St <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſavs <note n="h" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii. 16.</note> that "in the epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> there are ſome things <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> which the unlearned and unſtable <hi>wreſt,</hi> as they do the other Scriptures, to their own deſtruction;" when they conclude from them, that the Scriptures are <hi>not ſufficiently clear</hi> in all points, wherein our ſalvation is concerned; but that "the miſunderſtanding and miſinterpreting them, may endanger our eternal ſalvation." And that they have actually made a falſe inference, will appear from an attentive conſideration of the paſſage itſelf. For,</p>
            <p>The very thing which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> bring this text to <hi>diſprove,</hi> is evidently implied in the words of the Apoſtle. It is only <hi>ſome things</hi> in the epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> and in the other Scriptures, that are <hi>hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</hi> The <hi>other things,</hi> therefore, are <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.</hi> There is no danger of miſunderſtanding them; provided they are ſtudied with care and attention, together with a ſixed determination to <hi>do,</hi> as well as to <hi>know the will of God.</hi> There is not the leaſt occaſion of keeping the Scriptures from the common people; for the Apoſtle allowed the free uſe of them to the <hi>unlearned</hi> otherwiſe they could not have <hi>wreſted</hi> them.—Further,</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are called <hi>unlearned</hi> and <hi>unſtable</hi> by the Apoſtle, were not ſuch as are called ſo by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in this controverſy. They were not ſuch perſons as, in modern times, are eſteemed <hi>unlearned;</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:016171_0031_0F9BCD1DD5193EC0"/>namely, perſons unacquainted with the liberal arts and ſciences: But they were ſuch as had not learned the <hi>fundamental points of religion,</hi> and were unſettled in the <hi>principles of Chriſtianity.</hi> They were perſons of the ſame character with thoſe whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares <note n="i" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 14.</note> to "children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine." Such unſtable perſons may eaſily be ſuppoſed capable of <hi>miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> and even of <hi>wreſting</hi> the Scriptures to <hi>their own deſtruction;</hi> notwithſtanding that every article, neceſſary to ſalvation, is delivered with all needful plainneſs. To apply the words, therefore, to the <hi>illiterate part of mankind in general,</hi> and not to thoſe who are unlearned and unſettled in the principles of Chriſtianity, is a ſhameful perverſion of them.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of notice, that the Apoſtle does not forbid theſe very men the <hi>uſe of the Scriptures,</hi> or even the reading the things <hi>hard to be underſtood.</hi> Their deſtruction was not owing to their reading them, but was wholly occaſioned by their <hi>wreſting</hi> and <hi>abuſing them.</hi> Now, ſince the Apoſtle does not order the Scriptures to be kept from perſons, who ſo groſsly abuſed them, we may ſafely conclude that he never intended they ſhould be kept from the <hi>common people in general;</hi> merely becauſe ſome perſons in every age might probably abuſe them, as the <hi>unſtable</hi> then did. The true inference to be drawn from this text is directly contrary to the concluſion of the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> Inſtead of denving the common people the free uſe of the Scriptures, they ought rather to be exhorted to ſtudy them with the greater care, diligence and humility; leſt they ſhould be left to pervert them to their own deſtruction, as the unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable did in the days of the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:016171_0032_0F9BCD1E91CF5F38"/>
It may be obſerved further, that the things which the Apoſtle ſays are <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> and which were <hi>wreſted</hi> by ſome to their deſtruction, are things, of which Chriſtians may in ſome meaſure be ignorant, without <hi>endangering</hi> their ſalvation. They are not, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> maintain, things <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> which are ſpoken of, either with reſpect to <hi>Paul</hi>'s epiſtles, or to the other Scriptures. <hi>Peter</hi> had been treating, in the context, of the <hi>new heavens</hi> and the <hi>new earth,</hi> and of the <hi>diſſolution of the world</hi> at the ſecond viſible coming of Chriſt. Concerning theſe ſubjects, which are alſo treated of in the other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there are ſeveral things confeſſedly <hi>hard to be underſtood.</hi> But then, it is not neceſſary, that the humble, believing Chriſtian ſhould fully underſtand them, in order to this being ſaved at Chriſt's ſecond appearance. A general expectation of thoſe things, where there cannot be a full comprehenſion of them, will ſo influence the heart and life of a pious Chriſtian, that he will be found of his Judge in peace.</p>
            <p>Further, there being ſome things in the Scriptures <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> ought not to be made an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt their perſpicuity and utility. Some ſubjects, in their own nature, are more difficult than others; and require more ſtudy and attention to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them. Notwithſtanding ſuch ſubjects are handled with juſtneſs and propriety, and with as much perſpicuity as they will admit, yet to haſty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate perſons there may be ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, hard to be underſtood. This is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe with the moſt judicious and accurate compoſitions. But then it muſt be remembered, that the oftener and the more carefully ſuch compoſitions are read, the better will they be underſtood, and the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016171_0033_0F9BCD1F53ECA1B8"/>more will they be admired. And this is a glory that does, by way of eminence, belong to the ſacred Scriptures.</p>
            <p>It is alſo worthy our obſervation, that the difficult paſſages of Scripture which have been abuſed by ſome, have had a very good effect on others, even in the lower claſſes of life. By endeavouring to attain a competent knowledge of ſuch paſſages, they have been led into a more thorough acquaintance with the Scriptures in general; and have had their lives ſuitably influenced by the important truths contained in them. Since theſe have been the happy effects of ſtudying the <hi>abſtruſe</hi> parts of Scripture, we may ſafely abide by the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> doctrine, that THE SCRIPTURES ARE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR AND PERSPICUOUS IN ALL POINTS THAT IMMEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATELY CONCERN OUR ETERNAL SALVATION.</p>
            <p>Were the tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> reſpecting tradition, merely the private ſentiments of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative men in that church, they would not have deſerved the notice we have taken of them. But when they are conſidered as the chief ſupports of that amazing ſabrick of worldly policy, which the Pope and his clergy have reared upon the foundation of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, they cannot undergo too ſtrict an examination. <hi>Tradition,</hi> or <hi>traditive</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of Scripture, lie as the foundation of all the diſtinguiſhing tenets of <hi>Popery.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> finding that, in many inſtances, ſhe failed of plain ſcriptural evidence to prove her avowed articles of faith and to juſtify the practices ſhe had adopted, has diſcovered her worldly wiſdom, by declaring <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> to be of equal authority with the Scriptures. However, by doing ſo, ſhe has admitted to her
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016171_0034_0F9BCD2014EF7770"/>boſom, doctrines and precepts, ſubverſive of thoſe inculcated by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. By means of her traditions, ſhe has made the commandment of God of none effect.</p>
            <p>In the bull of <hi>Pope</hi> PIUS IV. bearing date at <hi>Rome.</hi> A.D. 1564. printed with the acts of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> a FORM OF FAITH is drawn up, which was extracted from the decrees of that Council. This form of faith, every one, who enters into holy orders, is bound by ſolemn oath not only to believe, but to maintain and defend, and teach the people under his charge; and that under pain of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of Almighty God, and his holy Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> This <hi>creed</hi> is the ſtandard of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Popery,</hi> and the laſt twelve articles of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the distinguiſhing tenets of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. Theſe I ſhall now rehearſe: For the rehearſal of them, without any commentary, will be ſufficient to juſtify the charge we bring againſt that church, of making the commandments of God of none effect by her traditions. The articles are as follows.</p>
            <p>"Article XIII. I moſt firmly admit and embrace apoſtolical and eccleſiaſtical traditions, and all other obſervations and conſtitutions of the ſame church.</p>
            <p>XIV. I do admit the holy Scriptures in the ſame ſenſe that holy mother-church doth, whoſe buſineſs it is to judge of the true ſenſe and interpretation of them; and I will interpret them according to the unanimous conſent of the fathers.</p>
            <p>XV. I do profeſs and believe that there are ſeven ſacraments of the new law truly and properly ſo called, inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſalvation of mankind, though not all of them to every one, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, Confirmation,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016171_0035_0F9BCD20D7A59E90"/>Euchariſst, Penance, Extreme Unction, Orders, Marriage; and that they do confer grace; and that of theſse, Baptiſm, Conſirmation and Orders, may not be repeated without ſacrilege. I do alſo receive and admit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and approved rites of the catholic church in her ſolemn adminiſtration of the aboveſaid ſacraments.</p>
            <p>XVI I do embrace and receive all and every thing that hath been defined and declared by the holy Council of <hi>Trent</hi> concerning original ſin and juſtication.</p>
            <p>XVII. I do alſo profeſs, that in the Maſs there is offered unto God a true, proper, and propitiatory ſacrifice for the quick and the dead, and that in the moſt holy ſacrament of the Euchariſt there is truly, really, and ſubſtantially the body and blood, together with the ſoul and divinity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that there is a converſion made of the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread into the body, and of the whole ſubſtance of the wine into the blood; which converſion the catholic church calls TRANSUBSTANTIATION.</p>
            <p>XVIII. I conſeſs that under one kind only, whole and entire Chriſst, and a true ſacrament, is taken and received.</p>
            <p>XIX. I do firmly believe that there is a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and that the ſouls, kept priſoners there, do receive help by the ſuffrages of the faithful.</p>
            <p>XX. I do likewiſe believe, that the Saints reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together with Chriſst, are to be worſhipped and prayed unto; and that they do offer prayers unto God for us; and that their reliques are to be had in veneration.</p>
            <p>XXI. I do moſst firmly aſſert, that the Images of Chriſst, of the bleſſed Virgin, the Mother of God; and of other Saints, ought to be had and retained; and that due honour and veneration ought to be given to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:016171_0036_0F9BCD219DB52210"/>
XXII. I do affirm, that the power of Indulgences was leſt by Chriſst in the Church; and that the uſe of them is very beneficial to chriſtian people.</p>
            <p>XXIII. I do acknowledge the holy, catholic, and apoſtolic <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to be the Mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches; and I do promiſe and ſwear true obedience to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſucceſſor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles and Vicar of Jeſus Chiſt.</p>
            <p>XXIV. I do undoubtedly receive and profeſs <hi>all other things,</hi> which have been delivered, defined and declared by the ſacred Canons and oecumenical Councils, and eſpecially by the holy Synod of <hi>Trent;</hi> and all things contrary thereunto, and all hereſies condemned rejected and anathematiſed by the Church, I do likewiſe condemn, reject and anathematiſe."</p>
            <p>Including theſe articles, there are above 100 points of doctrine laid down by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> of which no traces can be found in the Scriptures. To be conſiſtent with itſelf, the Council hath denounced an <hi>anathema</hi> upon all ſuch as do not believe them. To point out the repugnancy of the aforementioned articles to the ſacred Scriptures, would exceed the limits aſſigned to this diſcourſe. It muſt, therefore, be left for the employment of ſome future lecturers.</p>
            <p>The preſent diſcourſe cannot be cloſed better, than by reciting a memorable paſſage from <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s proof that <hi>Proteſtants are no hereticks. Chillingworth,</hi> who had been <hi>converted</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> by STUDYING THE SCRIPTURES, addreſſing himſelf to a writer of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, does, in this ſummary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, plead the Proteſtant cauſe.</p>
            <p>"Know then, Sir, that when I ſay the religion of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is in prudence to be preſerred before <hi>yours;</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:016171_0037_0F9BCD2405D4A148"/>as on the one ſide I do not underſtand by your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> or any other private man amongſt you, nor the doctrine of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> or of the Jeſuits, or of the <hi>Dominicans.</hi> or of any other particular company among you; but that wherein you all agree, or proteſs to agree, <hi>the doctrine of</hi> the Council of <hi>Frent:</hi> So accordingly on the other ſide, by the <hi>religion</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> I do not underſtand the doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Melancton,</hi> nor the confeſſion of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> nor the articles of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> no nor the harmony of Proteſtant confeſſions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all ſubſcribe with greater harmony, as a <hi>perfect rule</hi> of their faith and actions, that is the BIBLE.</p>
            <p>"The BIBLE, I ſay, the BIBLE <hi>only,</hi> is the religion of Proteſtants, whatſoever elſe they believe beſides it: And the plain, irrefragable, and indiſputable <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> of it, well may they hold as matter of <hi>opinion;</hi> but as matter of faith and religion, neither can they with coherence to their own grounds believe it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor require the belief of it of others, without moſt high and ſchiſmatical preſumption. I for my part, after a long, and (as I verily believe and hope) impartial ſearch of the <hi>true way</hi> to <hi>eternal happineſs.</hi> do profeſs plainly that I cannot find any reſt for the ſole of my foot, but upon this rock only.</p>
            <p>"I plainly ſee, and with mine own eyes, that there are Popes againſt Popes, Councils againſt Councils, ſome Fathers againſt others, the ſame Fathers againſt themſelves, a conſent of Fathers of one age againſt a conſent of Fathers of another age, the Church of one age againſt the Church of another age: Traditive interpretations of Scripture are pretended, but there
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:016171_0038_0F9BCD251BCA5970"/>are few, or none to be found: No tradition but only of the Scripture, can derive itſelf from the fountain, but may be plainly proved to be brought in, in ſuch an age after Chriſt, or that ſuch an age it was not in. In a word, there is no ſufficient <hi>certainty</hi> but of SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE <hi>only,</hi> for any conſidering man to build upon. <hi>This</hi> therefore, and <hi>this only,</hi> I have reaſon to believe: <hi>This</hi> I will profeſs, according to <hi>this</hi> I will live, and for <hi>this,</hi> it there be occaſion, I will not only willingly, but even gladly, loſe my life, though I ſhould be ſorry that Chriſtians ſhould take it from me.</p>
            <p>"Propoſe me any thing out of this book, and require whether I believe it or no, and ſeem it never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to human reaſon, I will ſubſcribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no demonſtration can be ſtronger than this, GOD HATH SAID SO, THEREFORE IT IS TRUE. In other things, I will take no man's liberty of judging from him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any man take mine from me. I will think no man the worſe <hi>man.</hi> nor the worſe <hi>chriſtian,</hi> I will love no man <hi>the leſs,</hi> for differing in opinion from me. And what meaſure I mete to others, I expect from them again. I am fully aſſured that God <hi>does</hi> not, and therefore men <hi>ought</hi> not to require any more of any man than this, <hi>to believe the Scripture to be God's word, to endeavour to ſind out the true ſenſe of it, and to live according to it.</hi>"</p>
            <p>That all, who receive their education in this place, may do ſo, God of his infinite mercy grant, through Jeſus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
