            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> wrote, had us'd Money as Indians do Wampum, it ſerv'd them for buying and ſelling, and they conſider'd it no farther. Among other Things, he remarks, That,
<q>Suppoſing any Iſland, ſeparate from the reſt of Mankind, whatever is their Money, if they have but a certain Quantity, and can get no more, it will be a <hi>ſteady ſtanding Meaſure of the Value of all other Things</hi>; but this, he ſays, is a Suppoſition that is not like to be found in the Practice of Mankind, ſince Navigation and Commerce have brought all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries acquainted with one another, and introduced the Uſe of Gold and Silver Money into all trading Parts of the World; and it ſerves rather to give Light into the Nature of Money, than to teach a new Meaſure of Traffick.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the great Truth of this Obſervation, the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> about forty Years ago, projected a Sort of Money,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006292_0003_102853A26CE3C688"/>
conſiſting of Publick Bills of Credit, and differing from the Money of all the reſt of the World. They argued juſtly enough, that theſe Bills have ſeveral of the moſt eſſential Properties of Money. They are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; or, in Caſe of Decay, others may eaſily be provided to ſupply their Place. They are of light and eaſy Carriage. They are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be counterfeited as Silver or Gold: And they may be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Quantity to the Trade and Circumſtances of the People. But then their Value is confin'd to the Governments of <hi>New England,</hi> which Experience has ſhewn them, cannot be preſerved, whilſt they have Commerce with the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p>It was in the Year 1690, that the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> iſſued the firſt Publick Bills of Credit that were known in <hi>New-England</hi>: For upon the Return of the Forces from an unfortunate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> there was a Demand for a larger Sum of Money than it was poſſible for the Government immediately to raiſe. The Court laid a Tax equal to the Demand, and iſſued Bills of Credit, with which they paid the Publick Debt, and promis'd to receive thoſe Bills; and by a ſubſequent Vote or Reſolve, allow'd 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> on them in diſcharge of the Tax.</p>
            <p>The Thing was new, and many of the Soldiers who received the Bills were forc'd to part with them at a Diſcount of 30 or 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to ſupply their immediate Neceſſities; but before the Tax was paid, the Bills were valued equal to Money, or rather above it. This Emiſſion was drawn in and finiſh'd without any bad Influence upon the whole Currency.</p>
            <p>In Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s War, the Government again iſſued a Sum in Bills annually, which not being very conſiderable, and the Bills having a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Treaſury to Silver, kept up their Credit until about the Year 1711, when ſuch large Sums were iſſued, that Silver began to be hoarded by ſome, and exported by others, in large Quantities, and the Bills became the only Meaſure and Inſtrument by which all private Trade and Dealing were regulated and managed. And to confirm the Currency of the Bills, and effectually to baniſh Silver and Gold, the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Province, in the Year 1712, made their Bills a Tender in Diſcharge of all Debts, unleſs there appeared a ſpecial Agreement or Contract other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus there being a ſomewhat greater Scarcity of Silver than common, a general Opinion prevail'd, that the Currency of the Country might be enlarg'd by iſſuing Paper; but like the Dog in the Fable, while they catch'd at the Shadow, they let go the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006292_0004_102853A588A804C8"/>In the Year 1714, the Silver being gone, and the whole Sum in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> then extant being leſs than was neceſſary to carry on the Trade, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were drove to great Straits, and a Project was ſet on Foot for a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bank of Bills of Credit: To divert which, and ſatisfy the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, the Government iſſued £ 50,000, being then equal to Silver at about 10ſ per Ounce, and lent to ſuch Perſons as ſhould give Security <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

The whole Scheme of this Loan ſeems to have been taken from a chimerical Projection for a Land-Bank, printed in <hi>London</hi> in the Year 1684, and re-printed at <hi>Boſton</hi> about this Time. In 1716, a Loan of £ 100,000 was iſſued: A few Years after, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> of £ 50,000; and then one of £ 60,000; the Bills of each being of the ſame Tenor. None of the Loans were paid at the Periods promis'd, and the Borrowers were indulg'd one Year after another, and ſeveral of them are not yet cloſed, though the Sum outſtanding is now inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. When a Tax has been engag'd as a Security to the Bills, by the Government, it never, but in one Inſtance, has been poſtpon'd; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in 1705, which in Effect is putting off the firſt Sum 'till then, and they continued this Practice from Year to Year <note n="*" place="bottom">Here was a fatal Error. Had the Government made a Tax every Year for ſuch Sum as they iſſued, given the Premium of 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to ſuch as paid Bills, diſtinguiſh'd the Bills of each Year, and ſuffer'd no other to anſwer the Tax of that Year, and allow'd thoſe Inhabitants that did not pay Bills to pay Silver, (of which there was then ſufficient) and ſo finiſh'd one Sett of Bills every Year, moſt of the Miſchiefs that attend a Paper Currency would have been prevented. Indeed it's probable, ſuch Bills would have been hoarded, and never ſerv'd as a Medium, but the Government would have obtain'd a Year's Credit, which was the Thing firſt aim'd at.</note>. In the Year 1736, the Bills were ſo depreciated, that 26 of 27ſ was equal to no more than one Ounce of Silver. All the Bills that were then extant were to be drawn in by the Year 1741. A new Sort of Bills were then iſſued for the Government
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006292_0005_102853AB48F620E0"/>
Charges, one of which was to be equal to three of the Old, in publick and private Payments, and the Poſſeſſor was promis'd an Ounce of Silver for every 6ſ8 of the New; and the ſame Promiſe ſeems imply'd for every 20ſ of the Old, to be paid in the Year 1742. And it was propos'd the Silver ſhould be rais'd in this Manner: Whenever Bills of the new Form were iſſued, a Tax was actually laid equal to the Sum iſſued, on ſome Year before 1742, and without any further Act of the Court, muſt have been levy'd in ſuch Year. This Tax was payable in Bills, or in Silver at 6ſ8 the Ounce: If it was all paid in Bills, there could be no Demand on the Treaſury: If any were left out, ſomebody muſt have paid in Silver ſufficient to exchange them. Thus there ſeem'd to be full Proviſion for enabling the Government to keep their Promiſe. But here was the Leak. By the Acts of Government iſſuing the Bills of the old Form, it was engaged, that the whole of them ſhould be drawn in before the Year 1742, a certain Sum each Year; but it was left to the Aſſemblies of each Year to apportion this Tax upon the Towns: So that a further Act of the whole Legiſlature was found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. When the Year 1741 came, the Houſe of Repreſentatives were ſenſible that an extreme Difficulty would be brought upon the People, by finiſhing the whole Bills in this Manner, when there was no Silver and Gold in the Country, to ſerve as a Currency, in the room of them; and when the late Governour, Mr. <hi>Belcher,</hi> inſiſted upon their apportioning the Tax of that Year, they refus'd to do it, on failure of which, the whole Scheme for paying off the new Bills muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. And indeed there was ſo little Expectation of the Bills being paid off in 1742, at 6ſ8, that in 1741, 9ſ of them would not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe an Ounce of Silver. In the ſame Year the preſent Governour came to the Chair, and found the Currency of the Country thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed; and the firſt Aſſembly he met, refus'd to apportion the Tax, after he had recommended it to them. This Refuſal as effectually deſtroy'd the Security of the Bills, as any Act of Government could have done, and the beſt Terms the Houſe of Repreſentatives could be brought to were, to carry the Tax of 1741, part of it to the Year 1742, and the remainder to 1743; and they provided by a Clauſe in the Act, that if the Aſſemblies of thoſe Years ſhould not agree upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning the Tax, the Treaſurer ſhould iſſue his Warrants agreable to the Apportionment in the laſt Tax Act. At the ſame Time Bills for the future Charges of Government were iſſued, of a new Form, payable in Silver at 6ſ8 the Ounce in 1746; one of theſe Bills to be equal to four of the firſt Form (Silver being now about 28ſ per Ounce in the old Bills,) and full Proviſion was alſo made for bringing in theſe new Bills in one or other of the Years before 1746, or Silver in lieu of them: So that now it was not in the Power of any Thing ſhort of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006292_0006_10282DC7A91384A8"/>
three Branches of the Legiſlature, to prevent all the Paper Currency extant being bro't in by the Year 1746. And to ſatisfy the Poſſeſſor of the Bills engag'd to be redeem'd in 1742, they were made equal to the new Bills in publick and private Payments, and a Tax was granted for ſuch Sum as the former Taxes were rendred deficient by Means of raiſing the Value of theſe Bills. This gave every Poſſeſſor of thoſe Bills, when were commonly called the Middle Tenor Bills, a great deal more than the Bill coſt him, tho' the Government neither did nor could comply with their Promiſe in Form. Before the Governour conſented to the afore-mentioned Act, he inſiſted, in a Speech made to the Court, upon their coming into ſome Meaſures for ſecuring the Value of private Debts, in Caſe the Bills ſhould depreciate; upon which another Act was agreed on and paſs'd, the Deſign of which was, That although Bills were the only Inſtrument in all Trade and Dealing, yet that Silver at 6ſ8 the Ounce ſhould be the Meaſure. And the Bills then and after to be emitted for five Years, were declared equal to Silver at that Rate: And in Caſe the Bills ſhould depreciate, compared with Silver and Exchange to <hi>London,</hi> an Addition ſhould be made on all Debts and Contracts equal to the Depreciation; and the current Rate of Silver and Exchange, was to be determined every ſix Months, either by the General Court, or by ſeven Councellors, or by a Committee appointed by the Judges of the Superior Court. This has been commonly called, the Equity Act; and it was generally thought, would prevent the great Miſchiefs of a Paper Currency, but yet it has prov'd of little or no Service. For</p>
            <p>As to the firſt Part of the Act, People were ſoon convinced that to make one Thing the ſole Meaſure, and another the ſole Inſtrument of Trade, was impoſſible. And all Perſons continued to keep their Books, and make their Agreements for Bills, as much as if the Act never paſs'd. And the Allowance for Depreciation run us into great Confuſion: The Merchant ſeldom or ever demanded it, for it would have been almoſt impoſſible in a running Account to have ſettled it; and beſides, he would have miſs'd the Sale of his Goods by inſiſting on it, and the Practice of it in any one Caſe, and not generally, prov'd very unequal. Indeed it ſoon appear'd, that the ſtrict Obſervance of the Rule would produce great Injuſtice. Silver and Exchange might riſe 10 or 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> but it was ſeveral Months before this had a general Influence on Trade even in the Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and longer in other Parts of the Province, and ſome Years before it had it's Effect on the Landed Eſtate of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. It was then thought, if Proviſions were taken in with Silver as the Standard, it might be a good Addition to the former Law, and an Act paſs'd accordingly, but the Price of Proviſions being govern'd by the Plenty or Scarcity of them, and a ſcarce Year following immediately upon this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006292_0007_102853B188181908"/>
Alteration of the Rule, made the Obſervance of it more difficult than before.</p>
            <p>Upon the breaking out of the French and Indian War, all Hopes of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Period to the Paper Currency vaniſh'd; for the Defence of the four Governments of <hi>New-England,</hi> lays in a manner, tho' very unreaſonably, upon the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Province, and ſuch large Sums were neceſſary for carrying on the War, eſpecially for the Charge of the ſucceſsful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt <hi>Cap Breton,</hi> that the Taxes for drawing in the Bills iſſued for thoſe Charges were greater than it was poſſible for the People to pay before 1746; and ſo the Funds for the future Emiſſions were neceſſarily laid upon more diſtant Years. The Bills being thus multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſunk in their Value faſter than uſual; ſo that 56 or 58ſ now will purchaſe no more Silver than 30ſ would do five or ſix Years ago.</p>
            <p>I have omitted a great many Circumſtances relating to theſe Bills, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning only to give a general Idea of the Nature and Operation of them.</p>
            <p>The other Governments of <hi>New-England</hi> ſoon went into the ſame Practice of iſſuing Bills, after the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> had ſhewn them the Way; and the Bills of each Government, by common Conſent, obtain'd a Currency through the Whole.</p>
            <p>The great Miſchiefs and infinite Injuſtice ariſing from a depreciating Currency, which it is impoſſible to prevent or redreſs, are ſo glaring, and our Ears have been ſo fill'd with the Complaints and Cries of thoſe who have been moſt ſenſibly affected, that there is no need of ſpending any Time in deſcribing or enumerating them.</p>
            <p>During the Currency of theſe Bills, a Variety of Propoſals have been publiſhed for retrieving their Credit, and for furniſhing a ſtable Paper Currency, but all to no Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>No Sort of Bills but ſuch as are payable on Demand, can have an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>able Value; and in this Caſe there muſt be a Depoſit, and it is as eaſy to provide Silver to ſerve for a Medium, as for a Deposit, and it is as likely to ſtay in the Country in one Caſe as in the other.</p>
            <p>Bills that are payable at a diſtant Day, will be eſteem'd according to the Time of Payment, and from their being iſſued, will gradually riſe in their Value, which will produce the ſame Injuſtice as a gradual Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; for whether the Creditor receives leſs or the Debtor pays more than the Contract, the Injury is the ſame; ſomebody is defrauded: But then, the Riſe would be more intolerable than the Fall. The Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors are few in Number compar'd with the Debtors, the one generally envy'd, the other pity'd. The Injury and Complaint of the Creditors have been too much diſregarded; but turn the Tables, and oppreſs the numerous Debtors, and they will not long remain quiet.</p>
            <p>I think therefore we may reſt ſatisfy'd, no ſtable Currency can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, other than that of Silver and Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006292_0008_102853B33656EF38"/>And here I expect to be aſk'd: Why may not <hi>New-England</hi> have a Currency of Bills of Credit, as well as <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Pennſilvania</hi>? I anſwer. At <hi>New York,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> Silver is their Medium, and mill'd Dollars paſs current at a known determinate Rate, and other foreign Coins in proportion: Paper Bills are ſometimes the Inſtrument in Payments, but the Proportion is ſmall compar'd with the Silver; and I have no Doubt that if either of thoſe Governments ſhould ever iſſue a ſufficient Sum in Bills to ſerve for a Currency, their Silver and Gold would leave them, and their Bills depreciate as thoſe of <hi>New-England</hi> have done; which, as has been obſerved, kept their Value while Silver continued current with them.</p>
            <p>The General Court of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> ſeem at length fully convinc'd of the Neceſſity of deſtroying the Paper Currency; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Sum granted by Parliament to reimburſe the Expence of the <hi>Cap-Breton</hi> Expedition, they have paſs'd an Act of Aſſembly for tranſporting the ſame in foreign Coin, and exchanging it for their Bills by the laſt of <hi>March</hi> 1750, at the Rate of a mill'd Dollar for 45ſ Currency; and have determin'd, that after that Time, all Contracts ſhall be in Silver at the Rate of 6ſ a Dollar, which is agreable to the Rate eſtabliſh'd by Act of Parliament, and that all paſt Contracts ſhall be diſcharg'd by a Dollar for 45ſ, and they have prohibited the Currency of the Bills of the other Governments after the Redemption of their own Bills.</p>
            <p>But this Act, notwithſtanding all the Calamities brought upon the Province by Paper Money, is not univerſally approv'd of.</p>
            <p>One would think, that with a People making a high Profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there ſhould need no other Argument to reconcile them to the Act than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Truth and Juſtice, after having been baniſh'd near forty Years, are in a fair Way to return again. Remove the Caſe and the Effect will ceaſe. In this Caſe no imaginary or expected Difi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that may attend the Trade of the Province, ought to have any Weight.</p>
            <p>However, we will conſider the ſeveral Exceptions that are made to the Act, and ſee what Force they have.</p>
            <p>The principal Objection with a greater Number than publickly care to own it, is this; That whenever the Bills are redeemed, the Poſſeſſor ought to be paid as much as they would purchaſe in Silver at the Time they were iſſued, which might be a Recompence for what he has ſuffered by the Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. Here ſeems to be an unwarrantable Deſire of perſonal Advantage at the Expence of the Publick. There has been ſuch a Confounding of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty that it is abſolutely impoſſible to remedy what is paſt. All Attempts have rather increas'd the Evil. Beſides, how unreaſonable would it be, when the Courſe of Exchange for a Year or two paſt has been at 900 <hi>per Cent.</hi> advance from Sterling, and almoſt Nineteen in Twenty of the preſent Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, have receiv'd the Bills at that depreciated Rate, they ſhould now be paid
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006292_0009_102853B62118F238"/>
double, or more, what they gave for them. But we are told, the Bills promiſe a certain Sum, and it behoves the Government to pay off their Bills according to their Promiſe, as much as it does a private Perſon.</p>
            <p>Promiſes made by private Perſons, the Performance whereof will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great and extenſive Injuſtice, may and ought to be diſpenſed with. I acknowledge, it behoved the Government, by all Ways and Means poſſible, after they had iſſued their Bills, to ſupport the Credit of them, and great Injuſtice ariſes by their Failure; but now it is produc'd, as the Caſe with theſe Bills is circumſtanced, there is no Remedy. The Bills have been ſinking in the Poſſeſſors Hands ever ſince they were iſſued, and every one who had been a Poſſeſſor ought to have his Part of the Loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> made up to him, and not the Poſſeſſor of the preſent Day run away with the Whole. But at firſt Glance it appears impoſſible to ſettle what every Man's Proportion ſhall be. Beſides, it may be conſidered in this Light. Whatever Sum is outſtanding in Bills, juſt ſo much is due from the Inhabitants to the Government; and whatever the Bills ſink in their Value, juſt ſo much leſs, really, the Inhabitants have to pay, than they would have, if the Bills kept their Value; and if they ſunk in every Man's Hands in Proportion to his Part of the Tax, he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of no Injuſtice, which all ariſes from Perſons being unequally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſ'd, tho' in what Proportion can never be aſcertain'd. Let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then the Value of the Bills could be rais'd again, this would advance the Value of the Debt to the Government, and as great Inequality and Injuſtice will be occaſioned by their riſing as was by their falling; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they are continually paſſing from one to another, the ſame Perſons will not be poſſeſs'd of them, in the ſame Proportion, when they riſe, as when they fell.—It is ſaid, the Parliament, in King WILLIAM's Reign, when the clipp'd Money was call'd in, receiv'd it as if it had been of full Weight, and voted a large Sum for the Deficiency occaſioned thereby. It is very true: But it was owing to the Neceſſity of the Times, which requir'd an immediate Stop to be put to the Currency of the clipp'd Money, which could be effected in no other Way: And it has always been allow'd, that Two Millions was given to the Poſſeſſors of that ſort of Money, more than in Equity they could claim.</p>
            <p>Another Exception to the Act is, That it is in vain to think of a Silver Currency, while the Balance of Trade is againſt us; for the Silver will be immediately ſhip'd off, and the Bills being deſtroy'd, we ſhall be without a Medium. By the Balance being againſt us, is, no Doubt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that we import more than we are able, by our Exports of every Kind, to pay for. Indeed there is no making ſo certain a Judgment of the Truth of this from Time to Time, with a Paper Currency, as with a Silver; which ordinarily would be more plenty or ſcarce, according as the Balance was for or againſt us. But I think it plainly appears, there is the bad Influence of the Paper Currency upon our Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006292_0010_102853B7AD917760"/>
               <hi>now</hi> the Profit ariſing to the Merchant, upon moſt Branches of our Trade, is from the Goods imported; whereas, <hi>when Silver was current,</hi> all Commodities for Exportation to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Southern Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on the Continent, and the foreign Ports in <hi>Europe,</hi> were purchas'd at ſuch Rates here, that they would bear an Advance when they came to Market; and the Profit of the Adventure lay in that Advance, more than in the Goods imported in Return, and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Goods were frequently ſo low here, that they made an advantageous Return to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Nay, even in our Trade to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> although the Profit of that conſiſted principally in the Advance on the Goods imported hither, yet a Man but of a middling Judgment in Trade, could ordinarily find a better Way of making Returns than ſhipping Silver from hence: Now it is moſt natural to ſuppoſe, that when we change our Currency, altho' a great Proportion of the Silver may at firſt be exported, to ſatisfy the Debts due to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and perhaps to import more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods; and we may be greatly ſtraitned from the Scantineſs of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, yet in a ſhort Time it will reſtore the Trade to the State it was in before the Paper Currency commenc'd; for a Man of but ſmall Acquaintance with Trade, before he parts with his Silver will conſider, whether the Price demanded for any Commodity for Exportation, is ſo reaſonable as that he has as good a Chance of Advantage by ſhipping the Commodity as the Silver, the Conſequence of which will be, not that he muſt ſhip his Silver becauſe he can't have the Commodity at a reaſonable Price, but it will come down to ſuch a Rate as that he can better afford to ſhip it than the Silver; and there is no Room to ſuppoſe the contrary, unleſs we could imagine that all the Produce of the Country, of every kind, is not ſufficient to pay what is abſolutely neceſſary for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; which Suppoſition is without the leaſt Foundation. If we have ſpent more than we have earnt while our Paper Currency la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed (for there is no Country under Heaven where People who have no Eſtates live ſo luxuriouſly as they do here) it will be one good Effect of the new Currency, that it will make us better Huſbands. But then I may perhaps be told, if the Conſequence of this new Currency will be the Lowering the Commodities of the Country, ſo far it will be a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Not at all: For thoſe Things imported, and which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the Buſineſs and Expences of the Inhabitants, will be cheap in Proportion. If a Trader has a reaſonable Profit or Advance on the Thing exported, he will have none on what he returns in lieu of it. No Doubt, in the general Scramble that we have had for Twenty Years paſt, when the Conteſt has been, who ſhould raiſe the Price of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006292_0011_102853BA736B77A8"/>
a little while all Things will return to the Standard, and bear a juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion one to another.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Perſons, I acknowledge, who have made a diſhoneſt Gain by a depreciating Currency, muſt be content, if they can reſt ſo, with what is paſt, and live honeſtly for the future. Of this Sort, in the Country, have been thoſe who have made a Trade of buying Lands at long Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and then paying for them in Bills when they have depreciated ſo much that perhaps the Value of their Lands has doubled. And, in the Town, may be reckon'd, ſuch Traders and Shopkeepers as have bought large Quantities of Goods on long Credit, and after that greatly exceeded the Credit given, and before Payment has been made the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Bills have ſunk one Half, and their Goods advanc'd in their Shops in Proportion. Now the Diſcouragement of this Trade, inſtead of being any Diſadvantage to us, will be extremely for our Benefit; for this unjuſt Gain had encouraged great Numbers, with little or no Trading Stock, to leave the Buſineſs they were bred to, and turn Shopkeepers; which has proved of pernicious Conſequence, by leſſening the Number of Artificers and labouring People, and by infecting thoſe that remain with an Itch after living by their Heads rather than their Hands. I would not be underſtood, that all Shopkeepers, eſpecially ſuch as have been bred to the Buſineſs, or have a Stock to begin with, ſhould be diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced. A Number will always be neceſſary for the convenient Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Goods to the Inhabitants in ſmall Parcels; but they have of late increas'd to a ſurprizing Degree, and it looks as if almoſt all liv'd one upon another, and that but a ſmall Proportion was employ'd in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any Thing from the Earth or Sea.</p>
            <p>There has been a further Exception made, which is not againſt the Deſign of the Act, but the Sufficiency of it to anſwer the Purpoſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. It is ſaid, That notwithſtanding all the Proviſion that is made to the contrary, the Bills of the other Governments will remain current in this Province, and if ſo, the Act can have no good Effect, as to any future Regulation of the Currency.</p>
            <p>It is, I confeſs, a great Unhappineſs, that we are poſſeſs'd of ſo large a Sum in the other Governments Bills, and there is great Danger, That, unleſs the Parliament interpoſe, the Bills will either die in our Hands, or the Continuance of their Currency will prevent the Deſign of the Act. Of the two Evils the firſt is the leaſt; for though it will be a heavy Loſs, we feel it at once, and it's over; the other would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Loſs, and work our Ruin. But there is all imaginable Reaſon to expect the Interpoſition of the Parliament. The Affair of the <hi>New-England</hi> Currencies has formerly been under the Conſideration of the Houſe of Commons. The <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Province have now voluntarily gone into the ſame Meaſures, or perhaps more effectual than any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

And it will be much eaſier now to project a Method for ſinking theſe Bills without Loſs, than it would have been if the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi> Act had never paſs'd. In order to ſhew how it may be effected, we will firſt conſider the State of the Bills of each Government, and then offer ſome Propoſals for putting an End to their Currency, in a Manner the leaſt burthenſome that may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Connecticut</hi> are a wiſe People, and have conducted their publick Affairs with great Prudence, more eſpecially with Reſpect to their Bills of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. They have never run into any extravagant Emiſſions; they have ſhewn a Deſire to preſerve the Credit of thoſe Bills they have iſſued, though without Succeſs; and, if I am not miſinformed, they have very little more outſtanding than their Grant from the Parliament, at the Rate ſet by the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> will redeem: If, therefore, they ſhould refuſe to apply the Grant to this Purpoſe themſelves (which there is no great Danger of) the Way is very plain for the Parliament to do it for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> have about Four Hundred and Fifty Thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd Pounds of the preſent Currency, or, as it is commonly called, old Tenor. Their Grant will not ſink above One Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Pounds, which will leave Three Hundred Thouſand. About One Third was lent to the Inhabitants, in like Manner as the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Loans, only for a longer Term, and the Eſtates of the Borrowers are mortgaged to the Government for Security. The Remainder, except a ſmall Proportion for the Charge of their Government, was iſſued for the <hi>Canada</hi> Expedition, and has no other Fund for drawing it in again, beſides an Expectation of being repaid the Charge of that Expedition by his Majeſty. But after they ſhall have receiv'd what may be allow'd for thoſe Charges, it's probable they may have about One Hundred and Eighty Thouſand Pounds remaining outſtanding.</p>
            <p>

            <p>It is a Queſtion whether <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> have one eighth Part of their Bills current within that Government. <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> has more of theirs, perhaps one third or one half. The reſt of the Bills of both Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are current in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut.</hi> There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Reaſon to expect that <hi>New Hampſhire</hi> or <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> will be anxious about redeeming their Bills. It is their Intereſt to have them depreciate until they become of no Value: The Borrowers will ſo much the eaſier diſcharge their Debts to the Government, and the Inhabitants pay what is due by Taxes. Nay there is great Reaſon to fear that <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> may ſpeedily iſſue more Bills. The Governor and all the Members of the Legiſlature are elected by the People, and it is ſometimes made a Teſt to the Candidates before their Election, that they ſhall declare in Favour of more Paper Money, and this is as likely to be the Caſe at their Election in <hi>May</hi> next, as it has been in Times paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> are able to ſink all their Bills above the Grant, by a Tax, in one Year. <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> have a Sum ſo much greater in Proportion, that it will be extremely difficult, and perhaps impoſſible, for them to do it.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then that by an Act of Parliament, all the Eſtates mortgag'd, or other Securities given to the Governments of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> for paying in the Bills according to the nominal Value, ſhould be made liable for the Payment of a Spaniſh Dollar, or other Silver Coin in Proportion, for every <hi>Forty five Shillings</hi> in Bills of the old Tenor, or every <hi>Eleven Shillings &amp; Three Pence</hi> in Bills of the new Tenor. That thoſe Borrowers who have engag'd to pay the Whole in leſs than Ten Years, ſhould be left to comply with their reſpective Agreements as to the Time of Payment; but where any exceeded Ten Years, they ſhould be held to pay one Tenth annually, their former Agreements notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and that Intereſt of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> ſhould be paid from Time to Time, for all that remain'd unpaid. If any Borrower fail'd of making Payment three Months after it became due, ſo much of the mortgag'd Eſtate, as would make up the Deficiency, to be forthwith ſold, without a Proceſs at Law. And for the Bills that have been iſſued for the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Government, the Aſſembly of each Government to make a Tax for one Tenth part annually, with the Addition of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt in the whole Sum that in each Year remain outſtanding; ſuch Tax to be paid likewiſe in Silver at the Rates aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>When this is done, each Government ſhould be oblig'd to call in all their preſent Currency, and give the Poſſeſſors new Bills (none to be leſs than Five Pounds Proclamation Money) payable in Silver with Intereſt of 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> the Whole in Ten Years, and one Tenth to be diſcharg'd

            <p>The <hi>Governments</hi> would have but a very ſmall Burthen. One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds Sterling a Year, or thereabouts, would be ſufficient for <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi>'s Tax, and <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> would not raiſe ſo much. And</p>
            <p>The <hi>Borrowers</hi> will not pay ſo much as they received; many in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> not half ſo much; and the Whole of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Loan was iſſued when Silver was about 30ſ per Ounce, and they will pay it at above 50ſ.—If it be urg'd, That when they made their Contract, they expected to diſcharge it by Bills of a depreciated Value, and not by Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This was an unjuſt Contract, and therefore ought to be void, or in Force ſo far only as it is equitable. And</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poſſeſſors of the Bills</hi> will have the preſent Value of them; for the Intereſt they will carry will make them as good as if they were payable on Demand.</p>
