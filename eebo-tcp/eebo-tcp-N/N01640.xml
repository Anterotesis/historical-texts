         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:001946_0003_0FFCAF23ADC45EA0"/>than which the Church of GOD is enriched with nothing more Glorious, among all its Incomparable Writings.</p>
            <p>THE Commendations which the Ancients gave of this <hi>Unparallel'd Book,</hi> are as high, as the <hi>Tongue of Men</hi> can carry them; And the Commendations would not be too high, if the <hi>Tongue of Angels,</hi> who poſſeſſed the Writers of this Book, were employ'd for the giving of them. Let <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> alone be called in, to declare unto us the ſenſe of all the reſt! <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who calls this wonderful Book, <hi>The Chriſtian Panoply;</hi> And <hi>Baſil,</hi> who Styles it, <hi>The Common Treaſure of all Good Precepts,</hi> and, <hi>A Compleat Body of Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE PSALMS are in the Hebrew, divided into <hi>Five Books,</hi> like thoſe of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſo they may be called, <hi>A Second Pentateuch.</hi> Yea, They are a ſurprizing <hi>Epitome</hi> of all the Bible; For which cauſe, if we call the Pſalter, <hi>A Little Bible,</hi> we ſhall do no other than what <hi>Luther</hi> did before us. And ſuch are the Excellent Vertues, in the <hi>Leaves</hi> of this <hi>Tree of Life</hi> which our God has granted for the <hi>Healing of the Nations,</hi> that, as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> expreſſes the matter, <hi>To cure Heavineſs, to lay aſide trouble ſome Thoughts and Paſſions, to eaſe us of our Cares, and recreate thoſe who are oppreſſed with any,

            <p>MELANCTHON ſays very truly, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Book of PSALMS, <hi>That it is the moſt elegant work extant in the World.</hi> It has indeed performed what <hi>Plato</hi> wiſh'd for, but what he thought <hi>meer Man</hi> could never come to: <hi>Plato,</hi> who ſaw there was no way of Inſtruction ſo efficacious, as that by <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Songs;</hi> but after all concludes, <hi>This muſt be the work of GOD, or of a Man that ſhall be full of GOD.</hi>

            <p>THERE have been profane, fooliſh, empty Pretenders to Literature, who have had no great Reliſh for the PSALMS of <hi>David.</hi> But with Men who have had a juſt ſenſe, a true guſt of Things, no Writings in the World have been ſo Reliſhed, as theſe matchleſs Gifts of Heaven unto the Children of Men.

§. 2. THEODORET informs us, The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his time, were ſo well acquainted with our PSALMS, that both in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try it was the uſual Employment of all Chriſtians, <hi>To Sing them:</hi> And even they who had little Acquantance, with any other Book of the Sacred Scriptures, yet ſo had the PSALMS by heart, as to recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Singing them in the <hi>Streets,</hi> and in the <hi>Fields,</hi> as well as in their <hi>Houſes.</hi> And Verily, Theſe marvellous Poems, have not by their <hi>Age</hi> loſt any thing of their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or their <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> The Chriſtians in our days, may as well feed and live upon them, and <hi>Eat the Bread of Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Truth is, It was no ill Advice of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> unto his Friend, That he would make the <hi>Pſalter</hi> his <hi>Vade mecum,</hi> his conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and Counſellor on all occaſions. <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Thou wilt find it ſo marvellouſly to anſwer all the occaſions of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that thou wilt commend the prudence of the Ancient <hi>Conſtantinopolitan,</hi> who being driven out of the City, took no part of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures but <hi>This,</hi> which unto him was, <hi>Pro et prae Divitjis,</hi> preferrible to all periſhable Riches.</p>

            </p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Pardon of Sin</hi> is to be implored, the PSALMS will furniſh us, with the moſt <hi>Pathetical Expreſſions</hi> imaginable for that Grand Concern.</p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Graces</hi> of the <hi>New Creature,</hi> and the Diſpoſitions of <hi>Piety</hi> are to be asked for, the PSALMS will not only furniſh us with <hi>Petitions</hi> for theſe <hi>Beſt of Bleſſings,</hi> but inſenſibly draw us in to the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER <hi>Maladies</hi> we find our Minds diſtempered withal, we may repair to the PSALMS as to a <hi>Diſpenſatory</hi> fill'd with the nobleſt <hi>Remedies.</hi>

            <p>WHEN we have our heavy <hi>Afflictions</hi> of many ſorts lying upon us, what can we do better, than repair to the <hi>Songs,</hi> which <hi>GOD our Maker</hi> has <hi>given for the Night,</hi> in the PSALMS which we now have in our hands? We ſhall not <hi>periſh in our Afflictions,</hi> if we take the <hi>Delights</hi> here provided for us.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, If we would be well inſtructed in the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> or be well acquainted with the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of what is to be done in the <hi>Latter Days:</hi> Let the PSALMS be well ſtudied. The trueſt and the higheſt <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is here to be met withal.</p>
            <p>AND if in the Proſecution of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, we add the method of <hi>Singing,</hi> which is the way to be <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> from whence the PSALMS are dictated, Behold, the <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> now put into a Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps there is more Liberty taken here in Tranſlating the <hi>Firſt Verſe</hi> of the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> than almoſt any Verſe in the whole Book beſide. It keeps cloſe to the <hi>Original;</hi> and even when a <hi>word of ſupply</hi> is introduced, it is uſually a needleſs Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the <hi>care of exactneſs,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it at all, as we have done, with an <hi>Italica-Character;</hi> for it is really in the Intention and Emphaſis of the <hi>Original.</hi> Yea, the juſt <hi>Laws of Tranſlation</hi> had not been at all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, if a much greater Liberty had been taken, for the beating out of the Golden and Maſſy <hi>Hebrew</hi> into a more <hi>Extended Engliſh,</hi> For, it may be obſerved, if you Tranſlate a <hi>French Book,</hi> ſuppoſe, into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you turn it into <hi>Engliſh Phraſe,</hi> and make not a <hi>French Engliſh</hi> of it; For, <hi>If fait froid,</hi> for inſtance, you do not ſay, <hi>It makes Cold,</hi> but, <hi>It is Cold,</hi> We have tied our ſelves to <hi>Hebraiſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>BRIEFLY, Upon any <hi>Difference</hi> in this, from the former and common Tranſlation, if the more Learned Reader will pleaſe to Examine the <hi>Original,</hi> there will be no Fear of its being Juſtified.

<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:001946_0012_0FFCAFE60554D670"/>Religious part of Mankind, for having ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a plain, clear, fair ſenſe of many Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which have hitherto been ſo Tranſlated, that People could ſcarce tell how well to underſtand them: In which regard, this very <hi>Tranſlation</hi> alone, without any of the <hi>Notes</hi> that wait upon it, may be eſteemed a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. MOST certainly, our Tranſlation of the PSALMS, without the Fetters of <hi>Rhime</hi> upon it, can be juſtly eſteemed no prejudice to the Character of <hi>Poetry</hi> in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. For indeed, however it is now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, according to the true ſenſe of the Term, to <hi>Rhythme</hi> it ſelf a <hi>Similis Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentia,</hi> or, a <hi>likeneſs of ſound</hi> in the laſt Syllables of the Verſe, is not eſſential. Old <hi>Bede</hi> will give you ſuch a Definition of <hi>Rhythme,</hi> and bring other Authorities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Auſtins</hi> for it, that <hi>Scaliger</hi> thereupon holds, all <hi>Verſes</hi> wherein Regard is had unto the <hi>Number of Syllables,</hi> to have a claim unto it. Be that as the Criticks on the Term ſhall pleaſe, our <hi>Tranſlation</hi> is all in <hi>Metre;</hi> and really more tied unto <hi>Meaſure,</hi> than the <hi>Original</hi> appears to have been, by all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations that have as yet been employ'd upon it. For, however it might be with the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and with the
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:001946_0013_0FFCAFE787466D40"/>Book of <hi>Job,</hi> and of the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Maſter <hi>Alſted</hi> allows me to ſay, That in the PSALMS, <hi>Nullum canticum ſit metricis legibus aſtrictum, ſed mera ſoluta ſit cratio, charactere Poetico animuta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED, that Queſtion, <hi>To what Rules the Poeſy of the</hi> Davidic PSALMS <hi>is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted?</hi> has been as vexed a Problem to our <hi>Modern Criticks,</hi> as moſt that they have med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with. It were endleſs to reckon up the ſeveral <hi>Methods</hi> wherein Learned Men have attempted an Account of the <hi>Hebrew Poeſy. Pfeiffer</hi> in his <hi>Dubia Vexota,</hi> has given us a Collection; Among which, that which <hi>Gomarus,</hi> has lit upon, looks as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable as any: And yet, the Rules invented by that Author, are ſo very lax, that you may according thereunto imagine, a Verſo, in every Line of almoſt any Author in the World. I am therefore ſtrongly of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the <hi>Poeſie</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Hebrews,</hi> knew no <hi>Meaſure,</hi> but that of the unknown <hi>Muſic,</hi> wherein it was to be accommodated. Our PSALMS in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> are not ſo much <hi>Metrical</hi> as <hi>Muſical;</hi> And hence, the very Inſcriptions of them ſometimes inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that there was a ſort of <hi>Melody,</hi> unto which they were adapted. It is true, the <hi>Oriental Nations</hi> at this day, have their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Poetry;</hi> But it is of a late Original.
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:001946_0014_0FFCAF47075712F8"/>However, 'tis very certain, that all the skill in the World, will hardly find the Rules of that <hi>Metred Poetry</hi> obſerved with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in the Songs of the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. There is little value to be ſet on the Authority, of either <hi>Philo,</hi> or <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and and after them, of <hi>Jerom,</hi> who quotes <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> for it, when they go to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the <hi>Hebrew P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">§ 6.

If a <hi>Jew</hi> would but believe the <hi>Songs of Zion,</hi> which once were ſung in his <hi>own Land,</hi> he would ſoon turn a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and would his Nation do ſo, it would not be long, that they ſhould be put upon Singing them in a <hi>Strange Land. Chriſtian,</hi> Dig in theſe <hi>Mines,</hi> and thou wilt ſoon be ſenſible of what thy SAVIOUR has told thee, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they teſtify of me.</hi> Yea, Good Old <hi>Hilary</hi> has a Note, That the Book of PSALMS is a Bundle of <hi>Keys,</hi> which will open the Locks of all the other Scriptures. The Word, <hi>Mictam,</hi> is found in the Titles of ſeveral PSALMS; and Monſieur <hi>Gouſſets</hi> Diſcourſe upon it, has very much to demand a Reception for it. The Word ſignifies, <hi>A Thing that is covered with Gold.</hi> But another Word of the ſame Letters, does alſo ſignify, <hi>A Sanctified Thing.</hi> Our Great SAVIOUR, and His Works, are variouſly Exhibited, in the <hi>Types,</hi> and ſo in the <hi>Songs,</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> The ſenſe which concerns the <hi>Types,</hi> is a piece of <hi>Canvas,</hi> on which the Holy Spirit has inlaid the <hi>Myſtical ſenſe,</hi> which concerns our SAVIOUR, as a <hi>Golden Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery.</hi>
               <pb n="xv" facs="unknown:001946_0016_0FFCAF4A891E7CE8"/>If <hi>David</hi> be the <hi>Canvas,</hi> in any of the <hi>Mictams,</hi> the Holy Spirit has inwrought a <hi>Golden Idea</hi> of our SAVIOUR into it, and curiouſly <hi>Embroidered</hi> it, with ſome of His Incomparable <hi>Glories.</hi> Verily, There are more <hi>Mictam's</hi> in our <hi>Pſalter,</hi> than thoſe which have this Term in the <hi>Titles</hi> of them. <hi>They</hi> are not the only ones, that have His Unutterable <hi>Glories</hi> Exquiſitely <hi>Embroidered</hi> in them. The German Divine, who wrote a Treatiſe, to prove, That there is not a <hi>Chapter</hi> in the Bible, wherein there is not a mention or a notice of our SAVIOUR, might find the <hi>Pſalter</hi> to be the eaſieſt part of the Bible for him to work upon. And now, when we diſcover our SAVIOUR in the PSALMS, we then have indeed the <hi>Quickening Spirit</hi> of them. In that <hi>Light</hi> of GOD, we ſee the <hi>Light</hi> wherein the true ſenſe of the PSALMS is <hi>made manifeſt</hi> unto us.

            <p>BUT, O <hi>Eagle-Eye'd</hi> Believer, when thou art Singing the <hi>Graces,</hi> the <hi>Actions,</hi> the <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and the <hi>Grandeurs</hi> of the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, and perhaps coming into <hi>Thoughts</hi>

            <p>THE Word, SELAH, Ever now and then occurs in the PSALMS. And now allow me to propoſe, every SELAH, as an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thee to make a pauſe, upon the <hi>Magnificence</hi> of thy SAVIOUR. I will not here make a long Recital, of the various, and very many Interpretations, which the Criticks have left that Word in the dark withal. It ſhall be enough to ſay, That in the large, <hi>Theſaurus Philologico-Theologicus</hi> lately Publiſhed, there is a Diſſertation upon that Word, which would perſwade us, That SELAH is a proper Name of the Bleſſed GOD our SAVIOUR, and that it ſignifies, <hi>The Magnificent One,</hi> or, <hi>One that is exalted on high.</hi> The Word muſt not be too much ſeparated from the reſt of the Diſcourſe, but it is to be look'd upon as a part of it. It belongs to the Period, and is to be rendred, ſometimes in the <hi>Nominative,</hi> ſometimes in the <hi>Genitive</hi> Caſe, and ſometimes in other
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:001946_0018_0FFCAF516A870238"/>Caſes; but moſt commonly in the <hi>Vocative, Chriſtian,</hi> In the PSALMS every where think on thy SAVIOUR. And if a SELAN ſtop thee, think, before thou go on, <hi>O my SAVIOUR, How Magnificent art thou!</hi> — Indeed, ſuch is the <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> ever between our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR and His People, that the condition of the <hi>One</hi> in the PSALMS will not <hi>forbid,</hi> but <hi>invite</hi> us to confider the condition of the <hi>Other.</hi> And therefore, what is now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, about a Contemplation of our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, to be a principal ſtroke of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in Singing of the PSALMS, will not ſuperſede the Entertainments which are to be joined with it.</p>

            <p>WE are to conſider, That the <hi>Holy Men of GOD,</hi> who wrote the SCRIPTURE, were <hi>moved by His Holy Spirit,</hi> in and for the Writing of it; and the <hi>Spirit of Holineſs</hi> at the Time of the Inſpiration made ſuitable <hi>Impreſſions</hi> on the <hi>Affections</hi> of His Faithful Servants, The Good Men had their <hi>Hearts</hi> Holily, Graciouſly, Divinely, and ſuitably <hi>Affected</hi> with the <hi>Matter,</hi> which the Spirit of GOD employ'd their Pens to leave upon, their Parchments. It might not meerly be ſaid of them, as it was of a <hi>Baloom, That the Lord put a Word into his MOUTH.</hi> No, A <hi>David</hi> who has an <hi>Heart after the Heart of</hi> GOD, moſt certainly had his HEART alſo Holily affected, with the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> that
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:001946_0023_0FFCB06EE689A578"/>came unto him. In the <hi>Written Paſſages</hi> here under our Contemplation, there will be found <hi>Evident Indications</hi> of ſuch AFFECTIONS working in the minds of the Inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as, A Flaming LOVE towards GOD; and then towards <hi>Men,</hi> for the ſake of GOD: LOVE, the <hi>Root</hi> of all <hi>Spiritual Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Lively FAITH, relying on the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> and <hi>Perfections,</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> or <hi>Threatnings</hi> of GOD; and on the <hi>Mediation</hi> of our SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>A Longing DESIRE, after ſuch Bleſſings as are in the view of a Soul that would <hi>Live unto GOD;</hi> Joined with an HOPE of obtaining them.</p>
            <p>A Fervent ZEAL for GOD, and for the cauſe of His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the Enjoyments of His <hi>Houſe</hi> among the Children of Men.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A Total DESPAIR to find that <hi>Help</hi> in

               <hi>Creatures,</hi> which is no where to be found but in their Great <hi>Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A diſtreſſing FEAR of the <hi>Judgments,</hi> whereto all Wickedneſs does expoſe thoſe who are drawn into it.</p>
            <p>A Triumphant JOY in GOD, and in His CHRIST, and in the <hi>Favours,</hi> which He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon His People.</p>
            <p>A Rapturous ADMIRATION of Him, who is the Glorious <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Ruler</hi> of the World, and of His Glories; with a <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of His Work which Men behold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL True PIETY is begun by the Enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of theſe <hi>Affections</hi> in the Soul. It proceeds, it proſpers, it improves, as theſe <hi>Affections</hi> gain ſtrength and vigour there. <hi>O Lord, Ey theſe things Men live, and in all theſe things is the Life of my Spirit: ſo wilt thou recover me, and make me to live!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Diſcover which of theſe <hi>Affections</hi> may be moſt obvious and evident, in the <hi>Sentence,</hi> which may be now under thy conſideration: And make a <hi>Pauſe!</hi>— But <hi>Reſtleſs</hi> until thou find the ſame <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> beginning to ſtir in thy own Soul, and marvellouſly to Harmonize &amp; Symphonize, with what the Holy SPIRIT of GOD raiſed in His <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> at the moment of His Writing it. Be not <hi>at Reſt</hi> until thou feel <hi>thy</hi> Heart-ſtrings quaver, at the Touch upon
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:001946_0025_0FFCAF5F8C325468"/>the Heart of the <hi>Sacred Writer,</hi> as being brought into an <hi>Uniſon</hi> with it, and the <hi>Two Souls</hi> go up in a Flame together.</p>
            <p>THE Hints which our Excellent <hi>Matthew Henry</hi> gives in his <hi>Expoſition on the PSALMS,</hi> at the cloſe of every Paragraph, what <hi>Affections the Verſes of that Paragraph are to be Sung withal,</hi> are a noble Commentary; And every <hi>Holy Heart</hi> who <hi>by reaſon of uſe may have ſenſes in Exerciſe to diſcern</hi> ſuch things, may add unto it, EASILY do I concur with my Excellent <hi>Franckius,</hi> in allowing, That an <hi>Unregenerat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe as this. But then I will ſay, That I Soul preſſing after a true <hi>Regeneration,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not readily take a more likely way to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto a Bleſſed Experience of it, that by waiting upon the Holy SPIRIT of GOD, with <hi>proper Trials,</hi> whether He will not quicken ſuch <hi>Affections</hi> in it, as are to be found no where, but in a Soul <hi>Regenerated,</hi> and Animated and Actuated from Above. <hi>Try,</hi> O Soul wiſhing for <hi>Quickenings from Heaven, Try,</hi> whether upon obſerving the Heavenly <hi>Affections,</hi> which are very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the Writers of the <hi>Word</hi> by which we are <hi>Born again,</hi> and upon Attempting with an Eye on Help from <hi>Sovereign Grace,</hi> to expreſs the like <hi>Affections,</hi> in the Salley
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:001946_0026_0FFCAF7705342740"/>of Devotion towards the Glorious GOD, thou doſt not find ſome <hi>Vital Operations</hi> in thee, that ſhall be the <hi>Inchoations</hi> of a <hi>Life</hi> that ſhall never be extinguiſhed. Moſt certainly; If thou doſt become <hi>Affected,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Favourites of Heaven,</hi> whom GOD choſe for the Vehicles, and Enkindlers, and Preſervers of PIETY in His Church thro' all ſucceeding Ages, it will be an <hi>Infallible Mark</hi> of GOD upon thee, aſſuring thee of an Everlaſting Manſion <hi>with them</hi> in His <hi>Holy City.</hi> Nor is it poſſible to propound an <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> that will more <hi>Prepare</hi> and <hi>Ripen</hi> Men to be <hi>Partakers in the Inheritance</hi> of thoſe Diſtinguiſhed and Exemplary <hi>Saints;</hi> or <hi>Aſſure</hi> them, that they ſhall be <hi>Aſſociated</hi> with theſe <hi>Angelical Men</hi> in the <hi>Future Bleſſedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, O you who are indeed <hi>Born again,</hi> Be prevailed withal, to make this <hi>Exerciſe of PIETY</hi> more uſual with you. When you would bring your ſelves into the <hi>Beſt Frames</hi> that can be wiſhed for, take a ſhort Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of the <hi>Word by which Men live,</hi> and with humble Addreſſes to Heaven pertinent unto the occaſion, <hi>Conſider,</hi> What <hi>Affections of Piety</hi> are plainly diſcernable in the <hi>Word</hi> now before you: And then, with a Soul Turning to the Lord, aſſay to utter the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> of the like <hi>Affections.</hi> Perhaps the
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:001946_0027_0FFCAF64A2F6C670"/>CXIX <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is as likely a <hi>Portion</hi> for this Purpoſe as any under Heaven, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment may be made upon. <hi>Friend,</hi> Ere thou art aware, thou wilt be <hi>caught up into Paradiſe,</hi> in ſuch and <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> Thou will <hi>mount up as with the Wings of Eagles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, They that can Examine the <hi>Original Tongues,</hi> have <hi>peculiar Advantoges</hi> for their Diſcoveries, when this Deſign is to be proſecuted.

            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Go thy way; Repair to thy <hi>Pſalter.</hi> Go this way to work upon it, and ſay, <hi>That thou haſt in thy Hands, the moſt Glorious Book of Devotions, that ever was in the World!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND here, Let one Admonition be given <hi>once</hi> for all, which the Devout Singer will <hi>often</hi> have occaſion to think upon; and which comes in as a <hi>Retainer</hi> to that <hi>Exerciſe of Godlineſs</hi> which is now in proſecution. <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> When thou art in the PSALMS that have <hi>Imprecations upon Adverſaries</hi> in them, Let thy Arrows be ſhot at thy <hi>Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Adveſaries.</hi> Thy <hi>Indwelling Sin,</hi> is an <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in thy Soul; and of all <hi>Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> the moſt worthy to have all the <hi>curſes in this Book,</hi> fulminated at it. That <hi>Old Man</hi>
               <pb n="xxviii" facs="unknown:001946_0029_0FFCAF6A63114F68"/>within thee, is too like the <hi>Violent Man,</hi> the Malicious and Injurious one, which is in the PSALMS complained of. Thy <hi>Lusts</hi> are the <hi>Enemies</hi> that <hi>Roar</hi> and <hi>Blaſpheme,</hi> and <hi>Purſue,</hi> and indeed the worſt of Enemies. And <hi>Satan</hi> too, with whom theſe are confederate; he is, the <hi>wicked one;</hi> the <hi>Den'd Lion,</hi> that <hi>lurks to catch the poor.</hi> His <hi>Evil Angels</hi> are the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones,</hi> who <hi>wait with hopes to ruine thee,</hi> under their moleſtations, thy Soul is <hi>with Lions,</hi> and <hi>among a fiery Crew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SING with ſuch Thoughts, and ſo carry on the <hi>Wars of the Lord.</hi> Thy Succeſſes will be, <hi>Wonderful! Wonderful!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. THERE is a wonderful Thing to be obſerved concerning our PSALMS, which has hitherto been too much overlooked by all the <hi>Uninſpired Interpreters;</hi> But it is a Thing which our SAVIOUR, and His <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who have quoted the PSALMS near Fifty Times, have led us into the Apprehenſion of. This is, That they are full of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and our <hi>Pſalter</hi> is indeed the moſt <hi>Prophetical Book</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>IT is more particularly, but not without holy <hi>Aſtoniſhments</hi>—to be obſerved, That the Deſign of the PROPHETIC SPIRIT, in the PSALMS, all along has been to deſcribe the Sufferings of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> as well
<pb n="xxix" facs="unknown:001946_0030_0FFCB0751135CEB8"/>as of the <hi>Chriſtian Surregate,</hi> under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and foretel the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and Confuſions of that <hi>Wicked One,</hi> and of his Followers; and predict the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> from their long Diſperſion, and a long Felicity for <hi>them,</hi> and the <hi>Converted Gentiles</hi> aſſociated with them, under the ſucceeding Reign of the MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH; and that Happy ſtate of the <hi>New Earth,</hi> in which, under the Influences of the <hi>New Heavens,</hi> there ſhall <hi>dwell Righteouſneſs;</hi> and the <hi>Tabernacle of</hi> GOD <hi>ſhall be with Men, and He ſhall dwell with them, and they ſhall be His People, and</hi> GOD <hi>Himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>IT may be, The Word which we render, <hi>To the Chief Muſician,</hi> but which may be rendred, (and was of Old ſo,) <hi>For the End,</hi> may be to intimate that the PSALMS are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated eminently with an Eye to the Things which are to be done, at that which the Bible calls, <hi>The Time of the End.</hi> Indeed <hi>Jerom</hi> long ago found <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in the PSALMS; And <hi>Austin</hi> affirm'd, That the PSALMS ought all to be underſtood, of CHRIST and His Church, and many of them refer to <hi>After Ages.</hi> But we now improve in our Diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, Upon the PSALMS, as we go along, the <hi>Devout Reader</hi> will find this
<pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:001946_0031_0FFCB077E24F9990"/>
               <hi>Key of David</hi> here communicated unto him. And when he becomes a <hi>Devout Singer</hi> too, then like the <hi>Beloved Diſciple,</hi> he ſhall <hi>be carried away in the Spirit into the wilderneſs,</hi> and be ſhown <hi>the Judgment of the Great Whore thee ſitteth upon many Waters.</hi> He ſhall alſo in theſe Viſions of GOD, <hi>ſee the Holy City, New Jeruſalem, coming down from GOD out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi> Very depraved muſt be that Soul, that has not a reliſh for ſuch Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, more than for any Earthly Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that will not moſt heartily ſay, <hi>They're more deſirable than Gold, yea, than much ſolid Gold; than Honey alſo ſweeter much, or dropping Honey-comb.</hi>

            <p>YEA, and who can tell, but the PSALMS put into the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> with ſo Entertaining a <hi>Commentary</hi> thereupon, may be a powerful and perſwaſive Engine in <hi>the Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When the <hi>Holy Singers</hi> then <hi>begin to Sing and to Praiſe,</hi> who knows, what <hi>Ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> our GOD may ſet againſt the Powers of ANTICHRIST, and of MAHOMET; cauſing them to <hi>deſtroy one another,</hi> and making way for, <hi>The Glorious Things which are ſpoken of thee, O Thou City of GOD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">§ 10. IT has been among the Glories of our PSALMS, that wherever the <hi>Kingdom of GOD</hi> has been upon making any New and Great Appearance, the <hi>Singing</hi> of THEM, has been very notably Subſervient and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental unto it. More particularly, It is well-known, That when the Reformation in <hi>France</hi> began, the PSALMS were turned into <hi>French Metre,</hi> and agreeable <hi>Tunes</hi> were ſet unto them. The <hi>Singing</hi> of THESE charm'd the Souls of Court and City, Town and Countrey. They were Sung in the <hi>Louvre</hi> itſelf, as well as in the <hi>Proteſtant Churches:</hi> Ladies, Nobles, Princes, the King himſelf Sang them. All Ranks of Men practiſed it; A Gentleman of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion would not Eat a Meal without
<pb n="xxxii" facs="unknown:001946_0033_0FFCB4585064DA88"/>it. This One Thing mightily contributed unto the Downfall of <hi>Popery;</hi> which the <hi>Popiſh Chergy</hi> railing at, they never gave over until the profane and obſcene <hi>Odes</hi> of the Pagan Poets, had among many People of Quality thruſt out the PSALMS of <hi>David.</hi> And <hi>Juel</hi> writing from <hi>England</hi> unto <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> beyond Sea, 1560, reported, That a <hi>Change</hi> now appeared viſibly among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but nothing promoted it more, than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting of People unto the <hi>Singing of PSALMS.</hi> This was begun at one Church in <hi>London,</hi> and quickly ſpread itſelf unto the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Places; and ſometimes at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs, there would be no leſs than Sir Thouſand People Singing together. Truly, a growing Regard unto the Book of PSALMS, allowing us to ſay, <hi>The Time of Singing is come, and the voice of the Turtle is heard in the Land,</hi> will be among the hopeful <hi>Signs of the Times,</hi> and give as cauſe to hope, that it won't be long before it be ſaid, <hi>The Winter is paſt, and the Rain is over and gone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOUBTLESS, <hi>The Day approaches</hi> wherein the <hi>Kingdom of GOD</hi> will appear in brighter diſplays of it, than the World has ever yet been Enlightened withal. There are certain MAXIMS of PIETY, wherein all Good Men are <hi>United,</hi> whatever <hi>Different Perſwaſions</hi> they may have in other matters: MAXIMS
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="unknown:001946_0034_0FFCAF740CEC9418"/>wherein all that are cordially United, are Good Men, and the <hi>Children of GOD.</hi> Good Men will come to an <hi>Explicit Union</hi> upon theſe MAXIMS, and know no other <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> than thoſe <hi>Terms of Salvation,</hi> and the Priviledges, the Emoluments, and the Expreſſions of <hi>Brotherly Charity,</hi> which <hi>of Right</hi> belong to all <hi>Good Men,</hi> as well in the <hi>Church</hi> as in the <hi>State,</hi> will be granted unto all that embrace theſe Glorious MAX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IMS. GOD will bring <hi>His People,</hi> to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one another</hi> upon theſe Generous MAX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IMS, and keep <hi>leſſer Points</hi> in a due <hi>Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to them, and manage their <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> on theſe <hi>leſſer Points,</hi> with another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than what has been too frequent among the <hi>Diſputers of this World;</hi> And all Invaſions upon the <hi>Throne</hi> of the Great GOD in the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of Men, will be abominated. There ſhall be a <hi>Reign of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> will ariſe from the operations of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> accompanying of it; and <hi>Joels</hi> Prophecy will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. There will be Men Qualified like, and Influenced by, the ANGELS of GOD; and thoſe <hi>Boanerges,</hi> and <hi>Sons of Commotion,</hi> ſhall <hi>Fly thro' the midſt of Heaven,</hi> having the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> of theſe Uniting MAXIMS, to <hi>Preach unto the Inhabitants of the Earth:</hi> And our Glorious LORD will <hi>ſhake all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
               <pb n="xxxiv" facs="unknown:001946_0035_0FFCB45A817F7BE0"/>until this <hi>Goſpel</hi> be complied withal.

                  <p>It may not be amiſs here to mention, what Monſieur <hi>Jurieu</hi> has obſerved.</p>
                  <p>There are Three Sorts of <hi>Inſtruments</hi> frequently mentioned in the <hi>Pſalms;</hi> The <hi>Cymbals,</hi> the <hi>Pſalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys,</hi> and the <hi>Harps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cymbals</hi> were large and broad pieces of Braſs bent, and giving a ſtrong ſound; which were beaten very near in ſuch a manner, as we now beat our <hi>Drums;</hi> and are known by the Name of <hi>Tymbals</hi> in our Days. Our Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in a famous Text alludes unto them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pſalterys</hi> were <hi>Violins,</hi> on which they play'd. with a Bow, Ten Strings belong'd unto it; and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notes were managed with the Bow and the touch, as tis done on the <hi>Violins</hi> in our days.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Harps,</hi> had Twelve Notes, and every Note had its own String, which was managed with the Fingers, and could not be altered by the different way of touching.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Levites</hi> were the only Perſons that were to play on theſe Inſtruments. Indeed we read of <hi>David,</hi> and all the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> playing on Inſtruments, at the Tranſportation of the Ark. But Monſieur <hi>Jurieu</hi> thinks, this might be one of the Irregularities which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the Death <hi>Unzah.</hi> At leaſt it may be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this was not allowed of, Except in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and in private Houſes. But in the <hi>Temple,</hi> no body durſt play on Inſtruments, unleſs he were a <hi>Levite,</hi> or the Son of a <hi>Levite.</hi> We ſay, the Son of a <hi>Levite,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Rabbi's</hi> tell us, that ſuch of the Levites as were Singers, did uſe to bring their Sons along with them, into the Court of the Prieſt, tho they were not come to their Full Age required unto the performance
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:001946_0447_0FFE51C5484DB798"/>of any Service there on their own bohalf. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tradition of the <hi>Rabbi's,</hi> That is was allowable to make choice of <hi>Singers</hi> from among the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> provided they were by Marriage near akin to the <hi>Sacerdotal Race.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, O <hi>Sincere Chriſtians, Lifted up to Heaven!</hi> You all are <hi>Prieſts of God:</hi> And of the Tribe, who may and ſhall <hi>Sing</hi> His Praiſes. His <hi>Graces</hi> in your Souls, will be the Glorious Inſtruments wherewith you ſhall perform the Noble Exerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The <hi>Bereſchith Rabba</hi> carries it, as if every Breath of a good Man ſhould Praiſe the Lord; There ſhould be a Praiſe of God in every Breath of ſuch a Man.
