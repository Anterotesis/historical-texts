            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Both the <hi>Sublimity</hi> of the Subject, no leſs than the <hi>Secret and Eternal Decrees</hi> of the Deity, a very abſtruſe Theme; as alſo the <hi>Choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the promiſed Dialogues, raiſed my Expectations to a very great Pitch. <hi>But</hi> upon the Peruſal of them; I ſoon found the Author laid himſelf open to the Cenſures which <hi>Horace</hi> tells us they are liable to fall under, who promiſe more than they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and fill the Reader up with vain Hopes, only to tantalize and baulk him in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>

               <l>Which ſuffer me to Engliſh after this manner.</l>

                  <hi>How is it, Man, the End's ſo vile and low?</hi>

            <p>In the firſt place, as is natural to every Reader, who deſires to be informed of the <hi>Occaſion, Deſign, and Scope</hi> of any Work, I dipped into the <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi> hoping there to find ſome ſpecial and weighty Reaſons, which urged the <hi>Editor</hi> to publiſh theſe Controverſial and Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igious Dialogues. <hi>Editor,</hi> I ſay; for it is hard to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>he,</hi> or his <hi>Aged Divine</hi> wrote them, or rather by a Juggle they brought forth the Mungril between them. He ſays, it was written by <hi>a Reverend and Laborious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in Chriſt's Flock, by one who has been for almoſt twice thirty years, a faithful and painful Labourer in Chriſt's Vineyard.</hi> I believe I know the <hi>Reverend and Laborious Paſtor</hi> he means, <hi>viz.</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Jacobite</hi> Clergy-man, who, I dare vouch
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002194_0005_0FDAC8A9200C6050"/>has Served the <hi>Pretender ten</hi> years, where he has the Flock of Chriſt <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return, I could not for my Life find any weighty Reaſon for his Publiſhing theſe <hi>Choice Dialogues.</hi> I began to think, It might be, that ſome of the Young Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plings had roared <hi>Predeſtination</hi> out of the Pulpits; but with all my inquiſitive Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es could not find it ſo. I then began to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect my ſelf, and as my <hi>Young Logic</hi> taught me, began to <hi>compare, compound and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Ideas,</hi> but could not with all my Wits ſee the <hi>Connection</hi> of the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>[Young Stripling]</hi> and <hi>[Predeſtination]</hi> or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how a Diſcourſe upon the <hi>awful and ſecret Decrees</hi> of God naturally led a Man to rail at a <hi>Young Presbyterian.</hi> And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I never met with ſuch an Oddity and Inconſiſtency, as to fill a Book with Calumnies and Reproaches, which is written out of <hi>Charity to the Souls of Men. Full of Charity,</hi> brim full of it! and yet through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Book tranſgreſſing the Rules of that excellent Grace, which the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6, 7. Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up; doth not behave it ſelf unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoyceth not in Iniquity, but rejoyceth in the Truth; beareth all things, believeth all
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002194_0006_0FDAC8AA92B07450"/>Things, hopeth all Things, endureth all Things.</hi> But his high-flying bitter Spirit ſavours of too much Rancor, to let the World think, that Love to Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and not Hatred to the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> was the Spring and Motive of his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this ſcurrilous Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the Dialogues themſelves,</hi> ſays he, <hi>they contain a rich and precious ſtore of Spiritual Knowledge, and Godly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> So the Prefacer thinks. But others are not of his Mind. Why are you angry, Sir? Won't you ſuffer us <hi>conſcientiouſly to diſſent from you?</hi>

            <p>Nay, but ſtop <hi>Young Stripling! they ſpeak to the Hearts of Men in a very eaſie and familiar Manner, ſo that the meaneſt Plough-man, the very meaneſt of God's People may underſtand them.</hi> Right, my Friend, no Body diſputes but the meaneſt Plough-man may dive to the profound Bottom of them The <hi>Dialogues</hi> we give in the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt Teſtimony you can deſire, they are <hi>plain enough;</hi> but is the Subject you write of made as <hi>plain?</hi> No Body deſpairs that ever I heard of, of penetrating into your deepeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, by a ſingle Glance.

            <p>
               <hi>They treat of that deep, but comfortable Doctrine, I mean the Doctrine of Election and Predeſtination.</hi> But then the Author limits his Meaning in a long <hi>Parentheſis, (that Soul-piercing Doctrine to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Unregenerate, but Soul-refreſhing, &amp; Heart-comforting Doctrine to the Saints, to all righteous and godly Folk.)</hi> Then it ſeems, it is a <hi>Soul-piercing</hi> Doctrine to the wicked and unregenerate. It would be too Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical and hard to argue the Author's <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> State and Character, from its being ſuch a <hi>Soul-piercing</hi> Doctrire to <hi>him,</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as endure the Sound of <hi>Fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, Fore-kowledge, Pre-deſtination;</hi>

By <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> I ſay, for this our Author, quotes none of the <hi>Writings</hi> of theſe <hi>Apoſtolick Men,</hi> or their <hi>Succeſſors.</hi> But why need our Praefacer run us up to the Doctrine which he ſuppoſes theſe <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> received from the <hi>Apoſtles, and Apoſtolick Men?</hi> Does he think what <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. told to <hi>Ignatius, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas the Paſtor,</hi> &amp;c. more true, or more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, than what for the Benefit of the Church in all Ages, he left in <hi>Writing?</hi> Does he think <hi>Paul, or Peter,</hi> &amp;c. could ſpeak their Minds better to thoſe Men, than
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:002194_0012_0FDACA3C980D2E48"/>they could <hi>Write</hi> in their <hi>Epiſtles?</hi> We have <hi>Paul</hi> by us, the <hi>ſure Word of Propheſy,</hi> which is enough to inform us what he thought, when he met with a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and when he did not. We know <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Romans</hi> Things <hi>unſearchable and paſt finding out</hi> by any Mortal, not what is <hi>level with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of every Plough-Man;</hi> I mean as to this Doctrine of <hi>Praedeſtination.</hi> And here let me tell our Author, <hi>Paul's Writings</hi> are as valuable with me, nay more, ſince I am ſure he wrote under the Conduct and Inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, than a <hi>perſonal Interview</hi> with him. But I wiſh nevertheleſs, the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer would Publiſh to the World what theſe brave Men were <hi>taught from the Mouths of the Apoſtles,</hi> relating to <hi>Praedeſtination.</hi> The World will own in their thankful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements their Obligations unto him.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Uninterrupted Succeſſion of the Clergy from the Apoſtles,</hi> I mean of <hi>Biſhops Dioceſan,</hi> I never could ſee the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them yet. It has hitherto been much ſuch a Secret in Eccleſiaſtick State as is the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Stone</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> of which it is often aſſerted there is ſuch a Thing in <hi>Rerum Natura;</hi> but we never can be certain any Body has been ſo ſagacious and ſharp as to find it.

            <p>But who is the <hi>Whore of Babylon, and the great Antichriſt,</hi> &amp;c. It can't be the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> for that ſpoils the <hi>uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted

Why, they are <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whom our Author joyns wth the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are a ſmall Body, which I know the Praefacer thinks to be mainly intended in the <hi>Apocaypſe.</hi> And yet in a few Lines after he calls us <hi>Fellow-Chriſtians.</hi> They are <hi>Fellow-Chriſtians,</hi> and yet have they <hi>followed blindly,</hi> for ſome ſcores of Years, <hi>blind Guides;</hi> nay, as in Converſation he will not ſcruple to call them <hi>falſe Brethren,</hi> and aver that they are no more <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> than every <hi>Carter and Dray-man</hi> that paſſeth the Street.

            <p>Now the Praefacer puts on an Air of Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and takes up a Lamentation. <hi>Here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take Notice of the ſad and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Degeneracy of Mankind,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Your Maſter has given Demonſtration enough of his affecting the Throne of the moſt high God. But really, friend John, you have done ſomething even beyond his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, to claim it for him. Formerly he uſed to value himſelf upon being the Object of all Worſhip from the <hi>Japaneſe,</hi> the <hi>Hottentots,</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Salvages. He never imagined that all the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in the World, which amount to ſeveral Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and a very diſtinguiſhed and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or part of Mankind, are alſo his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers. I proteſt John, I am ſo well acquainted with our Maſter, that I know he trembles before the God, whom the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> pray to.</p>
               <p>But avaſt! I remember now King <hi>William</hi> was a <hi>Calviniſt.</hi> But ſure, it is not upon his account that you ſo horribly blaſpheme the God he prayed to? For I remember, you never much liked him. O hungry and hardly beſtead, that you can't content your ſelf with curſing the King, whoſe immortal Memory, you and our Maſter abominate; but you muſt look upward and curſe his God too!</p>
               <p>Look you, <hi>John,</hi> hitherto your Maſter
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002194_0028_0FDACA5499CD3980"/>pleaſed himſelf with being <hi>the God of this World.</hi> But there is a Sett of People <hi>Called out of this World,</hi> who are continually lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Cries to the <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> that he would quicken them to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe;</hi> and who aſcribe to <hi>Sovereign Grace,</hi> the whole Glory of every good Thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them in a Way of Living unto God. Now, John, theſe were the People of all the World, which your Maſter and mine gave over as loſt; he has <hi>hue-in-cried</hi> them as Runaways, and has taken all Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to blacken them with ſuch Pens as your's (that writes all his <hi>Advertiſements</hi> for him) for <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>Brute-Makers;</hi> But it ſeems by you, that theſe alſo are they, who <hi>fall down and worſhip him.</hi> This is beyond what your Maſter himſelf ever imagined. He was in you, <hi>John,</hi> all the time you were a Scribling for him, tho' perhaps you were not aware of it. But how comes it, <hi>John,</hi> you're gone beyond his Inſpiration? You have pleaſed him won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully; For tho' he be a Spirit full of Envy, yet he is not ſo envious, as to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed when he ſees himſelf out-done in Deviliſm. You muſt not wonder at it, that when you ſay, the God of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> is more cruel than the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> ſhould applaud himſelf, for having a Man <hi>John,</hi> who bids ſo hopefully to out-do his Maſter.</p>

               <p>I confeſs, in this <hi>Jack,</hi> thou art meritorious enough.

And that his Decrees are all righteous, and holy. And that that Sin is to be wholly charged upon the Sinner; his own proper Fault, proceeding from the vitioſity of his own Will. If you had not foreſwore reading of them (under a pretence there is ſcarce <hi>common ſenſe</hi> in any one of them) you might have ſeen their Books abound with ſuch like Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                  <hi>Predeſtination</hi> to life is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby before the foundations of the World were laid, he hath conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by his Counſel, ſecret to us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from curſe and damnation, thoſe, whom he hath choſen in Chriſt Jeſus out of mankind, and to bring them by Chriſt to everlaſting Salvation, as veſſels made to honour; wherefore they that be endued with ſo Excellent a benefit of God, be called according to Gods purpoſe, by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon, they thro' Grace obey the calling, they be Juſtifyed freely, they be made Sons of God by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, they be made like the Image of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, they walk religiouſly in good works, and at length by Gods mercy they attain to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting felicity.

That this <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is no manifeſt, no open Decree, into the grounds and cauſes of which every mean capacity may dive, but a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den purpoſe, counſel or decree of God, which

            <p>The next demonſtration and diſcovery of the Church in this point, is from the <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Articles,</hi> agreed upon at <hi>Lambeth</hi> Houſe, by <hi>John</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Richard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tindall</hi> Dean of <hi>Elie,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> with ſeveral learned Divines of the Church; with the approbation of <hi>Matthew,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> compoſed at firſt in Latin, and ſent to the Univerſity at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> to prevent and cruſh ſome <hi>Arminian</hi> Controverſies that were beginning to be raiſed there; yet I ſhall give you in Engliſh Four of Nine, that relate to <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> never yet impeached or rejected by the Church, as inconſiſtent with the 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but inſerted in the <hi>Ireland</hi> Articles, &amp; allowed of in the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court. 1. <hi>God from Eternity hath</hi> Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>certain men unto Life, certain men he hath Predeſtinated, or reprobated unto Death:</hi> 2.

               <hi>moving and efficient cauſe of</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination <hi>unto Life, is not the fore-ſight of Faith or Perſeverance, or good works, or of any thing in the perſons</hi> Predeſtinated,

               <hi>but only in the good will and pleaſure of God.</hi> 3.

            </p>
            <p>The next Teſtimony from that Church for <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> is the Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> agreed upon by the Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, and the Clergy of that Kingdom, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation held at <hi>Dublin,</hi> 1615.

            <p>Art. 11. <hi>God from all eternity, did by his unchangeable Counſel, ordain whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſs, yet ſo as thereby no violence is offered to the wills of the reaſonable Creatures, and neither the</hi> Liberty <hi>nor</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency <hi>of</hi> Second cauſes <hi>is taken away, but eſtabliſhed rather.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>13. Predeſtination unto Life, <hi>is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby before the foundations of the World were laid, he hath conſtantly decreed in his Secret Counſel, to deliver from curſe and damnation, thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt, out of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to bring them by Chriſt, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation, as veſſels made unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>

            <p>Another diſcovery of the Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> is from the Suffrages of the <hi>five Repreſentatives</hi> of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> Dr. <hi>Carleton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> publick Divinity profeſſor at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canquel</hi> Dean of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Thomas Goad,</hi> who were called and aſſembled to

In the Collect for <hi>All Saints Day,</hi> it begins, <hi>Almighty God, who haſt knit together thine</hi> Elect <hi>in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and fellowſhip in the myſtical Body of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> If God has an <hi>Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> people, there muſt ſome be <hi>left out,</hi> and <hi>paſſed by,</hi> otherwiſe there can be no <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Choice.</hi> In the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> generally taught unto Children, in Anſwer to Q 6. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the third place, <hi>In God the Holy Ghoſt, who Sanctifyed me, and all the Elect, people of God;</hi> which plainly inſtructs us, that God <hi>chooſeth</hi> to <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as to <hi>Salvation,</hi> and that all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ones</hi> ſhall be <hi>Sanctifyed,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Saved.</hi> In the <hi>burial of the Dead,</hi> in the firſt prayer after the <hi>Lords Prayer; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching

Here is not only an <hi>Elect,</hi> but a definite and certain <hi>Number</hi> determined with God, which are not <hi>yet accompliſhed,</hi> and the number of ſuch as are left out and paſſed by, is alſo certain and determined. In a <hi>Godly prayer at all times,</hi> which is added to ſome old Bibles, there is this paſſage; <hi>In that it hath pleaſed thee freely, and of thine own accord, to</hi> Elect <hi>and chooſe us to Salvation before the beginning of the World.</hi> This is plain language, and in the Books of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and even thoſe who little thought <hi>Common Prayer</hi> favoured <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,</hi> which they oft called a <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrine,</hi> and is ſo particular, for a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> ſome of your Neighbours have aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>contrary to the Word of God, and a great diſcouragement to Piety;</hi> ſo that I wonder how the <hi>Oxford Oath</hi> of <hi>Aſſent and Conſent</hi> ſhall reliſh for the future, wherein men Swear, <hi>That nothing is contained in the Book of Cannons, Ordination of Biſhops, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, contrary to the word of God,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is found in one of them.</p>
            <p>We call in alſo to witneſs for us, the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> of the Church, which appear to be principally the eſtabliſhed Doctrine thereof, for the moſt part compoſed by the Arch-biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who ſealed among many more, this and other truths, with his Blood.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002194_0065_0FDACA8C17ADB0F8"/>It were too tedious to tranſcribe all here, but I ſhall give a paſſage or two, to engage Readers to be more attentive and obſervant for the future. Therefore in the <hi>2d</hi> part about <hi>p.</hi> 160.
<q>God of his mercy, and ſpecial favour, towards them whom he hath appointed to everlaſting Salvation, hath ſo offered his Grace eſpecially, and they have ſo received it fruitfully, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, by reaſon of their ſinful living out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, they ſeemed before to have been the children of wrath and perdition, yet now the Spirit of God mightily working in them unto the obedience of Gods will, that they are the undoubted Children of God, appointed unto everlaſting Life: for the Good fruit is not the cauſe the tree is good: for the tree muſt firſt be made good, before it can bring forth good fruit.</q> This and much more may be found in both parts for confirmation of this Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination.</hi>

Q. <hi>But how ſhall I know I am ordained to Eternal Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By the motions of Spiritual Life, which belongeth only to the Children of God. I might enlarge with varieties of Teſtimonies in favour of this Doctrine, from the Learned &amp; Godly in all the paſt Reigns, from the Reformation downward; and ſhall conclude with that honourable, and venerable Suffrage of <hi>Primate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> in his <hi>Sum and Subſtance of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which for the Satisfaction of all, I ſhall deliver in his own words.

            <p>
               <q>We muſt note, that leſs Regard is to be paid to the Ancient Fathers, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and lived before the Time of the Riſe of the <hi>Hereſy</hi> of <hi>Pelagius;</hi> I ſay, leſs Regard is to be paid to them in our Diſputes of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and <hi>Free Grace,</hi> than to thoſe who lived afterwards; becauſe that theſe latter have ſearched the Matter with more Care and Exactneſs. <hi>Every new Sect of</hi> Hereticks (ſaith St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin) which ſpring up in the Church, by the Diſputes, which they are the unhappy Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of raiſing in the Church, have given Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to others to illuſtrate and confirm, with a greater particularity, thoſe Truths of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they find thus attacked</hi> The Fathers, when they had it in Hand to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> were too apt in Oppoſition to them, to extol the Powers of <hi>Free-Will;</hi> nevertheleſs, moſt of them favoured the Truths which we defend;
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002194_0069_0FDACA925C5259D8"/>and they have ſaid many Things in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Error which we oppoſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But without being at the pains to conſult the Sentiments of the Fathers, who lived before</hi> Pelagius; <hi>we ſhall make a ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which the Church held and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, when that</hi> Heretick <hi>firſt aroſe to infeſt the Churches, and what was the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe who followed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It appears from the Works of St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>that there were</hi> three <hi>diſtinct Syſtems of</hi> Predeſtination, <hi>in the Time of that ancient Doctor of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> firſt <hi>was that of St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>and the Church, which gives</hi> all to God. <hi>The</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>is that of</hi> Pelagius, <hi>who attributes</hi> all to Man. <hi>The</hi> Third <hi>is that of the</hi> Semi-Pelagians, <hi>who divided it between</hi> God &amp; Man, <hi>attributing</hi> Part to God, and Part to Man; <hi>but attributing</hi> more <hi>to</hi> Man <hi>than to</hi> God. <hi>The</hi> Pelagians <hi>founded the</hi> Predeſtination, <hi>or rather the</hi> Election <hi>of God upon the</hi> Fore-ſight of the Merit <hi>of Man. The</hi> Semi-Pelagians, <hi>upon the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that</hi> Grace <hi>is neceſſary to all the actions of Piety, they attributed it to the</hi> Free-Will <hi>of Man, only the</hi> beginning and firſt Eſſays <hi>toward Faith; and they believed that</hi> Predeſtination <hi>was founded upon the</hi> Fore-ſight of this firſt Beginning <hi>of Faith, which according to them appertained only to Man; yea, they even aſſerted, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002194_0070_0FDACA9397D27708"/>dying in their Infancy, were</hi> Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>according as God had</hi> fore-ſeen <hi>they would have lived, in Caſe they had lived a longer Time in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They diſtinguiſhed alſo the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God into <hi>two ſorts,</hi> the one a <hi>general and conditional</hi> Decree of Saving all men; the other a <hi>particular and abſolute</hi> Decree, of Saving thoſe whoſe Faith he <hi>fore-ſaw from Eternity.</hi> But St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> with the Church not admitting <hi>any good Diſpoſition</hi> in Man which is not the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> even from the <hi>leaſt beginning of Faith to the End of our Perſeverance,</hi> and a Gift purely <hi>gratuitous,</hi> or of <hi>meer Grace,</hi> becauſe it is not done with a view to any <hi>Merit;</hi> but on the contrary 'tis a Gift to Sinners who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thereof, held that <hi>Predeſtination is wholly of Grace.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Church highly approved the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and thundered her <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's</hi> againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and the <hi>Semi-Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> in many of their <hi>Councils,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thoſe which were held at <hi>Carthage</hi> and at <hi>Milevi. Anno</hi> 416, 417, 418. againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celeſtius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Popes <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves againſt theſe Hereticks, and maintained the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Proſper</hi> largely defended the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Gauls.</hi>

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002194_0071_0FDACA9517FA9490"/>Defence hereof, as may be ſeen by one of his Letters; and he authorized all that had been ſaid and done againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> by the <hi>African Councils</hi> and others; and he made choice of St. <hi>Proſper</hi> himſelf for his Secretary in this Affair.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> ſignalized himſelf in the Defence of this Doctor of the <hi>Church,</hi> and made evident how much he eſteemed the Book of the <hi>Call of the Gentiles,</hi> placing all the Works of <hi>Caſſian</hi> and <hi>Fauſtus</hi> among the <hi>Apocryphal.</hi> Books, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which were not received by the Church.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth Century, Pope <hi>Hormiſda</hi> fell into the ſame Sentiments, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was defended by <hi>John Maxentius,</hi> a Monk and Prieſt of <hi>Antioch,</hi> by St. <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> by <hi>Primaſius</hi> a Biſhop, by <hi>Ferrandus,</hi> Deacon at <hi>Carthage,</hi> by the illuſtrious Biſhops and Confeſſors, baniſhed for their Faith into <hi>Sardinia,</hi> by the <hi>ſecond</hi> Synod at <hi>Orange,</hi> held in <hi>Anno</hi> 529, and by <hi>Caſſidorus,</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<q>The Opinion which ſeems moſt conformable to the Truth is this; Namely, that with reſpect to the Good, Predeſtination is nothing elſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind of the moſt learned <hi>Auſtin,</hi> than the <hi>Preparation of Grace;</hi> and with Regard to the Wicked, Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as I can conceive and judge of it, is the ſubſtraction of Grace.

               <hi>God does not afford the ſuccours of his Grace, to thoſe to whom he is not pleaſed to grant them, according to his</hi> Decree of Predeſtination; <hi>but yet in ſuch ſort, that the Equity of the Creator appears equally in his Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards either, while he</hi> gives <hi>to ſome his Grace out of meer Mercy, and does</hi> not give <hi>it to others, by a Judgment as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as it is hidden. As then we are all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen into a State of Condemnation; God ſhews Mercy to whom of us he pleaſes, and he hardneth alſo whom he pleaſes; that is, he leaves them under the Power of their own native hardneſs.

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002194_0074_0FDACA99990AE380"/>that he ſhews Mercy; but it is without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, that he reprobates and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens any,</hi> viz. <hi>that he denies them his Special Grace.</hi>

<q>As to the Order of <hi>Preſcience</hi> and <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> there are ſome who ſay that the Fore-ſight of Good and Bad Works, or Merits is the Reaſon and Cauſe of Predeſtination, and Reprobation; In ſuch ſort, that we are to conceive and think that God has Predeſtinated ſome becauſe he foreſaw they would do good Works, and would believe in Cariſt; and according to that Opinion, the ſenſe of Text of the Apoſtle is this; Thoſe whom God <hi>foreſaw were to be conformed to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Son, they were the Perſons whom he Predeſtinated.</hi> And it would be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſo to phraſe it, if Predeſtination had regard to <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but to <hi>Life Eternal</hi> beſtowed upon us as the Reward of our Works. But Predeſtination involves and implies in it all thoſe Gifts and Benefits which are profitable in order to Salvation, which God has prepared for Men from all Eternity. Wherefore all that Grace which he diſtributes to Men, as preparatives to eternal Glory, in Time, he had prepared
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002194_0077_0FDACA9E1A189290"/>for them from Eternity. To eſtabliſh them, and preſuppoſe upon our Part any Merit, the Fore-knowledge of which is the Cauſe and Foundation of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the ſame thing as to ſay, that <hi>Grace is given to us for the ſake of our Merits;</hi> and that the <hi>Principle of our good Works is from our ſelves,</hi> and only <hi>the conſummating and perfecting of our Grace is from God.</hi>

In fine, after the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which would not decide that Queſtion, there were great Conteſts between the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> or <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> Theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maintain the Cauſe of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> &amp; had <hi>Dominicus a Soto</hi> for their Head.

But ſtill further to ſtifle this Calumny, (<hi>viz.</hi> Of the pretended Novelty of this Doctrine) &amp; utterly to coufound it, I will more particularly and profeſſedly conſider that part of the Cavil which reſpects the, <hi>Ancient Fathers &amp; Writers</hi> of the Church &amp; which repreſents them as of a different Judgment from the Followers of <hi>Calvin</hi> in thoſe Doctrins that we have inſiſted upon. As to what thoſe <hi>Ancients</hi> ſay concerning theſe Points, I will give the Reader ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in theſe Two Propoſitions,
<list>
                  <item>1. Many of the Fathers are not to be relied upon when they ſpeak of theſe Doctrines.</item>
                  <item>2. Several of them, who are the moſt competent Judges of theſe Points, do plainly aſſert and defend them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I will make it evident, That many of the Fathers are not to be relied upon in what they deliver concerning theſe Articles of Religion. For, Firſt, It is difficult to know their true Senſe and Judgment when they ſpeak of theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And again, when we have found it out, and know what their deſigned mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, we can't reſt and confide in it. The former of theſe is very clear, becauſe in the Times of thoſe who were the moſt
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002194_0080_0FDACAA11945A678"/>Ancient Fathers of the Church, theſe Controverſies were ſcarcely ſtarted, much leſs purpoſely handled, at leaſt but by a few, and ſo they had not occaſion to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Judgments fully concerning theſe Points. They did not ſo take them into Conſideration as to treat of them diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and exactly. They did not diſcourſe of them with an Intention to ſettle Mens Judgments about them. How then can it be expected that they ſhould ſpeak home to the Point, when they ſpeak on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Bye, and as it were Accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and did not make it their Deſign and Buſineſs to treat of thoſe Things? It is obſervable, that before ſome of the chief Hereſies aroſe, theſe Writers were not ſo expreſs and punctual about thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion as they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> confeſſes that before <hi>Arius</hi>'s Time the Fathers delivered ſome Things <hi>unadviſedly, and with little heed to what they ſaid; yea, they ſaid ſuch things as can hardly eſcape the Cavils of perverſe M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> And what was thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by this learned Father concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Arian</hi> Controverſie, is obſerved likewiſe concerning the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002194_0081_0FDACAA43877D750"/>Father of the ſame Character, and particularly he remarks concerning <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> That before <hi>Pelagius</hi> appeared, he was negligent and careleſs in his Words, when he diſcourſed of Free-Will and Grace. And what he ſaith of this Father, may be ſaid of the reſt, they did not ſpeak ſo warily and heedfully as afterwards; and accordingly ſeveral Points were in thoſe Times unſettled, and not fully determined ſuch as thoſe that I have been handling, and therefore to quote the generality of the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon this occaſion is impoſſible, and to expect it to be done is idle and impertinent.</p>
            <p>There are other Reaſons why we ſhould not look upon ſome of the <hi>Fathers</hi> as good Judges here. For it was uſual with them to ſet down other Mens Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Opinions as their own. <hi>Jerom</hi> obſerves of <hi>Origen, Euſebius,</hi> and others, that they ſometimes write not their own Sentiments, but ſpeak what others had delivered. Yea, ſomtimes they ſaid not what they thought, but what the preſent Occaſion compelled them to ſay, with reſpect to the diverſity of <hi>Times</hi> or <hi>Perſons</hi> they had to do with. With regard to
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002194_0082_0FDACAA59931EBB0"/>which latter, they deliver'd not the ſame Notions and Sentiments to the Vulgar and to the Learned. Sometimes the Fathers rhetoricate and declame, and then we muſt not expect that things will be ſpoken exactly according to Truth. <hi>Jerom</hi> acknowledges concerning <hi>himſelf,</hi> that in ſome parts of his Writings he ſpeaks only <hi>Probably,</hi> and like a <hi>Retorician</hi> or <hi>Orator,</hi> for Argument ſake; and at other times he is <hi>Dogmatical</hi> and <hi>Serious,</hi> and cloſe to the purpoſe. But it is hard to tell when he delivers things one way, and when the other. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> that he ſpake ſometimes not <hi>dogmatically, but as in the heat of Diſpute.</hi> It is uſual with ſome of the Fathers, eſpecially <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> and his Imitator <hi>Theophylact,</hi> to aſſert ſuch and ſuch an Opinion, to give ſuch an Interpretation of a Text in Scripture, and then in another place to forget what they had ſaid, and to aſſert and Interpret in an other way, yea, ſometimes a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one. So that it is difficult to know what is the Senſe of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>And when we know it, we cannot rely on it. For ſome of the Ancient Writers of the Church were Novices, and being
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002194_0083_0FDACAA717AF52F0"/>but lately admitted into the Chriſtian Communion, were but meanly inſtructed in the Principles of it. Others of them, tho' of longer ſtanding, were ſometimes very extravagant in their expounding of Scripture. They ſtrain and wreſt the Text, and venture to add to the Words, or to conceal part of them, to prove the buſineſs they have undertaken, and to back the Opinions they have eſpouſed So that no impartial Searcher of Truth will ſwallow there groundleſs Interpretations. Nor is it to be forgot that ſome of the Fathers had been profeſſed <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and thence bro't into Divinity ſeveral undue Notions &amp; Principles. Thus tis known that they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> and uſes ſeveral Arguments for it. And ſo doth <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:002194_0084_0FDACAA8BB454F30"/>in his Fourth Book <hi>against Heriſies,</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters 71, 72, 76, 77. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his 6th Book of the <hi>Evengelical Preparation,</hi> proves from ſundry Topicks, that Man is a <hi>Free-Agent,</hi> and argues againſt Fatal Neceſſity. And ſometimes the Chriſtian Fathers ſpeak of Free-Will as to common Acts of the Mind, and natural Reſults of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which no man of Reaſon will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And it is likely that ſometimes they underſtand it of a Free-Will to Good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But it is too apparent, <hi>that</hi> ſome of them aſſert, <hi>that</hi> all Perſons have an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to will either good or ill in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: They hold, <hi>that</hi> there is a Natural Power in every Man <hi>to will and to do what is acceptable to God.</hi> Therefore it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the <hi>Centuriators</hi> of <hi>Magdeburg, that</hi> no Point of Doctrine began ſo ſoon to be obſcured and corrupted, as this of the Nature of <hi>Free-Will;</hi> and they quote ſome of <hi>the Fathers</hi> of <hi>the Second Century</hi> as chargeable with this. So it is acknowledged by <hi>Calvin, that the Greek Fathers</hi> are not of his ſide in this Point; for they generally held, <hi>that</hi> all Men by Nature have a Free-Will to chooſe Good in Spiritual and Divine Things.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002194_0085_0FDACAAA17F295B0"/>And we may certainly gather this from a paſſage in <hi>Irenaeus, viz.</hi> That it was part of the Hereſie of <hi>Saturninus,</hi> that ſome Perſons are born without freedom to do Good; and this Writer argues againſt it, unleſs we ſhall ſay (as was ſuggeſted before) that he ſpeaks of Free-Will only, as it denotes acting without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, we cannot depend upon the <hi>Fathers,</hi> for they have err'd in many things, and it is endleſs to particularize. I have done ſomething toward his in an other place. So that if we ſhould grant (as perhaps we ſafely may) that moſt of the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> had other Notions of God's <hi>Decrees, Free-Will, Grace,</hi> &amp;c. than I have offered, yet this is no Rule to us, unleſs we could prove that their Writings are void of Miſtakes and Errors. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, and no Wiſe Man expects it. Yea, we know that many Points in Religion have been taught heretofore by the Fathers, and generally received and applauded, which after-Ages tho't it no immodeſty to lay aſide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. Wherefore let not the <hi>Fathers</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:002194_0086_0FDACAAB9872CDE8"/>and <hi>Antiquity</hi> be pleaded in defence of the Doctrines which I have rejected.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Second Propoſition,</hi> is this, That theſe Points which I have been treating of, are plainly aſſerted and defended by ſeveral of the Fathers, even by thoſe of them who were the moſt competent Judges of them. The <hi>Abſolute Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a cortain number of Perſons,</hi> which is tho't by ſome to be a novel Doctrine, was aſſerted and defended by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi> Yea, he tells us, that ſome of the Fathers before him, as well as ſome that were contemporary with him held the ſame (tho' they had not occaſion to ſpeak of it ſo directly and plainly) and he quotes Paſſages out of <hi>Cyprian, Ambroſe, Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ianzen,</hi> for this. <hi>Election</hi> without the foreſight of good Works, is aſſerted by St. <hi>Jerom.</hi> And as for <hi>Proſper, Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil, Gregory</hi> the Great, learned Writers in the ſucceeding Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it is well known that they went this way: Particularly <hi>Proſper</hi> reckons it as the Doctrine of the favourers of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that <hi>Election was upon foreſeen Faith.</hi> And in the ſame place he mentions it as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Error of theirs, that they held
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002194_0087_0FDACAAD289C1288"/>the <hi>number of the Elect to be uncertain and undetermin'd.</hi> And <hi>Iſidore</hi> expreſly aſſerts a <hi>twofold Predestination,</hi> of the <hi>Elect unto Reſt,</hi> of the <hi>Reprobate unto Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Opinion of ſeveral of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers concerning Man's <hi>Free-Will</hi> &amp; God's <hi>Grace,</hi> is the very ſame that I have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. St. <hi>Baſil</hi> in many places of his Writings doth clearly and plainly aſſert, the abſolute Neceſſity of the <hi>Grace</hi> of the holy Spirit, in order to the performance of good Works, acceptable to God, and he depreſſes the power of <hi>Free-Will. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen</hi> doth in ſome part imitate him in one of his Poems, the 58th. And as theſe were the only Men of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers; ſo <hi>Cyprian</hi> is the firſt of all the <hi>Latin</hi> ones, that ſpeaks out concerning the Degeneracy and Infirmity of Man, and the Neceſſity of Divine and Supernatural Grace. <hi>Lactantius</hi> is the next that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owns theſe, and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is the next after him, who fully and largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon theſe Points, and taught others afterwards to do ſo.</p>
            <p>This learned Prelate was as much for <hi>Free-Will</hi> as any Father, as his Books <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002194_0088_0FDACAAE978414A0"/>the Manichees</hi> teſtifie; for theſe Hereticks denying all freedom of humane Actions, and holding that all Sin was by Neceſſity, this good Father, who wrote againſt them, profeſſedly aſſerts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the liberty of the Will, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomewhat too immoderately in ſome places, particularly in his Book <hi>De Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiacticis Dogmatibus.</hi> But when he wrote againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> part of whoſe Here fie was, that the Free-Will of Man, is not impair'd by the Fall, but is as ſound and perfect as in Innocency, he judiciouſly ſettled the Controverſie about the Will of Man, maintaining that there is in the Regenerate a Free-Will to Good, and this is ſupernaturally given them; and in the wicked there is a Free-Will to Evil, and this is naturally in them. He frequently proves and inculcates, that this Faculty in every Man is by nature weak, diſabled and enſlaved, and that it can't be healed, ſtrengthned, and freed, but by Divine Grace. <hi>What good can lost Man do,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but only ſo far as he is delivered from his Perdition?</hi> Again, <hi>The Will of Man ſo far free, as it is Freed.</hi> Thoſe words of his in another place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="unknown:002194_0089_0FDACAB020442D78"/>a great part of what he ſaith on this Head in the reſt of his Works, <hi>The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith neither denies Free-Will, nor aſcribes ſo much to it, that it can do any thing without the Grace of God.</hi> But the ſumm of all is compriſed in theſe words of the ſame Author, <hi>The Free-Will of Man, as it is now corrupted and captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hath power only to Sin; but when it is ſet at liberty by God, and aſſisted by Divine Grace, it hath ability to execute acts of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> It is true, (and hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved already) that this Father hath in ſome parts of his Writings, ſome Paſſages that favour the contrary Doctrine; but he chang'd his judgment, when he had better conſidered of the matter, and in his riper years he was reſolute and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory on the other ſide, as his Book of <hi>Retractations</hi> plainly ſhews And it is probable that moſt of the Fathers, who too much favour'd <hi>Free-Will,</hi> would have delivered their minds differently from what they did, if they had writ their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractations.</hi>

            <p>Firſt. The Author is not at all acquainted with the true Doctrine of the <hi>Stoics</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fate, when he calls the <hi>Calviniſticl Doctrine of Predeſtination,</hi> a <hi>Stoical and Fatal Scheme.</hi> The <hi>Divine Pre-ordinaion</hi> of all Events from the beginning to the End of Time, is entirely inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with <hi>Stoical Fate.</hi> Yea the very notions of <hi>Divine Pre-ordination</hi> is one of its principal Differences from <hi>Fate.</hi> And will appear, if we conſider what is <hi>Fate.</hi> Now altho', according to <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Book [<hi>De Fato</hi>] and according to <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> in his [<hi>Phyſiologia Stoicorum</hi>] and according to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Danet</hi> in his [<hi>Dictionary of the Greek and Roman Antiquities,</hi> compiled for the uſe of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>] and others do mention ſeveral different Opinions of the <hi>Stoics</hi> as to the true Doctrine of <hi>Fate,</hi> yet the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Notion thereof was to this Purpoſe; viz <hi>Fate is a certain blind and inevitable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable and neceſſary Chain of Cauſes and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:002194_0095_0FDACAB91CFF1498"/>effects whereby all Things and Events of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity come to paſs, and which Jupiter himſelf the great God of all cannot alter.</hi> So that <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf did not <hi>fore-ordain</hi> all Things and Events. It is a <hi>blind Fate,</hi> conſiſting in the Eternal Neceſſity of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and not dependent upon the Will of <hi>Jove. Jupiter</hi> indeed may <hi>foreknow</hi> all Events, but then it is by Reaſon of his Knowledge in examining and inſpecting thoſe Eternal Rolls of Deſtiny. The <hi>Fates</hi> are ſure and firm, &amp; determinate antecedent to any Preordination of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> For there is a Difference between a bare Theorical Science, or Preſcience, &amp; a Pre-ordination. Thus I know there will be a Day of Judgment; but it will not arrive any whit the more for my knowing of it. Thus <hi>Jove</hi> foreknows all Events (according to the <hi>Stoics</hi>) but has not appointed them. <hi>Jove</hi> foreknows all Events becauſe they will come to paſs; but they do not come to paſs becauſe he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knows them. For had there been no <hi>Jupiter</hi> the <hi>Fates,</hi> which are founded upon the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Things in their various neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Combinations, would have been, and Events have followed.

            <p>
               <hi>Jupiter</hi> is there introduced ſpeaking to <hi>Venus</hi> telling her it is to no Purpoſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to break the Decrees of the Three <hi>Parcae.</hi> And then he adds, <hi>I have obſerved and read their Decrees. Jupiter</hi> had no Hand in Ordaining them, but comes to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them by Inſpection into the Rolls of Deſtiny.</p>
            <p>But I conclude this with a Paſſage out of that great Poet our <hi>Engliſh Virgil,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Dryden.</hi> It is in his Dedication, of the <hi>Eneis</hi> to the <hi>Marqueſs of Normandy,</hi> who was alſo a great Poet. Speaking of <hi>Jupiter's</hi> Power to defer the Blow, that is to defer the Death of thoſe, for whoſe Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Life he had received ſtrong Petitions, and ardent Supplications, He ſays,
<q>I once occaſionally diſcourſed with that Excellent Perſon Sr. <hi>Robert Howard,</hi> who is better converſant than any Man I know, in the Doctrine of the <hi>Stoics,</hi> and he ſet me right, from this concurrent Teſtimony of Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers &amp; Poets, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> could not <hi>retard the Effects of Fate,</hi> even for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For when I cited <hi>Virgil,</hi> as favouring the Contrary Opinion in that Verſe, <hi>Tolle fuga Turnum atque inſtantibus cripe</hi> Fatis.
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002194_0097_0FDACABC177BDF10"/>He replyed, and I think with exact Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that when <hi>Jupiter</hi> gave <hi>Juno</hi> leave to withdraw <hi>Turnus</hi> from the preſent Danger, it was becauſe he foreknew, that his <hi>Fatal Hour</hi> was not come; That it was in <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> for <hi>Juno</hi> at that Time to ſave him; And that <hi>Himſelf,</hi> viz. <hi>Juptter,</hi> obeyed <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> in giving her, tha leave.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that <hi>Blind Fate,</hi> and <hi>Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical Predeſtination</hi> are intirely oppoſite; inaſmuch as the former is not ſubject to God himſelf; but this latter ſuppoſes an holy, and righteous, wiſe, and Powerful Providence of God, who did himſelf or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain theſe Events. So much for <hi>Fate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Blunder of the Dialogiſt is, that uis Notion of the <hi>Preſentiation</hi> of all Things in the <hi>Divine Mind,</hi> deſtroys and overthrows all the reſt of his Talk. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Once more, he blunders prodigiouſly in confounding the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Things decreed in the Divine Mind, with the Things themſelves in their actual or eventual <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</hi> All Things are preſent with God, there is no <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>After</hi> with God. We all acknowledge, that God Exiſts in the moſt perfect and incomprehenſible Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he is Being it ſelf [<hi>I am,</hi> that <hi>I am</hi>] and ſo endures no ſucceſſion properly ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> no Succeſſion which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies any Thing of Frailty or Change, which is to us inconceivable. Tho' Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> profeſſes he cannot underſtand the meaning of an Eternal <hi>Nunc Stans,</hi> (as the School-men phraſe it.) But we allow all Things preſent with God; yet we know they are ſucceſſive with us. And how does this knock off the Fetters of Neceſſity from <hi>Free will?</hi> If they be all preſent with God, and he beholds them with one intuitive View, what help is that to me? What God knows of me will prove true in the Event. And tho' all Things are preſent with God, they are ſo only in <hi>Idea.</hi> For what I ſhall do on the morrow, God knows; but God does not know (to ſpeak with humble Reverence) what I ſhall do to morrow under the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:002194_0099_0FDC6AE5F46014C0"/>Notion of a Thing actually accompliſhed. God therefore knows, this and that will be; but he does not know it as <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> until it be done. I am ſure, the Actions to be performed by <hi>John</hi> or <hi>James</hi> next Week, are not as yet performed. Unleſs you'll break thro' your own glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Maxim, <hi>a Thing can't he, and not be at the ſame Time.</hi> God did not in, or from Eternity, know all Mankind <hi>actually born,</hi> but he knew they ſhould be born. Thus we ſee this acute <hi>Metaphyſician</hi> is ſo clumſy as to confound the <hi>Idea's</hi> of Things Decreed with the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, actually Exiſting.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not Tire the Reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the Inconſiſtences, of one, who is himſelf giddy, by reaſon of a rapid Motion of his Brains; and is ſometimes an <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and ſometimes a <hi>Calviniſt.</hi> His Motion is very much like that of the Planets, ſometimes <hi>Direct,</hi> and then <hi>Retrograde;</hi> and ſometimes, I profeſs he is <hi>Stationary.</hi> And this laſt is, when he ſpeaks nothing of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> at all, as may be obſerved in ſome Paragraphs of his Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with theſe two Remarks.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He accurately and nicely obſerves,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002194_0100_0FDBB9CB60477168"/>that the <hi>Church of England</hi> mentions <hi>not a word of Reprobation</hi> in all the 17th Article of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> nothing of God's having <hi>Fore-decreed</hi> any to <hi>Miſery,</hi> but it ſpeaks only of thoſe, whom he has <hi>Elected to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> What an unmerciful Piece of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe is this! The Article ſays plainly, as we remarked before, that there are ſome <hi>Choſen out of Mankind.</hi> And ſo our Author would argue, there are none, which are not <hi>Choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Friend, ſhould I tell thee, there are Twenty Men now before me, and I chooſe Ten of them to Work for me; it follows (does it not?) that all the Twenty la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for me, becauſe I make no Mention of the Ten, I paſs by in my Election, whom I don't chooſe for the Employ. <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi> are <hi>Relative</hi> Terms; if a Perſon chooſes out of any Number of Things, he likewiſe refuſes ſome of that Number.</p>
            <p>Secondly. He is extreamly ignorant of the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Tenets.

He may <hi>ſearch and try</hi> himſelf, according to the Apoſtles Advice. And there are the Things which do <hi>accompany Salvation,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us in another place. We don't therefore in our Examinations begin with the Decree of God; but we begin with our own Souls. We know the <hi>Decree of God is ſure;</hi> but we are allowed to try our own Caſe; yea, commanded in Scripture here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and hereupon conclude of our Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Eſtate. If we make our <hi>Calling</hi> ſure (that is, if we by Examination find the Kingdom of Grace is eſtabliſhed in our Souls, &amp; that we are effectually called into the Fold of Jeſus Chriſt) our <hi>Election</hi> is ſure. For whom he <hi>predeſtinates,</hi> them he alſo calls. Not but that many make a very bad uſe of God's Decrees, and neglect their Salvation; and of this the 17 Article makes mention, and well cautions againſt ſuch a Deſtructive Practice. For tho' God has decreed us to Holineſs, yet we are to obſerve his <hi>revealed Will,</hi> which ſtrictly enjoins Holineſs &amp; Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to ſtrive after it. We are not Brutes or Machines, what God has ordained us to, we ſhall by his Grace ſavingly incline thereunto.

He chuſes the Path of the Deſtroyer, and tho' he may do ſome good Works, yet ſecretly wiſhes he had a Licenſe to Sin, and yet might be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So ſuppoſe an <hi>Impotence</hi> to good only, and not this Enmity to God and Holineſs, is to beg the Queſtion. For to ſnppoſe an impotent Penitent crying out, <hi>Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe, help my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief!</hi> and God refuſing his Grace to him, is more than any <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi> will affirm. <hi>Chriſt will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax, but will bring forth Judgment to Victory.</hi> But then this ſincere and truly Spiritual Deſire, is the bleſſed Effect of <hi>Special Grace</hi> upon the Soul of the Sinner.
