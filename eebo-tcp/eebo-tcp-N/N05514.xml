            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>DEUTERONOMY XXXIV. 5.</bibl>
               <q>So Moſes the Servant of the LORD, died there in the Land of Moab,—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN a ſtate of Exiſtence like the preſent, where there are Beings made for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and put upon Trial a few Years, or rather a few Days, in Order to be train'd up, and fitted for a nobler, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier ſtate of Things: and where thro' native Sluggiſhneſs, and Inattention or a contracted Stupor, thoſe Beings too ſeldom think upon their Errand, the great Buſineſs, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and eſpecially refers to this better State, 'tis convenient, 'tis frequently needful, that they have a ſolemn <hi>Memento,</hi> pointing of them forward to the Period of their Trial. The Reaſon of it is plain, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz</hi>
               </abbr> the immediate, &amp; powerful Tendency which it has, to awaken in the Minds of Men, a ſenſe of the Worth of Time, and to beget in them the moſt vigorous Efforts, to do ſeaſonably the Buſineſs aſſign'd them in the World. And this Reaſon always holds exactly proportionate both to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſsments
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006989_0005_102AB23D401F3060"/>
attending the Duty &amp; Buſineſs of Life, and alſo to the Importance of the Buſineſs itſelf. And hence when by Reaſon of an exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Station, a high Truſt, and the Burthens common to Government, any of our fellow Men have beſides the Duties, &amp; Intanglements common to Men, and Chriſtians, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Weight of a high Truſt, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commonwealth; they eſpecially need to have their Eyes turn'd forward, their Minds directed to the ſolemn Period, when their working Time ſhall be over, &amp; all preſent Diſtinctions laid aſide, <hi>when Christ ſhall have put down all Rule, and deliver'd up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Father.</hi> Agreeably the Sacred Writings frequently inculcate a Truth, which all Nature loudly ſpeaks, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the Mortality of Man. The frequent Inſtances of Mortality before our Eyes, and the conſtant Decays of our own mortal Frame, give us frequent Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, of our approaching Diſſolution. But as though theſe were little Things, the ſacred Scriptures tell us, over &amp; over again, that we muſt die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, that 'tis appointed for all men once to die; not only men of low De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Men of little Note, or Influence, in the World; but even great Men &amp; Princes. <hi>For he ſeeth that wiſe Men die, likewiſe the Fool &amp; brutiſh Perſon periſh.</hi>

a ſwelling Title, or the Diſtinction which Providence makes among Men in the World, ſhould make ſuch men forget the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of their Buſineſs, and forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; there are many faithful Leſſons recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Scripture, to keep alive in their Minds, a ſenſe that they are mortal, and accountable, and of the Obligations thence ariſing, to act in ſome good Proportion to their Character, and Truſt; particularly that cloſing ſtroak in the Character of ſo many of the Kings, &amp; Princes, and Worthies of Iſrael, which are recorded in the old Teſtament, even that finiſhing ſtroak in their Characters; <hi>and he died.</hi> And among all the Inſtances of this Kind, perhaps not one that ſpeaks with greater Emphaſis, than that which we are now to Conſider,</p>

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006989_0007_102AB24363CCC3B0"/>
Deeds, like Him whom he was the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Type of; was born in very bad Times, when inhuman Cruelty prevail'd to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that his Life was ſought for. But that God who had noble Service for him to do in the World, remarkably interpos'd by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, &amp; preſerv'd his Life, and ſo provided for his Education, that he ſhould be well fitted for the public Part, which he was to act in the World. And immediately upon the dawning of the Day of Iſrael's Deliverance, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf called him to Action. Moſes had by this Time baniſh'd himſelf from Pharaoh's Court, and diſown'd his adoptive Sonſhip to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's Daughter, and was become Son in Law to the Prieſt of Midian, by taking his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Wife; by which means he becomes the Keeper of Jethro's, his Fathers Flock.</p>
            <p>And whil'ſt Moſes was leading his Flock to the backſide of the Deſart, he came to Mount Horeb, the Mountain of God, where the Angel of the Lord, or rather the Lord Himſelf appear'd to him in a Flame of Fire, and commun'd with him, firſt reminding him of the affliction of his People Iſrael; and then expreſſing his Deſign of delivering them from their Egyptian Thraldom: And Commiſſions Moſes to go upon the public, and important<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Buſineſs, and gives him ſuch Credentials, that whoſoever diſputed his Commiſſion might

eaſily be put to Silence. And ſince in the Hiſtory of Moſes he generally appears acting ſome public Part, ſo whilſt I am conſidering of him, as the Servant of the Lord, I ſhall principally confine myſelf to the public Parts of his Service, wherein he render'd himſelf illuſtrious among his Kindred, and approv'd himſelf eminently the Servant of the Lord. But even among theſe I muſt confine myſelf to the following particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) His leading forth the Armies of Iſrael.</item>
               <item>(2) His giving Laws to the People.</item>
               <item>(3) His taking Care that the Laws were well executed.</item>
               <item>(4) His Friendſhip to Aaron, and his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of public Worſhip.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">(1) I ſhall <hi>conſider Moſes approving himſelf the Servant of the Lord, in leading forth the Host of Iſrael.</hi> God might without improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Moſes have led forth the Armies of Iſrael, which in a way of Eminence were the Hoſt of the Lord. Indeed their Deliverance out of Egypt was ſo much the Lord's immediate Work, that He is ſaid to have brought them out of Egypt, with an high Hand, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched Arm, and with great Terribleneſs, and with Signs, and with Wonders.<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 8.</note> But He might, without uſing his Servant Moſes, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly have ſubdued that haughty Monarch,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006989_0009_102AB2463747E2D0"/>
Pharaoh King of Egypt. He might eaſily have broken his hard Heart, or Rais'd ſo much Compaſſion in it, as to have eas'd the galling Yoke, and releas'd Iſrael from his Bondage. He might by his immediate Agency, or under the Conduct of Angels, have led his Choſen ſafe through the Deep, and through the Deſert. And even when their March was interrupted by Nations mightier than themſelves, he might by the Breath of his Noſtrils have devour'd them immediately, or marſhal'd his Stars to have fought from Heaven in their Courſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, &amp; ſo have left Moſes in the mean Time, in his former Obſcurity to have fed his Fathers Flock. But GOD makes uſe of Men, for the Accompliſhment of his Deſigns among Men. And as Moſes was the Servant of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo this was one Way, in which he was to ſerve Him. Iſrael muſt be led by the Hand of Moſes. Accordingly Moſes by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command, and with a high Commiſſion from the King of Heaven; goes to Pharaoh, King of Egypt, and with an intrepid Courage, ſupported by the Authority of his King; not only expoſes himſelf to the Rage of Pharaoh, who ſought his Life; but demands, &amp; reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perſiſts in his Demands, that Iſrael ſhould be releas'd. Moſes do's not threaten him that he would raiſe an Army, and force a Paſſage for Iſrael; but he urges the Honour, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006989_0010_102AB279D6A0BD68"/>

And ſuch were the ſpeaking awful Arguments which he uſed, as pretty thoroughly convinc'd Pharaoh, that it was in vain for him to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Arms with the Almighty.

            <p>And truly the Lord of Hoſts was a great King, and his Name was dreadful among the Heathen. It is mention'd as an Inſtance of <hi>Roman</hi> Greatneſs, while Rome was in the very Zenith of her Glory, That ſhe ſaved Egypt when under her Protection, and cauſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus who with a vaſt Army had laid Siege to Egypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to diſband, only at the bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of two or three Senators, who had no other Armour or Retinue, than a Staff, and a waiting Man.

But what is this compar'd with the Power of the Lord of Hoſts, and what was this Terrour compar'd with that which Seis'd the Egyptian King; when he <hi>whoſe Excellency is over Iſrael, &amp; whoſe Strength is in the Clouds,</hi> dealt with him, by the Hand only of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Moſes, and Aaron. Never was a proud

The Lord made to himſelf an everlaſting Name, <hi>by the marvellous Things he did in the Land of Egypt, in the Field of Zoan—When he brought up Iſrael out of the Sea, with the Shepherd of his Flock.</hi> Moſes was the Shepherd, the Leader of his Flock, the Captain of his Hoſt.

God was King in Jeſhurun, &amp; gave Law to Iſrael. So that Moſes was no other way a Lawgiver, than only a Promulger of the Law. He did not make the Law, but declar'd what was Law; and in this Character he ſerv'd God eminently. God might in this Caſe, as well as in the foregoing, have made uſe of the Miniſtry of Angels, or have ſpoken immediately from the Excellent Glory, with an audible voice to the People; but the People were afraid of ſeeing or hearing immediately from God, leſt the Glory of his Viſion, or the Terrour of his Voice, ſhould be too mighty for them.

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006989_0013_102AB24A21D69900"/>
to appear in the Place of Thunder, even upon the Top of the ſmoaking Mountain, to receive the Law at his Mouth. There he gave him that excellent Compendium of Morality, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Decalogue, or a Summary of the moral Duties, which men owe to their Maker, and to one another; caſt into ten diſtinct Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. God at ſundry Times ſpake to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Moſes, &amp; by him gave Laws, which were beſt adapted to the Circumſtances of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Some of them merely of a ritual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poray Nature, which if we ben't able to ſee the immediate Reaſon of, yet may reſt ſatisfied, &amp; content in this, that they were ſuch as he, who knew infinitely well their Circumſtances, the Temper of their Minds, their Luſts, their proneneſs to Idolatry, and their need of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant heavy Yoke; in his Wiſdom ſaw meet to enjoin upon them. Some of them were mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly typical, referring to the Coming, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Meſſiah; which of Courſe were to ceaſe, when the great Antitype Appear'd: theſe like the Twilight of the Morning, were done away by the opening of the perfect Day. Others of them again, were laſting in <hi>their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of perpetual Obligation;</hi> ſuch were the Laws refering to commutative Juſtice, and ſuch were many of the Laws referring to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Crimes. Many of theſe have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd into, and now adorn the Engliſh Laws,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006989_0014_102AB27EEDB14018"/>
and won't ceaſe to be excellent, and uſeful in their Nature ſo long as Time laſts. Theſe were the Laws, which Moſes the Servant of the Lord received from God himſelf, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd to Iſrael: and which he adapted, and made in a ſenſe his own Laws. And in ſo doing he did eminent Service, for his King. For in ſuch a world as this we live in, where Pride and Paſſion, Corruption, and Luſt, have univerſally diffuſed themſelves among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, there would be no tolerable Living, unleſs Men were laid under the direction &amp; reſtraint of Law. And that Legiſlator, that enacts or (being made) adapts, good, wiſe, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws; contributes in a good Proportion to the Health, &amp; Proſperity of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and deſerves well of it. This did Moſes: he ſerv'd his Generation faithfully this Way according to the Will of God. By this Service to his Generation, he ſerv'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who is abundantly honour'd and pleas'd with a good moral Government of the World. None of the Princes of Iſrael, ever diſtinguiſh'd themſelves like Moſes in giving Laws to the People.—Tho' he was the Servant of the Lord, he was a dignify'd one; he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſpeak Face to Face, with his Maker, to receive the Law from his Mouth, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it, with ſome Beams of divine Glory on his Countenance. And truly, <hi>there aroſe

            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Moſes approv'd himſelf eminently the Servant of the Lord, by taking Care that the Laws were well executed.</hi> Laws however good in themſelves, can do no Good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtrict Obſervance of them, and the Execution of condign Puniſhment upon the Breakers of them. Moſes ſenſible of this, diſcover'd a tender Regard for the Law, and a ſuitable Concern for the due Execution of it. Indeed ſuch was the Burthen of public Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lying upon this great Man, that he was not able to give his Attendance in executive Courts, except it was in ſome high, &amp; important Caſes. But he was nevertheleſs concern'd that Juſtice ſhould be done, and the Honour of the Law maintain'd.

He doth execute the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fatherleſs, and Widow, and loveth the Stranger.</hi> Here's a Conduct, and here are Counſels and Commands, worthy of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Lawgiver and Judge: how equal, how diſintereſted; how free from party Spirit, and ſervile Compliance, and how every Way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming God's Deputy, and Viceroy here on Earth.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>Moſes approv'd himſelf the Servant of the Lord by his Friendſhip to Aaron, and his Support of the Worſhip of God</hi> Every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant loves his Maſter, and his Maſter's Friends, and ſeeks his Maſter's Honour. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſincere Servant of the Lord, is the Friend of God, of all good Men, &amp; eſpecially a Friend to the Worſhip of God. This was <hi>Moſes:</hi> he was the Friend of God, and of Conſequence
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006989_0017_102AB24E505BAEE0"/>
a Friend to good Men, and very eſpecially to <hi>Aaron,</hi> who ſtood not meerly in the Relation of a Child to God, but in the Relation of a Prieſt of the moſt High, and was to tranſact between God, and the People, in Things of the moſt ſolemn Nature, and of infinite Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſenſible how much the good of Iſrael, their ſpiritual, and everlaſting good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon <hi>Aaron's</hi> Influence, endeavour'd in all proper Ways to aſſiſt, &amp; ſtrengthen him. Senſible alſo how much the Increaſe of Vertue &amp; Piety would contribute to the Eaſe of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Health, and Peace of the Community; he walk'd Hand in Hand with <hi>Aaron,</hi> indulg'd the greateſt Intimacy, and gave him peculiar Marks of his Friendſhip &amp; Love. Yea, God himſelf taught <hi>Moſes</hi> thus to do, by putting peculiar Marks of Honour &amp; Reſpect upon <hi>Aaron;</hi> not as a Man, or as a good Man, but as one who ſuſtain'd a high Office, as one from whom, God expected much Serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

He admitted him to frequent Intercourſes with Heaven, and often ſent him with <hi>Moſes,</hi> to do the Meſſages of the Lord to Iſrael. Hence we find upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſo many good Laws &amp; Counſels, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with thoſe Words, <hi>And the Lord ſpake
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006989_0018_102AB28354457FB8"/>
unto Moſes and Aaron, ſaying.</hi> Yea, the holy anointing Oil, wherewith <hi>Moſes</hi> was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to anoint <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them, that they might miniſter unto the Lord in the Prieſts Office, was emblematical of Love, and Friendſhip, the grand Cement, &amp; Band of Unity; and Foundation of laſting Peace, &amp; Felicity to a Commonwealth, Pſal 133. 1, 2. <hi>Behold how good, and how pleaſant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity. It is like the precious Ointment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even Aaron's Beard, that went down to the ſkirts of his Garment.</hi> Moſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts towards him, as one ſenſible of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Notices, which God had taken of him, as one ſenſible of the vaſt Importance of the Buſineſs aſſign'd him, of the Good he would hopefully do by his Miniſtry, and of his Need of his Brother's Help. And verily if <hi>Aaron</hi> was to <hi>Moſes inſtead of a Mouth, Moſes</hi> was to him <hi>inſtead of God.</hi> And as <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Friend to <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſo was he to <hi>Aaron's</hi> Work, even the Buſineſs of the Prieſthood, which was aſſign'd him. He was Zealous for the Worſhip of his God, and manifeſted it by the Laws which he publiſh'd in the Name of the Lord, and by the Puniſhments he inflicted upon thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan'd God's Worſhip and Ordinances, and by the ample Support, he made for thoſe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon the Altar. Thus he declares in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006989_0019_102AB25410B33520"/>
the Name of the Lord. Levit. 19 30. <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my Sanctuary.</hi> And when one was found breaking the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Moſes</hi> by Divine Command, orders him to be ſtoned to Death. And as to the Support of thoſe that attended at God's Altar, his Books are full of it, and very large Proviſion is made for it. Indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> acted in all theſe Things, by immediate Divine Command; theſe Laws, and Appointments, iſſued from the Throne of Heaven. But <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews that his Heart was in them, &amp; that they were as truly his Laws, as thô they had been the Reſult of his own cool judicious Reaſoning &amp; Reflection, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd upon his own wiſeſt Obſervation, and Experience. He gave fully into them, and adapted them, as the Rule of his Government, and adher'd to them with an invariable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. As to the minute Circumſtances of the Life of this great Ruler, the Hiſtory is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſilent. Thô the ſacred Pages, ſong after has Deceaſe, ſpeak of him with Epithets of Honour; ſuch as <hi>the Man of God,</hi> a <hi>powerful Interceſſor with God,</hi> and an intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Heaven. But if we take a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of him, only from his <hi>five Books,</hi> we may read in him the accompliſh'd General, facing Danger with an intrepid Courage, meeting Hardſhips with an unſhaken Firmneſs &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſubmitting to Diſappointments, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006989_0020_102AB286776B64A8"/>
bearing up under heavy Burthens, with Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Meekneſs of Temper, and leading Iſrael with Skilfulneſs of Hand. We may read in him the divine Lawgiver, &amp; the diſintereſted Judge; a hearty Friend to the eſtabliſh'd Worſhip of God, a nurſing Father to the Church, and an Encouragement, &amp; Support to a faithful Miniſtry. As theſe are things which meet in a great Ruler, ſo in theſe ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of Life, <hi>Moſes</hi> conducted with that Integrity &amp; Uprightneſs, as to ſhew himſelf heartily attach'd, to his God, and to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that his Mind was very much attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd to the Divine Mind. And in the whole he has left an Example, very well worthy the Imitation of all thoſe, who act in the ſame public Capacities that he did.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Servant of the Lord, and a very obedient one too, thrô the Courſe of his Life, ſo he was obedient even in Death. <hi>For according to the Word of the Lord;</hi> or at God's bidding, <hi>he went up from the Plains of Moab, unto Mount Nebo, and died there in the Land of Moab.</hi>—And is he dead? Yea, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Moſes the Servant of the Lord died there, in the Land of Moab.</p>
            <p>This brings me</p>
            <p>II. <hi>To conſider Moſes as the dying Man.</hi> We have conſider'd him hitherto as the Hero of his Age, the Leader of the Hebrew Bands,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006989_0021_102AB2565F538800"/>
the Scourge, and Terrour of their Enemies, the Friend of GOD, and a powerful Interceſſor with Heaven. But the Scene now ſhifts, the Curtains draw, Gloomineſs, and the Shadow of Death cover him. One would as ſoon have pitch'd upon Moſes as any Man, to have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brav'd the Jaws of Death, and gone tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing Body &amp; Soul up to Heaven. But he drags the Load of Fleſh no higher, than to the Top of Nebo, where his Soul drops its Burthen, and wings her Way to the upper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. If Piety, and the Love of GOD, could have exempted him from Death, if true For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, &amp; Greatneſs could have driven back the King of Terrours, if the greateſt Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his People, join'd with their Prayers, and Tears, could have repriev'd him from the Grave, he had not died. But, like the meaneſt of Men, he muſt pay this laſt Debt to Nature, &amp; return Duſt to Duſt. Death, commiſſion'd Death <hi>cuts off the ſpirit of Princes, and is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the Kings of the Earth.</hi> The Angel of Death it ſeems had no Reſpect to Perſons. There were thouſands in Iſrael, that could have been better ſpar'd than Moſes: Thouſands whoſe Death would not have made ſuch a Breach, as the Death of this one Man; at a Time when they were juſt about to paſs thrô <hi>Jordan,</hi> and encounter many powerful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. At this Juncture eſpecially, they needed
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006989_0022_102AB288B3A72118"/>
the Aſſiſtance of this aged experienc'd, and brave General, and the Influence of his Name: They wanted his prudent Counſel, and his Prayers. But he muſt encounter his laſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and there could be no Diſcharge in that War: Iſrael muſt fight their own Enemies, and leave their Leader, and their Prince, to be vanquiſh'd by his, without being able to reſcue or aſſiſt him. Moſes ſprung from the ſame common Stock with the reſt of Mankind, and muſt ſhare the common Fate with them. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence indeed had notably diſtinguiſh'd him from his Brethren, but his Nature was but human, and the Seeds of Mortality lurk'd within it, beneath the pompous Appearance of Honour, and Majeſty, unſubdu'd Power, and Victory. Moſes like other Men was but Duſt in his Original, and muſt return to it by Putrefaction. As there was a Time for him to be born, ſo he muſt find Time to die; yea, thô he was a God he muſt die like a Man, and fall like one of the Princes: Thò he was a God, <hi>i. e.</hi> bore ſome Reſemblance of Him, in Honour, Power, Influence, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> yet he was not like GOD Immortal; but like other Men a dying Creature: Thô at the age of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty his Eye was not dim, nor his natural Force abated, yet he had the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Mortality within him, and, like other Men, was liable to Wearineſs, Pain, &amp; Diſeaſe,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006989_0023_102AB2581F644140"/>
thoſe Harbingers of Death, and, like other Men, at laſt gave up the Ghoſt. Moſes, and the Patriarchs liv'd to a greater Age than is common now: But Death reign'd from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam to Moſes incluſively, as effectually as it does now: The Robe of Royalty, the Coat of Mail, could no more then than now, ſcrene the Prince from the King of Terrors, nor guard againſt his deadly Shafts; no, the Prince chang'd theſe for a funeral Habit, and the Diſhonours of the Grave: But if his Greatneſs could not diſtinguiſh him from other Men in his laſt Moments, his Goodneſs could: For when he had ſome Praemonitions given him, of his approaching Diſſolution, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, and ſhews no Concern for himſelf, but is very ſolicitous for Iſrael, and pleads im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with God for a Succeſſor in the Government, to be ſet over them: Numb. 27 12, &amp; on. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, get thee up into this Mount Abarim, and ſee the Land which I have given unto the Children of Iſrael, and when thou haſt ſeen it, thou alſo ſhalt be gathered unto thy People, as Aaron thy Brother was gathered.—And Moſes ſpake unto the Lord, ſaying, Let the Lord, the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, ſet a Man over the Congregation, which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,</hi> &amp;c. As he had been illuſtrious thro' a troubleſome
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006989_0024_102AB28BAB78F3B8"/>
fatiguing, but very uſeful Life; ſo he appear'd as a dying Man nobly great, and good. The certain Proſpect of a ſpeedy Departure, could not divide Iſrael from his Heart, nor abate his affectionate paternal Care, and Concern for them. He could not be willing to leave Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, at that critical Juncture, 'till he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of GOD, a Ruler for Iſrael, one who ſhould have Part of Moſes's Honour put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and to whom the Children of Iſrael ſhould be obedient. This obtain'd, the dying Prophet ſings the Majeſty of GOD, in that rapturous Song, recorded in Deut. 33d. <hi>The Lord came from Sinai, and roſe up from Seir unto them; he ſhin'd forth from Mount Paran, and he came with ten thouſands of Saints: from his right Hand went a fiery Law,</hi> &amp;c.

it of them, that they appear, when Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity calls for it; either Perſonally, or by brave, and well choſen Generals, in the high Places of the Field, to ſubdue the Rebel, and drive back the invading Foe. Yea, the Caſe may be ſuch, as to make it their Duty to carry War, into neighbouring Kingdoms, for the Defence of their Countries Property, &amp; Right: As where Neighbouring Kingdoms, or States commit Robbery, and incroach upon them, and refuſe Recompence. Such inteſtine mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunous Jars, ſuch Invaſions, &amp; Incroachments, threaten the very Being of the Government where they are, and unleſs prevented, muſt Iſſue in the Diſſolution of it. The Being of the Commonwealth requires; that ſuch Power be lodg'd in the Civil Magiſtrates Hand, and the well-being of it requires, that on ſuch ſpecial Occaſions this Power be exerciſed. It behoves thoſe then who ſet at Helm, to face the Danger, and call forth thoſe, that are at their Command, to make a Stand againſt it, and ſave their Country.</p>
            <p>And in doing this, they fulfil one good Part of their Character, even that of Shields of the Earth: Which is a Title given to Rulers by the Royal Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. 9. <hi>The Princes of the People are gathered together, even the People of the God of Abraham; for the Shields of the Earth belong unto God.</hi>—The Shield

was a Piece of Armour, formerly uſed for a Defence in Battle, and as here uſed, 'tis a happy Figure repreſenting the Protection, Defence, and Safeguard, which good Rulers are to their Land, againſt the Power, &amp; Craft of their Enemies. When civil Diſcord, and Rebellion, broke out in Iſrael, in the Inſtance of <hi>Korah,</hi> &amp; his Company, <hi>Moſes</hi> immediately interpoſes for the Subduing of it.</p>
            <p>And ſo when his People were call'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter mighty Nations, he very readily fac'd the Danger, &amp; eminently fulfil'd the Character, of the Shield of Iſrael: ſo did the other good Rulers of Iſrael that ſucceeded him. What an Ornament, and Glory, as well as Safeguard to a Land, is the good Ruler, who in the midſt of thoſe Storms, foreign and domeſtick which beat upon a State, ſtands like a Rock in the Sea, it breaks the Waves, but remains firm and unſhaken itſelf.</p>
            <p>But alas the want of ſuch Shields! After the Death of Moſes, and Joſhua, when there was no King in Iſrael, and every man did what was right in his own Eyes, tho' it was wrong in the Eyes of every Body elſe: Behold what Confuſion! Civil War preſently aroſe between the Tribes, and more than twenty thouſand of them fell in one Day. And this, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this, is too eaſily and too often the Caſe when a Community have not men at

            <p n="2">2. <hi>It becomes the civil Ruler to make, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapt good Laws,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſee them well executed.</hi> In a ſtate of Innocence and Perfection, where Light and Love direct the Way, and govern every Action; there would doubtleſs be no need of any other Laws, than thoſe which are eternal, &amp; neceſſary in their own Nature, which are written upon the Mind of every intelligent Creature, in Characters ſo deep, as never to be effac'd. But in a ſtate of Things like this, in a world where every Thing is out of Order, &amp; nothing more ſo, than the minds of men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their wills &amp; affections, the leading Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul there is the utmoſt need of good Laws guarded by well choſen Sanctions. The Safety, Peace, &amp; Proſperity of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that have been under the happy Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Reſtraint of ſuch Laws, ſpeaks this Truth aloud; but the Rapine, Wars, &amp; Blood, of ſome barbarous, Ignorant, and lawleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſpeak it louder. The highland Clans, and the Crooms of Guinea, are ſad Inſtances of this. The latter eſpecially proves that the want of good Laws well executed or in other words, the want of a well concerted Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, makes one of the richeſt Parts of the Globe, a Field of Robbery &amp; Blood; where,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006989_0029_102AB261A0508D70"/>
neither Property, Liberty, nor Life, is in any tolerable Meaſure ſecure. But civil Rulers, which are Miniſters of GOD, for good to the People, are to attend upon this very Thing, among others, and take Care that they have a good Syſtem of Laws, grounded upon the Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Things, the everlaſting Rules of Truth and Juſtice; and well adapted to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and State of their People. <q>Upon this depends the very Foundations of all civil Government, and of all mutual Society a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; for by them the Magiſtrate is directed how to govern, &amp; the People how far to obey; the Magiſtrate by them is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Poſſeſſion of his Authority over the People, and the People too by them are ſecured from the arbitrary Power, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Demands of the Magiſtrate, as well as from the Fraud, Violence, &amp; Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of each other.</q>

The Divine Law will furniſh the Magiſtrate with a good Model, and the general Direction of Scripture will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly help him, in drawing the Plan for a noble Body of Laws. But as the State of the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006989_0030_102AB2929F787138"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> differ'd from that of every other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo their Laws taken collectively won't ſuit the Conſtitution of any Nation under Heaven. And indeed ſuch are the different Circumſtances, and Conſtitutions of different Kingdoms, and Governments, that no one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Laws would ſuit any two diſtinct Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. And yet perhaps there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned well inform'd common wealth, but what has ſome Laws peculiar to it ſelf, that might well be adapted by another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis therefore doubtleſs a Duty, which the civil Magiſtrate owes to his People, to look over the Archives of the beſt model'd, &amp; moſt flouriſhing Kingdoms. And having collected a good Body of Laws, it remains a Duty for the Magiſtrate to ſee that they are well exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. It will be to very little Purpoſe to have good Laws, without a good Execution of them. Thoſe that need Laws moſt, will be leaſt influenc'd by them, if there is nothing more in them than the Reaſon of Things, and the Magiſtrates word. The Law is made for the lawleſs and diſobedient; but 'tis the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Penalty of the Law, rather than the Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Reaſon of it, that reſtrains, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns them. Hence it becomes the chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Common wealth, to take ſpecial Care, that the executive Courts are provided with men of ſtrict Juſtice, good Improvement,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006989_0031_102AB2632C0FF3F8"/>
and Penetration. The civil Government of <hi>Athens</hi> was juſtly eſteem'd one of the beſt in the World. Among Heathen Governments there was none in the Age, wherein <hi>Athens</hi> flouriſh'd, that could claim Preeſidence, if E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality with it. And never did their Glory riſe higher than under the adminiſtration of <hi>Solon,</hi> that great, and wiſe Lawgiver, and two or three more, who after ſome Interruption in the Government, ſucceeded him, reſtor'd his Laws, and improv'd upon them. But <hi>Solon</hi> was as careful to have his Laws well executed, as he was to give good Laws, and endeavour'd that his People ſhould be govern'd by them after his Death at leaſt an hundred Years; and bound every one of the Senate by a ſolemn Oath, and the Forfeiture of a Golden Statue, as big as himſelf, not to Violate one Statute.</p>
            <p>There can certainly be no Safety in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity where there are not both good Laws, and a faithful Execution of them. Nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe can the civil Magiſtrate by any means fulfil the Character of a faithful Servant of the Lord, or Father of his Country.—Indeed while he acts the Part of a true Patriot, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating, and executing Laws for the Suppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vice, and the Promotion of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; 'tis next to certain, that Men of perverſe Minds, that hate to be reclaim'd, Men of party Spirits that are ever impatient under

Checks, and Men govern'd merely by ſiniſter Views, whoſe private Intereſt is the Rule, and Meaſure of their whole Lives, 'tis almoſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Men of this Stamp will make a Noiſe, and eſpecially if they be any Thing numerous (as is too often the Caſe) they will endeavour to raiſe a Storm in the Community.</p>
            <p>But the good Ruler regardleſs of this, like the good Pilot, will keep a ſteady Courſe thrô the Storm, with a ſteady Pace bearing down upon Injuſtice, and Vice, and eſpecially upon the popular Evil that threatens the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if thrô the Weakneſs of honeſt Men, or the Wickedneſs of others, he falls from his Seat in the Defence of his Country; he falls a noble Sacrifice, 'tis a Death worth dying, a Death more honourable than a Life preſerv'd by a ſervile Temper, and mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.</p>

'Thô a civil Community may flouriſh, has flouriſh'd even in a heatheniſh Land where God had no Church, or peculiar People, yet I may venture to ſay, a civil Community never flouriſh'd without ſupporting, and being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, by thoſe two great Ornaments of a Church, <abbr>

Turn, not only without, but even in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the civil Magiſtrate. The Church of Chriſt in the early Ages of it, flouriſh'd intire upon her own Baſis; <q>And made wonderful Progreſs againſt all Oppoſition from the Bigotry of the Vulgar, the Power of the Great, and the Wiſdom of Philoſophy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this was at a Time when the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate was <hi>Heathen,</hi> and when the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, and Church State were to be ſet aſide, and diſſolv'd; and a new, and diſtinct Oeconomy and Diſpenſation to take Place in the World. A Change this, ſo great, and ſo over-bearing, to <hi>Jewiſh-Bigotry,</hi> and <hi>Gentile Idolatry,</hi> that nothing leſs than Miracles could prove ſuch Change to be the Will of God. And doubtleſs the rapid Progreſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and it's ſurprizing Spread, when Earth, &amp; Hell were combin'd for its Suppreſſion, was deſign'd as a miraculous Proof, that <hi>Judaiſm</hi> was now ended, and <hi>Chriſtanity</hi> to take the Place of it. And this being the Deſign of its great Author, no Wonder it flouriſh'd in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of all the Powers that were ingag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. 'Tis perhaps from this that ſome very weak People ſeem to think that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel would flouriſh moſt, when it was moſt oppos'd, and accordingly have invited Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and had rather break over the Rules of Decency, &amp; Chriſtianity than not be oppoſed.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006989_0035_102AB269B65E7CD0"/>
But notwithſtanding Chriſtianity has flouriſh'd without the Aſſiſtance of the civil Power, and even in oppoſition to it, whilſt the Magiſtrate was <hi>Heathen,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> needed Miracles for its Support, and Proof; can we thence conclude, that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> would be likely to flouriſh more eminently in Oppoſition to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtrate, in a Country where it is generally profeſs'd; or that the Magiſtrates Countenance, Example, and Influence, would not ſerve the Cauſe of Chriſtianity. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are to admit no ſuch Thing.</p>
            <p>That God that hath inſtituted the Chriſtian Religion, hath alſo appointed civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that 'tis to make the Inſtitutions of Heaven claſh with one another, to ſuppoſe that the Chriſtian Religion would flouriſh moſt, when the civil Magiſtrate moſt oppos'd it. In a common ſtate of Things, where Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty generally obtains, and the Proofs of it's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity are admitted; the foregoing Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carries in it nothing leſs abſurd, than this, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz</hi>
               </abbr> that the Appointments of Heaven are ſo jarring &amp; inconſiſtent, that the Being and Life of one depends upon the Deſtruction of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And althô (as before obſerv'd) in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtate of Things, the Church of Chriſt has flouriſh'd in Oppoſition to the civil Magiſtrate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet at other Times under Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution has been cover'd with Aſhes, has

mourn'd, &amp; fled into the Wilderneſs, &amp; ſeem'd as tho' ſhe wound be intirely extinct.</p>
            <p>Tis evident that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> thought they never walk'd ſtronger than when they walk'd Hand in Hand, and that the civil and religious Intereſts of the People, on one Hand, and civil and religious Diſcord on the other, would riſe &amp; fall together. Hence they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd not to oppoſe, but to Strengthen each other; <hi>Aaron</hi> for a Mouth to <hi>Moſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp; <hi>Moſes</hi> inſtead of GOD, <hi>i. e.</hi> for a Head &amp; Ruler un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aaron.</hi> Undoubtedly the civil Magiſtrate may like a nurſing Father, protect, encourage, and ſtrengthen the Church of God, and the Worſhip of God; by Influence, by a good Example, and even by well concerted Laws reſpecting the Temporalities of the Church. And this Way he is to approve himſelf the Friend of GOD, a nurſing Father to the Church, and an Encourager of Divine Worſhip. In Things of a temporal civil Nature, the civil Magiſtrate has undoubted Right to interpoſe his Authority for the Church: but not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Dominion over the Conſciences of Men, by impoſing Articles of Faith, and enforcing Subſcriptions with Penalties; for <hi>though the Purſe is Caeſars, the Conſcience is God's:</hi> And Authority of this Kind exercis'd by Men, is a bold Uſurpation of CHRIST's Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and thô it might be moderate, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006989_0037_102AB29D93A724A8"/>
modeſt at firſt, it would probably enough end, in all the Fooleries, and Butcheries of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such Authority may make Fools, it may make Knaves, but it will never make Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Plea of Conſcience I am ſensible is a Subterfuge, where ſometimes honeſt weak Men, and oftner wicked deſigning ones take Sanctuary to defend themſelves from Law &amp; Juſtice, and to do infinite Miſchief in the World: But 'tis Conſcience, &amp; not mere Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to it, that is ſo ſacred &amp; inviolable.</p>
            <p>But whilſt the civil Magiſtrate leaves this to a higher Tribunal; there are many things tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Health, Peace, and flouriſhing ſtate of Zion which God requires, and his Church expects from the Magiſtrate, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears bold and very Couragious for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Vice of every Denomination, and the Encouragement of Vertue. Agreeably St. Paul in his Deſcription of the civil Ruler ſays, <hi>Rulers are not a Terrour to good Works, but to the evil.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3.</note> Yea God and his People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of civil Magiſtrates that they contribute their Aſſiſtance to the ſupport and well being of the Church, by the encouragement of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſupporting Schools the leſs with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but eſpecially the Schools of the Prophets, &amp; endowing them with thoſe Privileges which
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006989_0038_102B2090B8CFFDB8"/>
are very needful to form men for Temple Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that Zion may have of her <hi>Sons for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of her young men for Nazarites.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Moreover the civil Magiſtrate fulfilling the Character of a nurſing Father to the Church, is to add to theſe, the Force, and Influence of his own Example, going before the People in the Paths of Vertue, and Shining in all the Graces of the Chriſtian Life.</p>
            <p>And indeed theſe are things neceſſary to the well-being of the Government. Without Vice ſuppreſt, Vertue encouraged, and Learning promoted, a civil Government can't ſubſiſt long, the Foundations will ſap, and the whole Frame of Government muſt fall.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It becomes civil Rulers to remember, that they are Servants of the Lord; but Servants dignify'd above the reſt of their fellow-Servants.</hi> Moſes that Divine Man, althô he was the Head of Iſrael, their Ruler and their Judge; yet was himſelf rul'd of GOD, and was but his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Indeed all are but Servants unto GOD; he makes even his Angels miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: and from the Seraph down to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Inſect 'tis true of all, that they are Servants unto him.</p>
            <p>The civil Magiſtrate is ſo. Thô they may be high honour'd, and rever'd as God's, yet they are Servants of the Lord, and as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006989_0039_102AB2D3F0A2B6D0"/>
upon their Maker and Maſter, as the moſt abject Slave.</p>
            <p>Thô they may have thouſands at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and ſay unto one go, and he goes, and to another come and he comes, yet they are themſelves Servants of the Lord, &amp; muſt come &amp; go at his bidding, they muſt ſerve the Lord, with Fear, &amp; be intirely ſubmiſſive to his Will. Thô they may have the Power of Life and Death, ſo that whom they will they kill, and whom they will they ſave alive, yet after all they are but Servants unto God, and there's not a Soul of them that can ranſom his own Life from the Grave.</p>
            <p>As this is the caſe with civil Magiſtrates even the moſt independant of them; ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them to remember it, &amp; improve it as an Argument to Fidelity; for 'tis required of Stewards, of Servants, that they be faithful. They have a high Truſt repoſed in them, and many Talents committed to them, to occupy in their Maſters Abſence; their Work is great, their Privileges great, and their Reward, if faithful will alſo be great when their LORD ſhall return having received a Kingdom.—<hi>Be wiſe now therefore, O ye Kings: be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ye Judges of the Earth. Serve the Lord with Fear,</hi> &amp; <hi>rejoice with Trembling. Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way.</hi>

But whilſt the civil Magiſtrate remembers that he is a Servant, he muſt conſider of what Claſs he is, that he is dignify'd above the reſt of his Fellow-Servants, he muſt ſteadily bear it in mind, leſt he ſhould act beneath his Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and forfeit the Honour which his Maſter has put upon him.</p>
            <p>Thô Mankind are all of one Blood, yet all don't ſtand upon a level; there are Superiors and Inferiors, as well as Equals among them. Civil Rulers are of the higheſt Order amongſt Men; they are cloathed with the Robes of royalty and majeſty, and in their Office bear ſome reſemblance of the great Governour of the World; like him they are to conſult the good of Men, like him to protect their People from Injuries, to puniſh Vice and reward Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſhed their Kindly influence upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The Lord Almighty has given them the Title of Gods, has put on them ſome of his Honour, and made them ſhine with ſome faint Beams of his Glory, giving us in them a ſmall Specimen of his Greatneſs, Authority and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributive Juſtice. A powerful Argument muſt this be with the good Ruler to act up to the dignity of his Office, and never to ſully thoſe divine Features which he bears: This ſhould be a powerful inducement to him, to reſemble Him, whoſe Title and Honour he ſuſtains, to be univerſally benevolent to mankind, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006989_0041_102AB2D6841F57F8"/>

            <p>The Conſideration that we are Men and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, and capable of an honourable and happy Alliance with the upper World, might well keep Men from Symbolizing with the Beaſt from groveling in the Duſt, &amp; mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Senſuality &amp; Luſt. Eſpecially then the Conſideration of a ſtate of Eminence, and Superiority in Life, ought powerfully to guard the Magiſtrate againſt whatſoever is low and mean, ſervile and ſenſual, againſt whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever miſbecomes a Man, that is the off-ſpring of GOD.—The Remembrance, and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a ſtate of Dignity, and Eminence in the World, may, and it ought to ſerve theſe noble Purpoſes. But 'tis ſadly otherwiſe, when Men take Occaſion from their advanc'd Station, to nurſe falſe Conceptions of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to feed their Vanity, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more than mortal Gods; when they grow giddy, and look down from their Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Contempt upon the reſt of Mankind, as Creatures made only for their Service, and to bear Burthens. This Temper generally iſſues in a Neglect of public Intereſt, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006989_0042_102AB2A2320AD250"/>
and Tyranny. But there is enough in the Conſtitution of Mankind to qualify in the good Ruler His exalted, dignify'd State, enough in it, thoroughly weigh'd, to allay in the haughty Ruler, the Teemor which puffs him up. For,</p>

There is enough in the Thought, that the Ruler is the dying Man to prevent falſe Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and allay the Pride of Granduer &amp; high Title, and this is the wiſe Improvement, which the Ruler ſhould make of the Admonitions given by the Death of others, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation upon his own Mortality, even this to abate high Thoughts of himſelf: not to keep him from acting in his proper Sphere of Elevation, but to keep him from over acting
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006989_0046_102AB2A7F4134898"/>
of it. For as on the one Hand, he is the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd Servant of the Lord, <hi>and therefore is not to Settle into low Life,</hi> but to keep up the Diſtinction which Providence has made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and other Men, and to act with a Greatneſs becoming his Character. So on the other Hand, he is the dying Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the great Buſineſs of Life, he is to look upon himſelf like other Men, Mortal and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable: and that the Diſtinction which Providence has put upon him in the World, is but a paſſing ſhort liv'd Thing, not given him to make him abſolute, but to improve for the Honour of his Maſter, &amp; the good of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servants. The good Ruler implies the Man &amp; the Chriſtian, and ſince, like them, he is to die; ſo he ſhould always act with a proper Reference to Death and the following State, remembring that he carries about with him continually the Seeds of Mortality, and that <hi>his Life,</hi> like the Honour of it, <hi>is even a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, which appeareth for a little Time and then vaniſheth away.</hi>

by ſome Touches upon ſeveral Things in the public Parts of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Conduct, wherein he approv'd himſelf eminently the Servant of GOD, and a dignify'd one too, and wherein he appear'd after all but a mortal Man.</p>
            <p>Had the Character been drawn to the Life it would have been a perfect Mirrour of good Government. In it we ſhould have ſeen, the able General, the wiſe Lawgiver, the accompliſh'd Judge, the Friend of GOD, and after all, Greatneſs, and Goodneſs ſubmitting to the irreſiſtable Power of Death. But changing the Things that are to be chang'd there is nothing in the Character of this great Man thus conſider'd, but what ſpeaks <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Uſeful</hi> to You; my renown'd Fathers.</p>

I know 'tis natural for them to complain 'tis equally natural for us to treat that affair with too much Parſimony. At preſent we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Peace; bleſſed be GOD for it: long may it laſt; may a good Agreement, and Friendſhip among the Nations cement, and flouriſh whilſt the Scars endure. But if GOD in righteous Judgment ſhould ſuffer War to ariſe, between us, and the Northern Tribes; what but the Lives, &amp; Fortunes of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in that Province, could ſave us from their unhappy Lot?

            <p>YOU, our venerable Rulers, are under GOD the Guardians of our Lives, and of what ever elſe is dear to us in the World.

            <p>But ſo different are the private Intereſt of Men, ſo various and headſtrong their Paſſions and Luſts, that good Laws and a ſtrict Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, will probably bring upon you the Odium of many. But remember Sirs! that ye are the Servants of GOD, and not of Sin, that ye are to pleaſe GOD by obeying his Will in conſulting your Country's Good, and not to pleaſe unreaſonable Men by obeying their Humours. 'Tis the Evidence of a Mind truly great, and a neceſſary Ingredient in the Character of a wiſe Ruler, to be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern at a Diſtance his Country's Intereſt and Safety, and beholding it, to follow his own Light, with a ſteady Pace, thro' all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which it points out to him, amidſt undeſerv'd Reproaches, and hard Treatment. Remember Sirs, the vaſt Difference between the good Ruler and the bad one. One is as the Light of the Morning, when the Sun riſeth, even a Morning without Clouds,<note n="§" place="bottom">2 <hi>Sam,</hi> 23. 4.</note> a Comfort and a Bleſſing to the People.

            <p>Moreover, Was <hi>Moſes</hi> the Friend of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and a ſupport to public Worſhip: ſo ſhould you our honour'd Rulers, be nurſing Fathers to the Church of God. The Subject I have been upon, would ſuffer me without Digreſſion to beſpeak your ſpecial Favour, to the Goſpel Miniſtry, but I wave it; and in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of my Fathers, and Brethren as well as for my ſelf, return you our hearty Thanks, for the many Favours confer'd upon us, &amp; the ſeveral Exemptions indulg'd us, by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Body of this People.

            <p>But for Zions ſake I will not hold my Peace. Such is the Tie between the civil &amp; religious Intereſt of a People, that 'tis ſcarcely to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they will flouriſh ſeparately. So that were it only upon political Views, you muſt be greatly wanting to the People under your Government, if you ſhould not to the utmoſt, endeavour the Promotion of real Religion.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:006989_0054_102AB2AD6087F8F0"/>
Peace, can never doubt the Truth of this. Yea whoever conſiders well the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, which there is between the ſeveral Branches of moral Vertue, ſuch as Temperance, Chaſtity, Moderation, Meekneſs, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> upon one Hand; and Health, Peace, Frugality &amp; good Behaviour, upon the other; or in a Word, whoever conſiders the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection which there is between Holineſs and temporal Felicity, muſt allow that the civil Ruler is ſtrictly bound to encourage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote true Religion, as be conſults the good of the Body politick. But this is not all, 'tis but the leaſt Part, our all is embark'd, not only the comfort of this tranſitory World, but our everlaſting well-being depends upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Holineſs, the Religion of our Minds, which can never flouriſh without a good moral Behaviour; and the externals of Chriſtianity. Here then with that deference due to my honour'd Fathers, and Superiours, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with an earneſtneſs becoming the importance of the Subject, I aſk your Influence and Aſſiſtance, to encourage Religion, ſupport the Goſpel, and maintain Peace, Purity, and good Order in the Church. <hi>Zion</hi> always had her Enemies, the Children of <hi>Edom</hi> were not the firſt, nor the laſt that ſaid, raſe it, raſe it to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

the ſpecious: pretence of Conſcience. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a ſacred Thing, and to be treated with the utmoſt Tenderneſs, but the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to it, are often made uſe or to cover the baſeſt Deſigns.</p>

And if for your pious Attachment to the civil or religious Immunity's of this People, you ſhould ever be traduc'd, and malign'd by any under your Government: If the ill Treatment only affects you Perſonally; He who came down from Heaven, the Governour and Judge of the World, has left you a bleſſed Rule illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by his own Example, of forgiving the Injury. <hi>Father forgive them,</hi> was his dying Prayer for the wretched Rabble, that Mock'd him, that Spit upon him, and Crucify'd him; when, if he had Pleas'd, he might have Call'd his Father's Legions to have reveng'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. But if ſuch ill Treatment ſhould more than affect your Perſons, and thro' you ſhould ſtrike at Government, and threaten the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Safety and Peace, may that Wiſdom which is from above, point out the Methods of Redreſs.</p>

               <hi>For Zions ſake,</hi> let me alſo aſk of you, my <hi>renowned Fathers,</hi> your kind Influence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Schools of Learning, eſpecially the College within the Colony, that it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd

with the beſt Advantages, to form Men to Vertue, and Holineſs, furniſh them with the moſt Uſeful Learning, and fit them for the Service of the Temple, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Country.</p>
            <p>And thus fulfilling the Character of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd Servants of the Lord, may your Days be filled with Honour, and Uſefulneſs, and Peace, until GOD ſhall call you off from Service.</p>
            <p>For verily, Sirs, ye are Mortal and muſt Die. 'Tis a memorable Inſtance of Wiſdom in a Macedonian Prince, that he ordered theſe Words to be pronounc'd in his hearing every Day, <hi>"Remember Sir, that you are a Man."</hi> Tho' we reverence, and honour you as our Fathers and Rulers, and call you Gods, yet you are to remember that you are haſt'ning over into the World of Spirits, where all preſent Diſtinction will be loſt. The Habit of your Minds, but not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your Names will go with you. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Grandure and Title, wont be the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your future Glory. Remember that but few Days divide you from the eternal World. It certainly becomes you, my honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Fathers, that are in the higheſt ſtate of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation, to look down into the dark Valley, and conſider, that you, with other Men, are ſhortly to take a lodging with the Worms.</p>

               <hi>II.</hi> I ſhall briefly Addreſs my ſelf to <hi>my Fathers, and Brethren in the</hi> MINISTRY.</p>
            <p>As the good Ruler is the Friend of GOD and the Friend of his Country, a Friend of <hi>Aaron</hi> and a Support of the public Worſhip; ſo it behoves us eſpecially, to wiſh them well, to Pray for them continually, to contribute to the utmoſt of our Power towards ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Hands, and increaſing their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Aaron</hi> was a Mouth to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo ſhould we in ſome ſenſe be to the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: in ſpeaking to God for them, in ſpreading their Caſe before his Throne, in pleading with him that all needed Light and Support, may be afforded them, and that they may be both faithful and ſucceſsful in their high Truſt. We are alſo to be their Mouth as well as the Mouth of GOD to the People, in warning the People of our reſpective Charges, againſt thoſe Vices which threaten a State; as well as their own Souls, warning them againſt Sedition, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,

a mobbiſh Spirit, and all groundleſs Murmurs; <hi>teaching every Soul to be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi> and <hi>that ſo is the Will of GOD, that they ſubmit themſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the LORD's ſake, whether it be to the King as ſupream, or unto Governours, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>We have Duties to diſcharge both towards Rulers and Ruled, for both are mortal and accountable, both have Souls to ſave or looſe. And as our own Comfort and our Crown, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our Faithfulneſs to the Souls of Men; ſo we had need be Prayerful, &amp; Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to get a good Underſtanding of the Will of Chriſt, that we may know the Inſtructions that we are to give, and be able to deal out a Portion to every one in due Seaſon: Yea, and that we may be able to confront all Hereſies that ſpring up in the Church of GOD, and put to Silence Gainſayers. The Difficulty's, my Fathers and Brethren, with a faithful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our Truſt, in the diſpenſing the Goſpel, and the Seals of it, and which eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially private faithful Reproof, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic adminiſtration of Diſcipline, will bring upon us, will call for all our Fortitude, and Strength. We need the conſtant Supplies of divine Grace; we ſhall need the Exerciſe of

continual Faith in the Promiſes of GOD, and verily we may find abundant Support, from the Encouragements and Promiſes of the Goſpel, peculiar to a faithful Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>May we go forth in the Strength of CHRIST, and be faithful in all his Houſe.</p>
            <p>Let us remember, that as our Work is great, ſo our Time is ſhort. We have but our Day, and with many of us it is a Day far ſpent; the Evening is approaching: Our Fellow-labourers, very many of them, within a ſhort Time, have quitted their Labour, and are called Home. The Shadows of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening grow long, and we muſt haſten, my Fathers, out of the Vineyard; we muſt haſten Home; neither our Office, nor Uſefulneſs, nor the Prayers of our People, can exempt us from the common Fate. Princes, and Prieſts, and People, lie undiſtinguiſh'd beneath the Clods, as <hi>Moſes</hi> went to Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> ſo <hi>Aaron</hi> went to Mount <hi>Hor,</hi> and died there. Let us live well that we may die well; 'tis dying well, that perfects the Man's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; let us ſo live, that we may look, and long for the bleſſed Hope, and glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, of the great GOD, and our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR.</p>

Are our Rulers dignify'd Servants, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men? You are to honour, and ſubmit to them, but not adore them. Our Rulers are under GOD our Guardians, they have a high Truſt repos'd in them, a heavy Work lying upon them. Contribute your Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to leſſen the Weight, and make Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eaſie, by being yourſelves obedient, to every ſalutary righteous Ordinance of theirs, by ſetting a good Example, and uſing all your Influence to promote Peace, and Truth.
