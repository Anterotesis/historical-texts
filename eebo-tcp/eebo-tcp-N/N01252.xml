            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>An Eſſay to do GOOD.</hi> By a diſſwaſive from Tavern-haunting, and Exceſſive Drinking.</head>
            <head type="sub">By <hi>Benjamin Wadſworth,</hi> Paſtor of a Church of Chriſt in <hi>Boſton;</hi> together with a <hi>Lecture SERMON,</hi> by the ſame Author.</head>
            <p>TIS ſaid of our glorious Redeemer, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he went about <hi>doing good.</hi> Act 10.38. All his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>ſhould walk as he alſo walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6. They ſhould imitate him in <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good,</hi> as much as poſſibly they can; to be ſure <hi>Ministers of the Goſpel</hi> ſhould do ſo. And it muſt needs be reckon'd a good work, not only to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our own luſts and corruptions (which we ſhould chiefly and conſtantly endeavour to do) but alſo to prevent and ſuppreſs Sin in others, as much as poſſibly we can. Tis <hi>Brotherly, Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> kindneſs, to <hi>reprove</hi> others for and caution them againſt Sin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19 17. We ſhould eſpecially wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt, and endeavour to put a ſtop to, <hi>growing threatning Evils;</hi> and among <hi>Sundry ſuch</hi> evils in our Land; I reckon <hi>Exceſſive Drinking</hi> to be one. I therefore thought it proper and ſeaſonable, to bear ſome Teſtimony againſt this growing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001491_0002_0FB34FE26F7A9638"/>
by offering ſome few conſiderations, to thoſe who <hi>needleſly frequent Taverns;</hi> and alſo to <hi>Tavern-keepers,</hi> or to thoſe who <hi>Retail Drink,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are <hi>Innholders</hi> or not Yet leſt I ſhould be miſ-interpreted, or be thought to run into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams; I'll readily grant,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the keeping of Taverns, or Houſes of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, is not only lawful, but alſo very uſeful and convenient.</hi> The proper end and uſe of <hi>Taverns, Inns Ale-houſes, Victualing-houſes,</hi> or <hi>Houſes of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in general, is, the <hi>accommodating of Strangers and Travellers.</hi> If Perſons had no occaſion to be far from home, there would be no occaſion or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily for <hi>Taverns.</hi> But the neceſſary buſineſs of many (yea of moſt at one time or other) calls them to be abroad, <hi>Journeying</hi> or <hi>Trading</hi> far from home. Now when Perſons are thus diſtant from home, Houſes of Entertainment are needful, to accommodate them with <hi>Victuals, Drink, Lodgings, &amp;c.</hi> I grant,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Town-dwellers who are nigh home, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, have proper occaſions to go into Taverns, and ſtay a while there.</hi> No doubt but ſuch Town-dwellers (eſpecially thoſe who have moſt <hi>buſineſs</hi> with <hi>Strangers and Travellers</hi>) may ſometimes have real buſineſs at <hi>Taverns,</hi> and ſo have proper occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to go thither for the doing of it. And no doubt but when their buſineſs calls them there, they may allowably buy and uſe, what drink is proper and needful for their <hi>Refreſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant,</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>That the uſe of Strong Drink, yea of Strong Spirits, is not only Lawful, but in ſome caſes convenient.</hi> I verily believe, that various ſorts of Strong Drink are greatly abus'd in this Land, and <hi>Rum</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. But tho' many abuſe theſe things, it does
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001491_0003_0FB34FE4E73D6518"/>
not thence follow that 'tis unlawful to uſe them. I grant that even <hi>Distill'd Spirits</hi> may do good, when taken only in a moderate quantity, and only at ſuch times or ſeaſons, when there is <hi>proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> for them. But tho' I readily grant theſe three things but now mention'd, yet I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that multitudes of Perſons in this Land, are very criminal and blame-worthy; for their <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs haunting of Drinking-houſes,</hi> and ſpending their Time and Money there. Now out of hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the glory of God, the good of the Publick, and the benefit of ſuch faulty Perſons; I would Intreat, Exhort and Urge, thoſe who are thus blame-worthy, to reform ſuch their ill practices. Don't frequent <hi>Taverns</hi> (or any <hi>Drinking houſes,</hi> be they call'd by what name they will) don't ſpend your time, nor Money there, unleſs there be ſome <hi>real occaſion,</hi> ſome <hi>real buſineſs</hi> that calls you ſo to do. The Exhortation is,
<q>Don't needleſsly Spend your Time nor Money, at Drinking-houſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To move you to a compliance with this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſider, by thus doing,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You Sinfully Spend your</hi> TIME, <hi>which you muſt give an account to God for.</hi> 'Tis in God you live, move and have your being; he holds your Souls in Life, and preſerves your Spirits; every breath you draw, is a renew'd Inſtance of Divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. God who thus lengthens out your <hi>Time,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that the whole of it ſhould be ſo Imploy'd, as to bring glory to his Name. God ſaid of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Deut. 4.10. <hi>I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to</hi> FEAR ME ALL THE DAYS THAT THEY SHALL LIVE UPON THE EARTH. You ſhould Fear, Serve and Glorifie

God, <hi>all the time of your Life upon Earth</hi> And God will call you to an account, <hi>How you ſpend your Time,</hi> and for what you do upon Earth. 2 Cor. 5.10. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> Well, and what account can you give to God, of the Time needleſly (and therefore <hi>Sinfully</hi>) ſpent in <hi>Taverns?</hi> Oh how doleful will your account be, if ſpeedy hearty Repentance does not prevent? If that Time you <hi>needleſly</hi> ſpent in <hi>Taverns,</hi> had been ſpent in <hi>Reading Gods Word,</hi> in holy <hi>Meditâtion,</hi> in earneſt <hi>Prayer</hi> to God for Spiritual Bleſſings; how much would it have been, for the good of your precious Immortal Souls, and for your Joyful account in the day of Judgment? Such needleſs ſpending of Time and Money,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Wrongs your Outward Estates.</hi> All Chriſtians, ſhould be <hi>diligent</hi> in ſome lawful buſineſs. <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> it ſelf is a great Sin, and leads to many Sins. You ſhould be, <hi>Not ſlothful in buſineſs,</hi> Rom. 12.11. The <hi>Slothful,</hi> is called the <hi>Wicked,</hi> Servant; in our Lords Parable, <hi>Mat</hi> 25 26. The Inſpired Apoſtle ſays, 1 Theſ 4 11, 12 — <hi>Study to be quiet, and to do your own buſineſs, and to work with your hands as we commanded you — that ye may have lack of nothing.</hi> Eph. 4 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. — <hi>Let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> Theſe plain commands of God you break, by needleſs frequenting of <hi>Taverns.</hi> You not only <hi>neglect</hi> diligent proper means, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to <hi>Increaſe</hi> your Outward Eſtate (which might render you <hi>more Serviceable</hi> and Uſeful) but you alſo <hi>diminiſh</hi> and leſſen what you have. And if you Eſtates can bear ſuch expences at preſent;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001491_0005_0FB34FE79EEF24C8"/>
yet the courſe you follow, tends to <hi>Poverty:</hi> Prov. 23.21. <hi>The Drunkard and the Glutton ſhall come to Poverty; and drowſineſs ſhall clothe a man with rags.</hi> Tis eaſy to give many Inſtances, of Perſons who had competent Eſtates, good Buſineſs, good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and in likely way to thrive honeſtly in the World; who by frequenting of <hi>Taverns,</hi> have been brought to Poverty. And if your ill courſe in frequenting Taverns, brings you into low, ſtrait, impoveriſh'd circumſtances; then theſe (among other) miſchiefs are like to follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You will be unable to pay your juſt Debts to thoſe you deal with.</hi> Gods command is, Rom. 13 8. <hi>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid to the Widow, 2 King 4 7. <hi>Pay thy Debt,</hi> Pſal. 37.21. <hi>The wicked borroweth and payeth not again.</hi> Men are <hi>wicked,</hi> if they dont do their utmoſt to <hi>Pay their juſt Debts;</hi> but your ill courſe renders you unable to pay ſuch Debts, therefore your wicked courſe puts you on further wickedneſs. You imploy that to Serve the Devil, and gratifie your luſts; which ſhould go to ſatisfie your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. This is miſchievous wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You can't do what you ſhould, to Support the State and Government.</hi> Rom. 13.7 <hi>Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtom to whom cuſtom,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe who Serve the Publick, ſhould be paid by the Publick; <hi>Rates</hi> and <hi>Taxes</hi> are neceſſary to be paid, for the Publick Service, and to Support the State. But your Poverty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by your wickedneſs, renders you unable to do your part in this Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>You can't do what you ſhould, to Maintain Gods Publick Worſhip.</hi> The divine command is, Gal. 6.6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</hi> Prov. 3.9. <hi>Honour
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001491_0006_0FB34FE9207F9C50"/>
the Lord with thy Subſtance.</hi> Tis the undeniable Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians, to pay out of their Eſtates what's needful, for the honourable Support of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Miniſtry. But your Sinful ſpending what you have, renders you unable to do this Duty. By wickedly ſpending what you have, you <hi>Serve the Devil</hi> inſtead of <hi>Honouring the Lord,</hi> with your <hi>Subſtance.</hi> The <hi>Poverty</hi> which your <hi>Sin</hi> procures, not only makes you <hi>defraud Men</hi> but alſo <hi>rob God;</hi> you are guilty of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> Mal. 3.8— 10. Poſſibly I may be Scoff'd and Mock'd at for this, by the <hi>Intemperate</hi> and <hi>Profane;</hi> but if I am, I'le indeavour to bear it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>You can't Support and Maintain your own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi> Many Families are greatly impoveriſh'd, brought into neceſſitous pinching circumſtances; becauſe the heads of them <hi>haunt Taverns,</hi> live Idly, ſpend their Time and Money in <hi>Drinking, Gaming</hi> and other vicious practices. What ſhall I ſay to you that are thus guilty? I ſay! Nay hear what God ſays, 1 Tim. 5.8. <hi>But if any provide not for his own, and ſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe; he hath denyed the faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> It may be you would be vex'd with me, if I ſhould call you <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> but God ſays, you are <hi>worſe than ſuch</hi> For many <hi>Heathen</hi> carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their Families, but you wickedly neglect yours. IF Gods Word may be regarded (and ſurely it ſhould) you don't deſerve to be call'd <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but to be call'd <hi>worſe than Infidels.</hi> Nay, <hi>the Sea monſters draw out the breast, they give ſuck to their young ones,</hi> Lam 4.3. Birds and Beaſts will feed their Young Ones; therefore you act much worſe than they, if you ſuffer your Wives and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, your poor Children, to want what's need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, while you wickedly ſpend your Time and Money at <hi>Drinking-Houſes.</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001491_0007_0FB34FEA9F8D58C8"/>5. <hi>You become burdenſome to your honeſt Neighbours.</hi> When by your wicked Impoveriſhing courſes, you come to be very low, have nothing before hand, and it may be much in debt too; if God ſhould now ſend <hi>Sickneſs</hi> on you and your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, why you muſt periſh if your charitable Neighbours did not help you. Thoſe that were <hi>Sweating</hi> while you were <hi>Drinking;</hi> diligently <hi>Working</hi> while you were <hi>Idling,</hi> and <hi>Playing;</hi> thoſe who were <hi>Frugal, Diligent</hi> and <hi>Prudent,</hi> while you acted like <hi>Prodigals;</hi> muſt now Support you and yours, elſe you would periſh.

A <hi>Drunken Sot,</hi> deſerves to be <hi>contemned. Solomon</hi> tells us, Prov. 3.35. <hi>Shame ſhall be the promotion of Fools.</hi> The ill courſe you follow,</p>

            <p n="5">5. <hi>You are in danger of being led into</hi> OTHER SINS. One Sin often leads to others, and ſmaller offences make way for greater. It may be tho' you needleſly frequent Drinking-houſes, yet at preſent you are reckon'd <hi>Sober Perſons;</hi> you are

no Swearers, you are no Drunkards ſo as to <hi>Reel, Stagger, Spew</hi> as the <hi>common Sots</hi> do; well if it be ſo, yet you are in an ill courſe, and there's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger of your growing much worſe. If you are not <hi>Profane Swearers,</hi> yet poſſibly at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,</hi> you may meet with ſome <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> ſome children of the Devil <hi>Curſing, Swearing, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> as if they were <hi>dating God to deſtroy them.</hi> And by your needleſly coming into ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and hearing ſuch helliſh abominable words; who knows how far you may be left to Imitate them? And if you are not <hi>Staggering Drunken Sots</hi> already, 'tis to be fear'd the courſe you take, will bring you to it. It may be when you have been Sitting and Drinking a while, and are about to go home; then there comes in ſome other Neighbour, and ſo you'll ſtay ſome-what longer, to have a <hi>Pot,</hi> or <hi>Pint,</hi> or <hi>Jill</hi> with him, and thus you gradually proceed from bad to worſe. And poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in a little time, you'll come to be really buz'd, really overcome with Drink, <hi>really Drunk.</hi> And what a figure will you make then? what are you good for, or fit for, in your drunken fit? why, for no good to be ſure. You are not fit for any Service for God or Man; you're only fit to Serve the Devil. If <hi>Children</hi> are <hi>Gluttons</hi> and <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,</hi> no wonder if they are <hi>Stubborn and Rebellious,</hi> Deut. 21.20.

others againſt it.</hi> Some in their Drunken fits, are like <hi>raving mad Dogs,</hi> are ready to <hi>quarrel and fight with any they meet with.</hi> To ſuch an one we might well apply, Prov. 17.12. <hi>Let a Bear robbed of her Whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</hi> When men are drunk, how often do they <hi>Quarrel, Fight, Wound, Bruiſe, Maim</hi> one another; and hurt <hi>Sober Perſons</hi> that come in their way? Nay, ſometimes they'll cruelly beat their own <hi>Wives, Children,</hi> or <hi>beſt Friends.</hi> Yea very many <hi>Murders</hi> have been committed, by Perſons in their <hi>Drunken fits.</hi> A few Months ago, <hi>Two men were Executed at Briſtol,</hi> for being <hi>guilty of Murder</hi> in their <hi>Drunkenneſs.</hi> One in the County of <hi>Middle-ſex,</hi> was laſt Summer <hi>try'd for his Life,</hi> for <hi>Killing a Man,</hi> (even a <hi>Kinſman</hi> too) when both they and others had been Intemperately <hi>Drinking together.</hi> 'Twould be eaſy to give many inſtances, of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders committed by men in Drink.</hi> Alas, when men are <hi>depriv'd of Reaſon</hi> by <hi>Exceſs of Drink,</hi> what wickedneſs are they afraid or aſham'd of?

commit many <hi>other</hi> Sins. For when in drink, I have been often guilty of <hi>Curſing and Swearing,</hi> &amp; quarrelling, and ſtriking others. But the Sin that lies <hi>moſt heavy</hi> upon my Conſcience is, That <hi>I have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the Word of God,</hi> and many a time <hi>refuſed to bear it Preached.</hi> For theſe things, I believe God has left me to that, which has brought me to a ſhameful &amp; miſerable Death.

of a little Money, expoſe your ſelves to this Woe? What, <hi>do you provoke the Lord to Jealouſie? Are you stronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.22. When you incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or indulge your Neighbours, in the <hi>miſpence of time and money</hi> with you; as you <hi>provoke God</hi> and incur his diſpleaſure, ſo you greatly <hi>wrong your Neighbours too.</hi> If you ſhould Steal a <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>Sixpence</hi> from him, this would be a plain breach of the <hi>Eighth Commandment;</hi> yet this Theft would not ſo much hurt your Neighbour, as your Selling him ſo many Peny-worth of Drink if you be (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you often are) morally ſure, that he'll be <hi>Drunk with it.</hi> For when your Neighbour thus gets <hi>Drunk,</hi> he not only has ſpent his <hi>Money,</hi> but he <hi>hurts his Body and Soul</hi> too, with what his money paid for. By reading what I have already ſaid to <hi>Tavern haunters,</hi> you may ſee how <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> their courſe is; therefore if you incourage or connive at ſuch practices in them; you are in a great degree, chargeable with the <hi>ſin and miſchief attending them.</hi> When you incourage their miſpence of time and money, you then further them, in hurting their <hi>Estates,</hi> their <hi>Credit,</hi> their <hi>Families,</hi> and their <hi>Bodies and Souls</hi> too; yea in <hi>hurting the Publick</hi> and that various ways. If when you owe your Neighbours a ſmall matter, you urge them to <hi>take it out in your way;</hi> that is, <hi>to drink it out</hi> tho' they have no need of it; this is very wicked in you. They had better <hi>loſe their Debt,</hi> than get it in ſuch a manner. If when <hi>Conſtables</hi> come to clear your Houſes, as the Law directs; you <hi>hide your wicked Cuſtomers,</hi> deny that they are there, and ſo encourage their ſtaying to <hi>Tipple, Game, &amp;c.</hi> then you do very wickedly; your ſin is greatly <hi>Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.</hi> You do wickedly, to indulge any ſorts of perſons, whether <hi>Heads of Families, Sons</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi>

needleſly to ſpend their time and money in your Houſes. But it ſeems ſomething of an <hi>Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of your ſin, when you ſuffer your <hi>Poor</hi> Neighbours, <hi>Tradeſmen, Labourours,</hi> to do ſo; when you know their <hi>Poor Families want Neceſſaries.</hi> It may be they have ſcarce <hi>Victuals to feed them;</hi> ſcarce <hi>Fire or Cloathes to warm them.</hi> Thoſe men who ſpend their money at Taverns, while their <hi>Wives, Children</hi> or <hi>Servants</hi> thus ſuffer; are worſe than brutiſh; and you act <hi>Inhumanely, Barbarouſly, Cruelly</hi> (not to ſay <hi>Murderouſly</hi>) in indulging them in ſuch Curſed practices. Indeed you are bound in Duty and Conſcience, to oppoſe and hinder as far as you can, any perſons miſpending his time or money in your Houſes. If any <hi>would</hi> be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly in your Houſes, you ſhould kindly and friendly adviſe them to deſiſt, and be gone; tell them how hurtful their practice is. If ſuch gentle means won't prevail, yet you may <hi>refuſe to let them have drink;</hi> you may take methods, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their wickedneſs if you will. Poſſibly you'll <hi>Object,</hi> this is the way to <hi>loſe your Cuſtom,</hi> you <hi>can't Live after this rate.</hi> To this, the anſwer is ſhort and plain, You had <hi>better loſe your Custom, thou miſchief your own Souls, and the Souls and Bodies of your Neighbours;</hi> which you do, if you indulge their wickedneſs. The Gain you get by indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin, is <hi>Unrighteous Gain;</hi> and that expoſeth to the Wrath and Vengeance of God, whatever you may think of it at preſent. Remember therefore the account you muſt give to God, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Day; and let that reſtrain you, from incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging or indulging Intemperance (or any other ſin) in any perſon whatſoever.</p>
            <p>From the Premiſes, I think the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are plain, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:001491_0020_0FB34FFEDF67CF68"/>1. <hi>That none but Perſons of approv'd Sobriety and good Converſation, ſhould have Licenſes to Retail Drink, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be Inn holders.</hi> If Vicious Immoral perſons, who have little or no Conſcience, come to be <hi>Inn-holders;</hi> they will allow of vile Diſorders, <hi>Swearing, Gaming, Drunkenneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> they won't care how much they <hi>Impoveriſh</hi> &amp; <hi>Debauch</hi> their Neighbours, if they can but <hi>Gain by it</hi> themſelves. Yea, the <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> in ſuch Houſes, are in great danger of being utterly Ruined I reckon ſuch <hi>Inn-holders</hi> are very <hi>Extenſive Plagues and Miſchiefs to the Publick</hi> They are more dangerous to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, than ſo many <hi>Indians on the Frontiers,</hi> or a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer on the Coaſt;</hi> for theſe open Enemies can do no more (at worſt) but <hi>Kill the Body;</hi> but ſuch <hi>Inn-holders</hi> won't ſcruple, to deſtroy the <hi>Estates, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, Bodies</hi> and <hi>Immortal Souls of their Neighbours.</hi> Sometimes <hi>one baſe Fellow in a Town</hi> (tho' in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Capacity) does a world of Miſchief, by tempting corrupting and debauching his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>Young Ones</hi> eſpecially; but if ſuch an one <hi>Keeps Tavern,</hi> hee'l probably do more abundant miſchief. Therefore thoſe who have power to <hi>Grant Licenſes,</hi> as they have any regard to God's Glory and the good of this Land; <hi>ſhould Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouſly take heed, not to grant them to Unſuitable Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The needleſs multiplying of Licenſes to Sell Drink, eſpecially to be Innholders, directly tends to debauch and ruin this People.</hi> If a grieved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (concern'd for the Publick good) might have liberty to Speak; I humbly conceive, that <hi>Licenſes</hi> are ſo multiplyed (eſpecially in ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) that thoſe who have them can get no tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gain by them, unleſs their Neighbours prove <hi>Wicked</hi> Cuſtomers, in ſpending <hi>more Money</hi> with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001491_0021_0FB3500060B8D0D8"/>
them than they ſhould. When men have <hi>Licenſes,</hi> they're under a Temptation to Sell what Drink they can; tho' they know their Neighbours do <hi>Wickedly,</hi> in buying <hi>ſo much</hi> as they do. And the <hi>Poorer</hi> thoſe are that have <hi>Licenſes,</hi> the greater are their Temptations to allow ill practices in others, for their own gain. It may be a Man has met with <hi>Loſſes,</hi> or his <hi>Trade Fails,</hi> he's become low and indigent; the next thing is, he ſeeks a <hi>Licenſe to Sell Drink;</hi> and when he has it, poſſibly many of his Neighbours ruin themſelves, by being his <hi>Wicked Cuſtomers.</hi> I fear <hi>many</hi> are <hi>made</hi> poor, by being <hi>Wicked</hi> Cuſtomers to others, that were poor <hi>before them.</hi> If thoſe really poor and low, would <hi>Keep good Conſciences;</hi> I think they had better follow the hardeſt labour their Bodies can bear, and be content to live very meanly; than to get a Licenſe to Sell Drink: for their Temptations would be very great. How many have reaſon to rue the day, that they got ſuch Licenſes? I doubt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes are ſo <hi>Multiplied,</hi> that few who have them can get a gain anſwerable to their Charge and Trouble, and <hi>Keep good Conſciences too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>All that deſire the Glory of God and the good of this People, ſhould do their utmoſt in their ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities to Suppreſs Intemperance.</hi> Thoſe in Civil Authority, ſhould Imploy their power againſt this threatening Vice, as well as againſt others; elſe they are not a <hi>Terror to Evil doers,</hi> Rom. 13.3. I reckon there's great need alſo, that all <hi>Ministers</hi> thro' the Land, ſhould very <hi>Plainly, Publickly</hi> and <hi>Particularly,</hi> bear their Witneſs againſt this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and threatning Evil. <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Familes</hi> ſhould watch over their <hi>Young Ones,</hi> not ſuffer them to <hi>haunt Taverns,</hi> nor drink to Exceſs. They ſhould not teach their Children, their <hi>Boys and Girls to

his behaviour has been. That every Man ſhall be thus dealt with, ſeems evident from the Text now read. In the 5. &amp; 6. <hi>verſes,</hi> we have a curſe denounc'd againſt thoſe, who <hi>Trust in Man,</hi> but their <hi>Hearts depart from God.</hi> In the 7. &amp; 8. <hi>verſes,</hi> we have a bleſſing pronounc'd on thoſe, who <hi>Truſt and Hope in God.</hi> Tis then added, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>The heart is decietful above all things, and deſperately wicked; who can know it?</hi> Some ſuppoſe theſe laſt words, to refer to the 5. <hi>v.</hi> where a <hi>Curſe</hi> is denounc'd againſt thoſe that <hi>Truſt in Man;</hi> as if the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>Man is not fit to be Truſted in,</hi> for his <hi>Heart is very decietful;</hi> he may pretend much kindneſs, when he intends miſchief. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers look on the words of <hi>v.</hi> 9. as ſome reply to Self flattering Hypocrites, who pretended, that their hearts were right with God and did not depart from him; as if the Prophet had ſaid to ſuch, <hi>Take heed that you be not miſtaken,</hi> for the <hi>Heart is decietful,</hi> &amp;c. If this latter be the true meaning, 'tis ſomething like the Apoſtles caution to every man, <hi>Not to think more highly of himſelf than he ought,</hi> Rom. 12.3.

God takes the moſt exact notice that can be, of what's in the heart of every Man, Woman and Child in the World. And what does God do this for? Why 'tis not as an Idle unconcern'd Spectator, that he critically obſerves all that's in the hearts of Men, but he does it as a Witneſs and <hi>Judge;</hi> That he <hi>may give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doing.</hi> To give to <hi>every Man,</hi> it ſeems then, that <hi>every Man</hi> muſt have to do with <hi>God as his Judge.</hi> Very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>in this World,</hi> God deals with Perſons in <hi>ſome meaſure</hi> according to their ways.

have our being in God; he holds our Souls in Life and preſerves our Spirits; he upholds all things by the word of his power. The Divine Power, cauſeth the Wind to blow, the Sea to flow and ebb, the celeſtial Bodies to keep their Stated regular motions. Tis the Divine Power, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds or preſerves the <hi>Natural Powers,</hi> which are in all living Creatures; and ſo in men as well as in others. Tis the Divine Power that upholds in men, the animal faculties of <hi>Seeing, Hearing, Smelling,</hi> &amp;c. and that does concur with theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in ſuch Senſations. So the Divine Power preſerves the <hi>Rational Soul,</hi> all its natural powers and abilities, and concurs with the faculties in all their natural operations. If God ſhould with-draw his ſuſtaining power, the Creature would preſently ſink into its original nothing. Or if God ſhould preſerve the Creature in being, yet it could not act, exert or exerciſe its uſual natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers, if the Divine Agency or Concourſe were with-held. All the actions of the Soul may be call'd <hi>Natural,</hi> as perform'd by the <hi>Rational natural faculties</hi> (whether Supernaturally or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly aſſiſted or not) tho' at the ſame time they may be call'd <hi>Moral</hi> too, as they refer to the <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> of Actions. Now conſider'd as <hi>Natural Actions,</hi> a Divine Concourſe is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to the performance of them. Divine power actually upholds and aſſiſts the faculties of the Soul, in all their operations. And ſince there is ſuch a Divine Concourſe, in all humane actions outward or inward, it neceſſarily follows, that God knows all the motions and actions even of the Souls of men. For the Soul can do no action without <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

muſt needs know all about it. That God knows the hearts of men, is evident,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe he has given Laws, to regulate and govern even the hearts of men.</hi> The Divine law requires us, to <hi>Love</hi> the Lord our God with all our <hi>Heart, Soul, Mind</hi> and <hi>Strength;</hi> and our Neighbour as our ſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22 37—39.

Tho' 'tis utter'd with the <hi>loweſt Whiſper,</hi> 'tis as audible to God as <hi>Thunder.</hi> And indeed in the Judgment day, Men ſhall give an account of <hi>every late Word</hi> they ſpeak, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. Men ſometimes plot, contrive, cabal to carry on ſome vile deſign; poſſibly they uſe utmoſt care to keep the matter <hi>Secret;</hi> but alas, God hears every word about it. But beſides all this, God as fully knows the <hi>Hearts</hi> of men, as he does their <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>outward Actions. Solomon</hi> ſaid to God, 1 King 8.39. <hi>Thou even thou only, knoweſt the hearts of all the Children of Men.</hi> There is not ſo much as any one of the Children of Men, but God knows his heart. He knows all the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of men, for <hi>no thought can be with-holden from him.</hi> He knows <hi>the thoughts afar off,</hi> Pſal. 139.2. What can be more plain and expreſs than what God ſays? Ezek. 11.5. <hi>I know the things that come into your Mind, every one of them.</hi> No one ſingle thought can paſs thro' our Minds, but God obſerves it. God knows what belief we entertain in our Minds, about himſelf, about his glorious perfections, about his holy Truths and Ways; what opinions we have about our ſelves, about our own ſtate as to the future World, about our own ways and actions; what opinions we have, about other Perſons, other things, &amp; the actions of others. He knows all our deſigns, purpoſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001491_0030_0FB3500F65B916D8"/>
of what nature ſoever they are; whether men know any thing of them or not. He knows all the arguings and reaſonings we at any time have, about any affair whatſoever. God knows all our doubts, fears objections; all our hopes, deſires, wiſhes whether good or bad. He knows what we <hi>Love</hi> and what we <hi>Hate,</hi> what we <hi>Grieve</hi> for or <hi>Rejoyce</hi> at. In a word, God is moſt perfectly acquainted with all the ſecret actions and motions of the Soul. He has a more exact knowledge of every mans heart, than the man himſelf has. Tis undeniably true, that God exactly knows the heart of every Perſon. This was the firſt Propoſition: we therefore proceed to the Second.</p>

Such things as theſe are too common among men, but no ſuch thing can be in the Day of Judgment.

be Openly Publiſhed, Eternally and Gloriouſly Rewarded; a reward of Grace ſhall then be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, for all their exerciſe of Grace here in this world. Then the Godly ſhall find by moſt bleſſed experience, that they ſerv'd a good Maſter; that none of their doings or ſufferings for Chriſt, were loſt or in vain. They'll never repent of any thing they did, or ſuffer'd for Chriſt. That day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, will be a day of inconceiveable Joy to them. No Tongue can expreſs, how ſurprizing, how raviſhing their Joy and Delight will be, and that for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>All the Sins of the Wicked ſhall be openly mention'd it the Judgment Day, and be Puniſh'd for ever.</hi> As that day will bring ſurprizing Joy and Glory to the Godly; ſo 'twill bring ſurprizing Shame, Woe and Miſery to the Wicked. Then their ſinful <hi>Deeds,</hi> ſhall be laid open before the world. Now they often ſtrive to <hi>Conceal</hi> their ſins from men, and if they can do that, they content themſelves.

               <head>We may now proceed to the USE of theſe things, in a few Inferences.</head>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>We ſhould never allow our ſelves in any Sin, under the Notion of it's being</hi> SECRET.

Therefore Oh Man, never indulge thy ſelf in any Sin, tho' thou canſt keep it ſecret a while from Men; ſuch Secrecy, cannot exempt thee from Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at laſt. If thou dareſt not do ſuch or ſuch an ill thing, <hi>before Men,</hi> for fear of blame, ſhame and puniſhment from them; and yet dareſt to do the ſame ill thing <hi>in Secret,</hi> then thou ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt more regard to Men than to God.

                  <hi>Abſoloms</hi> on the <hi>Houſe top,</hi> before all Iſrael and before the Sun. Canſt thou dare to extort, cheat, defraud, becauſe thou reckoneſt thou canſt hide it from men? But alas, notwithſtanding all thy Whiffling ſhuffling tricks, notwithſtanding all the baffling plea's thou doſt uſe with thy Sleepy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; yet God obſerves very critically, all thy methods of Unrighteous gain; and he ſtamps a curſe on thee for them. 1 Theſ. 4.6. <hi>That no man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter</hi> (not in any matter whatſoever) <hi>becauſe the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> Canſt thou dare among ſome of thine Intimates, to belye, revile, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach others, to blaſt their reputation, to raiſe or ſpread ill reports of them; canſt thou dare to do this, thinking 'twont be known that it comes from thee, or that it can't be prov'd upon thee? Alas, the great GOD hears, and critically obſerves all this thy wickedneſs. So far as thou doſt Indulge any Sin, under the Notion of it's being <hi>Secret;</hi> ſo far thou doſt practically deny God to be <hi>Omnipreſent,</hi> and <hi>Omniſcient.</hi> For thou ſeemeſt to ſuppoſe, that there is no God, or that he is not an Allſeeing and Holy Judge. Oh let not ſuch curſed Atheiſm prevail in thy Soul. Thou ſhouldeſt avoid Sin chiefly for this reaſon, to wit, that it diſpleaſeth and provoketh God; therefore thou ſhouldſt avoid <hi>Secret</hi> as well as <hi>Open</hi> Sins, for the former as well as the latter are known to him, and provoke him. The Allſeeing eye of thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge is always upon thee, by Day and by Night, whether alone or in company; let the thought; of this, keep thee from allowing thy ſelf in any known Sin whatſoever.

               <p n="2">II. <hi>We ſhould Repent even of our Secret Sins.</hi> Tis not enough, that we repent of our Sinful Words and Actions, which are commonly known to thoſe about us: but we ſhould heartily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our <hi>Secret</hi> Sins too, for our glorious Judge knows them all. Oh Man, Woman, it may be thou haſt been guilty of ſecret Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſecret Fornication or Adultery, ſecret Lyes or Perjuries, ſecret Reproaches and Defamations, ſecret Thiefts, Cheats, Frauds and Curſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of unrighteous gain; Well, God thy glorious Judge knows all theſe things What if men don't know them, yet thy Judge does, and he needs no Witneſſes. What if thou ſhouldſt go on Secretly in thy Wickedneſs, and go Impenitent and Undiſcover'd to the Grave? What then? why all thy ſecret Villanies, ſhall hereafter be publiſh'd before the World, and be Publiſh'd for ever. Therefore ſpeedily Repent of Secret (as well as open) wickedneſs. Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thy ſleepy Conſcience, let it do it's office, let it ſpeak plainly and faithfully; hearken to it's reproofs, don't ſtiffle them; for it will roar dreadfully hereafter, and that to thine eternal confuſion too, if ſpeedy hearty Repentance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not.

as open Sins. And if thou haſt <hi>Secretly</hi> wrong'd others, in their <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Eſtates,</hi> do thine ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to make Reparation. Don't keep what thou haſt gotten in any unjuſt way, tho' never ſo ſecretly; thou wilt keep the Curſe and Wrath of God on thy Soul, if thou doſt. Oh take warning before 'tis too late, ſpeedily and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fly to the blood of JESUS for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and forſake thy evil ways. GOD is now calling on thee and warning of thee to Repent; if thou doſt not now take warning, it may be few or no more warnings may be given thee: or if they be, poſſibly God may Judicially give thee up to a ſeared Conſcience; and may ſay, Let him that is filthy be filthy ſtill, let him that is unjuſt be unjuſt ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What if God ſhould ſay, if ſuch an one, or ſuch an one does not take warning, repent and reform now; then he ſhall go on in his ſecret ways of wickedneſs, and ſhall be blinded and hardened in Sin, till he drops into the unquenchible flames of the pit below; if God ſhould ſay thus, how dreadful would it be! For the Lords Sake, and for our Souls Sake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us conſider theſe things and impreſs them on our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Here's matter of Support and Comfort to the Godly, under falſe Charges and Accuſations laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</hi> The world is commonly fill'd with groundleſs Rumors and falſe Reports; and the Godly often ſuffer much by them. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaid, Rom. 3.8 <hi>We be ſlandorouſly Reported. David</hi> ſaid, Pſal. 35.11. <hi>Falſe Witneſſes did riſe up, they laid to my Charge things that I knew not.</hi>

Well, the conſideration of the All-ſeeing Eye of our Glorious Judge, ſhould quiet and ſupport us if at any time vile falſe Reports are raiſed of us. If any Charge us with ſaying ſuch or ſuch ill things, which we never ſaid; or with doing ſuch or ſuch ill things which we never did; or with having ſome ill deſign which we never had; if it be ſo, this may Support us, That GOD who knows all things and will Judge us at laſt, knows that we are Innocent in theſe matters. If our Conſciences Teſtify for us in ſuch Caſes, they are better (as to our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace and Satisfaction) than a Thouſand Witneſſes. Indeed, if men raiſe falſe Reports of us, and our Name ſuffer thereby; we ſhould ſeriouſly Conſider God's Hand in ſuch Affliction, (<hi>David</hi> Ey'd the Hand of God in <hi>Shimei</hi>'s Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) inquire into the Voice and Meaning of ſuch a Providence, and Indeavour to comply therewith by growing more Humble and Holy. Yet ſo far as we are Innocent, the thoughts of our Innocency being known to God, ſhould greatly Quiet and Comfort us.</p>

If men give Alms out of Obedience to God, tho' ſo Secretly that their right hand ſcarce knows what their left hand does; yet he that ſees in Secret will reward it Openly.

               <p n="5">V. <hi>We ſhould uſe utmost Diligence to be Sincere and Hearty, in all our External Religious (or other Commendable) Performances</hi> God not only hears all our Words and ſees our Outward Actions, but He alſo obſerves the Inward Principles from whence they flow; even all the ſecret Deſigns of the heart in them. Many things have a fair Outſide to men's Eye, but a black In-ſide to God's Eye. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> did <hi>Outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Righteous to Men</hi> but <hi>Inwardly were full of Iniquity and Hypocriſy:</hi> All the good things they did, they did them <hi>to be ſeen of Men,</hi> Mat. 23.5, 38. Men often ſerve the Devil and their own Luſts, under a <hi>Mask of Religion,</hi> under a plauſible ſhow and pretence of Holineſs. <hi>Abſolom</hi> asks leave to go to <hi>Hebron,</hi> under a pretence of <hi>pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Vows to God;</hi> when <hi>Treaſon was in his Heart;</hi> his deſign was to raiſe a Rebellion againſt his Royal Father. <hi>Jezebel</hi> orders a <hi>Fast,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

to have <hi>Juſtice done,</hi> and a <hi>Reformation wrought;</hi> when the deſign was, to <hi>Murder Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> and get his <hi>Vineyard. Herod</hi> Inquires after the holy Child Jeſus, pretending to <hi>Worſhip</hi> him, but intending to <hi>Murder</hi> him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. <hi>ch</hi> Alas, the <hi>Devil</hi> transforms himſelf into an <hi>Angel of Light,</hi> and his Children often Imitate him in ſuch helliſh diſſimulation. They often pretend much zeal for God, when indeed their hearts are Set on their wickedneſs. Well, let us never allow our ſelves in ſuch hypocritical practices, for GOD our Judge <hi>Sees our Hearts;</hi> tho' 'tis poſſible to deceive Men 'tis impoſſible to deceive God. Let our main care therefore be, to approve our hearts to God in all we do. We all call our ſelves Chriſtians, we profeſs and pretend to be the Diſciples of Chriſt; but if we are not hearty and ſincere in it, God will damn us for our Unbelief and Hypocriſy. If we have not the <hi>Power</hi> as well as the <hi>Form,</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> if we have not <hi>Oyl in our Veſſels</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Grace in our Souls) as well as in our <hi>Lamps</hi> (<hi>i. e</hi> our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſion) then we ſhall periſh for ever. Therefore On Man, be a Chriſtian indeed and in truth, unfeignedly receive Chriſt on Goſpel-termes, and live to him as Prince and Saviour. Outward ſhews without inward Sincerity, will avail thee nothing in a dying-hour What tho' thou doſt profeſs the ſelf <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Chriſtian, what if thou art a Church Member, and doſt lead a blameleſs Life in the view of Men, and all thy Neighbours count thee an eminent Saint; yet if thy heart be unſound and hypocritical, God will caſt thee into Hell for ever.

thy ſelf to Men, and getting their good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thee; but approve thy heart to God in all things. Don't content thy ſelf in doing thoſe things that are Materially good, but ſee that thine heart be right with God, in the doing of them. When thou heareſt a Sermon, let thy heart be Ingag'd with God in that Duty. When thou makeſt a Prayer, let thine Heart as well as thy Mouth draw nigh to God. Oh Chriſtian, take heed that thou doſt not deceive thy ſelf, even in doing that which is Materially good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. Be vigorous to promote every thing that's Holy Juſt and Good; yet don't be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical in it, don't do it to be ſeen of men: but do it out of hearty Obedience to God, aiming at his Glory therein, for he ſees thy heart whatever thy pretences are. Be zealous againſt Sin in others, duely to witneſs againſt and ſuppreſs it; this is thy Duty, don't neglect it. Yet don't allow the ſame Sins, nor any others in thy ſelf. And again take heed, that thou art not carryed forth by a Spirit of prejudice or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; for if 'tis perſonal prejudice or revenge, that makes thee condemn the faults of others, then thou doſt ſerve the Devil and thine own luſts in doing it: thou doſt make the luſts of others, fuel for thine own luſts to feed on. Take heed therefore that thy heart be right with God, even in doing thoſe things which are Materially good and laudable; for God ſees the heart, and hares Hypocriſy. He <hi>hates Robbery for burnt offerings,</hi> Iſa 61 8 He hates that Men under a pretence of honouring him, ſhould ſerve the Devil and their own corruptions. Therefore do the things that God commands, but do them with an <hi>Upright Heart,</hi> and with <hi>Sincere Deſigns.</hi>

I ſay, it may be we are apt to reaſon thus with our ſelves, about what we are going to do (and indeed it may not be improper, in many caſes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thus to query) but our great inquiry ſhould be. <hi>How will God like of it?</hi> What will our glorious Judge think of it? Will it pleaſe him? Then let us do it tho' it diſpleaſe all men. Will it diſpleaſe God? Then let us ſhun it tho' Men are never ſo much provok'd thereby.
