            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>leſtial Conſtellations, on the Bodies of Men, Women and Children, and the mighty Influences they have upon theſe that are born under them.</head>
            <p>ONE part of the wiſdom of the ancients conſiſted in the obſervation of ſeveral days and times, and from thence foretelling ſuch good and bad events, as from long experience they found always to follow: And therefore reviſing what ancient aſtrologers have ſaid, which I found very defective, I have myſelf made an exact judgment of what ſhould befal men, women and children, by the day of the week on which the firſt day of the year happened to fall: As if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to fall on a</p>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030393_0005_0FE6C409CB0B54E0"/>
there ſhall be robberies in moſt places, and perhaps war before the end of the year: Alſo it denotes the death of prelates and princes, diſſention and diſcord among men, but not of long continuance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday.]</hi> If New Year's Day fall on <hi>Monday,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a hard and cold winter, and a wet ſummer, and as a conſequence of that, many diſeaſes; the fruits of the earth very indifferent, which will produce great ſcarcity in ſome places: Alſo denotes the downfal of the gentry and many marriages among the common people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday.]</hi> If on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the winter ſhall be wet and the ſummer very dry; hay will be ſcarce, but corn indifferently plenty. Many factions and diviſions among thoſe that ſit at the helm, and a great mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity both of men and beaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday.]</hi> If on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> it denotes the firſt part of the winter very hard and ſevere, but the laſt part very mild and gentle, a ſeaſonable ſpring and plenty of fruit; but great ſickneſs and many diſtempers about autumn. Many fables, with falſe news, ſhall be ſpread abroad, and much diſcontent among the common people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday.]</hi> If on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> you may look for a hard winter, but a ſeaſonable and moderate ſpring, and a great increaſe of the fruits of the earth; ſheep and great cattle ſhall alſo proſper much, but towards autumn expect to hear of war and bloodſhed abroad, and troubles at home, occaſioned by conteſts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions among the clergy.</p>

               <p>HAVING ſpoke of the ſeveral ſigns, with the twelve houſes, and of their natures and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, I come now to ſpeak of the ſeven planets, or erratic ſtars, who in their ſeveral orbs or circles, paſs through the twelve houſes of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> in more or leſs time, according to the largeneſs or ſmallneſs of their ſeveral orbs; and as theſe planets paſs through the twelve ſigns, ſo they are ſaid to be in ſuch and ſuch houſes; thus the complement of one year, for on the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> at which time the ſpring and moſt properly the year begins, the ſun enters in <hi>Aries,</hi> and having paſſed through that, in <hi>April</hi> he enters into <hi>Taurus,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> into <hi>Gemini,</hi> and ſo of the reſt. And according to the houſes or ſigns in which any of the planets are, ſo they are ſaid to be dignified or debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for when a planet is in a ſign of its own nature, it is dignified; but if in a ſign of a contrary nature to its own, it is then debilitated, or made weaker; and according to their poſition, their effects and operations are wonderful upon the bodies of men and women; but I ſhall give you their characters, names, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The firſt is ♄ <hi>Saturn,</hi> who is by nature cold and dry, of a ſwarthy, dull, obſcure colour, like unto lead; he makes his revolution through the twelve ſigns in thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is ♃ <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who is by nature hot, moiſt, and temperate, he appears very bright and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is of a warm nature; he makes his revolution in twelve years.</p>

He makes his revolution in three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty five days, ſix hours and twentyfour minutes.</p>
               <p>The fifth is ♀ <hi>Venus,</hi> of nature cold and moiſt, the moſt bright and ſplendent ſtar in all the firmament, ſhe moveth equally with the Sun, though her motion ſeems to be very irregular, and makes her revolution at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>The ſixth is ☿ <hi>Mercury,</hi> whoſe nature is cold and dry, variable, he is ſituated very near the Sun, and is rarely ſeen; he makes his revolution at the ſame time as the Sun and Venus.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh is <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>

               <p>The <hi>Ecliptic Line,</hi> is a line imagined to go along the midſt of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> as a girdle out of which the ſun never goeth; but the moon and other planets are ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on the other ſide, which is called their latitudes, only the fixed ſtars alter not their latitude, whether great or ſmall; but the longitude of a ſtar is in the arch or part of the <hi>Ecliptic</hi> in degrees, between the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which paſſeth through the body of the ſtar; where <hi>note,</hi> that all circles of the ſphere or heavens, whether they are large or ſmall, have three hundred and ſixty degrees allowed to each of them.</p>

                  <hi>Horizon</hi> is a great circle which divideth the upper hemiſphere, that is the upper hall of the world from the lower, we being always ſuppoſed to be in the midſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meridian</hi> is a great circle paſſing through the poles of the world, and the poles of the horizon, called <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith</hi> and the <hi>Nadir</hi> (which are two points, one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over our heads the other directly under our feet) on which the ſun is always juſt at noon; and to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly north and ſouth, the meridian is changed; but to go eaſt and weſt it is changed to ſixty miles either way, and make one degree, of four minutes of time dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference under the Equinox, <hi>viz.</hi> ſixty miles eaſtward, it is noon four minutes ſooner, and ſixty miles weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward four minutes later.</p>

                  <hi>Tropicks</hi> are ſuppoſed to be two leſſer circles, paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with the Equinoctial, and diſtant from it on either ſide, twenty three degrees, thirty one minutes each; the ecliptic line touches the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer</hi> on the north ſide of the equinoctial, and it touches the <hi>Tropic</hi> of <hi>Capricorn</hi> on the ſouth ſide thereof, ſo that the ſun hath its motion between theſe two circles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Artick Circle</hi> is equally diſtant from the north pole, as the <hi>Tropicks</hi> are diſtant from the <hi>Equinox</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three degrees, thirty one minutes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antarctic Circle</hi> is the ſame diſtance from the ſouth pole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zones,</hi> ſo called are five in number, two cold, two temperate and one hot, which are divided by the two <hi>Tropicks</hi> and polar circles from each other; the hot

Zone is counted between the two <hi>Tropicks</hi> that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from one to the other, being about forty ſeven degrees two minutes broad; the temperate Zones are extended from the <hi>Tropicks</hi> on either ſide, to about fortytwo degrees ſixtyeight minutes, that is northward to the <hi>Artick</hi> circle and ſouthward to the <hi>antarctick</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the two cold Zones are each within thoſe two ſmall circles having the poles for their center.</p>
               <p>The <hi>poles of the Worlds,</hi> are two points exactly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to each other in the heavens, one in the north, the other in the ſouth, the earth being in the midſt, ſo that it ſeems to turn about, as if it were borne up by them; wherefore by ſome it is termed the axletree of the world, as if there was a line ſuppoſed to be drawn from one pole through the center of the earth to the other, and the earth turning thereon, though holy writ tells us, <hi>The Lord hangeth the earth upon nothing, it being upholden by his mighty power.</hi> The pole artick, or north pole, is elevated above our horizon above fiftyone degrees; and thoſe ſtars within that diſtance from it, never ſet with us, but keep their courſe round it daily; ſo likewiſe thoſe that are at that diſtance from the ſouth pole, never riſe with us, but perform their courſe in the like order.</p>

               <p>

Mercury</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> or the Moon, whoſe characters, names and nature, we have mentioned before, and whoſe influences we ſhall by and by give you a farther account of. Thoſe planets have alſo their ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Latitude of the Earth,</hi> is the diſtance of breadth on either ſide of the equinox, towards the pole, and they that are under the equinox have no latitude, but the poles of the world are in the horizon: This is a right ſphere, and every ſixty miles directly north or ſouth, are ſaid to make no degree of latitude, and the height of either pole above the horizon, is anſwerable to the degree of latitude in an oblique ſphere; as London is counted to be in latitude fiftyone degrees, thirtytwo minutes, the pole thereof being elevated as much. The like is to be obſerved in any other place or region.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Longitude of the Earth,</hi> is the outſide thereof extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from weſt to eaſt, croſſing the latitude at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, the beginning thereof (according to ſome aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers) is the <hi>Canary Iſles,</hi> ſo going eaſtward quite round the world, unto the ſame place again, which is three hundred and ſixty degrees; and under the equinoctial is reputed to be two millions one thouſand ſix hundred miles, reckoning ſixty miles to a degree; but then further off the equinoctial, the fewer miles are in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; for at <hi>London</hi> about thirtyſeven makes a degree of longitude: ſo theſe degrees grow leſs and leſs, until they are met in the latitude of ninety, that is under the poles.</p>

               <p>THOUGH there be ſeven planets (as we have before ſhewed) yet the ſun and moon being the two great luminaries of the world, have greater influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our bodies than all the reſt, and the ſun ſhining by his ow light, and being the fountain of both light and life, has greater power than the moon, and his influence is more in any of the twelve houſes. I therefore here (becauſe I affect brevity) give the reader an aſtrologic judgment of the ſun's power and influence, being in any of the twelve houſes; after I have firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted my reader what a houſe is, and ſignifies in aſtrology.</p>
               <p>A houſe is a certain ſpace in the firmament, which is parted and ſeparated by ſeveral degrees, by which the planets have their motion metaphorically, called houſes.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030393_0021_0FE6C3F656F2DCD8"/>
For as in a houſe there may be many manſions, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry planet has a peculiar or proper place in the firmament, in which it moves and in which it is reſident, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirty degrees, by which one houſe is differenced from another, and theſe are thus placed by Aſtrologers, viz.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Aries,</hi> makes a perſon born under it of a toward and peeviſh diſpoſition, quickly angry, but as ſoon pleaſed; given to ſtudy and very eloquent, but proud, living luxurious, promiſing all things, but performing nothing; not beloved among his kindred, and obnoxious to danger among his enemies; he ſhall be in danger of receiving harm from four footed beaſts, or being thrown from a horſe, and the like; ſo that he ought to avoid all hawking, hunting, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er exerciſe to be performed on horſecback, which are like to be fatal to him, but in other things he may be more fortunate. If the perſon born be a female, though ſhe may be fair and fruitful in children, yet ſhe will be given to lying, and of ſo bad a temper and diſpoſition that her huſband will live but uneaſy with her. <hi>Note,</hi> this alſo, that thoſe born in the day time, the ſun being in <hi>Aries,</hi> will be fortunate aad happy, but thoſe that are born in the night, will be unfortunate and come to diſgrace.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Taurus,</hi> makes the native bold and fortunate in attempting hard and difficult affairs; it ſhews him alſo victorious over his enemies, and a great traveller, but baniſhed from his native country. It alſo ſhews one ſervile, familiar and angry, but in his old age only; for in his youth he ſhall obtain rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by marriage, which ſhall make him better honored. But when age comes, it brings ſickneſs with it, and that makes men peeviſh.</p>
               <p>It makes females wanton, yet painful and obedient, but full of <hi>Tittle Tattle;</hi> it alſo ſhews them inclined to whoredom, which will wear off by degrees; ſhe ſhall have many huſbands and divers children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:030393_0022_0FE6C45C598CD520"/>The ſun being in <hi>Gemini,</hi> denotes a fair child, alſo one that is wiſe, liberal and merciful, alſo a boaſter, and one that runs up and down without any regard to his buſineſs, whereby he ſhall obtain but little riches of his own, but ſhall be of that fidelity and truth, that he ſhall have the command of the public treaſure: It alſo denotes one to be of a complaiſant behaviour, a good underſtanding, and acceptable to thoſe with whom he has to do. It ſhews him alſo to be well verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mathematical ſcience and arithmetic; and that he ſhall be in great danger about three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of age, either to be hurt by fire, or bitten by a mad dog.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Cancer,</hi> ſhews a perſon to be of a good wit, humility and wiſdom, but one inclined to pleaſure, and the love of women. It alſo ſhews one attempting many things, and eſpecially on ſeas, and thereby often in danger, and vexed with many incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and with much poverty and miſery, and that though he may get much, yet he may be never the richer; he ſhall dig for treaſure, and ſhall find that which he looked not for: But if it be a maid, ſhe ſhall be witty, ſhamefaced, evil, wiſe, diligent, nimble and beautiful, ſoon pleaſed, yet deceitful and crafty, ſaying one thing, and doing another, ſubject to many dangers by water, by falling, by childbearing and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic; and after the age of twentyſix, whether the native, male or female, it promiſeth good ſucceſs. It denotes alſo a perſon to be painful, faithful, acquainted with great men, and fortunate in huſbandry.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Leo,</hi> denotes a man proud and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, bold and ſtout; a mocker, ſcorner, unmerciful, cruel, and hard to be entreated; beſet with many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſubject to many miſeries; alſo a captain or other commander, looking for promotion from great men, unfortunate children, and meeting with many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions by their means, putting himſelf into many dangers; he ſhall be alſo in danger by fire or ſword, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030393_0023_0FE6C420CFBD4430"/>
violence of beaſts, by whom he ſhall be in danger of death; but with prudence may eſcape all threatened dangers.</p>
               <p>But if the native be of the female ſex, ſhe ſhall be bold, have great and large breaſts, and ſlender legs, which are tokens of ſtoutneſs, angers, ſlanders, and bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; though the ſoftneſs natural to women do allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the exceſs thereof. She ought however to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially careful of hot waters, and fire, by which ſhe will be in great danger; ſhe ſhall alſo be much inclined to ſickneſs, or gnawing of the ſtomach. But after the age of twentyone years, ſhe ſhall be fortunate in riches, which ſhe ſhall obtain by the help of great men, and the uſe of other men's goods: alſo by houſekeeping, beauty and love.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Virgo,</hi> makes the men fortunate and ſucceſsful in houſhold affairs, wiſe and fruitful, ſtout and ambitious: his wife ſhall die ſuddenly in his abſence; he ſhall have many things ſtolen from him, but ſhall be revenged on his enemies. He ſhall be ſo much given to talk, that he cannot keep his own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.— It alſo ſhews one fairfaced, of a genteel beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, a lover of women, and delightful to be in the courts of princes and noblemen. It alſo denotes one wiſe, juſt, and honorable, a patron and defender of his friends, alſo religious and temperate, of a comely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, and well featured. If the native be a maiden, ſhe will be witty, honeſt and modeſt; of a willing mind diligent and circumſpect; and ſhall be married about the age of fifteen years. But whether male or female, they ſhall be liable to meet with many afflictions.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Libra,</hi> denotes the perſon to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in all maritime affairs, and that he gains by trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſpices and precious ſtones. It alſo ſhews a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body, and a valuable pleaſant tongue, a good fame, and one curious to underſtand ſecrets, but not very careful to perform what he promiſes, how much ſoever he may pretend to it. It ſhews alſo that he ſhall
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030393_0024_0FE6C45C69591540"/>
have ſeveral wives, and that he ſhall quickly bury the firſt. He may alſo be a gainer by dead men, who will leave him large legacies. He ſhall be a lover of wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and entertain unlawful familiararities with them. He ſhall be alſo a good interpreter of dreams, whether he be born by day or night. If the native be of the female ſex, ſhe ſhall be free and debonair, and of a jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund humour, taking much delight in herbs, loving the fields, and wandering into ſtrange places. About 23 years of age ſhe ſhall have a huſband, and be happy, married for her beauty; pleaſantneſs of converſation, and good behaviour, ſhall much promote her. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the children of <hi>Libra</hi> are ſuch as are ſtudious and lovers of learning; but without ſpecial care be taken, they may receive prejudice by fire or ſcalding water.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Scorpio</hi> increaſes the natives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritence, and give them a boldneſs and ſtoutneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining them likewiſe to flattery, by which means thoſe they deal with are often deceived; and when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect bread may meet with nothing but a <hi>ſcorpion.</hi> It likewiſe denotes a perſon full of mirth, given to jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eaſy of belief, at the ſame time a conquerer of his enemies. It makes a woman to be full of craft and wit, and yet her huſband ſhall deceive her. She ſhall likewiſe be ſubject to pain and the ſpleen, and have ſome extraordinary mark, either in the head, ſhoulder, or brawn of the arm.</p>
               <p>It makes both ſexes bold and raſh, given to thiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to ſearch out hidden things, alſo it makes them wanton fornicators, and full of evil thoughts, and given to too much talking.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> gives fortune and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take in hand an enterpriſe, inclining a perſon to travel, and take vovages at ſea and journies by land, and not without conſiderable advantage; it alſo gives acceſs into courts of princes, where the native ſhall be advanced to ſome honourable poſt. It alſo ſhews a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given to riding, hunting, hawking, leaping, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030393_0025_0FE6C420DF0FC458"/>
and ſuch manly exerciſes, at which he always comes off with honor, by which means he is envied and has many enemies, whom yet he ſhall vanquiſh and and overcome. It alſo ſhews he ſhall poſſeſs the inher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itence of his father, and that he ſhall be juſt, ingeni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous, faithful, hearty, a ſure friend, and a generous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. If the native be a woman, it likewiſe betokens the ſame; ſhe ſhall be induſtrious, of an excellent temper; ſhe ſhall be envied by her enemies, but ſhall overcome them; ſhe ſhall be married about ſeventeen, and have many children.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> ſhews the native ſhall meet with many afflictions and adverſities, which he ſhall ſuſtain with many reſolutions: Yet it always ſhews him angry and fretful, and one that keeps bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. It alſo makes him merry and cheerful; yet he may fall in love to that degree, that he may be ready to die for his miſtreſs; but if the nativity be by night, he ſhall be inconſtant; it alſo ſhews in age he ſhall be covetous. He ſhall thrive in navigation, eſpecially in the trade towards the eaſt, for from thence his fortune ſhall ariſe. If the native be a woman, ſhe will be modeſt and baſhful, of a fearful diſpoſition, and very much addicted to travel.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Aquarius,</hi> maketh the native of a friendly diſpoſition, fearful of waters, and in danger of receiving prejudice thereby; he ſhall be ſubject to ſickneſs and quartidian agues until about the fifteenth year of his age, after which he ſhall be more fortunate, for by travelling through divers countries, he ſhall gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er riches, which with a liberal hand he ſhall diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; he ſhall meet with ſundry loſſes and afflictions, eſpecially by means of his wife and other women; and ſhall live for a long time without the enjoyment of her. But ſhe being dead, his affairs will be more fortunate. If the native be a woman, ſhe ſhall be comely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> body, and of a faithful and canſtant mind: ſhe ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with other men's goods, but her children ſhall
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030393_0026_0FE6C4624FACA260"/>
be a great affliction to her, and ſhe ſhall receive much damage by them. She ſhall not attain to any great fortune until the two and twentieth year of her age, and then ſhe ſhall arrive to a competent eſtate.</p>
               <p>The ſun being in <hi>Piſces</hi> denotes a man to be quick, of a valuable and ready tongue, bold and conceited, but fortunate in finding out hidden treaſure: for this is peculiar to thoſe who are born when the ſun is in <hi>Piſces,</hi> that they ſhall find ſomething unlooked for, and ſhall be alſo enriched with other men's goods; it alſo ſhews them to be merry and jocoſe, of a good diſpoſition, and loving the company of good men; they ſeldom live very long, but if they reach to thirtyfive years they may live to a good old age. They ſhall never be very rich, except in their own opinions; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways full of uneaſy thoughts, and are in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into captivity by means of women; they have commonly ſome mark in the elbow or foot, and their fortune will come from the mouth. If the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive be a woman, ſhe will be bold, contumelious, ſcold, and ſomething worſe, for ſhe will forſake her own huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and cleave to an adulterer.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given an account of the influences of the ſun, being in any of the celeſtial ſigns, by which any perſon may know in what ſign the ſun was at the time of his birth.</p>

As for example, I deſire to know what planet rules on Wedneſday, at 7 o'clock at night; under the title of Wedneſday, I look for 9, which anſwers to 7 o'clock at night; for the natural day conſiſts of 24 hours, beginning after midnight, ſo that from 12 at noon, you begin to reckon 13, 14 15, &amp;c. you find that the 19th hour from midnight, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to 7 o'clock at night, over againſt which you will find ☉ which ſhews that to be the hour of the

ſun. And if you would know what planet rules at 7 in the morning that day, you will find againſt ♀ 7, which ſhews that <hi>Venus</hi> rules that hour; and ſo of any other hour in the day.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall now come to ſpeak of the ſignifications of the planetary hours of each planet, and what it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to thoſe that are born in them. The hour of <hi>Saturn</hi> is ſtrong, and is good to do all things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſtrength: Such as fighting or bearing burdens, or the like; but for thoſe things it is very evil. He that is born in the hour of <hi>Saturn,</hi> is ſlow, dull and melancholy, of a dogged temper and diſpoſition, black and ſwarthy of complexion, being quarrelſome, wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and very malicious.</p>
               <p>The hour of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is in all things good, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes peace, love and concord: He that is born in the hour of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> is of a ruddy and ſandy complexion, fair hair, well proportioned body, and of a lovely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, his face rather broad than long, well ſpoken and courteous, of a very affable carriage, ſober, juſt and religious. The hour of <hi>Mars</hi> is evil, and denotes the perſon born in it, to be of a cholerick conſtitution, and of a robuſt ſtrong body, ſoon angry, and hard to be reconciled; his face red, and his eyes ſparkling and fiery, much addicted to fighting, and ready to quarrel with every man he meets, which often times brings him to an untimely end. The hour of the <hi>Sun</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies great ſtrength, and is very unfortunate for kings and princes. He that is born in that hour, hath ſharp eyes, brown hair, and a round face, denotes one that is a great projector, aims at high things, but is often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, and ſeldom brings his deſigns to paſs.</p>
               <p>The hour of <hi>Venus</hi> is very propitious and fortunate, but is better by night than day, eſpecially mid-day, for then the ſun covers it. He that is born in this hour hath fair hair, ſoft eyes, a little forehead, and round beard; very complaiſant in his carriage, mighty am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous, and a great admirer of women; much addicted
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030393_0031_0FE6C41D8C32AA58"/>
to ſinging and gaming, and ſpends his money in court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the female ſex.</p>
               <p>The hour of <hi>Mercury</hi> is very good, but chiefly from the beginning to the middle: He that is born in this hour, his ſituation inclining to tallneſs, a ſharp long face, long eyes, and a long noſe: His forehead narrow, long beard and thin hair, long arms and long fingers; of a good diſpoſition, and an obliging temper, much given to reading, and very deſirous of knowledge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting to be among books; very eloquent in his ſpeech, and yet addicted to lying; and if he be poor, he is commonly light fingered.</p>
               <p>The hour or the <hi>Moon</hi> is both good and evil, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the day: For from the 4th to the 17th it is good to thoſe that are born under it; but from the 17th to the 20th, it is counted unfortunate to be born under it; and from the 20th to the 27th, very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. He that is born in the hour of the <hi>Moon,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon her own day, ſhall be pale faced, of a thin, meagre viſage, with hollow eyes, and of a middle ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, he appears very courteous and obliging, but is very crafty and deceitful, ſetting about many things, but ſo inconſtant and variable in his humour, that he is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently off of them again, and ſetting about ſomething elſe; inſomuch, that what he cries up in one hour, he ſhall as much cry down the next; he is alſo very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, and will never forget an affront once offered him, his conſtitution phlegmatic.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given the reader the judgment of the ancients upon the planetary hours, and what they portend to thoſe that are born under them, by which a perſon, comparing himſelf with what is here ſet down, may eaſily know under what planet he was born.</p>

               <head>Of the Signification of the Seven Planets, with reſpect to Men's Bodies.</head>
               <p>BEFORE I conclude my diſcourſe of the ſeven planets, their nature and influences, I ſhall give you an account of the ſignification of them, as they reſpect the ſeveral parts of man's body, and the diſeaſes that they govern, that proper remedies may be applied accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturn</hi> governs the right ear, the bladder and the bones; and the diſeaſes he governs, are quartian agues, concerns, black choler, rheums, coughs, palſies, looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the blood, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jupiter</hi> governs the lungs, ribs, liver, ſeeds, arteries, and left ear; and the diſeaſes incident to them, are pleuricies and apoplexies, and ſuch as proceed from 100 great a quantity of blood, or from wind in any part of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> governs the gall, the veins and the reigns, and their diſtempers; which are fevers, yellow jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, madneſs, choler carbuncles. <hi>Mars</hi> alſo governs the ſtones and privy members of man or woman in part.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sun</hi> governs the eyes, heart, and right ſide, and the diſeaſes relating to them; ſuch as colds, eſpecially in the ſtomach and liver, fluxes in the eyes, cramp, headach, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> governs the liver, loins, matrix, paps and throat: The diſeaſes whereof are weakneſs in the body, and members, catarrhs, French pox, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> governs the brain, thought, memory, ſpeech and tongue, and alſo the diſtempers incident thereto, are falling ſickneſs, madneſs, coughs, hoarſeneſs, ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, phthyſic, and rheums.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> governs the left eye of a man, and the right eye of a woman, alſo the ſtomach, belly, and the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030393_0033_0FE6C468CCD4D210"/>
left ſide; and the diſeaſes proper to them, are dropſies, palſies, rotten coughs, ſurfeits, worms in children, king's evil, falling ſickneſs, convulſion fits, dimneſs of ſight, ſmall pox, and meaſles. <hi>Here note,</hi> That in all diſtempers, before you apply any thing to the patient, it is proper and neceſſary to conſult the motions and poſitions of the planets; and when by the table of planetary hours before recited, you know what plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et rules; you muſt in the next place conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that planet, as whether it be fierce or cruel, as <hi>Mars;</hi> or friendly and benevolent, as <hi>Jupiter;</hi> alſo whether they be cold and moiſt, or hot and dry, and what is the predominent complexion, whether the ſanguine choler, phlegm or melancholy; as alſo what member of the body it governs, and what diſeaſe is under its power. Theſe things being diligently weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſidered, will furniſh the ingenious phyſician with grounds ſufficient to make a judgment of the true nature of the diſeaſe, whereby he may apply the ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proper remedies that ſhall beſt conſiſt with, and the moſt prevalent againſt the deſtemper; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the want of a due conſideration of the matter, cauſe the phyſicians oftentimes to adminiſter thoſe med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icines that rather kill than cure, though theſe very med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icines may be good againſt the ſame diſeaſe to a patient under other circumſtances, and falling ſick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a different poſition of the ſigns and planets.</p>

            <p>AS I have found in the Aſtrological Science there are four different ſort of humours in the the body of man, of which the four complexions are formed and of theſe one is made of yellow choler, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of black choler, a third phlegm, and a fourth of blood: And if any of theſe be wanting the body muſt periſh, becauſe they equally ſuſtain it.</p>
            <p>And all thoſe ought to be kept in an equality, or if one be predominent over the reſt, it puts the body out of order and brings diſeaſes, which many times end in death, for the blood ſtagnated and gathering into clots, cauſeth ſhortneſs of breath, which by degrees growing leſs and leſs, at laſt proves without remedy; but if a perſon be let blood in the beginning of thoſe diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humours, the danger may be eaſily prevented. To purge the blood.</p>

               <hi>R.</hi> Of both ſorts of ſcurvy graſs, of each ſix hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, of ground ivy eight handfuls, of ſage ſix hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, of ſcapwort root, four ounces. Acrimony and creſſes, of each four handfuls; of roſemary flowers, two drams, of leaves of roſemary and balm, of each a handful, four orange peals, a large nutmeg ſliced; put all into four gallons of new ale; and when it has done working, ſtop the barrel cloſe. Take a pint every morning, and at four in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe the black choler, or melancholy, is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous, and when it gains the aſcendant over the other, do great prejudice to the body ſeveral ways, cauſing divers diſtempers; and ſometimes prevails ſo much over the ſenſes, that a man becomes in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a mere ideot, and alſo raiſes a kind of ſcurf all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the body, which ſometimes turns to the meaſles, and are, beſides, very apt to make a man afraid even of his own ſhadow, and turn a ſtout man into a coward, and a well bred perſon into one that is unmannerly: But by the uſe of proper medicines, ſuch as herbs, flowers, and the like, all this may either be prevented or cured:—Firſt ſhave the head, then bleed plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, afterwards purge well with the extract of Hellebore; laſtly, let them uſe the following diet drink.</p>

White Phlegm is alſo very hurtful, if it exceed in quantity and overpower the other humours, for then they cauſe the gout, and divers diſeaſes, and are alſo prejudicial to the feet, legs knees, hands and reins, cauſing evil favor both from the teeth, mouth, noſe and ears; but alſo this may be cured by med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icines compounded of roots and flowers; likewiſe by phyſical drinks, and taking a vomit.</p>

            <p>Yellow Choler, is likewiſe very bad when it predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inates in the body, affecting the heart, and troubling the brain, and indeed weakening all the members of the body, cauſing a general faintneſs, with ſuch a loſs of appetite, that neither meat nor drink will go down:— Beſides which, it alters a man's colour, and is hurtful to the eyeſight.

               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi>] THIS month beware of letting blood on the 1ſt, 2d, 5th, 10th, 15th, 19th, 20th, and 25th days. becauſe of theſe days it is very dangerous; but to drink good white wine faſting, will both clenſe the body, and procure an appetite, but if thou haſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be let blood, and neceſſity urge it, ſee that the ſign be good for that purpoſe, or elſe it is better letting it alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>February.</hi>] I caution thee this month to beware of cutting any pottage made of ducks or mallows, for they are right perilous, and if thou haſt occaſion to let blood, whether it be on the wriſt or arms, let it not be upon the 4th, 8th, 16th, or 18th days, unleſs the ſign be very good, and the neceſſity very urgent.</p>

               <p>THOSE that are troubled with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, fevers lethargy, or pains in the head, muſt be let blood in the vein which is in the midſt of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are of a dull underſtanding, and are troubled with deafneſs and ſhortneſs of breath, alſo thoſe that have the meaſles or leproſy, muſt be let blood in the arterial vein behind the ears. Thoſe that are troubled with too much blood in the brain, which is bad for the ſight, ought to be let blood in the arterial
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030393_0043_0FE6C47A5F27C8C8"/>
veins near the temples; which is alſo very good againſt the gout, megrim, and divers other diſtempers of the head.</p>
               <p>For impoſthumes, ſwelling in the throat, quinſey, and other ſuch like diſtempers, let a man bleed in the two veins under the tongue.</p>
               <p>When the leproſy proceeds from abundance of blood it will be proper to bleed in the two original veins in the neck; but not without the advice of a phyſician.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are troubled with phthyſic, and ſhort-winded, and are given to ſpit blood, ought to bleed in the arm, and they will find eaſe.</p>
               <p>Bleeding at the liver vein in the arm takes away the extraordinary heat of the body, and keeping it in a good ſtate of health, and it is very available againſt the yellow jaundice, and impoſthumes of the liver, and againſt the palſy.</p>
               <p>The pains that come from the ſtomach and ſide, as blains, bletches, impoſthumes, and divers other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that proceed from too much repletion of blood, are cured in letting blood in the vein between the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter finger and the little finger.</p>
               <p>For the dropſy, let blood on the right ſide, between the womb and the branch. <hi>And here, note,</hi> the party ſhould bleed proportionable, according to their fatneſs, or leanneſs, and this ought not to be done without the advice of a doctor.</p>
               <p>For blotches and impoſthumes proceeding from the groin, let blood in the vein named <hi>Sophon,</hi> which is one of the three under the ankle of the foot. It is alſo of great advantage to courſes to deſcend in men, and to prevent the <hi>Hemorrhoides</hi> in the ſecret parts.</p>
               <p>When any perſon is taken by the peſtilence, cauſed by repletion of humours, let them bleed in the vein that is between the wriſt of the feet, and the great toe;— but let the patient be ſure to bleed within twentyfour hours after he is firſt ſeized with this diſtemper, and let
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030393_0044_0FE6C4BB77D8A950"/>
it be with reſpect to the patient's body whether it be fat or lean.</p>
               <p>If the eyes run with water, or be red, or any other ill, proceeding from the overflowing of blood and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; let the patient bleed in two veins that are in the angle of the eyes.</p>
               <p>If the noſe be red and pimpled, and the face be red and pimpled in the like manner, and be troubled with red drops, ſcabs, piſtules and other infections, that may proceed from too much blood; let the patient bleed in the vein which is at the end of the noſe.</p>
               <p>For the toothache, and the canker in the mouth, let the party troubled be let blood in the four veins that are in the gums in the mouth. Thoſe that are taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſtinking breath, let them be let blood in the vein that is between the lip and the chin.</p>
               <p>There are four veins in each arm, the biggeſt of the four is from the head, the heart challenges the ſecond, and the third from the liver; the laſt is called the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er liver vein, and comes from the melt. Theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent veins ſhould be bled upon different occaſions: As for inſtance, for pains in the head, eyes, brain, heart, ſweeled faces, and thoſe that are red; it is moſt proper to bleed that vein in the arm which has relation to the head. For fevers, either tertains or quartans, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er liver vein is the moſt proper to be blooded; but then care muſt be taken that the orifice be made wider, and not ſo deep as uſual, leſt thereby it not only gathers wind, but alſo damages a ſinew that is underneath it, called the lizard.</p>
               <p>There are three veins in each, and that above the thumb is proper to bleed, in order to remove the heat of the face, and to diſſipate the thick blood, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that are in the head, this vein being more proper than the arm.</p>
               <p>Againſt all fevers, tertains and quartans, phlegms, and other obſtructions about the paps and the melt,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030393_0045_0FE6C47C8BDB1860"/>
letting blood between the little finger and the leech finger, helps very much.</p>
               <p>Againſt pain and humours in the groin and geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, bleed a vein in the thigh.</p>
               <p>Againſt pains in the flanks, and to diſſipate all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that would gather therein, and to reſtrain too great a flux in the menſtrues in women, it exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helps to bleed the vein under the ankle of the foot, without, which is called the Sciot.</p>

               <head>Of <hi>Phyſiognomy,</hi> and the Judgment made therby.</head>
               <p>PHYSIOGNOMY is an ingenuous ſcience of knowledge of nature, by which the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diſpoſitions of every creature are underſtood; and becauſe ſome of the members are uncompounded, and enrire of themſelves, as the tongue, the ears, &amp;c. and ſome of a mixed nature, the eye, the noſe, and others; we therefore ſay, that there are many ſigns which agree and live together, which inform a wiſe man how to make his judgment, before he be too raſh to deliver it to the world.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to be eſteemed a fooliſh and idle art, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is derived from the ſuperior bodies. For there is no part of the face of the man, but what is under the

peculiar influence or government, not only of the ſeven planets, but alſo of the twelve ſigns of the Zodiack, and from each governing part is the nature and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a man or woman plainly foretold, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons undertaking this province, or pretending to it, be an artiſt. Which, that my reader may attain to, I ſhall ſet theſe things in a clearer light by the following figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>By this the reader may ſee, at the firſt glance, that the forehead is governed by ♂ <hi>Mars;</hi> the right eye is under the dominion of ☉ <hi>Sol;</hi> the left eye is ruled by the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> 
                  <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Luna;</hi> the right ear is the care of ♃ <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the left of ♄ <hi>Saturn;</hi> the ruling of the noſe is claimed by ♀ <hi>Venus</hi> (which by the way is one reaſon that in all unlawful veneral encounters, the noſe is ſo ſubject to bear the ſcars which are gotten in thoſe wars) and the nimble ☿ <hi>Mercury,</hi> the ſignificator of eloquence, claims the dominion of the mouth, and that very juſtly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:030393_0054_0FE6C4CE1DBC4248"/>Thus have the ſeven planets divided the face among them, but not with ſo abſolute a ſway, but that the twelve ſigns of the Zodiac come in for a part; and therefore the ſign of ♋ <hi>Cancer</hi> preſides in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the forehead, and ♌ <hi>Leo</hi> attending upon the right eyebrow, ♐ <hi>Sagittary</hi> does upon the right eye, and ♎ <hi>Libra</hi> upo the right ear; upon the left eye and eyebrow, you will find ♒ <hi>Aquarius</hi> and ♊ <hi>Gemini</hi> and ♈ <hi>Aries</hi> taking care of the left ear; ♉ <hi>Taurus</hi> rules in the forehead, and ♑ <hi>Capricorn</hi> the chin; ♍ <hi>Scorpio</hi> takes upon him the protection of the noſe; ♏ <hi>Virgo</hi> claims the precedence of the right cheek, and ♓ <hi>Piſces</hi> of the left. And thus the face of man is cantoned out among the ſigns and planets, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carefully attended to, will ſufficiently inform the artiſt how to paſs a judgment. For according to the nature of the ſign or planet ruling, ſo alſo is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be of the part ruled; which all thoſe that have underſtanding know eaſily how to apply.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to give a particular judgment of the ſeveral parts of the body: And <hi>firſt. Of the head.</hi> A large head ſhews a perſon ſtupid and of a dull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, alſo a very ſmall head ſignifies the ſame; but the head of a man being neither great nor ſmall, is the prognoſtic of a wiſe man; for all extremes are irregular, and a deviation from nature; and experience has made it manifeſt, that a great head and ſmall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, do always produce much indiſcretion and folly, both in man or woman; but we muſt alſo conſider the ſeveral parts of the head: And firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Hair.</hi>] The hair is only the excreſence of a moiſt brain; yet the ancients obſerve ſeveral things from it; as, if the hair be thin, it ſhews a man to be of a weak conſtitution; but if curled and thick, it ſhews the perſon to be of a hot complexion: If the hair be ſtiff, and ſtand upright, either upon the head, or any other part of the body, it ſhews the perſon extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030393_0055_0FE6C486B27EAE78"/>
ſubject to fear, and very apt to be frighted. If the hair be thick and lank, it ſhews the perſon to be meek and humble, and his conſtitution inclined to cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Forehead.</hi>] A large forehead ſhews a liberal man; but the forehead narrow, denotes a fooliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: A long forehead ſhews one apt to learn, and a high forehead, ſwelling and round, is a ſign of a crafty man, and a coward; a forehead full of wrinkles, ſhews a man to be envious and crafty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Eyes.</hi>] The eyes being moiſt and clear, ſhews mirth, good manners, and an honeſt life, but if the eyes be declining and looking downward, or red and very great, they betoken fleſhy luſt; ſmall hallow eyes ſignify covetouſneſs; grey eyes an evil man, hollow eyes a crafty man, rolling eyes a wicked and vicious man, black eyes denote a ſharp and piercing wit, but one luſtful and incontinent; great eyes denote ſloth; trembling eyes ſluggiſhneſs; glittering eyes betokens drunkenneſs; ſmilling eyes ſhew a merry life; eyes of divers colours,, and ſmall, denote one crafty and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering; eyes turned towards the noſe, ſhew a man given to women; great drooping eyes, with an unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble countenance, ſhew a man mad; the circle of the ball green, declares a crafty wicked man, and a thief; moiſt eyes denote ſtoutneſs of ſtomach, perfect ſpeech gluttonous and mad; high eyes, large, clear, pure and moiſt, are tokens of circumſpection, diligent perſons, and lovers; eyes always running, without ſickneſs cauſe it, ſhew fooliſhneſs; ſmall and hollow eyes, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, deceitful, and angry man; cheerful eyes betoken juſt men, of pleaſant diſpoſition, kind and holy; twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eyes, ſhew a thief and one that lays wait to catch and enſnare men; blear eyes ſignify a whoremaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Eyebrows.</hi>] Upright eyebrows are amiable, but the eyebrows hanging over, ſhew an effeminate perſon. The brows very hairy, denote an impediment
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030393_0056_0FE6C4CE2C14D9E0"/>
in his ſpeech, and the brows being extended to the temples, ſhew a man to be a ſloven, and uncleanly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Ears.</hi>] Open ears ſhew a man to be without reaſon and underſtanding; great ears an unwiſe man, and ſmall ears a fool; ſquare ears, and of a middle ſize, ſhew a learned and wiſe man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Noſe.</hi>] A great noſe ſhews a good man; a little noſe a deceitful perſon. A ſharp noſe denotes an angry perſon, and a ſcold; thick and low, a perſon of bad manners. The noſe ſtretching to the mouth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes honeſty, ſtrength, and aptneſs to learning. A noſe like an ape, betokens a libidinous and riotous perſon; a long crooked noſe, magnanimity and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Mouth.</hi>] A very big mouth, with the upper lip hanging over, ſignifies a man fooliſh and unſteady, alſo a raſh man, a babbler, a glutton, and an ungodly man. An indifferent large mouth, ſheweth a bold and courageous man, a warrior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Lips.</hi>] Thin lips with a little mouth, ſhews an effeminate perſon. Slender, thin and fine lips, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens eloquence; fleſhy and great lips, a fool; and thoſe whoſe teeth bear up their lips, are generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious, ſlanderers, unfaithful, alſo addicted to the love of women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the face.</hi>] A lean face is a token of a wiſe man; the face plain and flat, denotes a man of ſtrife: The face without any riſing or ſwelling, denotes a perſon injurious and unclean; a fleſhy face ſhews a man apt to learn; a ſad face ſometimes denotes fooliſhneſs, and ſometimes wiſdom. A fat face ſhews a man to be a liar, and fooliſh; a round face ſignifies folly; a great face ſhews a man dull and ſlow about buſineſs; a well proportioned face ſhews a perſon to have virtuous qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and to live a commendable life, whether they be rich or poor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:030393_0057_0FE6C48F9C6C8510"/>
                  <hi>Of the Voice.</hi>] A ſhrill voice denotes a perſon to be choleric and haſty. A great and hoarſe voice ſhews a perſon to be injurious, and of a mercileſs temper. A weak and low voice ſhews a man to be fearful and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly. A grave and ſlow voice ſhews a man to be of a ſedate and quiet temper, and one of great ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Neck.</hi>] A neck inclining to the right ſide, ſhews a temperate man; but turning to the left ſide, a fool, and a man given to unlawful love. A crooked neck ſhews a covetous man. A thick neck denotes a rude, barbarous, ill natured man. A long ſlender neck ſhews a man to be a coward. A thick and long neck, a furious and ſtubborn perſon. A mean neck, a ſtrong and virtuous man, and one inclined to learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Breaſt.</hi>] A broad breaſt is always good, and preſents magnanimity, boldneſs, honeſty and courage. A narrow breaſt denotes imbecility, or weakneſs, both of body and mind. A purſy or groſs breaſt, ſhews a man to be moroſs, croſs and void of pity. The pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or dugs hanging down from the breaſt, ſhews a violent choleric man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Back.</hi>] A broad back is a ſign of ſtrength; but the mean proportion of both back and breaſt is always commendable. A crooked or hunch back, is generally a token of a nigardly and covetous perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Belly.</hi>] A lank belly, with a high breaſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a man of underſtanding, courage, counſel; but a great belly ſhews an indiſcreet, fooliſh, proud man, and given to luxury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Arms.</hi>] Very long arms are a ſign of boldneſs, ſtrength and honeſty. Short arms denote a fomenter of diſcord and ſtrife among friends.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Hands.</hi>] The hands very ſhort, denote a clowniſh, rude, ill bread perſon; and if fat and fleſhy, with the fingers ſo alſo, it ſhews they are inclined to theft. Small hands and long fingers denote a perſon of a genteel carriage, but crafty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:030393_0058_0FE6C4CF40FC9040"/>

Slender legs denote ignorance; ſhort and fat legs cruelty. Legs crooked and hollowed inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a ſign of very ill men. Soft and ſwelling legs ſhew a man to be of very ill manners. The ſkin croſs and ſhort, with a ſharp heel, and fat thighs, denotes madneſs to happen to that party.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> Of <hi>Palmeſtry,</hi> ſhewing the various Judgments drawn from the Hand.</head>
               <p>ISAALL next ſay ſomething of Palmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is a judgment made of the conditions incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and fortunes of men and women, from the various lines and characters which nature has imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hand, which are almoſt as various as the hands that have them. And to render what I ſhall ſay more plain, I will in the firſt place preſent the ſcheme or fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of a hand, and explain the various lines therein.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>By this figure the reader will ſee that one of the lines, and which indeed is reckoned the principal, is called the line of life; this line incloſes the thumb, ſeparating it from the hollow of the hand. The next to it, which is called the natural line, takes its beginning from the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030393_0059_0FE6C48FAC0E4A30"/>
riſing of the fore finger, near the line of life, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the table line, and generally makes a triangle, thus <g ref="char:trine">△</g>. The table line, commonly called the line of fortune, begins under the little finger, and ends near the middle finger. The girdle of <hi>Venus,</hi> which in another line ſo called, begins near the joint of the little finger, and ends between the fore finger and the middle finger.</p>
               <p>The line of death is that which plainly appears in a counter line to that of life, and by ſome is called the ſiſter line, ending uſually at the other end; for when the line of life is ending, death comes, and it can go no farther. There are alſo lines in the fleſhy parts as in the ball of the thumb, which is called the mount of <hi>Venus;</hi> under each of the fingers are called mounts, which are each one governed by a ſeveral planet, and the hollow of the hand is called the plain of <hi>Mars.</hi> I now proceed to give judgment of theſe ſeveral lines. And in the firſt place take notice, that in Palmeſtry the left hand is chiefly to be regarded; becauſe therein the lines are moſt viſible, and have the ſtricteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the heart and brains. Now having promiſed theſe, in the next place obſerve the line of life, and if it be fair, extended to its full length, and not broken with an intermixture of croſs lines, it ſhews long life and health; and it is the ſame if a double line of life appears, as there ſometimes does. When the <hi>Stars</hi> appear in this line, it is a ſignificator of great loſſeſs and calamities: if on it there be the figure of two O's, or a Y, it threatens the perſon with blindneſs. If it wraps itſelf about the table line, then does it promiſe wealth and honor to be attained by prudence and induſtry; if the line be cut or rugged at the upper end, it denotes much ſickneſs. If this line be cut by any line coming from the mount of <hi>Venus,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030393_0060_0FE6C4CF502F2488"/>
the line of life and the table line, ſhews the perſon to be very liberal and charitable, and of a noble ſpirit. Let us now ſee the ſignification of the table line.</p>
               <p>The table line, when broad, and of a lovely colour, ſhews a healthful conſtitution, and a quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented mind, and courageous ſpirit: But if it have croſſes towards the little finger, it threatens the party with much affliction by ſickneſs. If the line be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or divided in three parts in any of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it ſhews the party to be of a generous temper, and of a good fortune to ſupport it; but if this line be forked at the end, it threatens the perſon ſhall ſuffer by jealouſies, fears, and doubts, and with the loſs of riches got by deceit. If three points ſuch as theſe ... are found in it, they denote the perſon prudent and liberal, a lover of learning, and of a good temper. If it ſpreads itſelf towards the fore and middle fingers, and ends blunt, it denotes preferment. Let us now ſee what is ſignified by</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The middle Finger.</hi>] The line has in it ſometimes (for there is ſcarce one hand in which it varies not) divers ſignificant characters. Many ſmall lines between this and the table line threatens the party with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and alſo gives him hopes of recovery. A half croſs branching into this line, declares the perſon ſhall have honor, riches, and good ſucceſs in all his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. A half moon denotes cold and watery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, but a ſun or ſtar upon this line promiſeth proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and riches. This line doubled in a woman ſhews ſhe will have ſeveral huſbands, but without any children by them.</p>
               <p>The line of <hi>Venus,</hi> if it happens to be cut or divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the fore finger, threatens ruin to the party, and that it ſhall befal him by means of a laſcivious woman, and bad company. Two croſſes upon this line, one being on the forefinger, and the other bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030393_0061_0FE6C490C7503528"/>
towards the little finger, ſhews the party to be weak, and inclined to modeſty and virtue; and indeed, it gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally denotes modeſty in women; and therefore thoſe who deſire ſuch wives, uſually chooſe them by this ſtandard.</p>
               <p>The liver line, if it be ſtrait and croſſed by other lines, ſhews the perſon to be of a ſound judgment, and a piercing underſtanding; but if it be winding crooked, and bending outward, it ſhews deceit and flattery, and that the perſon is not to be truſted. If it makes a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, or a quadrangle <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, it ſhews the perſon to be of a noble deſcent, and ambitious of honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>
               <p>If it happens that this line and the middle line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin near each other, it denotes a perſon to be weak in his judgment, but if a woman, danger by hard labor.</p>
               <p>The plain of <hi>Mars</hi> being in the hollow of the hand, or if the line paſſes through it, which renders it very plain, is fortune: This plain being hollowed, and the lines be crooked and diſtorted, threaten the party to fall by his ill conduct. When the lines begin at the wriſt, long within the plain, reaching the brawn of the hand, they ſhew the perſon to be one given to quarreling, often in broils, and of a hot and fiery ſpirit, by which he ſhall ſuffer much damage. If deep large croſſes in the middle of the plain, it ſhews the party ſhall obtain honor by martial exploits; but if it be a woman, that ſhe ſhall have ſeveral huſbands, and eaſy labour with her children.</p>
               <p>The line of death is fatal, when any croſſes or broken lines appear in it; for they threaten the perſon with ſickneſs and a ſhort life. A clouded moon appearing therein, threatens a child bed woman with death. A bloody ſpot in the line, denotes a violent death. A ſtar like a comet threatens ruin by war, and death by peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence; but if a bright ſun appear therein, it promiſes long life and proſperity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:030393_0062_0FE6C4D81949A9D0"/>As for the lines in the wriſt being fair, they denote good fortune; but if croſſed and broken, the contrary.</p>
               <p>Thus much with reſpect to the ſeveral lines in the hand. Now as to the judgment to be made from the hand itſelf: If the hand be ſoft and long, and lean withal, it denotes the perſon of a good underſtanding, a lover of peace and honeſty, diſcreet, ſerviceable, a good neighbour, and a lover of learning. He whoſe hands are very thick and very ſhort, is thereby ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be faithful, ſtrong and laborious, and one that cannot long retain his anger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A YEAR is the principal part of time, by which not only the ages of man and other things, but alſo the times of many actions in the world, their beginning, progreſs, continuance and intervals are meaſured: and is a periodical revolution of a great circle of months and days, in which the four ſeaſons of <hi>Spring, Summer, Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> are, after one rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution of the ſun, ordained to return to their courſes.</p>
            <p>But there are divers ſorts of years, as ſay the ancients, according to divers nations, which are different from one another, reduced to the rule of celeſtial motions. The year is divided in aſtronomical and political parts.</p>
            <p>The aſtronomical year is two fold, that is <hi>Solar</hi> and <hi>Lunar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſolar year is the time in which the ſun, by his proper motion, departing from one point of the eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030393_0069_0FE6C49B14731798"/>
returns to the ſame again. And there is called either natural or ſyderical.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The natural or tropical year, is the ſpace of time in which the ſun is departing out of the tropical, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, or ſolſtitial point, and returning through the ecliptic, returneth to the ſame again.</p>
            <p>This natural, or tropical year, contains 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 15 ſeconds.</p>
            <p>The true and unequal tropical year, is ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs than the equal, by 6 or 7 min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes; ſo it increaſeth, or decreaſeth, according to the ſwift or ſlow progreſs of the equinoctial or ſolſtitial points.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſyderial year is the ſpace of time in which the ſun returns to the ſame ſtar, from whence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; and is 365 days, 6 hours, 6 minutes, but in the ſeconds there is a difference among authors.</p>
            <p>Now the lunar year is likewiſe two fold; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which is 12 moons, or 354 days, 8 hours, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The embilliſmal, which is 13 moons or lunations, containing 383 days, 21 hours, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The political and civil years, are ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed for the diſtinction of times, wherein reſpect had either to the motion of the ſun or moon only, or to them both together, according to the cuſtom of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers nations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Julian</hi> or old <hi>Roman</hi> year, conſiſted of 365 days and 6 hours; this <hi>Julian</hi> account, or year, is uſed by the <hi>Engliſh, Muſcovites, Syrians, Abaſſenees</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> though the names of the months differ. It is held to begin (with the vulgar) on the 1ſt of Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, which is therefore called New Year's Day; but according to the ſtate accounts, the year begins not till the year; as for example: The firſt day of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary next will be reckoned the firſt day of the year 1797. But becauſe the ſtate firſt account begins not till the 25th of March they commonly write the date double, thus 1719—20 from the 1ſt of January till the 25th of March, after which they write only 1720.</p>
            <p>The Gregorian, or new Roman year, is ſo called, becauſe mended by <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> XIII. conſiſts of 365 days, 5 hours, 40 minutes and 12 ſeconds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It begins

               <p>THE months by which we meaſure the year, are of two ſorts, viz. aſtronomical, and political, and each hath ſeveral diviſions; aſtronomical or nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural, are according to the motion of the ſun and moon; and be either Solar or Lunar; the Solar are the ſpace of time in which the ſun runs through a twelfth part of the Zodiac, of which there are two ſorts, mean or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, true or unequal; an equal ſolar month, is the time in which the ſun by his mean motion, goeth a twelfth part of the Zodiac, and is always 30 days, 10 hours, 26 minutes, 6 ſeconds, &amp;c. But the true or apparent, is according to the true motion of the ſun through the Zodiac; for when he is in, or near his apogaeon, the months are longer, but when he is in, or near his perigaeon, they are ſhorter. Lunar months are referred to the moon's motion, and are chiefly three fold, viz.—Firſt, periodical, which is the ſpace of time in which the moon, by her motion, goes through the Zodiac, and is about 27 days, 8 hours; ſecondly, ſynodical, which is the ſpace of time from one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to another, being performed according to the moon's mean motion, in 29 days, 22 hours, 44 minutes, and about 4 ſeconds: But according to the moon's true motion, it is ſometimes greater or leſſer, by about 12 hours.—Thirdly, the month of illumination, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, is ſaid to be 28 days, or four weeks, it being the longeſt time that the moon is to be ſeen between the change and change: Laſtly, the political months are evil and uſual: As every nation beſt pleaſe; which differ both in proportion and name.</p>

But yet if the ground be light and ſandy, it may be ploughed in the winter, if the weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will permit.

                  <p>Now if your ground be barren and cold, producing ſtore of weeds or ruſhes, or to bring it to a moderate heat, and ſo make fruitful, let it be manured with lime.

It is a greater help to a cold, clayey wet ground; ſuch grounds are alſo very much helped by laying dung, or
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030393_0081_0FE6C523860BB2F0"/>
any ſoil that is fattening, either of cattle, or ſuch as is caſt out of pond lakes, or muddy ditches, for bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and hot earth can never be overlaid with good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and compoſt, for that warms the earth, and it is the want of warmth makes it unfruitful.</p>
                  <p>As for the hacking and ſanding before mentioned, the firſt is, after the ground has been turned up with the plough, to go over it with a long hoe, or hack, and cut in pieces the graſs which you ſee turned up with ridges or furrows, or any uneven lumps, that it may be dragged away, burnt, or carried together with the weeds, not to grow up again, to incumber the corn. And landing it, to bring loads of ſand, and lay them in convenient places, ſpreading them lightly, or thick (as you ſee occaſion) over the ground, that the lime mixing with it, may the better embody with the mould, and produce a good crop.</p>
                  <p>But beſide what I have already mentioned, there are ſeveral other ways of manuring land: I will mention ſome of them, for the huſbandman's better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But here it will not be amiſs to take notice, that what will do very well for one ſort of land, will not do at all for another; and therefore in manuring of land, regard muſt be had to the nature of it: As for example; for a clayey ground, lime and ſand is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent to manure it with, but for a barren ſandy ground, good marle is much more proper. If it be aſked, <hi>What this marle is?</hi> I anſwer, it is a rich cliff clay, an enemy to all weeds that ſpring up of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and gives a generative virtue to all ſeeds that are ſown in the ground. It is of a glewy ſubſtance, in quality cold and dry, and was earth before ti was marle, it is nothing but a rich clay of divers colours, according to the ſtrength of the ſun and climate where it is produced. This is ſo good a manure, that well laid on, it will enrich the barreneſt ground for ten years, and ſome for thirty. To find it, take an auger whimble, made to hold many bits, one longer than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030393_0082_0FE6C5110AA78A00"/>
till you have tried, by drawing the earth into one place, then proceed in the moſt proper places till you come to the marle, and the propereſt places are in the loweſt parts of high countries, near the brooks and lakes, and in the high parts of low countries, upon the knolls or little hills, and in the clefts of ſteep banks, or branches in hills opening themſelves; in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it lies deep, in others ſhallow; and commonly barrenly ſandy grounds are verged with it, lying very deep. Having found it, dig it up in great lumps, and lay it in heaps a yard diſtance one from another, and when it is dried, ſpread all the heaps.—Many mix the marle with the ſand; but becauſe this is not ſo eaſy to come at, I will ſpeak of others more general, that will enrich any poor ſand or city for grain, with leſs trouble and coſt than before.</p>
                  <p>Woolen rags are very profitable for manuring and enriching of land, a ſackful and half being ſufficient for dreſſing an acre of arable ground. The way of uſing them is to chop them very ſmall, and ſpread them an equal thickneſs over the land before the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing time, and then coming to fallow, let the plough take them carefully into the ground, and cover them.</p>
                  <p>Shavings, or waſte horns, or hoofs of beaſts, are very good to manure land withal; ſcatter the ſhavings in the ſame manner, and plough them in after heat.

Alſo malt duſt is much available to this purpoſe, allowing three quarts of it to an acre. And to enrich your dung or layſtall, is to

                  <p>In ſowing of your ſeed, let your grain be the beſt, and ſcatter it according to the art of good huſbandry, and let your ſprinkling be a medium, not too much, nor too little. But to make the ſeed proſper the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſteep it in thick ſlimy water, that drains from dunghills, and if no ſuch is to be had near at hand, ſteep cow dung in water, and ſoak the ſeed in it; wheat will be well ſoaked in 18 hours; barley in 36; peas in 12; but rye and oats may be ſowed dry, for that agrees beſt with them.</p>
                  <p>But when the ſeed is ſown, all is not done; you muſt take care to prevent the deſigns of thoſe that will make void all your labour, and defeat your hopes, or elſe, though you have ſown your corn, you ſhall never ſee it come up; rooks, crows and daws, are great devourers of grain, who will be ſure to be about you when you go to ſow; to keep theſe at a diſtance, ſhoot ſome of them, and hang them upon poles in divers angles of your field; ſtick their feathers along the ridges of the land; lay trains of gunpowder and blow the powder up, or let it lie ſcattered in the moſt frequented places, and the ſcent of it will make them forſake the field, eſpecially now and then ſhooting a little; you may alſo take great numbers of them by placing ſtrong thick brown paper, twiſted taper wiſe, like thoſe on ſugar loaves, in holes of the earth, the broad top coming even with the ground, bird lime the inſide, and ſcatter ſome grain in it, and then the fowl putting in his head to take it out, the paper ſo limed will ſtick cloſe, and riſe with him, when being blindfolded, in amaze he will fly up a great height, and will fall down again, ſo that if you be near at hand, he may eaſily be taken.

The ſcent of any bitter thing being ſo offenſive to them, that they are never found where any ſuch things grow.</p>
                  <p>Moles are another vermin to be deſtroyed, for they are in a double regard deſtructive to corn; that is, in eating the roots, and rooting it up; not making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of any ſort, and taſting all alike; there are divers ways of taking them, but not ſo eaſily when the corn is well grown, for then they do the greateſt miſchief, when their tracts, or caſting up their hills, cannot be diſcovered ſo eaſily; however, you muſt do as well as you can; and when you ſee them caſting, or moving in their tracks, ſtrike them with an iron of

                  <p>When the corn is ſprung up about a foot above the ground, thoſe ſorts of ſoil that are apt to produce weeds, will require your looking after to root them out: If they be thiſtles, or ſuch as are great and offenſive, they muſt be taken away with hooks and nippers, cutting them off cloſe by the roots, or rather pulling them up by the roots, if you can do it without breaking the ground, ſo as to bring corn along with them. The nipper may be made with two long pieces of wood ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetted, to be opened like a pair of pincers, with ſaw-teeth, cloſing in one another, that they may take the ſurer and firmer hold without ſlipping. And theſe weeds may be much hindered in their growth, by ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two buſhels of bay ſalt in an acre of land, as you do your wheat; for though is is a friend to corn, in making it proſper and increaſe, yet it is an enemy to the weeds, and hinders their growth.</p>

And this is two ways, viz. by watering and manuring it. And for this uſe, the lower the ground lies (ſo it be not ſubject to overflowings, or too much wet) the better it is, and the ſooner made good. Conſider in the next place, what kind of graſs it naturally produces, whether clear and entire, or mix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> with that of worſe growth, the firſt is beſt; but if it be of a worſe ſort, intermixed with thiſtles, broom and offenſive weeds, then grub and pluck them by the roots, clearing the ground of them as well as you can, then dry them, mix them with ſtraw, and burn them upon the ſwarth of the ground, and ſpread the aſhes upon it, then fold your ſheep upon the ground for ſeverel nights, that their dung may increaſe its ſtrength, and their feet trample up the graſs; then ſcatter it well over with hay ſeeds, and go over them with a roller, or beat them with a flat ſhovel, that they may be preſſed into the ground to take root; then over theſe ſcatter hay, or the rooting of hay under ſtacks, or the ſweeping of the barns, or moiſt bottoms of any hay that has been good, and is moiſt, and of no other uſe, then ſpread on your manure, as horſe dung, man's odure, or the dung of any beaſt, which being thinned, and the clods well broken, let it lie till the new graſs ſpring through it; but do not graze it the firſt year, leſt the cattle tread it up, not having yet taken very good root, but mow it that it may have time to come to perfection; and though the firſt year it may prove ſhort and coarſe, yet the ſecond it will be fine and very long, and in great plenty. And dreſſing it thus but once in twenty years, will continue it for good meadow or paſture; eſpecially if in dry ſeaſons you have water to relieve it, which may be done by bringing ſprings
