            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHETHER the Bank ſhall be aboliſhed or eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is one of thoſe important queſtions which will in courſe attract your notice. The heat of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will then give birth to many arguments. But diſputants do not always convey information. There is (no doubt) a great majority of members who will vote according to their diſpaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate judgment; and ſuch men will naturally wiſh to form opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on plain reaſon plainly delivered. To them therefore this paper is addreſſed. And, in order that we may have a clear view of the object, let us conſider (firſt) whether admitting the inſtitution of the Bank to have been pernicious, a law to aboliſh it would be wiſe, and (ſecondly) whether it is really a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, admitting the inſtitution of the Bank to have been pernicious, would a law to aboliſh it be wiſe. The anſwer to this queſtion depends on two points. Firſt, whether ſuch a law would be effectual; and ſecondly, whether it would be prudent. An enquiry whether the law would be effectual, involves a doubt of your power, and may therefore offend the weak or illiberal, but wiſe repreſentatives of free citizens, will liſten with candour and form a diſpaſſionate judgment. They know that the boaſted omnipotence of legiſlative authority is but a jingle of words. In the literal meaning it is impious. And whatever interpretation lawyers may give, freemen muſt feel it to be abſurd and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional. <hi>Abſurd,</hi> becauſe laws cannot alter the nature of things; <hi>unconſtitutional,</hi> becauſe the conſtitution is no more, if it can be changed by the legiſlature. A law was once paſſed in New-Jerſey which the judges pronounced to be unconſtitutional, and therefore void, ſurely no good citizen can wiſh to ſee this point decided in the tribunals of Pennſylvania. Such power in judges is dangerous; but unleſs it ſome where exiſts, the time employed in framing a bill of rights and form of government was meerly thrown away.</p>
            <p>The doubt which ariſes on this occaſion, as to the extent of your authority, is not founded on the charter granted by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs:
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018897_0003_0FA82B1D52CED1C0"/>
but ſuppoſing the incorporation of the Bank to have been the ſame in its origin as that of a church, we aſk whether the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and the rights acquired by law, can be deſtroyed by law. Negroes have by law acquired the right of citizens, would a ſubſequent law take that right away? It is not true that the right to give, involves the right to take. A father (for inſtance) has no power over the life of his child, nor can a felon or traitor pardoned by act of grace, be by repeal of that act condemned and executed. Should an act be paſſed to cancel the public debts, would that act be valid? Where an eſtate has been granted by law, can it be revoked by a ſubſequent law? Could the lands forfeited and ſold, be reſumed and conveyed to the original own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Many ſuch queſtions might be put, and a judicial deciſion (either affirmative or negative) would be inconvenient and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Look then to the end e'er you commence the labor.</p>
            <p>Secondly, admitting your power, ought it (in prudence) to be exerciſed. You will certainly conſider, that (as a violation of private property) it muſt ſully the reputation of the ſtate. Good men are careful of their own reputation, and protect that of their country, from <hi>ſentiment.</hi> Wiſe men are confirmed in this ſentiment, by <hi>reflection</hi> and <hi>information.</hi> Facts are ſometimes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than arguments. It is then a fact, that applications made by citizens of Pennſylvania to borrow money in Holland, have been defeated by thoſe attacks already made on the Bank. It is alſo a fact, that the credit of our merchants has been greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured (in foreign countries) from the ſame cauſe. This is the argument which foreigners uſe. <hi>If your government ſo little reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the property of their own citizens as to overturn an inſtitution like the Bank, how can our property be ſafe among you?</hi> It will not be eaſy to anſwer that queſtion, and you know gentlemen that your merchants cannot give credit, unleſs they can get credit; and you know alſo how important credit is to the frontier inhabitants at leaſt, if not to thoſe of the more ſettled country.</p>
            <p>Deeply therefore are we intereſted in preſerving unſullied fame. But if this conſideration has not ſufficient weight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the domeſtic conſequences of aboliſhing charters. What is practice to-day, becomes precedent to-morrow. And ſure it is worth ſome ſerious thought, whether this dangerous practice ſhall be introduced. Every man is intereſted in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch precedent, as a member of ſome religious ſociety, or of particular corporations for the promotion of ſcience, or the purpoſes of humanity. Attention to the changes of human affairs, like meditation among the tombs, teaches ſolemn and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018897_0004_0FA82B1E10044BC8"/>
affecting leſſons of wiſdom and moderation. Look back to the diſputes which convulſed this commonwealth twenty years ago. Mark the ſucceeding revolutions. See how friendſhips and how enmities have changed. See how power has been wreſted from one, and graſped by another. This generation will ſoon paſs away. Who can deſignate the men that will ſit in ſeats of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority twenty years hence? or five? or one? You are here to-day, and gone to-morrow. Beware then how you lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for future encroachments. While juſtice is the principle of government, to be innocent is to be ſecure. Be not then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the momentary bauble of power; for place it where you will it is dangerous, and the tyrannous uſe of it is always tyranny. Thoſe who live by the ſword ſhall die by the ſword. The violent muſt, of neceſſity, become victims of violence. Should the next election give power to thoſe who may now be oppreſſed, what bounds ſhall be ſet to unbridled reſentment? May not all charters be at once laid low, by a general law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the exiſtence of corporations to be incompatible with the public welfare? Since, then, theſe conſequences may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, we may reaſonably doubt whether a law to aboliſh the Bank would be wiſe, even if the inſtitution had been pernicious. But is it really a pernicious inſtitution?</p>
            <p>This queſtion is of great magnitude. Some objections againſt the bank may perhaps be well founded. Let us examine them. They are firſt, that it enables men to trade to their utter ruin by giving them the temporary uſe of credit and money. Secondly, that the punctuality required at the Bank, throws honeſt men into the hands of uſurers. Thirdly, that the great dividend on bank ſtock induces monied men to buy ſtock rather than lend on intereſt. Fourthly, that rich foreigners will (for the ſame reaſon) become ſtockholders ſo as that all the property will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally veſt in them. Fifthly, that the payment of dividends to foreigners will be a conſtant drain of ſpecie from the country. Sixthly, that the Bank facilitates the exportation of coin? Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it injures the circulation of bills of credit. Eighthly, that the wealth and influence of the Bank may become dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the government. Ninthly, that the directors can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unfair advantages in trade for themſelves and their friends. And tenthly, that it is deſtructive of that equality which ought to take place in a free country.</p>
            <p>Theſe objections, though artfully made and induſtriouſly circulated, do not conſiſt very well together. For if it be true that the Bank enables men to overtrade themſelves, by the uſe
<pb n="6"
                   facs="unknown:018897_0005_0FA82B1EC77AC3B0"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
of money at an eaſy rate; it cannot be true that it throws men into the hands of uſurers, who exact for the uſe of money an exorbitant rate. If it be true, that foreigners will buy out ſtockholders (even as is ſaid at fifty per cent advance) ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proprietors of the whole; it cannot be true that the money of our rich citizens will be veſted in bank ſtock, and none remain for loans. If it be true, that the Bank facilitates the exportation of coin; it cannot be true that it injures the circulation of bills of credit, which bills are always expreſsly emitted to ſupply the real or ſuppoſed want of ſpecie. If it be true, that the uſe of money obtained by diſcounts at the Bank ruins the trade; it cannot be true that the directors and their friends would gain any advantage by it. If it be true, that the Bank has a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to lock up in its vaults the money of rich citizens; it cannot be true that it facilitates the exportation of coin. If it be true, that foreigners will continually bring in money to buy the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the ſtock; it cannot be true that the country will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually be drained of ſpecie by paying the dividend on that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. If it be true, that the funds of the Bank muſt finally veſt in foreigners; it cannot be true that it is deſtructive of equality among the citizens.</p>
            <p>Thus much in general. Let us next conſider each objection by itſelf; and firſt, that it enables men to trade to their utter ruin, by giving them the temporary uſe of money. It is true that the Bank has given great facility to commercial people, of which ſome have made an imprudent uſe, by engaging in raſh and ruinous enterprizes. But this abuſe of commercial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages cannot be prevented, otherwiſe than by the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of commerce itſelf, or by confining the trade (as in China) to an excluſive company. Neither of theſe modes would ſuit the genius and temper of Pennſylvania. We muſt therefore (as in former times) leave the fooliſh to ſuffer the conſequence of their folly, and not puniſh (for their ſakes) the ſober and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet. The convenience merchants derive from being able to obtain money for ſhort periods, and on eaſy terms, is of the greateſt conſequence to them. And it would be a marvellous thing indeed, if the uſe of water were prohibited, becauſe ſome people chuſe to drown themſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is ſaid that the punctuality required at the Bank throws honeſt men into the hands of uſurers. This objection will admit of nearly the ſame anſwer with the laſt. If men who borrow for a ſhort term, will engage the funds borrowed in long ſpeculations, thereby depriving themſelves of the means of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018897_0006_0FA82B1F9EDEA238"/>
payment, who is to blame? Is it the benevolent lender, or the fooliſh and diſhoneſt borrower? Why did he incur the debt and undertake the payment? or why diveſt himſelf of the means? But ſay, that a man is (by misfortune) in want of a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum, without which his credit would ſuffer. The Bank advance the ſum for forty days, and ſave him from ruin. If within that period he collects his funds, and repays the advance, has he derived no benefit from the Bank? If at the end of forty days he ſhould be unable to pay, is the ſituation worſe than it was? If in that caſe the Bank renew the diſcount for forty days more, (which has uſually been done) is not the benefit increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And if after all (when they will truſt him no longer) he apply to uſurers, (which he muſt otherwiſe have done in the firſt inſtance) is the Bank to blame? But the man it ſeems has been unfortunate, and is ruined, which ruin the Bank did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, but could not prevent. Now what is the concluſion drawn from theſe premiſes, and how is it drawn? Why thus. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is the cauſe of loſs. Imprudence is the ſource of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Loſs and diſappointment demand ſupplies of caſh. Uſurers exact enormous intereſt. Bad voyages, wild ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, miſmanagement, and uſurious intereſt, produce ruin. Therefore the Bank muſt be deſtroyed. It muſt be deſtroyed, becauſe it would not continue to truſt men who were no longer truſt worthy. Before this objection be repeated, let theſe men, or at leaſt one of them, be openly named; ſo that the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may have an opportunity fairly to combat the charge: and then, if they do not ſhow that the party received every indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he had any right to claim, expect, or even hope for, let the charge be eſtabliſhed. But until this opportunity be given, <hi>let not the voice of ſlander be heard in the ſanctuaries of legiſlation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rely on it, Gentlemen, that however calumny may caſt the aſperſion, no proof will ever be adduced. It might therefore be abandoned to the merited contempt. But ſince ſuch pains have been taken to inculcate a falſe idea that the Bank promotes uſury, let us recur to facts. Before the eſtabliſhment of the Bank, uſury had been carried to an alarming degree. Men of the greateſt property, who happened to be here from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtates, were forced to pay as high as ten per cent. for one month's anticipation of their remittances; merchants who met with misfortune were driven to the greateſt diſtreſs, and the public could not obtain advances upon any terms. Under theſe circumſtances, the Bank was inſtituted; and there are many in this city and elſewhere whom it ſaved from deſtruction.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018897_0007_0FA82B206ED691F0"/>
The number of uſurers and the rate of uſury, were ſoon dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. But as there ſtill remained ſome objects whoſe diſtreſſes the Bank could not relieve, <hi>becauſe moſt of its funds were employed in the public ſervice,</hi> ſo there ſtill remained ſome uſurers to prey on thoſe diſtreſſes. In proportion as the number who want money is increaſed, or (which comes to the ſame thing) as the means of obtaining money are diminiſhed, in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will uſury abound and flouriſh. This the uſurious know, and therefore they have never intermitted their efforts to deſtroy the Bank, as the ſure means of increaſing and ſecuring their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous gains. Beware then, Gentlemen, that ye be not dupes to the artifice of ſuch wretches. It is indeed but a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and deſpicable artifice. A poor attempt to perſuade you, that an inſtitution which lends for one half per cent. per month, drives folks to borrow at ten per cent. And on this ground they ſuggeſt, that the beſt mode of preventing men from giving ten per cent. for a month's uſe of money, is to diſable them from obtaining it on any other terms.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is ſaid the dividend on bank ſtock induces monied men to buy it rather than lend on intereſt. The object of this aſſertion is to perſuade you, that the difficulty of borrowing money ariſes meerly or chiefly from the Bank; which is not true. For firſt, it is notorious that few ſtock holders are of that claſs who were in the habit of lending on intereſt. Such as are fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners or inhabitants of the neighbouring States (and theſe it is ſaid own half the ſtock) would not lend their money in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, even if circumſtances favoured ſuch loans. A conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the remaining half belongs to ſmall ſtock hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who would not ſend their money into the country. And a far more conſiderable part is the property of merchants, who would be obliged immediately to employ their funds in their own buſineſs, if deprived of thoſe facilities which the Bank affords. After making theſe deductions from the capital of the Bank, the remainder (belonging to thoſe who would and could lend) will be inconſiderable. But ſuch as it is, to whom would it be lent? Not to farmers who pay intereſt irregularly, and from whom the principal cannot always be recovered without legal proceſs. No, it would be lent to merchants, and the greater part to ſuch as (through neceſſity) give more than legal intereſt. Can it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, while uſurers get ten per cent. per month for the uſe of money, and pledges in hand for ſecurity, that the twenty or thirty thouſand dollars (now veſted in bank ſtock) which belong to men not engaged in active buſineſs, would be lent on bonds
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018897_0008_0FA82B211309C398"/>
and mortgages for ſix per cent per annum? It is true that money cannot be borrowed, and it is alſo true that the purchaſe of bank ſtock is more profitable than lending on intereſt. But trace the evils complained of to their true ſources, and it will be found that they flow from that uſury which has been occaſioned by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar circumſtances of the times, and from that oppoſition which has been excited againſt the Bank. Why is money ſcarce and not to be borrowed? Why is it ſo deſirable to own bank ſtock? An anſwer to theſe two queſtions will lead to the ſolution of a third. How is money to be made more plenty, and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with more eaſe?</p>
            <p>Firſt then, why is money ſcarce and not to be borrowed. It is a melancholy truth, that during the late war many were ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by payment of their debts in paper greatly depreciated. Some who received the paper while it was valuable, put it in the loan office. Some purchaſed land. And ſome kept it till it was good for nothing. It is evident, that theſe perſons (who before the war were lenders of money) have no money to lend now; and that every ſhilling ſo paid and diſpoſed of, muſt be deducted from the ſum formerly at intereſt in Pennſylvania. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that ſum, is ſtill in the hands of thoſe who borrowed it ten years ago, and cannot be lent before it be paid. It may perhaps be ſaid, that ſome merchants made money during the war. But it will be found that the gainers were few, the loſers numerous; and that taking the merchants collectively as a body, it is poorer by millions. The reaſon therefore why money is not to be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed is that no one has money to lend, and even admitting that there ſhould be a few who <hi>can</hi> lend, there are none who <hi>will</hi>; for the following reaſons: Thoſe who want are always willing to borrow, but thoſe who owe are not always willing to pay. If therefore the laws of a country, or the adminiſtration of thoſe laws, countenance unreaſonable delays of payment, the owners of money (or any thing elſe) will not diſpoſe of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty on credit, unleſs they be tempted by great intereſt, or great profit. And ſuch as diſdain uſurious dealing, will not be tempted at all. A prudent peaceable man would rather buy ſtock in the Britiſh funds, and receive regularly but five per cent, than take a mortgage at ſix, on the beſt eſtate in Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. Becauſe he may ſuffer for years, a detention of both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and principal, and becauſe he apprehends ſome things which have happened already, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd may therefore happen again —For inſtance, he trembles leſt a long train of paper emiſſions, with a legal tender at the tail of them, ſhould cancel his debt for a tenth of the value. He fears alſo, that a tax on his bond may
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018897_0009_0FA82B21F7586948"/>
reduce the precarious intereſt of ſix per cent to four, and even oblige him to pay the two per cent tax, though he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſix per cent intereſt. Thus we find, on fair inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that money is ſcarce, becauſe (in one way or other) it has been taken or withheld from the owners. And that money is not to be borrowed, from a well grounded apprehenſion that (when due) it will not be repaid.</p>
            <p>Let us then, in the ſecond place, enquire why it is ſo deſirable to own bank ſtock. Three cauſes preſent themſelves. Firſt, that the dividend gives ſomething more than legal intereſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by extenſion of the capital, and contraction of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it yields leſs than formerly. Secondly, that this dividend is payable with rigid punctuality at the end of every half year, ſo that the proprietors can count with certainty on their income, to defray their expences. Thirdly, that in caſe of unforeſeen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the ſtockholder can (for legal intereſt) command a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary accommodation; and if unfortunate events ſhould oblige him to collect all his reſources, he can ſpeedily ſell and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by command the value of the ſtock. To theſe three reaſons, which ſtrike every perſon at firſt ſight, muſt be added a fourth as applying more directly to the charge, that the benefits of bank ſtock incline men to purchaſe it rather than lend. After the peace, when the advantages of the Bank had been felt, and the property of ſtock had become ſecure, an oppoſition was raiſed by ſome of the ſame perſons who are now the oppoſers, but on ground ſomewhat different. For then, inſtead of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a Bank as pernicious, it was declared to be ſo highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial that they muſt needs have two. They did indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the old Bank. But for what? Not becauſe the capital was ſo large as to threaten general ruin, but becauſe the directors would not open a ſubſcription to make it larger. And what was the modeſt requeſt of that day? Why truly ſuch an extenſion of the capital, as might enable thoſe who had waited for events in perfect eaſe and ſafety, to enjoy the ſame advantages with thoſe who had borne the burthen, and ran the riſque of the conteſt. It was indeed a hard caſe, that many worthy gentlemen who would not have given a ſhilling to ſave the ſtate, ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged either to pay five hundred dollars for a ſhare in bank which had coſt but four, or to lend their money on bond and mortgage to the farmers of Pennſylvania. A very hard caſe! And ſo loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did they complain of it, that at laſt many ſenſible members of Aſſembly were prevailed on to believe it would be a good thing to have two Banks. Two ſhops to go to; for that was the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018897_0010_0FA82B2288C26E80"/>
phraſe. And they were the more eaſily led into this opinion, becauſe it was laid down by ſome in high ſtation for whoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents they had acquired an habitual reſpect. But that reſpect may perhaps be diminiſhed, if thoſe who pronounced deciſive judgment two years ago that two Banks were neceſſary, ſhould now as poſitively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>onounce that no Bank at all is neceſſary; and (wonderful to relate) go cackling round the country, that one Bank is pregnant with ruin to the State. The language of truth is uniform, and theſe ſudden changes of haſty opinion, ſhew ſo great a want of temper and knowledge, that thoſe who really mean the public good will quit ſuch blind guides, and think for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The conſequence of the noiſe made at that time muſt be well remembered. The Aſſembly were plagued with long ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on both ſides, which might as well have been ſpared, and then all at once the thing was huſhed up and accommodated. Becauſe ſuch of the promoters of the new Bank as had money, found out that moſt of their new friends had none. Becauſe they all found out, that the ſcheme did not promiſe ſo much either of profit or ſecurity as was imagined. And becauſe they had not too much confidence in each other, being (like Nebuchadnezzar's image) compoſed of diſcordant materials. They agreed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to abandon their project, on certain conditions acceded to by the old Bank, one of which was to extend the ſubſcription; and this it is which has converted all the ſurplus money of the State into bank ſtock. For otherwiſe, let the price of a ſhare have riſen ever ſo high, nay had it gone to four thouſand inſtead of four hundred dollars; not one penny would have been added to the bank capital. But in proportion as ſtock roſe, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend would have been leſs valuable, till at length it would have been more profitable to lend at ſix per cent, than to purchaſe bank ſtock. For inſtance, if the dividend on a ſhare of four hundred dollars had continued to be forty dollars, and the price of ſuch a ſhare had riſen to be eight hundred dollars, then the purchaſer would have got only five per cent for his money, inſtead of ſix.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, then, let us inquire how money may be rendered more plenty and eaſier to be obtained. And firſt, the ſureſt way to render money plenty is to bear the evils of ſcarcity. To make it plenty (according to the desire of ſome) would be, as in the continental times, to make it no money at all. For when it can be obtained without labor, and found without ſearch, it is of no uſe to the poſſeſſor. Thoſe nice politicians, therefore, who try to make money ſo plenty that people may get it for nothing, will find that their money is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018897_0011_0FA82B24F25B1530"/>
The ſcarcity conſtitutes the value. And when that ſcarcity is ſuch that men will do a great deal for a little, it will become plenty; for thoſe will always have moſt money, who will give moſt for it. The complaint that money is ſcarce, is generally made by the idle or the unfortunate; by thoſe who will not, or thoſe who cannot give any thing in exchange for money, except bare promiſes which they cannot or will not perform. Now ſuch men would ſuffer more from the want of caſh in Amſterdam or London, where it is moſt plenty, than in any part of the ſtate of Pennſylvania. If folks are idle they muſt be relieved by labor, and if poor by charity. Till this be done, the complaint that money is ſcarce will continue, and though very loud will not be very juſt. There was (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) a grievous complaint of the want of money at the cloſe of the war; and yet every man who had a buſhel of wheat could get eight or nine ſhillings for it. People in general plunged into extravagance, and laid out their coin for foreign fripperies, and the merchants (unable to remit for payment of theſe things in produce, except on ruinous terms) ſent away the coin; ſo that in two years there has been more money exported from this country (in which a ſcarcity was then complained of) than is neceſſary for a circulating medium. The ſeveral ſtates are now iſſuing paper, that what little ſpecie is left may alſo be exported, inſtead of the wheat, corn, rice, tobacco, &amp;c. Flour has long been cheaper in London than in Philadelphia. We buy fine coats, and handſome buckles, and a thouſand other hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fine things in London, and then when called on to pay, though our barns be full of wheat, we will not ſell it as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for five ſhillings the buſhel, but ſit down and cry becauſe money is ſcarce. The waggon is in the mud, and we beg Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules to pull it out without putting our own ſhoulders to the wheel. The legiſlature muſt relieve us, for we will not relieve ourſelves. And againſt what do we want to be relieved? Why againſt our idleneſs, extravagance and folly.</p>
            <p>But, ſecondly, another means of making money plenty is to render it leſs neceſſary. For this purpoſe enforce the punctual payment of debts, ſo that thoſe who truſt can be ſure of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, in ſeaſon, from thoſe whom they have truſted. This will produce two happy conſequences. Firſt, that men will no longer run in debt for idle gewgaws, which they muſt pay for with their ſubſtance when pay day comes. Executions for debt will then be as wholeſome warnings to the extravagant, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions for crimes are to the profligate. Secondly, a man who
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018897_0012_0FA82B2664DC8600"/>
wants to buy land or needful goods on credit, will then obtain the credit deſired. The punctuality of his payments will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his credit. Thoſe payments will alſo enable the merchant to comply with his engagements, which will (in like manner) extend his credit at home and abroad. In proportion to the punctuality of remittances, the merchant will get longer credit, and on better terms; and thus money will be plentier becauſe the trading people (who have always a preference in ſuch things) will be relieved from the neceſſity of borrowing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, another means of making money plenty, is to enforce a collection of taxes, make ſolid proviſion for paying the intereſt of our debts in coin, and introduce order and oeconomy into the adminiſtration of affairs. This will reſtore the public confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and then the value of certificates will riſe, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors be able to diſpoſe of them for caſh. Thouſands will thereby be relieved who are now in great want of money, and under the dire neceſſity of getting it from uſurers, or going to gaol.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, theſe plain and ſimple meaſures will make money not only plenty but eaſy to be obtained. Becauſe induſtry and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality (which want but little) will thereby be introduced; and we can always command money when we are not in want of it. As to thoſe blades who muſt forever want, becauſe they ſpend their time in ſtreets and taverns, and occupy themſelves with ſtate affairs, inſtead of their own affairs, and who dreſs and feaſt and will not work, but wiſh to borrow; let them meet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buff given by an old philoſopher to one of their predeceſſors.
<q>Friend borrow of thy back and belly, they will never aſk thee for the money, but I ſhould be very troubleſome.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth objection made againſt the Bank is that rich fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners will be induced to become ſtockholders, ſo as that all the property will finally veſt in them. This objection has ſome weight, and if it be allowed to operate as a bar to meaſures of public utility, will ſave a deal of time and trouble to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it may not conduce to the proſperity of the ſtate, and muſt prove injurious to thoſe by whom it is made. People in general ſeem now to expect ſome permanent proviſion for the intereſt of the public debts, and if that ſhould happen, foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will purchaſe a conſiderable ſhare. The Dutch are ſaid to hold about thirty millions ſterling in the Britiſh funds, bearing an intereſt of four per cent. and they lent five million guilders to Congreſs at five per cent. when no funds were provided, and during the war. Hence we may with certainty infer, that they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018897_0013_0FA82B279AF62920"/>
will buy up the certificates bearing ſix per cent. when placed on a ſolid footing. Is that a ſufficient objection againſt providing for the public creditors? And if not in one caſe, why in the other? The practice ſome men have of affirming to-day, and denying to-morrow, is neither decent nor becoming. A griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous complaint is made of the want of money, and yet as grievous a complaint of the only means to obtain any. We have it not at home, and we muſt not receive it from abroad. Do theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſuppoſe it will rain money now, as it did manna of old? And becauſe they have the ſame perverſeneſs with the children of Iſrael, do they expect the ſame miracle? To experience a want of public credit is (they ſay) <hi>terrible,</hi> but to deſtroy the only means of ſupporting public credit, is (they ſay) <hi>deſirable.</hi> Let us appeal to facts. No country on earth enjoys extenſive cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit which has not a public Bank. We have ourſelves experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced its good effects, when we were in the greateſt diſtreſs. And ſhall we now be told that the Bank muſt be deſtroyed, and yet public credit be ſupported? People who ſpeak in this way ſhew great ignorance, or ſomething worſe. They aſk how a Bank contributes to public credit; and (if no reply be made) think they have gained a victory, when they have puzzled an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. For the ſake of thoſe who love truth, and not with any hope of making ſuch men ſenſible either to ſhame or conviction, their queſtion ſhall be anſwered. The Bank may be likened to that which bears the ſame name, a bank or dam for collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the waters. After a head is raiſed, ſome part turns the wheels of the mill, and ſome part waters the adjacent grounds. Take the bank away, and the water will ſtill flow, but not with the ſame beneficial effect. If revenues were appropriated to the intereſt of the public debt, and other important objects of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſhould any delay take place in collections, a ſimilar delay of payment would alſo happen. The want of punctuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would leſſen the value of ſtock. And, on the other hand, if collections were more rapid than the payments, much money might be taken out of circulation, and lodged in the public cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. The conſequence would be, either that commerce muſt ſuffer (as at preſent) for the want of it, or that the ſtate muſt procure more money than is neceſſary; which might not be very eaſy, if we may judge from paſt experience. But with the aid of a Bank, the ſame ſtream turns the wheel, and fertilizes the ground; being prudently applied to either purpoſe as occaſion requires. And ſo the ſame ſum of money, will not only ſupply the buſineſs of the merchant and of the ſtate, but the funds proceeding
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018897_0014_0FA82B27CDD32F40"/>
from trade, and thoſe ariſing from taxes, will (when thrown into the ſame maſs) mutually aid the operations of each, and jointly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the objects of both. Nor is there the leaſt danger that foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will hold even a great proportion of the bank ſtock. Bank ſtock will always be moſt uſeful for the mercantile man who lives on the ſpot. Becauſe he (and he alone) can at once receive the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend, and when occaſion requires have (by loan for a ſhort time) the uſe of his money: So that he will naturally outbid the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner. And as the object of the foreigner muſt be to ſecure a certain annual income from his funds, make but the intereſt of the public debt as regular and ſafe as the bank dividend, (which by means of the Bank is eaſily done) and the foreigner will as naturally wiſh to change bank ſtock, for an amount of funded loan office certificates yielding more annual intereſt, as the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant will to change ſuch an amount of certificates for bank ſtock. And ſo far from any danger to the State, by the intereſt of foreigners in their funds, there is a great ſecurity. Every fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign creditor is an advocate for us with his own government, in times of public calamity, and is induced to lend more, as the means of ſecuring what has been already lent; eſpecially if he has been regularly paid the intereſt of his capital.</p>
            <p>The next objection againſt the Bank is, that the payment of the dividend to foreigners will be a drain of ſpecie from the country. This has already been anſwered in part, but farther; a man who has bought a piece of ground, wants to borrow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the purpoſe of clearing, fencing, draining and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating it. He would not reliſh the advice of a neighbour who might tell him not to borrow, leſt the payment of intereſt ſhould drain him of caſh. He might indeed be glad to get the money at a low intereſt, or for no intereſt, but he would certainly get it if he could; and by induſtrious attention, and a prudent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, he would pay both principal and intereſt from the profits of his farm. And thus by degrees a wilderneſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into beautiful cultivation. From the diſcovery of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to the preſent hour, we have been paying intereſt for what we owe on the other ſide of the Atlantic. Our debt and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity have gone hand in hand. And yet when people now complain of the difficulty of borrowing money, they muſt be told it is for their advantage not to obtain the principal, becauſe they will not (in that caſe) be obliged to pay the intereſt. If a farmer in Pennſylvania has to pay annually five pounds for the uſe of a hundred pounds borrowed, is it of any conſequence to him whether the lender lives in Philadelphia, New-York,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018897_0015_0FA82B28A7FFA3A8"/>
Boſton, London, or Amſterdam? Twenty buſhels of wheat do the buſineſs. And when he has parted with them, whether they are eaten in Philadelphia, or ſent to Liſbon, is none of his affair. On the large ſcale, indeed, it might be convenient that wealthy men ſhould croſs the Atlantic to become citizens of Pennſylvania; and ſo they will, if equal juſt laws, and a mild firm adminiſtration give that ſecurity to property without which it is a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing. But if bad laws be made, or the good laws be badly executed, and if ſolid eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments can be overturned by every capricious breath, the wiſe and the good will avoid us as they would the peſtilence. Then indeed there will be a conſtant drain of wealth, for <hi>none will leave property in a country where it is inſecure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther, though we admit that borrowing does every year carry a ſum out of the country for payment of intereſt, it will not follow that the country is impoveriſhed by the amount of that ſum. When a farmer wants neceſſaries, and has not caſh, he muſt either take them on truſt, or borrow money on intereſt. Every body knows that the difference between buying with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy money, and buying on credit, is much greater than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt on the price of the goods, and therefore it is cheaper for the farmer to borrow, than to run in debt at the ſtore. Juſt ſo it is with the country. Moſt of the articles we want (when pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at the firſt hand) muſt be immediately paid for; and when merchants abroad lay out their caſh to buy goods, and after ſell them to us on credit, we pay (in the price of ſuch goods) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an intereſt on the purchaſe money, but for the trouble foreign merchants take, and the riſque they run. To all this is added a handſome commiſſion, and then a round profit into the bargain. Thus, for inſtance, ſince it has been the practice to buy tea with caſh at the firſt hand, we get that article for nearly one half of what it uſed to coſt. Let any man therefore calculate the difference between paying fifty pound per annum inſtead of a hundred, in price, and ſix per cent (or even ten per cent) per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num for intereſt on the fifty, and he will be convinced that we are recompenced five fold for the dividend paid abroad. On the whole, the matter ſtands thus. The merchant whoſe buſineſs it is, and who muſt for that reaſon be the beſt judge, tells you that the advance of money by foreigners for bank ſtock, and the facility which the Bank can thereby give to commercial opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, enable him to carry on buſineſs more advantageouſly though he ſells imported commodities lower, and buys produce higher, than before the war. The farmer (who perhaps neither
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018897_0016_0FA82B295A5F28E0"/>
comprehends nor cares for the reaſons on which this aſſertion may be founded) prudently brings it to the teſt of experience. The tree (ſays he) is known by its fruits. Let me examine the facts. He does ſo, and finds that moſt of the articles imported can be purchaſed for much leſs than formerly and that he can get half as much again for his wheat. So that duties properly laid on ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, the conſumption of which is chiefly unneceſſary, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pernicious, would pay the intereſt of the public debts and not coſt the conſumer more than before the war. Thus, without impoſing new burthens, full relief may be given to the public creditors, and they be thereby enabled more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and more eaſily to ſuſtain their ſhare of ſuch burthens as circumſtances may hereafter require. All which advantages we muſt (it ſeems) forego, and preclude ourſelves from the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of eſtabliſhing public credit, leſt foreigners ſhould derive an intereſt on lending us money. Overturn the Bank ſay they and perhaps you may get a little of their money. Kill the gooſe that lays golden eggs, and you may wear her feathers.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, it has been ſaid that the Bank facilitates the export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpecie. Of all the charges in the world, this is the laſt which one would have expected. The operations of the Bank depend (as every body knows) on the quantity of ſpecie in their vaults. When that is gone, the Bank is done, juſt as the mill ſtands ſtill when the pond is dry. And therefore to ſuppoſe the directors would facilitate the exportation of coin, is the moſt abſurd of all ſuppoſitions. Truth is, the directors of the Bank are extremely ſolicitous to prevent the exportation of coin, and happily for the ſtate, have the means in their power. The Bank capital is about a million of dollars, part of which is in their vaults, and the remainder lent for ſhort periods. The amount of their loans is ſuppoſed to be twice as much as their capital. A part of the ſum lent is in bank notes, the remainder in coin. Now therefore when the directors find that caſh is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported (which they do at once, by perceiving that any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum goes out of the Bank in a week more than is received) they are not meerly led by inclination, but driven by neceſſity, to leſſen or to ſtop their diſcounts, according to the nature of the caſe and the degree of the evil. This ſtoppage has the effect; for not only the money is prevented from going abroad, but if the ſtoppage continue, it is brought in from every quarter. The operation is ſo powerful, that on one occaſion many thouſand dollars were brought to the Bank, and there taken out of thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018897_0017_0FA82B2A215CE4C0"/>
packages in which they were (next morning) to have been ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to London.</p>
            <p>In this place it may be proper to notice the ſtrange opinion, that in the preſent ſtate of trade a bank is injurious. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeems to have been founded on the idea, that becauſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is collected in the Bank it may eaſily be taken out of the Bank. And ſo indeed it might by an armed force, but thoſe who have tried the experiment in any other way have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. The money is collected in bank 'tis true, but how is a man to get it out? Either he muſt ſell property for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and then it is of no conſequence whether the payment comes out of the Bank, or out of the Treaſury, or where it comes from. The owner may diſpoſe of it as he thinks meet; and we might as well ſay that David Rittenhouſe, Eſq. facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the exportation of money, when he pays for arms or cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a merchant who ſends it to Europe, as lay that blame on the Bank. The other mode of getting at money in bank, is by borrowing for the ſhort period of forty days, and if the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower ſhips it off, he will be obliged (when the forty days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) to hunt for it, and will ſometimes pay dearly for his trick. Perhaps it will be found on examination that ſome of thoſe who complain of being driven to deal with uſurers, had been dabbling in this way, and proved too cunning for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as cunning men generally do. So far is the Bank from being injurious to the preſent ſtate of trade, that the converſe of the propoſition is true, viz. that the preſent ſtate of trade is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the Bank. And it would have been ruinous to the commonwealth, but for the ſeaſonable checks given by the Bank, which checks are among the cauſes of the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. They ſay the Bank facilitates the exportation of coin, and that therefore they complain; but in truth the Bank pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them from exporting the coin, and therefore they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. While a man ſpends more than he earns, his coin muſt go to pay the difference, and he will have leſs of it when the year ends than when it began. Juſt ſo it is with a country. We import great quantities of goods, we either cannot or will not give produce on moderate terms to pay for them, and yet we grumble that our caſh runs low. We will not acknowledge our own imprudence, but accuſe the Bank, which has alone reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the general torrent; by which means Pennſylvania is better off than any of the neighbouring ſtates.</p>
            <p>A ſeventh objection againſt the Bank is that it injures the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of bills of credit. This is a popular argument and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is made. But as to the truth of the aſſertion, the authors
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018897_0018_0FA82B2ACCE47210"/>
do not trouble their heads about it. Their maxim is, Let us lay it on and let them take it off as they can. Some will ſtick. Suppoſe this kind of morality were extended a little, and when theſe charitable kind hearted people walk the ſtreets one of their proſelytes ſhould bedaub them with the contents of the kennel, hugging himſelf in the idea <hi>that ſome will ſtick,</hi> would they not find the practice of their own principles rather unpleaſant? Pray how has the Bank injured the circulation of paper money? Why the paper is not received in bank as ſpecie. And did ever any man ſuppoſe it would, or could, be ſo received? If it had, would not the directors have been guilty of an infamous breach of truſt? Could they have excuſed themſelves to thoſe of whoſe ſpecie they had the cuſtody? The Bank might indeed have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en currency to the bills, as long as their coin laſted, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing one for t'other; and no one can doubt that in this caſe the coin would, as faſt as exchanged, have been packed up and ſent to our good friends and favorites in London. Under ſuch circumſtances, thoſe candid Gentlemen who prayed and voted for paper currency, and afterwards refuſed to receive it, would perhaps have played their patriotic game quite through. And we may reaſonably ſuppoſe too, that when the coffers of the Bank were filled with their emiſſions, they would have found as good reaſons to aboliſh the paper, as they now do to aboliſh the Bank. If a refuſal to give money for bills of credit be an injury, what ſhall be ſaid for thoſe who (though patrons of the plan) would neither give money nor any thing elſe for the bills. It would be difficult to make an apology, if the generality of the refuſal were not a ſufficient reaſon for each individual. Let us then be candid, and far from reprehending the practice, calmly ſeek the cauſe. Paper can only circulate on a par with ſpecie, from a general belief that it is equal to ſpecie. The faith makes the thing. If there be not ſuch a general belief, it cannot be equal to coin, becauſe it will not ſo generally anſwer the pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>e. The holder may think (as in the continental times) that his three pound bill is worth eight dollars, and be very angry that his neighbour is not of the ſame opinion. But unleſs he can perſuade the perſon whoſe goods he wants, that the paper is really equal to the ſilver, his own conviction will be of ſmall avail. Admitting then, for argument ſake, that every merchant in Philadelphia did really and truly believe the new bills to be worth what they ſpecify; ſtill they could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with them, unleſs the farmers (whoſe produce they want to purchaſe) had the ſame belief, and would ſell that produce for paper as freely as for gold. Becauſe the merchants being
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018897_0019_0FA82B2B8B97D5A0"/>
either in debt, or wanting to purchaſe goods, in foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, can make no other uſe of the paper than to buy ſuch things as may be ſent abroad. And further, they muſt be able to buy not only ſuch things, but at ſuch prices, as may anſwer in foreign markets. If, therefore, the country Gentlemen will agree to ſell wheat for five ſhillings the buſhel in paper money, merchants will be as ſolicitous to receive, as they are now to avoid paper. But while produce continues at the preſent prices, wiſe merchants will not ſell but for ſpecie, which they can export ſafely, becauſe they muſt loſe by ſending away produce; a practice which ſome have purſued to their ruin. Having thus hinted at the true means to give paper a briſk and lively circulation, candor requires that a few words be ſaid in favor of the landed intereſt, on whom the blame might otherwiſe be thrown. Suppoſing, therefore, the charge to be made againſt an honeſt farmer, he would perhaps make the following reply— How can it be expected that I ſhould repoſe confidence in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who for eight years paſt have been the victim of that confidence? A piece of my land was ſold for continental bills; theſe are all ſunk in the gulph of depreciation. Part of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was ſeized by officers of Congreſs, and part was ſold to officers of the ſtate. For all this I have nothing but uſeleſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates. When every body had grown ſick of the old money, Congreſs iſſued new, and though experience was againſt the meaſure, yet (relying on their wiſdom) I took the new bills chearfully; but found, to my ſorrow, that the new travelled in the ſame road with the old, and the only difference was that they travelled faſter. The bills iſſued (about that time) by the ſtate, had what they call funds for redemption, but they ſoon fell to ſix for one. I have obſerved too, that when theſe bills become of little value, the government joins in and agrees to the depreciation; ſo that every one who receives them is ſure to ſuffer in the end. Now, therefore, until I have eight years experience that government may ſafely be truſted, I cannot forego the benefit of that experience which I have bought ſo dear. By truſting government, one half my ſubſtance is gone; the other half muſt be kept to provide for my family.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons, or reaſons like theſe, are not confined to any one body of men, either merchants, huſbandmen or manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers. They pervade all ranks and degrees. The citizens of Pennſylvania will not give free circulation to the ſtate paper, becauſe they have not confidence in the government. We know that confidence cannot otherwiſe be eſtabliſhed, than by the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy purſuit of juſt meaſures, for a number of years. It is ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018897_0020_0FA82B2C49EC7F30"/>
and every man muſt feel as well as ſee it. Every man therefore can judge of the excellent ſenſe of thoſe who cry, down with the Bank if you could give circulation to the bills. <hi>Break a promiſe made three years ago, by way of inducing men to rely on the promiſe you make now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But eighthly, it is ſaid that the wealth and influence of the Bank may become dangerous to the government. It is a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal monſter whoſe property may be ten millions of dollars, whoſe duration is perpetual. Theſe circumſtances are ſo terrible, that ſome are for putting the poor monſter to inſtant death, while others (in their great goodneſs) would only give him a hectic which ſhould work his diſſolution in a dozen years. Of each in turn, but firſt of thoſe who would limit the duration of the Bank to a few years, and limit the capital to what ſuits their own ideas of propriety. Theſe are really the worſt of the two, for their half way conduct, would be every way wrong. Such a law would be as unjuſt, and have every eſſential circumſtance of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, with the immediate diſſolution of the charter. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may deceive themſelves into an opinion of their own lenity, not a man among them would either as juryman or judge, admit it to be a good defence againſt a charge of murder that the act had been performed by a ſlow poiſon. Public credit muſt ſuffer alike in both caſes, for in both the rights of private property will be alike violated. What then are the advantages held out? Why it ſeems, that if the charter be limited to a ſhort period, the legiſlature can (at the expiration) renew it on ſuch terms and conditions as may to them ſeem meet. And theſe terms or conditions muſt of courſe be ſome benefit to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which could not otherwiſe have been obtained. And to prove theſe things, the Bank of England is quoted. But the choice of an example is rather unlucky, for that limitation of their charter which one cunning miniſter introduced, other cunning miniſters have at different times taken advantage of, till at laſt all the ſubſtance of the Bank has been ſqueezed out. And for what purpoſe? Was it to open navigations? To clear new roads? To extend a lucrative commerce? No it was to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the power of the miniſter for the time being, and feed the expence of thoſe ruinous wars, which the people would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have borne. Standing then on the ground of their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let us look forward to the probable conſequence of ſuch a limitation in Pennſylvania. Suppoſe the period arrived when the charter is to expire. Is it certain the ſtate would then want aid from the Bank? If not, the object of the limitation is gone. But even ſuppoſing the ſtate ſhould ſtand in need, what tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018897_0021_0FA82B2D0ED38C28"/>
could they offer to obtain relief? Not a prolongation of the charter, becauſe the ſuppoſition implies a breach of the contract made when the Bank was firſt inſtituted, and therefore no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance could be placed on any ſubſequent contract. For if the Bank ſhould lend to the government, then the cancelling of that debt would be an additional motive for diſſolving the Bank. Nor is this ſuſpicion injurious, for one act of moral turpitude is always the prelude of another. But admitting that the Bank would purchaſe a few years exiſtence; from whom would the purchaſe be made, and for what price? The directors of that day, would naturally caſt their eyes on the leading members in Aſſembly, and open the negociation with them. Men of great wealth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence (ſhould any ſuch ariſe) would make uſe of the Bank to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and increaſe their authority. They would watch this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to obtain ſeats in Aſſembly. And if a majority could be prevailed on to vote with ſuch leaders, the purchaſe would be made of them, and <hi>the price would be ſome private gain, and no the public good.</hi> In like manner, if the capital be limited, it is not the ſtate but great men in the ſtate would receive the benefit of an enlargement. And why ſhould the capital be limited within narrower bounds than at preſent? It is notorious that if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors had not been under compulſion they would not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſubſcription beyond the firſt four hundred thouſand dollars. It is notorious alſo, that every addition to the number of ſhares leſſens the value of each. And therefore we have the beſt ſecurity in the world, (the intereſt of the proprietors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) againſt an increaſe of the capital. In like manner there is every reaſon to believe that the Bank will continue to afford that aid to government, which has never yet been withheld when it could with propriety be granted. And if they ſhould extend their capital (a thing ſo contrary to their intereſt) it can only be on ſome trying occaſion, to ſupport the government of which they are citizens, and preſerve the ſhip in which all are embarked. The charter being held ſacred (as chartered rights ought ever to be) applications for aid by the ſtate, will be plain and manly tranſactions, not dirty jobs. The Bank will candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate their means, the extent to which they are willing to go, and the ſecurity they are willing to accept. They will perhaps (on ſuch an occaſion) point out the ill treatment they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived when funds appropriated by the Aſſembly to payment of a former loan, were diverted to another object: and in their quality of citizens as well as that of directors, they will perhaps go a little farther, and ſtate with becoming firmneſs the dangers which muſt enſue <hi>if any individual ſhall dare to alter appropriations
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018897_0022_0FA82B2DCAF4BBB8"/>
of public money made by legiſlative authority.</hi> But ſurely this can do no harm. Calm reflection will therefore convince a candid man, that the wealth and influence of the Bank can only become dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the ſtate, by laying it at the mercy of great men in the ſtate. For it is utterly inconceivable that four or five hundred ſtockholders, (of all ranks, parties and denominations) ſhould join in chuſing directors who would attempt to overturn the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. On the contrary it is a truth vouched by uniform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (from the earlieſt ages) that the monied intereſt of a country will ever oppoſe, check, and counteract, all changes and convulſions of government; becauſe that intereſt is ſure to be the victim of confuſion and diſorder. This laſt conſideration applies forcibly alſo to the arguments of thoſe who would now diſſolve the charter. Let them further conſider, that the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of banking is not (of neceſſity) to be carried on by public Banks alone. One or more individuals may form a banking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whoſe operations will be extenſive and lucrative, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the degree and extent of their credit and connections. Over ſuch a Bank (or ſuch Banks) there can be no controul. The citizens of Philadelphia will have no vote in chuſing direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, nor will any perſon be particularly intereſted in obſerving their conduct. Diſſolve the national Bank in March, and by the firſt day of May a private Bank will riſe on its ruins. The merchants of Philadelphia will pour in their coin, with as much confidence as they now do into the national Bank; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has ſo clearly ſhewn the advantages of ſuch an inſtitution, that they will not, cannot, be without it. If therefore the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Bank will look round, and ſee who are the men that will probably ſet up ſuch a private Bank, it may do more towards bringing them to a right judgment, than the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive arguments.</p>
            <p>The ninth objection is, that the directors can obtain unfair advantages in trade for themſelves and their friends. And it muſt be owned, that there is ſome force in this objection. But it cannot be alledged that the ſuppoſed advantages are unfair. Some advantages are neceſſarily attendant on the place of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, and ſome inconveniencies are as neceſſarily the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible that things ſhould be otherwiſe, and the only check is in the annual election, by which the ſtockholders have an opportunity of teſtifying their ſenſe of each director's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. This will always prevent any great miſchief. For the Bank being an inſtitution in which the money of many acts for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018897_0023_0FA82B2EB5509710"/>
the benefit of all, by being jointly applied to each in his turn; every ſtockholder is a centinel, bound by his private intereſt to diſcover unfair practices, and ſound the alarm, when undue advantages are obtained. Becauſe the preference of one, muſt operate the excluſion of another. After all, however, we muſt acknowledge, that this evil will in ſome degree prevail; for we know that nothing on earth is perfect. But muſt we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a great advantage to all, becauſe a greater advantage will reſult to a few? We might as well object to the exiſtence of government, becauſe it muſt be adminiſtered by fallible men, and confer on them ſuperior eminence and authority; or to the uſe of money, becauſe it is ſometimes applied to vile purpoſes, as object to a money government or bank, becauſe the labors of a director are compenſated (or more than compenſated) by commercial advantages.</p>
            <p>Laſtly then, let us conſider whether the Bank be deſtructive of that equality which ought to take place in a free country. And the firſt queſtion is, whether by equality is meant equality of property, or equality of rights. If it be the former, then it may perhaps be doubted whether the oppoſers of the Bank would themſelves agree to an equality (that is to ſay, a general diviſion) of property among all the citizens of Pennſylvania. This might ſuit eight or ten thouſand gentlemen who came over laſt year, from Ireland and Germany to give us the honor of their good company. But will the ſubſtantial freeholder, or wealthy mechanick, be willing to pay for that good company ſuch an exorbitant price? We have in general (it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) been ready enough to give a preference to ſtrangers, over our own brethren and countrymen, but there is reaſon in every thing. If an equality of rights be meant, then the objection va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, for any man may purchaſe the right of a ſtockholder in the Bank, for leſs money than he can purchaſe a farm, even in the back counties: So that he may be a ſtockholder, on eaſier terms than he can be a freeholder. And if it ſuits one man to be a ſtockholder and the other to be a freeholder, neither ought to grumble at the rights or poſſeſſions of the other. But, if (which is moſt likely) the objectors mean here under a plauſible cry raiſed about equal rights, to cover the dictates of envy at ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior fortune and ſucceſs in the world, then they had beſt conſider again, whether by overturning the public Bank they would not aſſiſt in ſetting up a private Bank. And whether ſuch private
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018897_0024_0FA82B2FF2883010"/>
Bank, would not bring very great acceſſions of wealth to thoſe whom they particularly diſlike.</p>
            <p>You, gentlemen of the aſſembly, who are the guardians of Pennſylvania, and bound by every principle which can actuate honeſt men, to promote her welfare and proſperity, it is with you to conſider this great object in all its lights. The objections raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will doubtleſs be varied. The anſwers given will certainly be diſputed. Perhaps the arguments in ſupport of the Bank, are not ſo ſtrong as the advocates believe. One thing however is certain, that conſequences of the laſt importance to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, muſt follow from your deciſion. If therefore the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent be doubtful, nay if the deſtruction of this charter ſhould not be abſolutely neceſſary, pauſe a moment and conſider moſt deeply what you are about to do. How can we hope for public peace and national proſperity if the faith of government ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly pledged, can be ſo ſuddenly violated? If private proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be ſo lightly infringed? Deſtroy this prop, which once gave us ſupport, and where will you turn in the hour of diſtreſs? To whom will ye look for ſuccour? By what promiſes or vows can you hope to obtain confidence? This hour of diſtreſs will come. It comes to all, and the moment of affliction is known to him alone, whoſe divine providence exalts or depreſſes ſtates and kingdoms. Not by the blind dictates of arbitrary will. Not by a tyrannous and deſpotic mandate. But in proportion to their obedience or diſobedience of his juſt and holy laws. It is he who commands us that we abſtain from wrong. It is he who tells us, "<hi>do unto others as ye would that they ſhould do unto you.</hi>"</p>
