            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ACT for Restraining and Punishing Privateers and Pyrates.</head>
            <p>WHereas nothing can more contribute to his Majesties Honour than such Articles as are concluded and agreed on in all Treaties of Peace, should by all their Majesties Subjects according to their Duty, be most inviolably preserved and kept, in and over all their Majesties Dominions and Territories. Whereas against such Treaties of Peace made between their Majesties and their Allies, several of their Majesties Subjects do continually sail under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions of Forreign Princes and States, contrary to their Duty and good Allegiance, and by fair means cannot be restrained from so doing. Be it therefore Enacted by the Governor, Council and Assembly, and it is hereby Enacted by the Authority of the same, That from and after Publication hereof, it shall be Fellony for any Person which now doth or hereafter shall inhabit in or belong to this Province, to serve in <hi>America</hi> in an Hostile manner under any Forreign Prince, State or Potentate in Amity with their Majesties, without special Lisence for so doing, under the Hand and Seal of their Majesties Governor or Commander in Chief of this <hi>P</hi>rovince for the time being, and that all and every such Offender and Offenders, contrary to the true intent of this Act, being thereof duely convinced in their Majesties Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature within this Province (to which Courts Authority is hereby given, to hear and determine the same, as other cases of Fellony) shall suffer,

            <p>And for the better and more speedy Execution of Justice upon such who having committed Pyracies, Fellonies, and other Offences upon the Sea, shall be apprehended in or brought prisoners to this Province, Be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Fellonyes, Pyracies, Roberies, Murders, or Confederacies committed, that here-after shall be committed upon the Sea, or in any Haven, Creek or Bay, within the Jurisdiction of the Admirality, shall be enquired, tryed, heard, determined and judged in such Form as if such Offence had been committed in and upon the Land, and to that end and purpose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions shall be had under their Majesties Seal of this Province, directed to the Judge or Judges of the Admirality of this <hi>P</hi>rovince for the time being, and to such other substantial persons, as by their Majesties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour or Commander in chief of this Province, for the time being, shall be named or appointed; which said Commissioners, or such a Quorum of them, as by such Commission shall be thereunto authorized, shall have full Power to do all things in and about the enquiry, hearing, determining, adjudging and punishing of any of the Crimes and Offences aforesaid, as any Commissioners appointed by Commission under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> by Virtue of a Statute made in the Twenty Eight Year of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to do and execute within the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> And that the said Offenders which are or shall be apprehended in or brought Prisoners to this Province, shall be lyable to such Order, Process, Judgment and Execution, by Virtue of such Commission to be grounded upon this Act, as might be awarded or given against them, if they were proceeded against within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> by Virtue of any Commission grounded upon the said Statute.</p>
