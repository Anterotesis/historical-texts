            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE advantages of a publication of this kind to the practitioner in medicine, are 'tis preſumed, too obvious to need enumeration; I ſhall, therefore, only premiſe a few neceſſary obſervations relative to the work itſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The doſes of medicines &amp;c. are ſet down as for adults; and therefore, the preſcriber will eaſily vary them for other ages. For example, children of two years old may, in general, take about a third part of the doſes for adults; or a little more; and ſo in proportion for other ages, the conſtitution being alſo conſidered.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Where it could conveniently be done, I have mentioned the intervals at which the medicines are to be repeated: but theſe may be varied at the preſcriber's diſcretion. For brevity's ſake I have in many places, uſed the word frequently; by which I would have it underſtood, that every three, four, ſix, eight, &amp;c. hours are meant, according to the exigency of the caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:018456_0005_0FA76D0DF33223E0"/>III. When any particular indication is to be anſwered, the claſſes, as cathartics, diuretics, aſtringents &amp;c. may be referred to; under which heads, as many of the compoſitions and ſimples as were judged neceſſary, are arranged.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The limits aſſigned to the work would not admit of formulae; nor do I think them by any means neceſſary. The doſes of all the articles uſually adminiſtered are ſet down; and I will not ſuppoſe, that there is any medical practitioner, who cannot give directions for making them into draughts, boluſes, or other forms that may be required. The vehicles ſhould be either perfectly innocent, as pure water, ſimple ſyrup &amp;c. or of ſimilar virtues with the medicines to be given. And if two articles of the ſame virtues, cathartics for example, are employed, it ſcarce need be mentioned, that the doſe of each muſt be proportionably leſs. It may be added, that ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of a volatile nature ſhould be given in a liquid form, leſt their virtues exhale; very nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous ones ſhould, if convenient, be given in the form of pills or boluſes.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:018456_0006_0FA76D0E8932DBC0"/>V. In the alphabet I have, for the moſt part, made uſe of Engliſh names; or at leaſt have referred from thoſe where technical terms are employed.</p>
            <p>This work was drawn up originally for my own uſe, and in the courſe of practice, I have found it very convenient to refer to occaſionally. It was the opinion of thoſe medical Gentlemen who ſaw the Manuſcript that it would be equally uſeful to others, and this was my motive for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it public.</p>
            <p>If this work aſſiſt the practitioner's memory in matters already known, at leaſt till he has leiſure to conſult larger works, where neceſſary, my deſign is anſwered.</p>

               <p>SYMPTOMS. A collection of water or ſerum in ſome part of the body. Before the diſorder is perfectly formed it is called Cachexy; when the lymph is accumulated in the cellular membrane it is called Anaſarca, or Leacophlegmatia; when there is a collection of water in the abdomen, it is termed Aſcites; if in the brain, Hydrocephalus; if in the breaſt, Hydrops pectoris; if in the womb, Hydrop. Uteri; and if in the ſcrotum, Hydrocele.</p>
               <p>In common dropſies the legs uſually ſwell, and a dent or pit remains for ſome time after preſſing the fleſh with the finger: the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018456_0024_0FA76E5C36554570"/>
appetite abates; the face either bloats or becomes thin and pale; little urine is made; thirſt, ſlow fever, ſhortneſs of breath, laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude and heavineſs; theſe ſymptoms obtain eſpecially in the anaſarca and aſcites. In the hydrocephalus, convulſions, ſquint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhunning the light, opening of the ſutures, and vomiting of bile, commonly attend, eſpecially if the diſeaſe be far advanced.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT In the Anaſarca and Aſcites, purges with Jalap, ſcammony, calomel, gamboge, elaterium, or the like, twice or thrice a week. Tinct. cupri, tinct. cantharid. ſal diuretic. or ſal abſinth. with bitter infuſion. Emetics and ſudorifics, bliſters and ſcarifications, preſcribed with due caution, have often good effect, otherwiſe, they may do harm. Bark may be given if the ſtrength flag, or conſumptive ſymptoms appear. Weak liquids of all kinds uſed to be avoided, but are now allowed freely with ſucceſs, eſpecially after the draſtic purges. In this complaint bread is generally ordered to be toaſted, and fleſh to be baked, roaſted, or broiled. Smoking is of great uſe, and muſtard ſeeds taken whole have often good effect.</p>
               <p>If the diſorder ariſeth from the too copious uſe of weak liquids, or obſtructed perſpiration, ſudorifics are much to be depended upon. If from drunkenneſs, riding on horſeback and the uſe of wine, or rather geneva diluted with water, in moderate quantity, will be uſeful. If from a conſumptive tendency, diuretics, joined with corroborants. If after great loſs of blood, or from tedious fevers, cathartics ſhould not be uſed too freely, but chalybeate bitters ſhould be chiefly relied on. In the Aſcites, tapping muſt be performed, if the methods above recommended fail.</p>
               <p>In Dropſy of the breaſt, diuretics are chiefly to be employed, cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics only occaſionally. Bliſters applied below the breaſt, and even on the thighs or legs and kept open, are alſo very effectual.</p>
               <p>In the Hydrocephalus internus, a ſalivation excited by mercury has of late been recommended; purges may be given, and medicines of the carminative and antiſpaſmodic kind. Bliſters, ſetons, and iſſues ſhould alſo be preſcribed.</p>
               <p>In the Dropſy of the womb, emetics, ſtimulating clyſters, and occaſionally cathartics; diuretic, attenuant, and reſolvent medicines ſhould be given; and fomentations and vapour baths adviſed.</p>
               <p>In the Hydrocele, let out the water with the trochar at the bottom part of the ſcrotum; but when water is contained in the cellular membrane, treat it as an Anaſarca.</p>

Irregular, when the fits are uncertain and frequent, when the ſymptoms vary, and when the diſeaſe attacks the ſtomach, head, or other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts; chiefly affects the membranes, tendons, and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the pain like that of a diſlocated bone, with a ſenſation as if warm water was poured on the part, ſucceeded by chillineſs and ſlight fever: a breathing ſweat comes on at the end of the fit, and the part ſwells; the fit returns at intervals till the gouty matter is ſpent: the longer the intervals the more ſevere the fit, but the ſymptoms are too well known, to need further enumeration in a work of this nature.</p>

               <p>It is of more conſequence here to deſcribe the ſymptoms in the dog than thoſe of the patient. We may know the dog to be mad by
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018456_0038_0FA76E6B46CE62C8"/>
his dull heavy look, endeavouring to hide himſelf; ſeldom or ever barking; angry and ſnarls at ſtrangers, but fawns on his owner; refuſes all food, droops, hangs down his ears and tail, and often lays down as if going to ſleep; this is the firſt ſtage.</p>
               <p>He now begins to breathe quick and heavy, ſhoots out his tongue, ſlavers, and froths at the mouth; looks half aſleep; flies ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly at byſtanders; runs forward in a curve line; at length he knows not his owner, his eyes become thick and dim, and water runs from them; tongue of a lead colour; grows weak and faint; often falls down, then riſes; and attempts to fly at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; grows mad and furious; the nearer to this ſtate, the more dangerous the bite.</p>
               <p>If the ſtate of the dog cannot be obtained, he may be known to have been mad, or the diſorder may be known to be this by the following effects, which will come on ſooner or later: The bitten part begins to be painful, wandering pains comes on gradually, with heavineſs and uneaſineſs; diſturbed ſleep, frightful dreams, ſtartings, ſpaſms, ſighing, anxiety, love of ſolitude, pains ſhoot from the bitten part up to the throat, with ſtraightneſs, ſenſation of choaking, and horror or dread at ſight of water or other liquids, which is a ſufficient characteriſtic of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT. Cut out the bitten part immediately, which is the only certain cure: cupping-glaſſes ſhould then be applied; cauterize and waſh it daily with ſalt water, or ung. caerul fort, keeping it open with eſcarotics; bleed, if the veſſels be full; vomit with merc. emet. flav. give moſch. to xvi. gr. cinnabar half a ſcruple (to which camphire and pil. ſapon. to vii. gr. may be added) at night, and a purge the next morning; bathe in the ſea, or cold bath, and give a ſudorific; repeat theſe for a week daily, and three or four times at the next full and change of the moon.</p>

May be known from a mere ſyncope by the pulſe and breathing continuing, whereas in a ſyncope they are not perceptible; it alſo comes on gradually, but a ſyncope more ſuddenly; in that, the fit is of ſhort continuance, in this, uſually much longer: with a colour in the face, which is not the caſe in a ſyncope.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT of the diſorder itſelf, as in the hypochondriaſis. In the fit volatile foetids, ſinged feathers, &amp;c. may be applied to the noſtrils; and cold water and volatile foetids given.

               <p>SYMPTOMS. Chillineſs, ſhivering, heat, pain in the head and back, ſickneſs and pain at the ſtomach, and ſometimes vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; fever, coſtiveneſs, convulſive fits ſometimes in children, which is a good ſymptom. On the third or fourth day the eruption appears, like flea-bites, in the face, breaſt, arms, body, and feet ſucceſſively; pains and ſoreneſs in the throat. The eruption being compleated, the fever goes off or abates. The eruptions fill, or maturate like boils, and the ſkin between them is alſo red; the eye-lids, face, hands, and feet, ſwell ſucceſſively; the pocks from red, grow whitiſh and ſmooth in the body, and yellow and rough in the face, full of a white matter. About the ſeventh day from the eruption, (ſometimes the ninth) they dry, or turn as it is called, and ſcale off, leaving red marks, and ſometimes pits behind.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT. If the pulſe be full and ſtrong at the beginning, bleed; and if neceſſary, or the period be ſufficiently early, purge, and give an emetic. During the eruptive fever, cooling febrifuges, with laxatives, or clyſters occaſionally; but if the ſymptoms require it (as low pulſe, &amp;c.) gentle cordials and diaphoretics. After the eruption, little is generally required but a gentle anodyne at night, proper diluents, and if neceſſary, opening clyſters, &amp;c. If purging come on, check it with caution; if delirium or fever, apply bliſters; and if the pock ſink, give bark, with proper diaphoretics and cordials; eſpecially if malignant or putrid ſymptoms, or petechiae appear. Spt. vitrioli dulcis is alſo good in theſe caſes, as are ſinapiſms to the feet.</p>
               <p>In the confluent kind, all the ſymtoms are worſe than in the diſtinct. The eruption makes its appearance a day or two later, and does not come to its height till the eleventh or fourteenth day after; the fever alſo continues after the eruption appears, and a ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation comes on, which muſt by no means be checked. The patient requires to be ſupported more in this caſe than in the other; care, however, muſt be taken in both kinds to avoid too much heat, or a heating regimen; and pure, and even cool

air, where no objection appears, is ſalutary. If the puſtules are opened, and the matter let out, ſo much the better; eſpecially if danger of their ſinking or ſtriking in appear. Purging is eſteemed proper after this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>To inoculate for the Small Pox, take a little matter from a puſtule, after the eruptive fever, on the point of a lancet, and inſert it in the arm (by making a ſmall puncture or two) between the true and ſcarf ſkin, which may afterwards be preſſed down with the ſlat ſide of the lancet. Three or four days afterwards the punctures appear inflamed; in about three days more the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſory ſymptoms come on, and at length the eruption.</p>
               <p>Previous to the inoculation, a mercurial purge or two may be adminiſtered, if the patient is of a full or groſs habit; and he ſhould alſo be reſtrained to a milk and farinaceous or vegetable diet, avoiding eſpecially high ſeaſoned food. It is found beſt to keep him out of bed, and even now and then in the cold air. The ſymptoms are generally ſo favourable, that little aſſiſtance is required from medicine, except a few mercurial purges after the diſorder goes off.</p>

A few days after an impure coition, a titillation about the glans penis; heat and pricking pain in making water; then a diſcharge of matter from the urethra, at firſt whitiſh, and in ſmall quantity; afterwards yellow or green or even reddiſh, and more copious. If it be ſuffered to proceed, inflammation and excoriation follow; painful erection or chordee. Sometimes phymoſis (or an inability of drawing the ſkin back over the glans.) paraphymoſis, (or an inability of drawing the ſkin forward ſo as to cover the glans,) ſwelling of the teſticles, chancres, bubors, ſcabby erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nocturnal pains, nodes, carious bones, ulcers in the throat and noſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT, In the beginning, bleed, if nothing forbid; and give a cooling purge, a ſmall doſe of calomel, merc. calcinat. or other proper mercurial, every night; and nitre, with gum arabic, and ſome gentle lenitive, ſeveral times in the day; repeating the purge occaſionally.
