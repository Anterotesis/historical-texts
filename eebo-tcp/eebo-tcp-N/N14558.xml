            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE advantages of a publication of this kind to the practitioner in medicine, are 'tis preÅ¿umed, too obvious to need enumeration; I Å¿hall, therefore, only premiÅ¿e a few neceÅ¿Å¿ary obÅ¿ervations relative to the work itÅ¿elf.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The doÅ¿es of medicines &amp;c. are Å¿et down as for adults; and therefore, the preÅ¿criber will eaÅ¿ily vary them for other ages. For example, children of two years old may, in general, take about a third part of the doÅ¿es for adults; or a little more; and Å¿o in proportion for other ages, the conÅ¿titution being alÅ¿o conÅ¿idered.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Where it could conveniently be done, I have mentioned the intervals at which the medicines are to be repeated: but theÅ¿e may be varied at the preÅ¿criber's diÅ¿cretion. For brevity's Å¿ake I have in many places, uÅ¿ed the word frequently; by which I would have it underÅ¿tood, that every three, four, Å¿ix, eight, &amp;c. hours are meant, according to the exigency of the caÅ¿e.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:018456_0005_0FA76D0DF33223E0"/>III. When any particular indication is to be anÅ¿wered, the claÅ¿Å¿es, as cathartics, diuretics, aÅ¿tringents &amp;c. may be referred to; under which heads, as many of the compoÅ¿itions and Å¿imples as were judged neceÅ¿Å¿ary, are arranged.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The limits aÅ¿Å¿igned to the work would not admit of formulae; nor do I think them by any means neceÅ¿Å¿ary. The doÅ¿es of all the articles uÅ¿ually adminiÅ¿tered are Å¿et down; and I will not Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that there is any medical practitioner, who cannot give directions for making them into draughts, boluÅ¿es, or other forms that may be required. The vehicles Å¿hould be either perfectly innocent, as pure water, Å¿imple Å¿yrup &amp;c. or of Å¿imilar virtues with the medicines to be given. And if two articles of the Å¿ame virtues, cathartics for example, are employed, it Å¿carce need be mentioned, that the doÅ¿e of each muÅ¿t be proportionably leÅ¿s. It may be added, that ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of a volatile nature Å¿hould be given in a liquid form, leÅ¿t their virtues exhale; very nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eous ones Å¿hould, if convenient, be given in the form of pills or boluÅ¿es.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:018456_0006_0FA76D0E8932DBC0"/>V. In the alphabet I have, for the moÅ¿t part, made uÅ¿e of EngliÅ¿h names; or at leaÅ¿t have referred from thoÅ¿e where technical terms are employed.</p>
            <p>This work was drawn up originally for my own uÅ¿e, and in the courÅ¿e of practice, I have found it very convenient to refer to occaÅ¿ionally. It was the opinion of thoÅ¿e medical Gentlemen who Å¿aw the ManuÅ¿cript that it would be equally uÅ¿eful to others, and this was my motive for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it public.</p>
            <p>If this work aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the practitioner's memory in matters already known, at leaÅ¿t till he has leiÅ¿ure to conÅ¿ult larger works, where neceÅ¿Å¿ary, my deÅ¿ign is anÅ¿wered.</p>

Some cancers are fixed, others moveable; Å¿ome pale, others red and inflamed; Å¿ometimes they remain harmleÅ¿s for years, at others they increaÅ¿e haÅ¿tily; ulcerate, and diÅ¿charge a foetid Å¿anious ichor, and Å¿oon prove mortal.</p>

Externally, apply lint only if the tumour break. Hemlock fomentations have been found Å¿erviceable, as hath alÅ¿o the herb called clivers.

               <p>TREATMENT. Vomit Å¿everal times with warm chamomile tea, then give opium in pills or otherwiÅ¿e, as alÅ¿o by clyÅ¿ter; the pain and tenÅ¿ion being removed by theÅ¿e, give gentle cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, Å¿uch as ol. ricini, infuÅ¿.

While tubercles are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with fever and inflammation, avoid heating medicines, and give cooling febrifuges; if little or no fever, chalybeates are very efficacious; in Å¿pitting of blood, bleed and give tinct. roÅ¿ar. tinct.

For Å¿weats, give elix. vitr. acid. or if that diÅ¿agree, the pearl julep; very gentle vomits of ipecacuanha may be given twice a week, if nothing forbid, to promote expectoration; change of air and gentle exerciÅ¿e are good; the diet Å¿hould be light, mild, and nutritive; as jellies, broths, milk, butter milk, &amp;c.

               <p>SYMPTOMS. A collection of water or Å¿erum in Å¿ome part of the body. Before the diÅ¿order is perfectly formed it is called Cachexy; when the lymph is accumulated in the cellular membrane it is called AnaÅ¿arca, or Leacophlegmatia; when there is a collection of water in the abdomen, it is termed AÅ¿cites; if in the brain, Hydrocephalus; if in the breaÅ¿t, Hydrops pectoris; if in the womb, Hydrop. Uteri; and if in the Å¿crotum, Hydrocele.</p>
               <p>In common dropÅ¿ies the legs uÅ¿ually Å¿well, and a dent or pit remains for Å¿ome time after preÅ¿Å¿ing the fleÅ¿h with the finger: the

appetite abates; the face either bloats or becomes thin and pale; little urine is made; thirÅ¿t, Å¿low fever, Å¿hortneÅ¿s of breath, laÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿itude and heavineÅ¿s; theÅ¿e Å¿ymptoms obtain eÅ¿pecially in the anaÅ¿arca and aÅ¿cites. In the hydrocephalus, convulÅ¿ions, Å¿quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Å¿hunning the light, opening of the Å¿utures, and vomiting of bile, commonly attend, eÅ¿pecially if the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e be far advanced.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT In the AnaÅ¿arca and AÅ¿cites, purges with Jalap, Å¿cammony, calomel, gamboge, elaterium, or the like, twice or thrice a week. Tinct. cupri, tinct. cantharid. Å¿al diuretic. or Å¿al abÅ¿inth. with bitter infuÅ¿ion. Emetics and Å¿udorifics, bliÅ¿ters and Å¿carifications, preÅ¿cribed with due caution, have often good effect, otherwiÅ¿e, they may do harm. Bark may be given if the Å¿trength flag, or conÅ¿umptive Å¿ymptoms appear. Weak liquids of all kinds uÅ¿ed to be avoided, but are now allowed freely with Å¿ucceÅ¿s, eÅ¿pecially after the draÅ¿tic purges. In this complaint bread is generally ordered to be toaÅ¿ted, and fleÅ¿h to be baked, roaÅ¿ted, or broiled. Smoking is of great uÅ¿e, and muÅ¿tard Å¿eeds taken whole have often good effect.</p>
               <p>If the diÅ¿order ariÅ¿eth from the too copious uÅ¿e of weak liquids, or obÅ¿tructed perÅ¿piration, Å¿udorifics are much to be depended upon. If from drunkenneÅ¿s, riding on horÅ¿eback and the uÅ¿e of wine, or rather geneva diluted with water, in moderate quantity, will be uÅ¿eful. If from a conÅ¿umptive tendency, diuretics, joined with corroborants. If after great loÅ¿s of blood, or from tedious fevers, cathartics Å¿hould not be uÅ¿ed too freely, but chalybeate bitters Å¿hould be chiefly relied on. In the AÅ¿cites, tapping muÅ¿t be performed, if the methods above recommended fail.</p>
               <p>In DropÅ¿y of the breaÅ¿t, diuretics are chiefly to be employed, cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics only occaÅ¿ionally. BliÅ¿ters applied below the breaÅ¿t, and even on the thighs or legs and kept open, are alÅ¿o very effectual.</p>
               <p>In the Hydrocephalus internus, a Å¿alivation excited by mercury has of late been recommended; purges may be given, and medicines of the carminative and antiÅ¿paÅ¿modic kind. BliÅ¿ters, Å¿etons, and iÅ¿Å¿ues Å¿hould alÅ¿o be preÅ¿cribed.</p>
               <p>In the DropÅ¿y of the womb, emetics, Å¿timulating clyÅ¿ters, and occaÅ¿ionally cathartics; diuretic, attenuant, and reÅ¿olvent medicines Å¿hould be given; and fomentations and vapour baths adviÅ¿ed.</p>
               <p>In the Hydrocele, let out the water with the trochar at the bottom part of the Å¿crotum; but when water is contained in the cellular membrane, treat it as an AnaÅ¿arca.</p>

               <p>It is of more conÅ¿equence here to deÅ¿cribe the Å¿ymptoms in the dog than thoÅ¿e of the patient. We may know the dog to be mad by
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018456_0038_0FA76E6B46CE62C8"/>
his dull heavy look, endeavouring to hide himÅ¿elf; Å¿eldom or ever barking; angry and Å¿narls at Å¿trangers, but fawns on his owner; refuÅ¿es all food, droops, hangs down his ears and tail, and often lays down as if going to Å¿leep; this is the firÅ¿t Å¿tage.</p>
               <p>He now begins to breathe quick and heavy, Å¿hoots out his tongue, Å¿lavers, and froths at the mouth; looks half aÅ¿leep; flies Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly at byÅ¿tanders; runs forward in a curve line; at length he knows not his owner, his eyes become thick and dim, and water runs from them; tongue of a lead colour; grows weak and faint; often falls down, then riÅ¿es; and attempts to fly at Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; grows mad and furious; the nearer to this Å¿tate, the more dangerous the bite.</p>
               <p>If the Å¿tate of the dog cannot be obtained, he may be known to have been mad, or the diÅ¿order may be known to be this by the following effects, which will come on Å¿ooner or later: The bitten part begins to be painful, wandering pains comes on gradually, with heavineÅ¿s and uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s; diÅ¿turbed Å¿leep, frightful dreams, Å¿tartings, Å¿paÅ¿ms, Å¿ighing, anxiety, love of Å¿olitude, pains Å¿hoot from the bitten part up to the throat, with Å¿traightneÅ¿s, Å¿enÅ¿ation of choaking, and horror or dread at Å¿ight of water or other liquids, which is a Å¿ufficient characteriÅ¿tic of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT. Cut out the bitten part immediately, which is the only certain cure: cupping-glaÅ¿Å¿es Å¿hould then be applied; cauterize and waÅ¿h it daily with Å¿alt water, or ung. caerul fort, keeping it open with eÅ¿carotics; bleed, if the veÅ¿Å¿els be full; vomit with merc. emet. flav. give moÅ¿ch. to xvi. gr. cinnabar half a Å¿cruple (to which camphire and pil. Å¿apon. to vii. gr. may be added) at night, and a purge the next morning; bathe in the Å¿ea, or cold bath, and give a Å¿udorific; repeat theÅ¿e for a week daily, and three or four times at the next full and change of the moon.</p>
               <p>Ung. caerul. mit. applied externally, and turbith mineral given inwardly, Å¿o as to raiÅ¿e a Å¿alivation for Å¿everal weeks, are Å¿aid to be efficacious, The uÅ¿ual remedy known is now the OrmÅ¿kirk medicine, but this has failed in a variety of caÅ¿es.</p>

               <p>TREATMENT. Bark, and other tonics; nervous antiÅ¿paÅ¿modics as caÅ¿tor, valerian, aÅ¿Å¿afoetida, &amp;c. attenuants, as volatile Å¿alts and Å¿pirits; bitters and chalybeats if no fever; emetics, aperients,

May be known from a mere Å¿yncope by the pulÅ¿e and breathing continuing, whereas in a Å¿yncope they are not perceptible; it alÅ¿o comes on gradually, but a Å¿yncope more Å¿uddenly; in that, the fit is of Å¿hort continuance, in this, uÅ¿ually much longer: with a colour in the face, which is not the caÅ¿e in a Å¿yncope.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT of the diÅ¿order itÅ¿elf, as in the hypochondriaÅ¿is. In the fit volatile foetids, Å¿inged feathers, &amp;c. may be applied to the noÅ¿trils; and cold water and volatile foetids given. The feet and legs may be placed in warm water; the pure cold air Å¿hould be freely admitted; cold water may be Å¿prinkled on the face and breaÅ¿t; and if a plethora be indicated, bleed; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e cautiouÅ¿ly avoid it.

               <head>SMALL-POX.</head>
               <p>SYMPTOMS. ChillineÅ¿s, Å¿hivering, heat, pain in the head and back, Å¿ickneÅ¿s and pain at the Å¿tomach, and Å¿ometimes vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; fever, coÅ¿tiveneÅ¿s, convulÅ¿ive fits Å¿ometimes in children, which is a good Å¿ymptom. On the third or fourth day the eruption appears, like flea-bites, in the face, breaÅ¿t, arms, body, and feet Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively; pains and Å¿oreneÅ¿s in the throat. The eruption being compleated, the fever goes off or abates. The eruptions fill, or maturate like boils, and the Å¿kin between them is alÅ¿o red; the eye-lids, face, hands, and feet, Å¿well Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ively; the pocks from red, grow whitiÅ¿h and Å¿mooth in the body, and yellow and rough in the face, full of a white matter. About the Å¿eventh day from the eruption, (Å¿ometimes the ninth) they dry, or turn as it is called, and Å¿cale off, leaving red marks, and Å¿ometimes pits behind.</p>
               <p>TREATMENT. If the pulÅ¿e be full and Å¿trong at the beginning, bleed; and if neceÅ¿Å¿ary, or the period be Å¿ufficiently early, purge, and give an emetic. During the eruptive fever, cooling febrifuges, with laxatives, or clyÅ¿ters occaÅ¿ionally; but if the Å¿ymptoms require it (as low pulÅ¿e, &amp;c.) gentle cordials and diaphoretics. After the eruption, little is generally required but a gentle anodyne at night, proper diluents, and if neceÅ¿Å¿ary, opening clyÅ¿ters, &amp;c. If purging come on, check it with caution; if delirium or fever, apply bliÅ¿ters; and if the pock Å¿ink, give bark, with proper diaphoretics and cordials; eÅ¿pecially if malignant or putrid Å¿ymptoms, or petechiae appear. Spt. vitrioli dulcis is alÅ¿o good in theÅ¿e caÅ¿es, as are Å¿inapiÅ¿ms to the feet.</p>
               <p>In the confluent kind, all the Å¿ymtoms are worÅ¿e than in the diÅ¿tinct. The eruption makes its appearance a day or two later, and does not come to its height till the eleventh or fourteenth day after; the fever alÅ¿o continues after the eruption appears, and a Å¿ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation comes on, which muÅ¿t by no means be checked. The patient requires to be Å¿upported more in this caÅ¿e than in the other; care, however, muÅ¿t be taken in both kinds to avoid too much heat, or a heating regimen; and pure, and even cool
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018456_0059_0FA76E8750343D38"/>
air, where no objection appears, is Å¿alutary. If the puÅ¿tules are opened, and the matter let out, Å¿o much the better; eÅ¿pecially if danger of their Å¿inking or Å¿triking in appear. Purging is eÅ¿teemed proper after this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>To inoculate for the Small Pox, take a little matter from a puÅ¿tule, after the eruptive fever, on the point of a lancet, and inÅ¿ert it in the arm (by making a Å¿mall puncture or two) between the true and Å¿carf Å¿kin, which may afterwards be preÅ¿Å¿ed down with the Å¿lat Å¿ide of the lancet. Three or four days afterwards the punctures appear inflamed; in about three days more the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curÅ¿ory Å¿ymptoms come on, and at length the eruption.</p>
               <p>Previous to the inoculation, a mercurial purge or two may be adminiÅ¿tered, if the patient is of a full or groÅ¿s habit; and he Å¿hould alÅ¿o be reÅ¿trained to a milk and farinaceous or vegetable diet, avoiding eÅ¿pecially high Å¿eaÅ¿oned food. It is found beÅ¿t to keep him out of bed, and even now and then in the cold air. The Å¿ymptoms are generally Å¿o favourable, that little aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance is required from medicine, except a few mercurial purges after the diÅ¿order goes off.</p>

Itching about the anus, with teneÅ¿mus, are Å¿igns of aÅ¿carides, or Å¿mall thread worms. Sudden gripings about the navel, denote the common round worms. Gnawing pains in the Å¿tomach, and voraciouÅ¿neÅ¿s, the maw worms. And a weight in the belly, like the rolling of a ball, the taeni, or tape worm,</p>

If a nerve be divided in part (as violent pain, convulÅ¿ions, and delirium will indicate) divide it entirely; as muÅ¿t alÅ¿o be the caÅ¿e with a tendon or artery in like circumÅ¿tances. If there be fever, bleed, purge, and give cooling febrifuges; and if inflammation, apply emollient poultices and fomentations. If the patient is low and the wound does not go on kindly, bark, or other proper cordial and Å¿trengthening medicines, with Å¿uitable diet, Å¿hould be preÅ¿cribed.</p>
