            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Came the <hi>Indians</hi> with great numbers upon <hi>Lancaster</hi>: Their first coming was about Sun-rising; hearing the noise of some Guns, we looked out; several Houses were burning, and the Smoke ascending to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There were five persons taken in one house, the Father, and the Mother and a sucking Child, they knockt on the head; the other two they took and carried away alive.

Another seeing many of the <hi>Indians</hi> about his Barn, ventured and went out, but was quickly shot down. There were three others belonging to the same Garison who were killed; the <hi>Indians</hi> getting up upon the roof of the Barn, had advantage to shoot down upon them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Fortification. Thus these murtherous wretches went on, burning, and destroying before them,</p>
            <p>At length they came and beset our own house, and quickly it was the dolefullest day that ever mine eyes saw. The House stood upon the edg of a hill; some of the <hi>Indians</hi> got behind the hill, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the Barn, and others behind any thing that could shelter them; from all which places they shot against the House, so that the Bullets seemed to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now is that dreadfull hour come, that I have often heard of (in time of War, as it was the case of others) but now mine eyes see it. Some in our house we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We had six stout Dogs belonging to our Garrison, but none of them wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But out we must go, the fire increasing, and coming along behind us, roaring, and the <hi>Indians</hi> gaping before us with their Guns, Spears and Hatchets to devour us. No sooner were we cut of the House, but my Brother in Law (being before wounded, in defending the house, in or near the throat) fell down dead, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the <hi>Indians</hi> scornfully shouted, and hallowed, and were presently upon him, stripping off his cloaths, the bulletts flying thick, one went through my side, and the same (as would seem) through the bowels and hand of my dear Child in my arms. One of my elder Sisters Children, named <hi>William,</hi>

they knockt him on head. Thus were we butchered by those merciless Heathen, standing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, with the blood running down to our heels. My eldest Sister being yet in the House, and seeing those wofull sights, the Infidels haling Mothers one way, and Children another, and some wallowing in their blood: and her elder Son telling her that her Son <hi>William</hi> was dead, and my self was wounded, she said, And, <hi>Lord let me dy with them</hi>; which was no sooner said, but she was struck with a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and fell down dead over the threshold. I hope she is reaping the fruit of her good labours, being faithfull to the service of God in her place. In her younger years she lay under much trouble upon spiritual accounts, till it pleased God to make that precious Scripture take hold of her heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>And he said unto me my Grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> More then twenty years after I have heard her tell how sweet and comfortable that place was to her, But to return: The <hi>Indians</hi> laid hold of us, pulling me on way, and the Children another, and said, <hi>Come go along with us</hi>; I told them they would kill me: they answered, <hi>If</hi> I <hi>were willing to go along with them, they would not hurt me.</hi>

were twelve killed, some shot, some stab'd with their Spears, some knock'd down with their Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets. When we are in prosperity, Oh the little that we think of such dreadfull fights, and to see our dear Friends, and Relations by bleeding out their heart-blood upon the ground. There was one who was chopt into the head with a Hatchet, and st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipt naked, and yet was crawling up and down. It is a solemn sight to see so many Christians lying in their blood, some here, and some there, like a company of Sheep torn by Wolves.

               </gap>lting, as if they would have torn our very hearts out; yet the Lord by his Almighty power preserved a number of us from death, for there were twenty-four of us taken alive and carried Captive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I had often before this said, that if the</hi> Indians <hi>should come, I should chuse rather to be killed by them then taken alive</hi> but when it came to the tryal my mind changed; their glittering weapons so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my spirit, that I chose rather to go along with those (as I may say) ravenous Beats, then that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to end my dayes; and that I may the better declare what happened to me during that grievous Captivity I shall particularly speak of the severall Removes we had up and down the Wilderness.</p>

She had fine red Stokins, and white Shoos, her hair powdered and face painted Red, that was alwayes before Black. And all the Dancers were after the same manner. There were two other singing and knocking on a Kettle for their musick. They keept hopping up and down one after another, with a Kettle of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the midst, standing warm upon some Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to drink of when they were dry.

               <p>J <hi>have seen the extrem vanity of this World</hi>: One hour I have been in health, and wealth, wanting nothing: But the next hour in sickness and wounds, and death, having nothing but sorrow and affliction.</p>

                  <hi>Before</hi> I <hi>knew what affliction meant,</hi> I <hi>was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sometimes to wish for it.</hi> When I lived in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; having the comforts of the World about me, my relations by me, my Heart chearfull: and taking little care for any thing; and yet seeing many, whom <hi>I</hi> preferred before my self, under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tryals and afflictions, in sickness, weakness, poverty, losses, crosses, and cares of the World, I should be sometimes jealous least I should have my portion in this life, and that Scripture would come to my mind, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> But now I see the Lord had his time to scourge and chasten me. The portion of some is to have their afflictions by drops, now one drop and then another; but the dregs of the Cup, the Wine of astonishment: like a sweeping rain that leaveth no food, did the Lord prepare to be my po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And I hope I can say in some measure, As <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>It is good for me that I have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</hi> The Lord hath shewed me the vanity of these outward things. That they are the <hi>Vanity of vanities, and vexation of spirit</hi>; that they are but a shadow, a blast, a bubble, and things of no continuance. That we must rely on God himself, and our whole dependance must be upon him. If trouble from smallar matters begin to arise in me, I have something at hand to check my self with, and say, why am I troubled? It was but the other day that if <hi>I</hi> had had the world, I would have given it for my freedom, or to have been a Servant to a Christian. I have learned to look beyond present and smaller troubles, and to be quieted under them, as <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.</hi>
