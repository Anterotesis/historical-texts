            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>She owes theſe grievances to Bute's vile tribe,</l>

               <l>TO you my lord, theſe honeſt lines I ſend;</l>
               <l>To you the ſov'reign's not the people's friend</l>
               <l>The ſov'reign's friend? yes, when I think again,</l>
               <l>A friend like Wolſey in a Harry's reign.</l>
               <l>Harry, who gave his royal luſts full ſcope;</l>
               <l>Commenc'd a devil and renounc'd the pope.</l>
               <l>In Bute and North two devils make us groan,</l>
               <l>And at Quebec the pope reſumes his throne.</l>
               <l>Harry's deſpotic frowns o'er caſt us now;</l>
               <l>Fate hangs on Bute's proud will and George's brow.</l>
               <l>Below, North repreſents abſconding Bute,</l>
               <l>Above, a Nation dyes by Roy le veut.</l>
               <l>Proud of North's name corruption wears no veil;</l>
               <l>At North's ſoft bribe, no ſenator turns pale.</l>
               <l>Shrew'd Walpole never went your lordſhip's length;</l>
               <l>But boldneſs with ſupplies has gather'd ſtrength.</l>

Safe from impeachments in this venal time,</l>
               <l>Each parricide may triumph in his crime.</l>
               <l>Knaves in your lordſhip's numbers put their hope;</l>
               <l>Lords fear no ax, and commoners no rope,</l>
               <l>Virtue's fair dawn you've clouded with a ſum;</l>
               <l>And check'd her teſt for ſeven years to come.</l>
               <l>Aſſociation is a dreadful ſound;</l>
               <l>And Bute muſt dye if virtue is not bound.</l>
               <l>Shou'd teſts enſue; impeachments wou'd take place,</l>
               <l>And old St. Stephen wear an honeſt face.</l>
               <l>What muſt be done?—"diſſolve, cries Bute in fits:</l>
               <l>"Diſſolve—and ſtab your country with new writs."</l>
               <l>He ſpoke, and North obedient to his voice,</l>
               <l>With gold prepar'd his boroughs for their choice.</l>
               <l>Appriz'd his members of the dex'trous cheat,</l>
               <l>And plac'd corruption in her former ſeat.</l>
               <l>Crouching ſhe licks the hand by which ſhe's fed,</l>
               <l>And joys to ſee Sir Fletcher at her head;</l>
               <l>To ſee North ape Bute's dictatorial nod,</l>
               <l>For George deſerts his country and his God.</l>
               <l>To ſee her ſons alert when North commands,</l>
               <l>And at his beck lift up four hundred hands.</l>
               <l>But whence this mighty influence? whence this pow'r?</l>
               <l>All virtue's delug'd in a golden ſhow'r.</l>
               <l>A treas'ry ſtorm what virtue can reſiſt?</l>
               <l>Ev'n George to drown her, dips his civil liſt.</l>
               <l>With thirſt hydropic all North's patriots drink,</l>
               <l>And half a million ſcarce will make 'em ſink.</l>
               <l>From craving more no decency reſtrains,</l>
               <l>At once they poiſon and exhauſt our veins.</l>
               <l>Let thoſe, who feel the civil liſt decreaſe,</l>
               <l>Call on Mountſtewart to reſtore his fleece.</l>
               <l>Father and ſon are equally a curſe:</l>
               <l>One dupes the ſov'reign, and one drains the purſe.</l>

In baubles and douceurs what treaſures fly?</l>
               <l>How are the people plunder'd to ſupply!</l>
               <l>Elegance laviſh'd on a Scot is vain,</l>
               <l>A hovel might content an embryo thane.</l>
               <l>His anceſtors (this truth is wormwood now,)</l>
               <l>Whoſe hut contain'd their wife, their bairns, &amp; cow,</l>
               <l>Thought e'er their union taught their pride to feel,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A Pounde in Siller was a muckle deale.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But ſince Scots felt the bleſſings of that law,</l>
               <l>Which laid their Thanes on down inſtead of ſtraw,</l>
               <l>Bleſs'd them with commerce, arts, and all their fruits,</l>
               <l>And bade them herd no longer with their brutes;</l>
               <l>By culture humaniz'd their ſavage mind,</l>
               <l>And plac'd them on a footing with mankind;</l>
               <l>Their haughty ſons who elſe had fed on graſs,</l>
               <l>Or filch'd for hunger, thiſtles from their aſs,</l>
               <l>Shiv'ring on mountains deſolate and cold,</l>
               <l>Strangers alike to luxury and gold.</l>
               <l>Forgetting, like their ſires, want's bitter ſting,</l>

               <l>O! ſhame! where art thou fled!—ye Briton riſe?</l>
               <l>Is it for Bute's proud race you grant ſupplies?</l>
               <l>With juſt reſentment bid Mountſtewart fly,</l>
               <l>And feed his pride beneath his father's ſky;</l>
               <l>There pinch on rocks where barren nature ſleeps;</l>
               <l>Yes—ſcourge him back to his paternal nieps.</l>
               <l>Weak ſov'reigns, thus their artful minions bleſs;</l>
               <l>Aſk what they dare their conſtant anſwer's yes.</l>
               <l>When injur'd ſubjects with petitions go,</l>
               <l>The ſov'reign, low'ring, looks an haughty no.</l>

Yet if his kingſhip wants a freſh ſupply,</l>
               <l>Below—aye, aye,—above, contents the cry.</l>
               <l>Petitioners with rebels are involv'd;</l>
               <l>Let Bute but hint—the parliament's diſſolv'd.</l>
               <l>This influence Beckford labour'd to reſiſt;</l>
               <l>Corruption, was maintain'd, and he diſmiſs'd.</l>
               <l>Cities petition, yet their plague endures;</l>
               <l>But virtue's rage quick diſſolution cures.</l>
               <l>Say (for you know, my lord) the cauſe of this,</l>

               <l>I'll anſwer it myſelf then—frown who will.</l>
               <l>In ancient days when ſimple monarchs ſaw</l>
               <l>No better means by reigning than by law,</l>
               <l>When ſages counſell'd with an honeſt heart.</l>
               <l>And kings religiouſly perform'd their part;</l>
               <l>E'er ſtanding armies were a ſtanding curſe,</l>

               <l>No ſuitor unredreſs'd then left the throne;</l>
               <l>The nurſe's intereſt and the child's were one.</l>
               <l>The three eſtates then us'd to coaleſce,</l>

               <l>Now kings, lords, and commons faithfully agree,</l>
               <l>Like a banditti in confed'racy.</l>
               <l>Combin'd to plunge a nation in diſtreſs,</l>
               <l>To double grievances without redreſs.</l>
               <l>In vain to George the ſuppliant knee is bent;</l>
               <l>He enjoins ſilence, ſuff'ring and content.</l>
               <l>With ſullen gloom he arms his ſulky brow,</l>

               <l>To day 'tis ſlav'ry and to-morrow death.</l>
               <l>That all are rebels, but that paſſive tribe,</l>
               <l>Who kiſs his chains, his footſtool and his bribe.</l>
               <l>That ev'ry ſubject's traiterous in his view,</l>
               <l>Who dares petition, meet, conſult or ſue.</l>
               <l>Theſe ſentiments are Bute's by Mansfield penn'd;</l>
               <l>Mansfield who tells us he is virtue's friend.</l>
               <l>This doctrine good my lord, full ſcope affords,</l>
               <l>To your vile commons and your ſupple lords.</l>
               <l>Since ev'ry act brings forth ſome grievance new,</l>
               <l>Enlarge the narrow bounds of treaſon too.</l>
               <l>Like Mary' Minion in her tyrant reign,</l>
               <l>Enlarge old Edward's act amend, explain,</l>
               <l>Shew Edward's ſages they miſtook the caſe;</l>
               <l>Declare new treaſons—'tis an act of grace.</l>
               <l>Declare it treaſon but to wiſh ſucceſs</l>

               <l>Work your new doctor's inſult into fact;</l>

               <l>If wiſhing's treaſon, writing is no leſs.</l>
               <l>Safe in your votes, corruption now invites:</l>
               <l>This is your time—lop off the hand that writes.</l>
               <l>By libels full of truth, your Mansfield bleeds,</l>

               <l>Nor let him read the CRISIS but by ſtealth.</l>

Let Johnſon's ſheets attrack the monarch's eye;</l>
               <l>There he may ſee how knaves well paid can lye.</l>
               <l>In Johnſon's tenets let him read his own,</l>
               <l>That kings are born to laugh whilſt ſubjects groan;</l>
               <l>That pow'r is their's in ſupplication's ſpite;</l>
               <l>Whatever they and heav'n inflict, is right.</l>
               <l>When kings for wanton ſlaughter give the word,</l>
               <l>Subjects are bound to fall upon their ſword.</l>
               <l>When kings by famine chooſe their ſlaves ſhou'd die;</l>
               <l>Thoſe ſlaves muſt drop without an aſking eye.</l>
               <l>So much for life—to claim our own is vain:</l>
               <l>Like Monteſquieu they fancy who complain.</l>
               <l>What has a ſlave? nor fire, nor cloaths, nor meat;</l>
               <l>Not for themſelves they're warm'd, or cloath'd, or eat;</l>
               <l>But to deſend their maſter in his pride;</l>
               <l>Their ſov'reign; who may tax their very hide.</l>
               <l>Flay off their ſkin in wantonneſs and ſport,</l>
               <l>Or ſend an order for their heads from court.</l>
               <l>Shou'd freedom's odious form preſume to riſe,</l>
               <l>North makes a motion, and the phantom flies.</l>
               <l>Mansfield and Bute the murd'rous bill invent.</l>
               <l>North brings it in—'tis paſs'd—and gains aſſent.</l>
               <l>No tax, no pain, no penalty's too much;</l>
               <l>All are thrice hallow'd by the ſcepter's touch.</l>
               <l>Thus by no tyranny the ſlave's oppreſs'd;</l>
               <l>The means are ſacred, and the end is bleſs'd.</l>
               <l>He's the beſt ſubject who moſt proſtrate lies,</l>
               <l>He's the true patriot who ſubmits and dies.</l>
               <l>Thus Johnſon writes: at court his works have praiſe;</l>
               <l>No reſolution whims in George's days!</l>
               <l>Thus frantic ſavages preſent their breaſt,</l>
               <l>To pointed lightnings, with falſe zeal poſſeſs'd;</l>

               <l>O mighty king! wiſe council! righteous throne!</l>

               <l>Demand the cauſe why ſword or famine drinks</l>
               <l>Boſtonian blood?—Cries Johnſon, Boſton thinks;</l>
               <l>Thinks as her curſed anceſtors were us'd,</l>

               <l>The good or ill their miniſters may do,</l>
               <l>Ariſes always from the point in view.</l>
               <l>Their darling aim gives life to their deſigns;</l>

               <l>The board of cuſtoms by direction meet</l>
               <l>To-morrow, and pronounce Sir James a cheat.</l>

For why? of late Sir James too reſtive draws;</l>
               <l>To ſcourge him North pretends a public cauſe.</l>
               <l>Now for Sir James, in patents picking holes,</l>
               <l>And now againſt him for his frauds in coals.</l>
               <l>Thus we diſcern the juſtice of the ſtate;</l>
               <l>That kings and miniſters breathe life or fate:</l>
               <l>Petitions as rebellious are withſtood,</l>
               <l>Whilſt ſpleen is gratify'd for public good.</l>
               <l>Beware the goal, my lord, nor drive too high;</l>
               <l>Kings dare be tyrants, but they durſt not die.</l>
               <l>'Tis a nice conduct that can ſteer between</l>
               <l>King's luſts, mens rights, and ills that intervene.</l>
               <l>When godlike kings (like Alfred) give aſſent</l>
               <l>To all that can relieve, aſſiſt, content;</l>
               <l>When juſtice by the royal touch gains force,</l>
               <l>And virtue is ſupported in her courſe;</l>
               <l>When regal power is for a bleſſing us'd,</l>
               <l>And mercy like the beams of heaven diffus'd;</l>
               <l>Then righteouſneſs and truth ſurround the throne,</l>
               <l>Then kings are miniſters that heav'n may own.</l>
               <l>By day their preſence gives all hearts delight,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry ſubject is their guard by night.</l>
               <l>But when inflate with pride they ape the god;</l>
               <l>Affect to damp addreſſes with a nod;</l>
               <l>Check and o'er bear the humble ſuitor's claim,</l>
               <l>And give to liberty, vile treaſon's name:</l>
               <l>When in their face and words the tyrant's reigns,</l>
               <l>And free born ſubjects muſt receive their chains;</l>
               <l>When you, my lord, behold this daring ſcene,</l>
               <l>With caution ſteer your little bark between</l>
               <l>The ſov'reign's and the ſubject's ſide;</l>
               <l>On a rough ſea behold each veſſel ride,</l>
               <l>This mann'd by freedom, that by tyrant pride.</l>
