            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llable relating to his age, parentage, or early occupation. To have aſked him directly would have been rude when he evidently meant to be ſilent on theſe ſubjects. My conjecture was that he was the natural ſon of ſome gentleman in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017828_0004_0FB81A2E356C9ED8"/>
England, and that he had been brought up in or near London, and had been about the Court. Since his deceaſe have been able to learn from undoubted authority, that he was born in the county of Eſſex, in a village not far from London. As to his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in youth am ſtill left in the dark, but find he has once mentioned to a gentleman, ſome little inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which happened to him while in company with his father, and that he very early became acquainted with a club in London who were Deiſts, where 'tis probable he received the firſt rudiments in thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. While in England, where he left a mother and ſiſter, he had a fair character for integrity and honeſty. In the year 1755 he went out to the Iſland of Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>adoes, in the family of Charles Pinfold, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of that Iſland, where he tarried ſix years, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> returned to England, purchaſed ſome merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and from thence came to New-York in the year 1762, and immediately removed to Stratford in this State, from thence to Darby, and then to Fairfield, where he married &amp; dwelt ſome years.—By this time he had acquired about twelve hundred pounds property, with which he removed to this town, about ten years ſince, where he reſided until his death. His buſineſs was that of retailing, he formerly credited his goods, but ſince his reſidence in this town he has refuſed to give any credit, intending to keep his property with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own reach, believing it always ſecure while his eye was upon it. While here he added conſiderable to his ſtock, none of which he ever veſted in real e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; the Continental currency taught him that wealth could take to itſelf wings and fly away: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his vigilance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017828_0005_0FB81A2F45A98A08"/>
When the war commenced he had on hand a very handſome aſſortment of goods for a country ſtore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hich he ſold for the currency of the country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut any advance in the price; the money he laid by, waiting and expecting the time would ſoon arrive when he might therewith replace his goods, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to part with it until it ſhould be in as good demand as when received by him. His expectations from this quarter daily leſſening, finally loſt all hope, and was thrown into a ſtate little better than diſpair, as appears from his writings; he adopted a plan of the moſt rigid family oeconomy, but ſtill kept up the outward appearance of his former affluence, and ever to the laſt entertained his friend with his uſual decent hoſpitality, although nothing appeared in his outward deportment, which evinced the uncommon pride of his heart; his writtings ſhew clearly that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to bear the mortification of being thought by his friends poor and dependent. On this ſubject he expreſſes himſelf in the following extraordinary manner: "If a man, who has once lived well, meant well and done well, falls by unavoidable accident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to poverty, and then ſubmits to be laughed at, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and trampled on, by a ſet of mean wretches as far below him as the moon is below the ſun; I ſay, if ſuch a man ſubmits, he muſt become meaner than meanneſs itſelf, and I ſincerely wiſh he might have ten years added to his natural life to puniſh him for his folly."</p>
            <p>He fixed upon the night ſucceeding the 18th of November for the execution of his nefarious purpoſe, and procured a ſupper of oyſters, of which the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat very plentifully; that evening he writes as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017828_0006_0FB81A3236080030"/>
"I have prepared a noble ſupper of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſters, that my flock and I may eat and drink together, thank God and die." After ſupper he ſent the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with a ſtudied errand to a friend's houſe at ſome diſtance, directing her to ſtay until ſhe obtained an anſwer to an inſignificant letter he wrote his friend, intending ſhe ſhould not return that evening—ſhe did howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return, perhaps her return diſconcerted him and prevented him for that time. The next day he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his piſtols to a ſmith for repair; it may be, the ill condition of his piſtols might be an additional rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the delay.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 10th of December ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were with him at his houſe, to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as chearful and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The company left him about nine o'clock in the evening, when he was urgent as uſual for their ſtay; whether he ſlept that night is uncertain, but it is believed he went to bed. The children and maid ſlept in one chamber; in the grey of the morning of the 11th of December he went to their bed chamber, awaked the maid and ordered her to ariſe gently without diſturbing the children; when ſhe came down ſtairs he gave her a line to the family phyſician, who lived at the diſtance of a quarter of a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There is much reaſon to believe he had murdered Mrs. Beadle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he awaked the maid. Upon the maid's leaving

Perhaps he had thoughts he might uſe it againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if his piſtols ſhould fail; it appears he then ſeated himſelf in a Windſor chair, with his arms ſupported by the arms of the chair; he fixed the muzles of the piſtols into his two ears and fired them at the ſame inſtant: The balls went through the head in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe directions.

            </p>
            <p>The afternoon before this terrible execution, Mrs. Beadle walked a broad to viſit an acquaintance, and it was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the lady, ſhe was uncommonly penſive; ſhe aſked the reaſon, Mrs. Beadle with much concern told her, "She had for months been troubled with frightful and uncommon dreams, and that very morning ſhe dreamed violence had been offered her family and her children deſtroyed; ſhe ſaid thoſe dreams wrought on her mind in a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to divert her thoughts from them ſhe had walk'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad that afternoon; and that ſhe verily believed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had judgments in ſtore for their family, which he was about to inflict on them by ſome ſweeping ſickneſs, or in ſome other awful manner."—Mr. Beadle, who, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his writings, was alone privy to his malevolent intentions, put a very different conſtruction upon her dreams. He doubtleſs conſidered them as premonitions from Heaven, and convincing proof to him that his purpoſe was right, of which he ſays he had ſundry intimations he really thought from God himſelf, which he does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
            <p>From whence thoſe dreams originated it is impoſſible to determine, whether the weapons he carried to his bed ſide gave her uneaſineſs and excited a jealouſy in her mind of his intentions, or whether any of his conduct which fell under her obſervations might be alarming to her which might trouble her ſleep, no one can tell. She has lately
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017828_0014_0FB81A520D1C1FF8"/>
mentioned ſundry dreams of a ſimilar nature, which ſhe had near ſix months ſince. Some great and good characters have thought ſuch intimations were at times given from on high, to convince mankind of the reality of the inviſible world—to hazard ſuch a conjecture in theſe modern days would perhap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Her laſt dream penned by him was nearly literally verified. Although the weather was ſerene and pleaſant on the 10th, and near full moon: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſun or moon were viſible from the time this horrid deed was done, until the body of this man was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the clods, which redoubled the horror: When ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the wind blew from the northweſt, diſpelled the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and diſcovered a cloudleſs ſky. The air grew cold, and the faces of the other five being opened to view in their coffins, in the front of the meeting-houſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was ſo great that much time was ſpent to give op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for all to take a view; the cold ſtill increaſing, the bodies in all probability were ſtifned with froſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beadle leſt ſundry letters directed to his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and one laboured treatiſe in juſtification of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; they contain many inconſiſtencies.

impatient to viſit his God and learn his will from his own mouth, face to face in ſome future world, or worlds (which he thinks may be many) and ſeems to think there is as great probability of ſucceeding advantageouſly, in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one world to another as from one country, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to another; and ſeeing all men muſt be lugged off at laſt (as he expreſſes it) he was determined to make the experiment voluntarily which all muſt do through neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

            <head>Extracts from the Rev. Mr. Marſh's Sermon, preached at the Funeral of the Wife and Children of William Beadle.</head>
            <p>THE very ſhocking and execrable deeds perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated laſt Wedneſday morning by a man in this ſociety have led me to make the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>That a perſon, favoured with Chriſtian light and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who appeared to be an affectionate huſband, and a tender, fond parent, ſhould, with deliberation and in cool blood, maſſacre an amiable wife, and four lovely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing children, and then take away his own life, is an event ſo extraordinary, ſurprizing, and unheard of, that we can ſcarcely believe it a reality, though the corpſes of the unhappy woman and chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dren, with the moſt affecting marks of violence upon them, are here preſent before our eyes.</p>
            <p>Had he left no written account of his intentions and views reſpecting the deſtruction of himſelf and family we ſhould have been ready to conſider it as the effect of a ſudden and moſt vehement frenzy. But by his writings he appears to have had it in contemplation for three years.</p>
            <p>The time he firſt fixed upon for carrying into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution his horrid and deteſtable purpoſe was the 18th of Nov. 1782. Not long before this he writes thus: "I mean to cloſe the eyes of ſix perſons thro' perfect humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the moſt endearing fondneſs and friendſhip; for mortal father never felt more of theſe tender ties than myſelf.—How I ſhall really perform the taſk I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken I know not 'till the moment arrives; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017828_0017_0FB81A5DC1954DD0"/>
I ſhall perform it as deliberately, and as ſteadily as I would go to ſupper, or to bed."</p>
            <p>In one of the laſt letters he wrote, there is the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage: "Any man that undertakes any great affair, and at the ſame time thinks, ought to be very deliberate indeed; and think and reflect again and again. On the morning of the ſixth of December I roſe before the ſun, felt calm, and left my wife between ſleep and wake, went into the room where my infants lay, found them all ſound aſleep; the means of death were with me, but I had not before determined whether to ſtrike or not, but yet tho't it a good opportunity. I ſtood over them and aſked my God whether it was right or not, now to ſtrike; but no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer came, nor I believe ever does to man while on earth. I then examined myſelf, there was neither fear, trembling nor horror about me. I then went into a chamber next to that, to look at myſelf in the graſs; but I could diſcover no alteration in my countenance or feelings: this is true as God reigns, but for further trial I yet poſtpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it." And when the fatal morning was come it does not appear by any one circumſtance, but that he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about and went thro' the ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nſter of a man was this! What were his principles that could lead him into ſuch deteſtable and more than ſavage conduct? Surely it concerns us to know that we may guard againſt and avoid them as moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to individuals and ſocieties. Thoſe he has left a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten account of.</p>
            <p>Speaking of the Chriſtian religion he ſays, "It is a moſt benevolent ſyſtem, and would produce grand effects, if it was really believed and univerſally practiſed. I firmly believed it for many years; but my adherence to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts when every one elſe forſook them, has been my bane on earth: But never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind that, if it is really true I ſhall be ſaved by it yet. And now I muſt generouſly own that I have as many doubts about the truth of that, as I have about the truth of any other ſcheme of religion, that ever appeared in the world.—When I conſider men as Chriſtians, I look on them as free agents; I have examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both old and now Teſtaments, and muſt think T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

is their true meaning and intent. But when I conſider man as a Deiſt, or one that does not believe revelation, I think him a perfect machine, and that he can do nothing, but as he is operated upon by ſome ſuperior power—I have renounced all the popular religions in the world, and mean to die a proper Deiſt. I really think there never was any thing done wrong in the world, but believe that all is right;—that we are all impelled to ſay and act, every thing that we do ſay and act.—That a tyrant king, or two or three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce republicans deluging three quarters of the world in blood—that my killing my family—that a man's deſtroying a neſt of waſps, or a fly, is as much directed by the hand of heaven as the making this whole world was—And if this is the caſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is no ſuch thing as ſin.</p>
            <p>Thus he frankly owns that he had apoſtatized from the Chriſtian religion and embraced the principle of deiſm and fataliſm,—that he believed men to be meer machines, and God the author of all their actions in ſuch a ſenſe as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the poſſibility of ſin from the world. The idea of future puniſhment he alſo rejects, as inconſiſtent with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, though he ſays, "I know by experience there is no want of hells in this ſtate of things." And ſeems to be full in the opinion that he and his ſhall be happy in the future world whether he be rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> or not in rejecting the Chriſtian revelation.</p>
            <p>Theſe principles appear to have had a main influence in reconciling him to actions, which have a ſelf-evident criminality in them, which every man's mind, at firſt view, cannot but abhor and condemn.</p>
            <p>Pride, imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tience, and cowardice firſt led him to think of deſtroying himſelf and family, and operated power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in bringing him to determine upon it. He had a high opinion of his intellectual abilities; and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy with the meanneſs of his perſonal appearance, and ſlenderneſs of his fortune. He writes, "My perſon is ſmall and mean to look on, and my circumſtances were always rather narrow; which were great diſadvantages in this world: But I have great reaſon to think that my ſoul is above the common mould.—There are but few men ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of deiſm: they are when ſound like a diamond among millions of pebbles."</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:017828_0019_0FB81A6168AF4C68"/>
He murmured and complained of Providence in the following language; "I was determined not to haſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the matter" (of deſtroying himſelf and family) "but kept hoping that yet Providence would turn up ſomething to prevent it, if the intent were wrong: but inſtead of that every circumſtance, from the greateſt to the ſmalleſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Being too haughty to ſubmit to the humbling diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence, and not having fortitude and courage enough to encounter and ſuſtain the inconveniences ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſtraitened circumſtances, he entertained the cowardly thought of flying from them and taking ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in the unknown world: But the guilt and danger of ſuch conduct, upon ſuppoſition of the truth of the ſac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed ſcriptures, were too apparant to ſuffer him to reſolve upon it, before he had brought himſelf to diſbelieve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them. And to render it ſtill leſs hazardous in his view he gave into the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aliſtic ſcheme, judging God to be ſo far the author of all the actions of men, as to allow them no other agency than that of meer machines; and upon this Hypotheſis concluded that there is no ſin. In which he is doubtleſs more conſiſtent than thoſe who admit the ſame hypotheſis, and yet hold that men are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their conduct.</p>
            <p>But even ſuch a view of the actions of men, added to his profeſſed diſbelief of the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

November 18. he relates in theſe words: "Yeſterday morning ſhe told me her dream—tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent parts of his body. Poor woman! She little thought that the greater part of that dream would be realized within three days—But I am unappalled and think the hand of heaven is really with us.") "She has ſince had two more—one of them, That ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to great puniſhment—that it created g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

On the thankſgiving night ſhe dreamed that her three daughters all lay dead, and they even froze in that ſituation; and even yet I am little affected. O my God, wonderful indeed are thy works; in the higheſt wiſdom haſt thou contrived them all! All muſt be right, or I am hardened indeed.—Some of theſe will be called the ſuggeſtions of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: but men may rely on it, that I have ever truſted in a much higher power; and 'tis he alone that now directs me and ſupports me."</p>
            <p>In another letter, ſpeaking of the intended maſſacre of himſelf and family, he ſays, "In fine clear days, when I am moſt chearful, and in a morning when I firſt wake, free from any diſturbance, I ſeem to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in a ſteady, calm and reaſonable way, that it is appointed for me to do it—that it is my duty and muſt be done. That it is God himſelf that prompts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects me, in all my reflections and circumſpection, I really believe. But if it ſhould at laſt prove Mr. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or any other evil ſpirit, all that I can ſay about it is, that I was born a very unlucky fellow."</p>
            <p>Dreadful deluſion! Strange inconſiſtencies! Horrid blaſphemy! How ſurprizing is it, that a man, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the infallible evidences in favour of the divinity of the Chriſtian religion, a religion which he allows to be moſt benevolent, and with whom it ſeems to be a maxim, that God never makes an extraordinary reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of himſelf to man while upon earth, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and be confident, that He has given him ſundry
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017828_0021_0FB81A66A3FE9D68"/>
intimations that he is right is forming, and taking mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to carry into execution, deſigns condemned by the light of nature as abſolutely wrong, and which no man "whoſe conſcience is not ſeared as with a hot iron," can think of without abhorrence! How ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that one, who ranked himſelf among the few ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime geniuſes, who only, as he ſuppoſed, are cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble of deiſm, that is, of withſtanding the force of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty evidence in ſupport of the divine authority of the Bible, ſhould produce his wife's dreams and his own feelings at her narration of them as a convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the hand of heaven was with him! Such dreams, related in the manner we may ſuppoſe they were by her, had a natural tendency to move the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paſſions, and give a check to his pernicious deſigns. This he ſeemed to be aware of, and conſidered his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unaffected and unappalled as owing either to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural divine help or ſupport, or to his own hardneſs; the latter he would not admit: How aſtoniſhing that he could imagine it to be the former!</p>
            <p>But why do I ſay aſtoniſhing! Can any thing be ſo in one, who, in an enlightened age, ſo far ſets himſelf againſt God as to reject a revelation attended with all the evidence, both internal and external, of it's divine original, that the nature of the thing will admit?</p>
            <p>Can any thing be ſurprizing in one, who in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the light of reaſon, and his own conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of human liberty and free agency, conſiders man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as perfect machines, and God as the efficient cauſe of all the actions of wicked men?</p>
            <p>Can we ſuppoſe any opinion too abſurd to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch an one—any inconſiſtency too glaring for him to be guilty of?</p>
            <p>Can we ſuppoſe it ſtrange, that ſuch an one ſhould be given over by God to "ſtrong deluſion, that he ſhould believe a lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?"</p>
            <p>The horrid deeds perpetrated by this man under the influence of ſuch principles, are a more effectual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of thoſe principles, than any it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of language to produce.</p>

The terrible judgment of heaven in permitting one, who prided himſelf in the character of a deiſt and fataliſt, to be carried by his error to ſo dreadful a length as with deliberation and diſpaſſion to murder himſelf and his whole family, I am ready to think, will, wherever it is known, ſtrike terror into the minds of all who glory in ſuch a character, if any thing will produce ſuch an effect, ſhort of the coming of the Judge of the world in flaming fire, to take vengeance on his enemies.</p>
