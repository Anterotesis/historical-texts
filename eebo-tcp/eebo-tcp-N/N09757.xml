            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HOLY Job, tho' he is ſaid to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and upright, one that feared God, and avoided that which is evil; tho' he was a pattern of patience, and manifeſted great reſignation to the divine will, under the moſt grievous and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon trials; yet the hand of God did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſorely preſs him, and he was ſo ſcorched with the vehement heat of the furnace of affliction into which he was caſt, that like Moſes, he ſpoke unadviſedly with his lips. He murmurs at the diſpenſations of divine Providence towards him, and is ready to charge God with ſeverity in his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012415_0004_0F8973D83133B7E8"/>dealings with him. For this, his friends had ſharply reproved him, and Elihu in an eſpecial manner had ſpoken very cloſely and pertinently to him, in order to convince him of the juſtice and equity of the divine conduct, and to ſilence his murmurings, and bring him to acquieſce in God's providential dealings with him: But all to little purpoſe; ſtill Job is uneaſy and unſatisfied; till at laſt God himſelf ſpeaks to him out of the whirlwind, and cloſely preſſed him with many ſerious and weighty queſtions in this, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapter.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion that God put to him, to humble him and ſhew him his ignorance, was concerning the creation of the world, and who it was that gave it its regular form and ſtructure, v. 4—7 "Where waſt thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou haſt underſtanding. Who hath laid the meaſures thereof, if thou knoweſt? or who hath ſtretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof faſtned? or who laid the corner ſtone thereof?" At the laying of which corner-ſtone, "the morning ſtars ſang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy." It is the eternal Jehovah that is here poſing a mortal worm with theſe queſtions;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012415_0005_0F8973D8F2A6CC00"/>and (as we might juſtly expect) the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is ſublime, the expreſſions lofty, and the ſentiments well adapted to ſtrike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction into a repining ſufferer, murmuring at the all-wiſe conduct of his Maker: q. d. <q>O Job, you pretend to have a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the counſels of God; you have made a great figure among the children of the Eaſt; thou ſetteſt up for an oracle and doſt pretend to cenſure the juſtice and equity of the divine proceedings— now only tell me where thou waſt when the foundations of the earth were laid, declare how it came to be ſo finely fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo firmly fixed, ſo exactly proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and ſo advantageouſly ſituated: If you are ſo wiſe and underſtanding in the government of the world as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be, you doubtleſs know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about the formation of this noble fabric: and I demand of you to tell me where you was, when at the firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this glorious ſtructure, the "morning ſtars" ſtruck their harmonious notes, and with perfect concord chanted the moſt melodious ſongs, in praiſe to its great Creator. Was you then preſent, to hear the ſhouts of joy among the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> and in what a rapturous manner they applauded the work, and adored the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012415_0006_0F8973D9B24CFBD0"/>Workman? Was your ear charmed with the heavenly muſick? and did you join your feeble voice, with the ſhouting miriads that extolled my name upon that occaſion?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus does God query with Job. on purpoſe to bring him to a ſenſe of his folly, in finding fault with His providence in governing the world, ſeeing he was not preſent at the formation of it. <q>And ſince God did not conſult with him in making the world, and yet it is well made; he need not expect that God ſhould conſult with him about the government of the world, and yet it ſhall be well governed:</q> And therefore it became him and all others, chearfully to acquieſce in the wiſdom of divine providence, and not to murmur at any of its proceedings.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the connexion of the text with the context, and what was the deſign of God therein—You ſee, the <hi>morning ſtars,</hi> (by which we are undoubtedly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the angels) are bro't in ſinging praiſe to God at the laying of the foundations of the earth; which ſuppoſes that they had an exiſtence, before the earth was regularly formed and faſhioned, or otherwiſe they could not ſing together upon that occaſion. Moſes has told us
<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. i. x.</note> that "In the beginning
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012415_0007_0F8973DA7331CDF0"/>God created the heaven and the earth,"— the angels doubtleſs are included in the creation of the <hi>former;</hi> and being formed to ſing their Maker's praiſe, they <hi>early</hi> began that bleſſed work, for which they are here called <hi>morning</hi> ſtars: and carefully obſerving the hand of God forming and faſhioning this terraqueous globe, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a ſuitable habitation for man, and knowing, perhaps, that their and our Creator would "rejoice in the habitable parts of the earth, and his delight would be with the ſons of men;" as they ſaw mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo they wanted not a diſpoſition for praiſing God, and giving to him the glory due to his great name therefor.</p>
            <p>The latter part of the verſe, in which it is ſaid, <hi>all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy,</hi> I ſuppoſe to be only exegetical of the former: And what is deſigned by the whole verſe is, to ſhew, that the angelic tribes were ſo ſtruck with a ſenſe of the infinite majeſty and power of God in rearing the ſtately ſtructure of the world, that they all with one accord expreſſed their joy, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God by offering to Him their melodious ſongs of praiſe and thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>To ſing praiſes to God, is the delightful employment of Heaven; and not only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012415_0008_0F8973DB325C8460"/>but <hi>men</hi> are capable of bearing a part in it: And therefore it becomes <hi>them,</hi> in imitation of the bleſſed ſpirits above, to learn to tune their voices in a manner ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to offer praiſes to their maker—and while they are in this world, to begin that bleſſed work, which we hope to be forever employed in, when we come to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Under the direction of this text, I ſhall attempt the following things—viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhew that ſinging praiſes to God, is a duty which He requires of all his ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creatures, of men as well as of angels.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Say ſomething as to the manner of performing this duty:—and then conclude with addreſſes ſuited to the occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to ſhew that ſinging praiſes to God, is a duty which He requires of all his rational creatures, of <hi>men</hi> as well as of angels.—Every rational creature that has underſtanding enough to conſider and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the works of God, and obſerve His perfections and attributes diſplayed in all the divine operations, are under moral obligations to praiſe and glorify Him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for. Indeed the very deſign of God in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012415_0009_0F8973DBF20D04D0"/>forming reaſonable creatures, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his perfections to them, was not only that He might communicate happineſs to them, but alſo that they might glorify Him; i. e. adore and praiſe Him for his perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For <hi>whoſo offereth praiſe, glorifieth me,</hi> ſaith God, Pſ. 50.23. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the divine attributes diſcovered in all the works of God, whether of creation, providence, or grace: And according as God diſcovers himſelf to his creatures, ſo ſhould their acknowledgments of Him, be. And not to acknowledge God according to the diſcoveries he makes of his perfections unto us, is a degree of atheiſm itſelf: It is in a ſenſe to deny that He is poſſeſſed of thoſe perfections, or worthy to be praiſed for them. Every <hi>being</hi> ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by others, according to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that are made of <hi>It</hi> to others; otherwiſe <hi>It</hi> is denied by them: This is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſit in the very nature of things. And ſince the ſupreme Being in his works has diſcovered, unlimited power, unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wiſdom, boundleſs goodneſs, ſpotleſs holineſs, and inflexible juſtice, every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature is in duty bound to praiſe Him for theſe his perfections, according to the diſcoveries he has, or might have had of them.</p>

               <hi>All thy works ſhall praiſe thee, O Lord,</hi> i. e. they <hi>all</hi> even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate parts of the creation furniſh rational intelligences with matter for praiſing Him. In this ſenſe "the heavens declare his glory, and the firmament ſheweth forth his handy work." And the "ſun and moon, and all the ſtars of light," praiſe Him: They do it, by exciting angels and men to that bleſſed work; and furniſhing them with abundant matter for it. And when inanimate things, ſuch as the ſun and moon and ſtars, are ſaid to praiſe God; it intimates that there is much excellency in the works of God, that if they could ſpeak, they would declare and ſhew forth his praiſe; even as when the diſciples of Chriſt rejoiced and praiſed God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works which they had ſeen, ſaying,

               <hi>Bleſſed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: Peace in heaven and glory in the higheſt;</hi> the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Phariſees did not like ſuch muſick, and ſaid to Chriſt, "rebuke thy diſciples:" But Chriſt anſwered, "I tell you that if <hi>theſe</hi> ſhould hold their peace, the <hi>ſtones</hi> would immediately cry out." So here, if angels and men will not ſing praiſe to God, for the works of creation, providence and grace; rather than God ſhould not have the glory thereof, the ſun and moon and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012415_0011_0F8973DE3A386F28"/>ſtars, would all break out into joyful ſongs of praiſes to him.</p>
            <p>You ſee, at the creation of the world, the bleſſed angels were "hymning the eternal Father," adoring his power, wiſdom and goodneſs, which were therein diſplay'd: ſo at the firſt appearance of the <hi>new creation,</hi> when Chriſt Jeſus, the corner-ſtone thereof was laid, then did theſe "morning ſtars" again ſing together, "and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy." No ſooner was it known in heaven, that the eternally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, appeared in a mortal form, but an angel is ordered with ſwifteſt wing to convey the news thereof to the humble ſhepherds, who were with earneſt expectation "waiting for the conſolation of Iſrael." Theſe glad tidings of ſalvation were uſher'd in, by an anthem of praiſe from the heavenly hoſt; for <hi>ſuddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hoſt, praiſing God and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi>

            <p>Thus we ſee that as at the birth of the old, ſo alſo of the new creation, the bleſſed angels tuned their harps to praiſe their Creator. And it is well worthy to be remarked here, that altho' neither the firſt creation of our world, nor the redemption
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012415_0012_0F8973DF5046D308"/>of it by Jeſus Chriſt, was deſigned parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for the benefit of the angels, but for men only, yet theſe diſintereſted and benevolent ſpirits rejoiced in it, and praiſed God for it. This is worthy of our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and let us learn from them, to bleſs and praiſe God for his goodneſs to others, as well as to ourſelves. The exerciſe of ſuch benevolence and good-will in us, will be doing God's will on earth, as it is done heaven: and as in ſuch a temper we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near the inhabitants of the heavenly world; ſo we ſhall be ſharers with them in their happineſs, and partakers with them in their joys.</p>
            <p>Singing praiſes to God, was not deſigned to be the employment of angels only, but is a duty alſo incumbent upon <hi>man.</hi> God has given him a voice, and the faculty of ſpeech, which he is bound to employ in praiſing and glorifying his Maker: Hence it is, that God has made <hi>ſinging</hi> a part of his worſhip; and he expects and requires of every one, that they worſhip him in that way, according to their ability and the capacity God has given them. We muſt "enter into his gates with thankſgiving, and into his courts with praiſe." And we are commanded to <hi>ſing</hi> unto the Lord with the <hi>voice</hi> of a <hi>Pſalm</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm xcviii. 5.</note>; and often, to praiſe
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012415_0013_0F8973DFB252DFA0"/>him with our <hi>voices,</hi> and to <hi>ſing</hi> praiſes unto Him. Altho' ſinging be a token of joy, it is nevertheleſs a duty incumbent on us at all times; for we are commanded to "rejoice evermore," and to "rejoice in the Lord at all times"; nor can our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances be ſo afflictive, but that we have occaſion of ſinging praiſe to God: For how diſtreſſing ſoever our eſtate may be, yet there are many favors and mercies ſhewn to us which demand our praiſes. And the pious Pſalmiſt reſolves,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm ci. 1.</note> I will ſing of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and of judgment, unto thee O Lord will I ſing.</p>
            <p>Singing praiſes to God was a very ſublime and ſolemn part of publick worſhip, under the Old-Teſtament diſpenſation: And our Savior has recommended it to all <hi>chriſtians</hi> by his own <hi>example,</hi> who, we find "ſung an hymn," after he had inſtituted the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's ſupper. And God has been pleaſed to teſtify his acceptance and approbation of this part of his worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New-Teſtament diſpenſation, by miraculous operations in favor of thoſe that were e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>naged in this duty. When Paul and Silas were caſt into priſon—"at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they prayed and ſang praiſes unto God;" and he teſtified his acceptance of their worſhip, by cauſing a great earthquake
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012415_0014_0F8973E0727BB0D8"/>which ſhook the foundations of the priſon, opened the doors, and looſed the bands of the priſoners
<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 16.</note>. And this very inſtance, one would think ſhould be enough to ſilence all objectors, and convince every one that ſinging is an acceptable duty to God; otherwiſe He would never have given ſuch an evidence of his being well-pleaſed with it. Moreover, the apoſtles of our Lord frequently enjoin it upon chriſtians as an incumbent duty, to "teach and admoniſh one another, in <hi>pſalms, hymns</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging</hi> with grace in their hearts to the Lord."</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that this duty is in itſelf reaſonable and fit: It is highly proper that God ſhould be praiſed by all his reaſonable creatures; and when they have a voice and capacity for it, they are under moral obligations to perform it. And we cannot ſuppoſe, but that the neglect of it in ſuch as might perform it gracefully and acceptably (if they took due pains) is a criminal omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is a duty recommended to us by the greateſt examples, and enjoined by the greateſt Authority. We have the example of the holy angels, who were early engaged in this heavenly work—we have the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Old-Teſtament Church—of Chriſt and his apoſtles—as well as many expreſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012415_0015_0F897528F23D7B10"/>precepts to enforce it upon us. Nay, There is ſcarce a book in all the ſcriptures, but what recommends <hi>this</hi> as a duty incumbent on us: And good men in all ages of the Church, have taken pains to promote it.</p>
            <p>It may be added, <q>from the experience of many good Authors, that where pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mody is moſt uſed, thoſe churches are generally the moſt filled:—It has a great influence upon the minds of moſt people, eſpecially <hi>youth,</hi> and keeps them from many vices on the Lord's-day, and at other times, which were it not for the charms of muſick, they would readily run into.</q> God is daily communicating his mercy, benefits, and grace unto <hi>us;</hi> and we are bound to bring unto <hi>Him</hi> our tribute of praiſe and thankſgiving: And <q>to ſing praiſes, is by Him accepted, as the higheſt part of divine worſhip, and in it we approach the neareſt to the worſhip of the heavenly hoſts.</q> Prayer, indeed, is a great duty, and fitted to a ſtate of trial and probation: But when that ſtate is over, prayer will ceaſe; but ſinging of God's praiſes <hi>never</hi> will. It will be the main Employment of <hi>men,</hi> as well as of <hi>angels,</hi> as ſoon as we get to heaven. Therefore, as the Apoſtle <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xlii.</note> prefers <hi>Charity,</hi> before all other chriſtain graces, becauſe it <hi>never
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012415_0016_0F897529B1819D50"/>faileth;</hi> ſo may <hi>we</hi> prefer <hi>ſinging</hi> before all other chriſtian duties, becauſe it will never be laid aſide—a whole <hi>eternity</hi> will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſinging anthems of praiſe to God and to the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Thus much with regard to the <hi>Duty</hi> of ſinging. I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſay ſomething of the <hi>manner,</hi> in which it ought to be performed—And here the example of the <hi>Angels</hi> is for our imitation—the morning ſtars <hi>ſang together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This implies,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their <hi>union and agreement</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to offer up their praiſes to God. They did not ſing as ſcattered individuals, here one, and there another; but combined together, and ſang in concert. It adds much to the beauty of muſick, and makes it moſt melodious, to have the united voices of a multitude, harmonizing together in the ſong. God has made men, as well as angels, ſociable creatures, and he expects and requires that they unite together in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up their praiſes to Him: And as it is good for them to <hi>dwell,</hi> ſo to <hi>ſing together in unity.</hi> And we ſhould all be united in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012415_0017_0F89752A71DE8A60"/>our <hi>hearts,</hi> in this part of his worſhip; and as many of us as <hi>can,</hi> ſhould unite our <hi>voices,</hi> that with one heart and with one voice, we may glorify God.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is not <hi>every one,</hi> let him take never ſo much pains with himſelf, that can modulate his voice ſo as to be able to ſing in concert with others. Every one has his proper <hi>gift</hi> of God: And <hi>ſome</hi> have a talent this way, <hi>others</hi> have not. But it is to be feared that <hi>many</hi> that have a talent for ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, improve it not; but let it lie by <hi>wholly</hi> neglected. Such, will have but a poor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to give of themſelves when an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is made, how they have improved the talents committed to them, for their Lord's glory. But where there is the want of a talent, there ſhould be no want of a diſpoſition and good-will that God ſhould be worſhipped in this manner. They ſhould not look upon it, as an indifferent and needleſs thing for men to learn to ſing God's praiſes harmoniouſly; but ſhould help it forward and do all they can to encourage <hi>others,</hi> in that, which they have not an ability for <hi>themſelves;</hi> and in this way, ſhew their good-will to the praiſes of God; and then they would have this to comfort them, that "where there is a willing mind it is accepted according to what a man hath,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012415_0018_0F89752B31C23C48"/>and not according to what he hath not."— But the conduct of <hi>ſome</hi> in the world, with regard to this affair, has been ſuch as gives too much reaſon to ſuſpect, whether they have any deſire that God's praiſes ſhould be ſung in chriſtian aſſemblies, or not— or at leaſt, they are no friends to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and harmonious ſinging, and care not in how barbarous a manner this part of worſhip is performed: Hence it is that they oppoſe all endeavors to retrieve the credit of our church-muſick, and reſcue it from that degeneracy and decay into which it was unhappily fallen. If we are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God at all in this way, (as I hope <hi>no one</hi> will ſcruple) why ſhould we not worſhip him as well as we are able? And why ſhould we not follow on towards perfection in <hi>this</hi> divine <hi>art,</hi> as well as in any other? If we ſing his praiſes in the beſt manner we are able, after our greateſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we do not do it too well, nor even then, in a manner adequate to what his perfections demand—we come infinitely ſhort of what is his juſt due. But it may be ſome alleviation of our ſorrow that we can praiſe Him no better, to conſider, that He is, in a more perfect manner praiſed by the angels in heaven. It certainly concerns us to wiſh well to his praiſes, and do all we
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012415_0019_0F89752BEF944088"/>can to encourage the ſinging of them.— Let us all be <hi>united,</hi> in a thing ſo laudable— a matter ſo intereſting to <hi>Religion</hi>—to the glory of God, and the credit of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The more united we are, the better melody ſhall we make, both in our hearts and with our voices—the nearer ſhall we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the worſhip of <hi>angels,</hi> and the more acceptable to God will our praiſes be. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we may be able to ſing <hi>together,</hi> it is neceſſary for us to get a good acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the <hi>Rules</hi> of ſinging; and be able to diſtinguiſh between thoſe ſounds which are concordant and harmonious, and thoſe which are diſcordant and grating to the ear.</p>
            <p>In the doctrine of ſounds (upon which all muſick depends) there is ſomething very myſterious and unaccountable. Sounds, at certain intervals or diſtances from each other, mixing together, ſtrike the ear with an agreable ſenſation, and are called <hi>concords;</hi> at certain other diſtances, they are harſh and grating to the ear, and are called <hi>diſcords.</hi> Now why there ſhould be ſuch a coaleſcence of ſounds at juſt ſuch diſtances, ſo as to make it <hi>grateful</hi> to the ear, and at other intervals or diſtances either leſſer or greater than the former, there ſhould be no ſuch agreement,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012415_0020_0F89752D81E06860"/>and the ſounds when made, ſhould be ſo jarring and <hi>grating;</hi> is one of the ſecrets of nature not inveſtigated by man. That it is ſo, is fact: but <hi>why</hi> it is ſo, <q>muſt be reſolved into the will, power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the great Creator, who doubtleſs deſigned the pleaſing harmony and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of ſounds, to ſweeten and heighten the pleaſures of human life, and to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate and diſpel its cares. <note n="*" place="bottom">Martin's Philoſoph. Gram.</note>
               </q> But this ſhews the neceſſity of certain Rules to find out the diſtances of ſounds, and adjuſt them in ſuch a manner as to produce <hi>melody.</hi> Were all ſounds, at whatever diſtances from each other, equally concordant and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious; I ſee not, that there would be any occaſion for the intervention of any <hi>fixed rules:</hi> But ſince it is not ſo, it is abſolutely neceſſary that there ſhould be rules for the regulating our voices, diſtinguiſhing ſounds, and meaſuring notes. Now, is it poſſible for us to <hi>ſing together</hi> harmoniouſly, unleſs we are regulated by ſuch rules? It is eaſy to ſee what diſorder and confuſion it would make for every one, without regard to any rule, to ſing <hi>loud</hi> or <hi>low, ſtrong</hi> or <hi>weak, quick</hi> or <hi>ſlow,</hi> juſt as he pleaſed. Singing in that manner, in an aſſembly, would be rather like the <hi>yellings of Bedlam,</hi> than the worſhip of rational men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012415_0021_0F89752E85C441E0"/>
God, is <hi>a God of order, and not of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and He requires rule and order among all his worſhippers, and in every part of his worſhip. And as <hi>ſinging</hi> is a part of his worſhip, it ought to be performed in an orderly ruleable manner, ſo that different voices may go together, unite, and produce harmony; which never can be in ſinging, if only the mere dictates of uncultivated nature be followed. The rules of muſick, we muſt acquaint ourſelves with, if we would ſing <hi>together,</hi> ſo as to make melody to the Lord, or pleaſe ourſelves. We muſt know the <hi>air</hi> of the tune—the <hi>pitch</hi> of our voices,—and the <hi>length</hi> of our notes; or we cannot ſing harmonious and concordant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rules</hi> of muſick, are not mere arbitrary things, depending only upon the will of him that invents them; but are founded in reaſon, nature, and the order of things; inſomuch that they cannot be otherwiſe than they are, and produce ſuch an agreement in ſounds, as to be melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And therefore that ſinging which is moſt by rule, is moſt agreeable and fit, in the nature of things, to be offered to God, and for that reaſon, moſt acceptable unto him.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to infer from hence that any <hi>cuſtom</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of ſinging, practiced in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012415_0022_0F89752EF3BB4558"/>the Churches, that is contrary to the rules of muſick, <hi>ſuch practice</hi> (unleſs ſome greater advantages accrue ſome other way by it) muſt be diſagreeable to the mind and will of God. If God is a <hi>God of order,</hi> and a lover of harmony—and if ſinging by <hi>rule</hi> is the moſt regular and harmonious ſinging— then it is the moſt fit and proper, that ſuch ſinging ſhould be offered to him; and we cannot ſuppoſe but that He would be beſt pleaſed with it. And no <hi>cuſtom</hi> of ſinging that infringes upon the rules, or embarraſſes the ſong, ought to be tolerated in the Church, unleſs ſome <hi>greater</hi> advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe by ſuch a cuſtom ſome other way, than would do, by attending cloſely to the rules of muſick.</p>
            <p>The cuſtom of <hi>reading</hi> the Pſalm, <hi>line by line,</hi> as it is ſung, is objected againſt, by the greateſt maſters of ſong, as a violation of the rules of ſinging. But ſo great are the advantages that are ſuppoſed to accrue by that practice another way, that many are loth to give it up: and this in many places cauſes great heat and contention. I ſhall not think it amiſs at this time, briefly to conſider this matter, and ſhall endeavour to give the arguments on both ſides, their due weight, that we may better come to the knowledge of our own duty in this affair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:012415_0023_0F89752FB050FCF0"/>
As to matters of God's worſhip, we have nothing to direct us therein but his <hi>Word,</hi>— or the <hi>practice</hi> of the primitive Churches,— or the <hi>expediency and fitneſs</hi> of things.—The Word of God is the only rule of conſcience; and no man can ſay that he can't in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, comply with any propoſed practice, unleſs he can ſee ſomething in the ſcriptures that forbids it: He may plead that his <hi>humour</hi> forbids it, but he can't plead <hi>conſcience,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he finds ſomething in the Bible, that directs him in the caſe. Now the Bible no where tells us, that the pſalm ſhall be read, line by line when we ſing; nor is any thing there ſaid, that implies any ſuch thing. It is well known to all that have looked into <hi>antiquity,</hi> and what was the <hi>cuſtom</hi> of the Jewiſh Church, that they never practiſed reading with ſinging: Indeed their <hi>tunes</hi> were ſo contrived, that they would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſuch a practice: They were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like our <hi>Anthems,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. WATTS'S larger Pref. to his Verſ. of the Pſalms, P. 17.</note> muſical notes were ſet over the words in their pſalm-books, which directed their voices as they pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the words in ſinging. Chriſt and his Apoſtles were trained up in this manner of ſinging, and were able to ſing <hi>together,</hi> as we find they did, at the inſtitution of the Lord's Supper. They did not form a <hi>new ſcale</hi> of muſick, but kept to <hi>that</hi> which was practiſed upon in the Jewiſh Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:012415_0024_0F89753071E7B9F0"/>
As to the <hi>primitive chriſtians,</hi> we find not the leaſt tittle to incline us to think that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſinging, was ever practiſed in a ſingle inſtance by <hi>them;</hi> nor the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſuch officer as a <hi>Reader</hi> of the pſalm for the congregation, when ſinging: and certainly it belonged not to the <hi>Deacon</hi>'s office, any more than to the office of any one elſe,—and yet ſome of the writers of thoſe times, profeſſedly give an account of the <hi>cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> of chriſtians in their publick worſhip; ſo that, if it had been the cuſtom to <hi>read</hi> with <hi>ſinging,</hi> it is very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable that they ſhould ſay nothing at all about it. And I believe I may ſafely challenge any man to produce a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of thus reading with ſinging for about fifteen hundred years after Chriſt.— I confeſs I am unable to give a particular account how the practice firſt came to take place in the chriſtian churches: But the moſt probable conjecture is this.—When a reformation from popery took place, the pſalmody in the church of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with popiſh doctrines and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that when the <hi>Reformers</hi> broke off from her communion, they left their pſalm-books behind them: and whenever a verſion was publiſhed according to the <hi>Proteſtant ſcheme,</hi> ſpecial care was taken by the <hi>Pope,</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012415_0025_0F897531331D9A10"/>all <hi>ſuch</hi> tranſlations: and in thoſe countries where his influence moſt extended, very few ſuch pſalm-books could be procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And as <hi>ignorance</hi> with them <hi>was the mother of devotion,</hi> very few were taught to read, and ſo unable to make uſe of pſalm-books if they had them. So that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were obliged either to alter the <hi>manner</hi> of their ſinging, or many of them loſe the <hi>matter</hi> of the ſong: For which reaſon it is probable they firſt allowed of <hi>reading</hi> with ſinging. But it appears that this practice never took place in <hi>moſt</hi> of the reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>The pious Dr. WATTS, who for his many ſweet and heavenly ſongs, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſkill in ſinging, may fitly be called the <hi>Britiſh David;</hi> in his larger preface to his verſion of the Pſalms, ſpeaking of other verſions of the Pſalms not being adapted to the ſtate of the chriſtian Church, ſays thus upon it,<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 6.</note> that <q>it renders the performance of pſalmody—extremely troubleſome in thoſe aſſemblies where the Pſalm is ſung without reading line by line, which yet is <hi>beyond all exception the trueſt and beſt method.</hi>
               </q> And in another place
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 27.</note> he ſays, —<q>It were to be wiſhed that all Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and private Families would ſing as they do, in foreign proteſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012415_0026_0F897531F90AE7C0"/>without reading line by line—many inconveniencies will always attend this unhappy manner of ſinging.</q> Thus he.</p>
            <p>Thus thoſe who are in favor of ſinging without reading plead—that they have the example of God's ancient Church—the practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and of the chriſtian Church for fifteen hundred years together—that reading, is a violation of the <hi>rules</hi> of ſinging—interrupts the long —hurts the melody and diſappoints them of the pleaſure of the muſick—that in a country where pſalm-books, may be had at ſo cheap and eaſy a rate, as among us, it is entirely needleſs to have it ſo—and if people would provide themſelves with <hi>books</hi> (as they ought to do) they would better take the ſenſe, and ſee the connexion of one line and verſe, with another, than they poſſibly can do by hearing it read line by line—all might better underſtand the <hi>matter</hi> of the ſong, and no interruption given to the <hi>manner</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide it is plead—That many people are poor, and unable to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe pſalm-books—that others are old, and unable to ſee to read if they had them—that there are many young people and others, that can't ſo well read, and they would take
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012415_0027_0F897532B841DEE8"/>the ſenſe much better to have it read line by line: They plead alſo—that it has always been the practice of our Fore-fathers in this Land —and that this ſinging without reading, is a new-found invention of Man—that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs the peace of Churches and Societies,— and (thoſe that know no better, will ſay that it) is a leading ſtep to <hi>Popery;</hi> and that if they once begin to let in new things they know not where they ſhall ſtop,—and that ſince they have reaſon to believe that God has heard the prayers, and accepted the praiſes of his people in this land, when they have worſhipped Him in the manner they now do,—and ſince alſo, they cannot ſee that <hi>reading</hi> does give ſuch an interruption to regular ſinging as is pretended;—they can't ſee their way clear to encourage the practice of ſinging without <hi>it:</hi>—It is what they never heard of till of late, and they don't love to be given to change.—Theſe are their main objections.—Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them, and ſee what can be ſaid in anſwer to them.</p>
            <p>As to peoples being <hi>poor,</hi> and unable to purchaſe pſalm-books; there are enough that will engage to <hi>give</hi> to ſuch as are not able to buy for themſelves: So that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is quickly anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:012415_0028_0F897534A2782860"/>
As for thoſe that cannot <hi>ſee</hi> to read, or cannot <hi>read</hi> if they could ſee; doubtleſs reading line by line may be ſome advantage to them: but I preſume the number of ſuch is very ſmall,—and there may be others that are <hi>deaf,</hi> and cannot hear, if it is read; and yet becauſe it is not cuſtomary to carry pſalm-books to publick worſhip, they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, for fear of being looked upon as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and making their infirmity to be taken notice of by the aſſembly: Whereas if it had been cuſtomary to carry <hi>books,</hi> (as it would have been, if there had been no reading) they would have done it, and ſo would always have been able to have taken the ſenſe of the pſalm as it was ſung. But further—conſidering the diſadvantages that attend ſinging with reading, it may juſtly be queſtioned, whether for the ſake of a <hi>very few</hi> old people and perſons that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read, <hi>congregations</hi> are in duty bound to tolerate that practice: We know of no ſuch proviſion that was made for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, either in God's ancient Church, or by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or by any of the primitive Churches: And if <hi>they</hi> did it not, it will be hard to prove that <hi>we</hi> are in duty bound to do it. I would condeſcend as far for the ſake of ſuch, as is any way reaſonable or convenient, but to do it at the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012415_0029_0F897534F1603A70"/>expence of the regular performance of that part of worſhip, and to the diſadvantage of ſo many others, is what I cannot ſee ſufficient reaſon for. Beſides, when once thoſe perſons become better acquainted with the method, they will by the help of hearing the Pſalm once read over by the <hi>miniſter,</hi> and attending to the <hi>ſingers</hi> as it is ſung, (if they ſpeak the words as diſtinctly and plainly as they can, which they ſhould be careful to do) I ſay ſuch perſons, and indeed all the congregation may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the moſt that is ſung. So that <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> with ſinging will be but of very little, if any advantage upon this account.</p>
            <p>As to the plea that it has been the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practice</hi> of our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> in this land, and that to ſing without reading, is a <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found invention of men;</hi> this is wholly a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.—Mr. MATHER, in his <hi>Ratio Diſcipline,</hi> a book publiſhed above fifty years ago, tells us "that ſome congregations where they had pſalm-books, ſung <hi>without reading:</hi>" and it is well known by thoſe that have made due enquiry, that it was never practiſed in ſome of the <hi>oldeſt</hi> Churches in this land; and and it is ſo far from being a <hi>new</hi> invention, that it is as <hi>old</hi> as Chriſtianity itſelf, and was the method practiſed by our Savior and his Apoſtles: So that when we plead for it,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012415_0030_0F897535B10BAA00"/>we aſk for no more, than what was the <hi>good old way</hi>—and it is to be hoped that all that are lovers of that way, will readily join with us.</p>
            <p>As for its making <hi>diſturbances</hi> in the Church—It is generally obſerved that thoſe that are moſt diſturbed, are commonly ſuch as know the leaſt of the matter. There is no reformation that is ever ſet on foot, even tho' it be from ſuch groſs corruptions as Idolatry itſelf, but what will cauſe diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, and breed contention. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome, the prejudice of others, and the wilfulneſs of more, will always raiſe oppoſition: And what! becauſe of this ſhall we never attempt to reform? we were unworthy the name of Chriſtians if we did not. Indeed in matters of little or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, it is not worth while to diſturb the peace of ſocieties about them: And whether the thing now pleaded for, is worth <hi>contending</hi> about, I will not determine. —I hope none are for driving matters to extremity, or making ſuch a point of it, as to diſturb the peace of the ſociety:—But then, <hi>one</hi> way, or the <hi>other</hi> may be moſt agreable to the body of the people, and moſt acceptable to God; and it cannot be amiſs to conſider what may be ſaid on both ſides of the queſtion: And I hope that every
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012415_0031_0F897536701733F8"/>one will judge for <hi>himſelf,</hi> and act upon that ſide where he ſees the greateſt light.</p>
            <p>As to its being a leading ſtep to <hi>popery,</hi> and an inlet to <hi>innovations;</hi> there is not the leaſt foundation, for ſuch an aſſertion: This is only the "Bug-bear of folly," and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry to diſturb the minds of others. For what ſort of connexion can any one ſee, between ſinging without reading, and popery? They may as well ſay that the practice of primitive chriſtianity led to popery. And if it is really a reformation in our worſhip, to ſing without reading, and a coming nearer to the practice of primitive chriſtians, we ought to rejoice in it, and be glad of <hi>ſuch</hi> innovations every day.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs God has heard the prayers, and accepted the praiſes of his people in this land, tho' they have not ſung in the manner that is now pleaded for. It is not every irregular practice in his worſhip that will cauſe Him who is ſo infinite in mercy, and ready to pardon to reject the prayers and praiſes of his worſhippers. But altho' He has accepted the praiſes of his people when performed in a leſs ſuitable manner, it will not from thence follow, that they would not have been more acceptable, if they had been performed in a different manner: And therefore it can be no plea
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012415_0032_0F897537335C9EE0"/>for continuing <hi>that</hi> practice. Tho' the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and praiſes of a perſon not perfectly ſanctified, may be acceptable to God; yet it would be very wicked for the perſon to ſay—that therefore, he will not preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards greater perfection: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the nearer he gets to perfection, the better he performs his duty, and the more acceptably to God.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the main pleas that are made in favor of the preſent cuſtomary way of ſinging— <hi>you yourſelves,</hi> are to judge of the force of them, and of the anſwers given to them.</p>
            <p>Whether reading is actually an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> in ſinging—every one that has any tolerable acquaintance with the rules of ſinging, cannot but ſee that <hi>it is.</hi> The like practice in any other part of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, would be judged, I believe, as a <hi>great</hi> interruption. Should a line of Prayer be read, and then prayed over, and ſo on— no one, I preſume would deny but that reading in that manner, was an interruption to praying: and I ſee not, but it is as <hi>much ſo</hi> in ſinging—in both caſes the ſong and the prayer, are equally interrupted by the reading</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay that they ſhould not ſo ſtrongly object againſt the practice of ſinging
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012415_0033_0F897537F116DD30"/>without reading, if it was not for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing</hi> the <hi>Baſs</hi> and <hi>Treble</hi> between the Lines, but <hi>this</hi> is ſo much of ſound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubſtance, and ſounds ſo odly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthly to them, that they cannot away with it:—But ſuch ſhould know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that this <hi>continuing</hi> has its advantages; it keeps the muſick alive, ſteadies the tune, and helps the better to ſtrike into the ſame pitch again—and therefore ought not to be found fault with.</p>
            <p>After all; whatever the advantages are that accrue by the practice of reading the Pſalm, line by line as it is ſung; yet the diſadvantages of it another way not yet mentioned, I think, are more than a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-balance: This practice prevents many people from getting <hi>Pſalm-books,</hi> which otherwiſe they would do: And for want of books in our Families, neither the Heads of families nor children can acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficiently with our <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> nor have the benefit of it in their private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and this, among chriſtians, is a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal omiſſion; Our Pſalm-books are as neceſſary in their place, as our Bibles; and it is what is enjoined upon chriſtians by an inſpired Apoſtle <note n="†" place="bottom">Col. iii. 16.</note> to teach and admoniſh one another, in Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012415_0034_0F897538B2FD0638"/>Songs. <note n="*" place="bottom">If any are deſirous of knowing the difference between Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs; I ſhall give it them, as I find them diſtinguiſhed in LEIGH'S <hi>Sacra Critica. Pſalms,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain exhortation to manners, or holy life. <hi>Hymns,</hi> contain praiſes to God, in the commemoration of his Benefits. <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> contain Doctrine of the Chief Good or Man's eternal Felicity. A Pſalm is a Ditty to be play'd upon an Inſtrument; an Hymn is a ſong to be uttered with the voice only; an Ode or Song, is a Ditty fitted for either way. See Leigh in Vocibus.</note> Now how we can comply with this duty, and never have pſalms nor hymns in our houſes, is hard to conceive. Beſides, children and young People, at their leiſure hours would take delight in reading and committing many of them to memory, which would be of great ſervice to them in future life: But for the want of them in our houſes, they are deprived of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. Now ſo far as the preſent practice, is an inducement to People to neglect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding themſelves with books; ſo far it is hurtful to Religion—and their not having books, inſtead of being urged as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for continuing the practice of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is (with me) one of the greateſt arguments againſt it, as thereby many are induced to neglect their duty in this affair.— But with regard to the <hi>manner</hi> of ſinging.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we ſhould carefully attend to the <hi>matter,</hi> as well as the manner of the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012415_0035_0F89753970D651C0"/>ſong. The apoſtolick direction is to <hi>ſing with grace in your hearts to the Lord:</hi> And how ſkilfully ſoever we may tune our voices, and how melodious ſoever our ſinging may be in the ears of others; yet if the matter that we ſing is neglected, and there is no ſuitable affection working in our hearts towards God—we are but as "ſounding braſs, and a tinkling cymbal;" and we are ſo far from <hi>making melody</hi> in his ear, that our ſong is grating, diſcordant and unharmonious; becauſe, tho' with our voices we praiſe Him, yet our hearts are not right with Him. This is a capital point, and ought to be well conſidered; for it is the very Thing that renders our praiſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto Him: And in vain is our ſinging if it be not acceptable.—But I muſt haſten to a word of addreſs.—Firſt, To the ſingers in this congregation in particular; and <hi>then,</hi> to the aſſembly in general—and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi>—To the Singers.—We rejoice to ſee that under the good Inſtructions which you have lately had, in ſo ſhort a time, you have made ſo great proficiency —the aſſiduity and diligence with which you have applied yourſelves to this laudable and uſeful ſtudy, is much to your honor.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012415_0036_0F89753A2F7308A0"/>We flatter ourſelves, that what we now ſee of your talents and accompliſhments for church muſick, is but a faint ſpecimen of what your further improvements will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to produce—you will not reſt at thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of knowledge to which you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attained, but preſs forward towards greater perfection; you would do well to keep up your meetings for this purpoſe—but be careful, at the ſame time that you do not let one duty infringe upon another; nor purſue ſinging ſo as to neglect prayer, or the duties of your particular callings;— remember, you are in a world of trouble and temptation, in a ſtate of trial and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, where ſomething elſe is to be done, as well as ſinging; it is only in Heaven that <hi>this</hi> is to be our main employment— Obſerve ſuch a decorum in theſe things, as that your <hi>good</hi> may not be <hi>evil ſpoken of.</hi>— It is by <hi>you,</hi> that the moſt ſublime part of publick worſhip is to be performed—God is honoring you, by calling of you to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this duty: In a ſenſe He is making of you, his ſpiritual prieſts, to offer up, in his Church the ſpiritual Sacrifices of praiſe unto Him! ſee then, that your behavior at all times, correſponds with ſo high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable a character.—Beware of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing—avoid that which is evil, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012415_0037_0F89753BB9DCF148"/>purſue that which is good; defile not yourſelves with any ſinful impurities, leſt, God have no reſpect unto your offerings: God requires ſpiritual ſacrifices; and that thoſe who worſhip Him, do it in <hi>ſpirit and in truth.</hi>—Don't let it be altogether your concern to have your <hi>voices</hi> rightly tuned, but look at your <hi>hearts</hi> and ſee that they are tuned for God's worſhip; ſee that you make melody <hi>there</hi> unto Him. If you do not take care to have your Hearts right with Him, all is but a hypocritical oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is an abomination unto Him.— Conſider, how dreadful your caſe will be in the other world, if after you have ſung God's praiſes, in ſuch melodious ſtrains with your voices <hi>here,</hi> you ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rejected of Him, and ſent to howl the doleful notes of the damned in <hi>hell.</hi> The more you reliſh the charms of muſick, the more tormenting will it be to you, to be forever deprived of them—to be baniſhed that company, who ſhall be forever praiſing God in the moſt rapturous ſtrains of melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.—See that you live in peace with each other—you are lovers of concord and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and it is no leſs delightful in a <hi>moral,</hi> than it is in a <hi>muſical</hi> ſenſe.—If you meet with no diſcouragements from the Society, (as I pray God you may not) if that part of divine worſhip is not well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012415_0038_0F89753CB1EF1C90"/>the blame will lie at your door. Be very careful to give your attendance upon the publick worſhip—remember, you have a part of it to carry on yourſelves and there—
<q>
                  <l>"Rehearſe his Praiſe with Awe profound,</l>
                  <l>"Let Knowledge lead the Song;</l>
                  <l>"Nor mock him with a ſolemn ſound</l>
                  <l>"Upon a thoughtleſs Tongue."</l>
               </q> The Lord be with you, and bleſs you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi>—To the Aſſembly in general.— I hope there is none of us, but what wiſh well to God's praiſes, and rejoice to ſee the improvements that are made in our Church muſick—and tho' there are ſome of us, that have not a talent that way, yet I hope all our hearts are in it: If ſo, it may be ſaid of us, as of the "morning ſtars," they <hi>ſang together.</hi> If God has given to any of us a capacity and talent for ſinging his praiſes, together with others, and yet we do not improve it, but let it reſt and lie by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; we are undoubtedly much to be blamed. It concerns us all to examine our talents this way, and to improve them, as we find God has given us ability. We are not to imagine that ſinging regularly is a uſeleſs and unneceſſary accompliſhment; God has given to men voices, and a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for it, and requires us to worſhip him,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012415_0039_0F89753D310CDE98"/>by joining in concert, and ſinging harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. But if we can't ſing ourſelves, be-ſure we muſt not diſcourage this work; ſuch as do it, whatever they think of it now, will at laſt be found fighting againſt God, and oppoſers of his worſhip: May we all be directed to act in this, and in all other affairs to his Glory.</p>
            <p>To conclude. If a few feeble voices very imperfectly tuned, ſinging in concert here below, are ſo melodious—then what will Heaven be? when all the ſaints on earth, and "the Spirits of the Juſt made perfect," ſhall join with the <hi>morning ſtars,</hi> ſinging and ſhouting forth everlaſting praiſes to <hi>God and the Lamb,</hi>—Cherubims and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, Men and Women, ſhall all ſing <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> in one grand Aſſembly, and with voices perfectly tuned, ſhall carry the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective <hi>parts</hi> aſſigned them,—O! how ſweet their ſong! and how charmed muſt our ſouls be, when all at once they ſtrike their harmonious notes, and raiſe their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in lofty ſtrains of melody!—How ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and ſolemn the muſick, as it reſounds from the concave of the third Heavens, and echoes from Pole to Pole.—May we all be bro't, not only to imagine, but taſte the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and with the <hi>morning ſtars</hi> ſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
