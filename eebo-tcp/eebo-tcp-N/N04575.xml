            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the Beginning of this Chapter, <hi>John</hi> ſeeth in Viſion a ſealed Book presented in his Hand who ſitteth on the Throne, that is the Father. This Book no doubt was the Book of God's Counſels and Decrees reſpecting the Things which ſhould befall his Church to the End of the World, this Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Proclamation is then made by an Angel, <hi>Who is worthy to open the Book, and to looſe the Seals thereof,</hi> v. 2.

            <p>In the Words we may obſerve, 1. Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the Lamb that was ſlain. 2. He is worthy to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. DOCT. <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Lamb that was ſlain.</hi> 1. He is the Lamb. 2. He was ſlain.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005685_0005_1026BF80D88C2E00"/>1. <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Lamb.</hi> He is ſuch by way of Eminency, The Lambs uſed in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Old, were but ſhadowy Emblems and Types of him, who is the Lamb of God. Here we may conſider, upon what Accounts Chriſt may be compared to a Lamb. I ſhall but juſt Hint at two or three Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Lord Jeſus may be compared to a Lamb <hi>for his Purity, Innocence and Uſefulneſs.</hi> The Lamb is a cleanly inoffenſive Creature, and ſo fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him who is <hi>holy, harmleſs and undefiled,</hi> Heb. 7.6. He was not ſhapen in Iniquity, as we were. No, the Child Jeſus was conceived in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, and conſequent upon this, it is ſaid to her, <hi>That holy Thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God,</hi> Luke 1.35. This Lamb was without Blemiſh in the perfect Rectitude of his Nature, and in his Life and Converſation. He did no Evil, nor was Guile found in his Mouth. And he is moſt uſeful and profitable to all that obtain an Intereſt in him: They have in him the choiceſt Food, of Virtue to nouriſh them to eternal Life; and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that excells the pureſt and fineſt Wool, the Robes of his perfect Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Lord Jeſus may be compar'd to a Lamb for his <hi>Meekneſs and Silence under Sufferings.</hi> The brute Creatures are not capable of moral Vertues, however there is ſuch a Reſemblance of theſe even in ſome of them, that God in his Word is pleaſed to make uſe of them in Compariſons. Mat, 10.16.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005685_0006_1026BF825E8C7710"/>
               <hi>Be ye therefore wiſe as Serpents, and harmleſs as Doves.</hi> Now the Lamb is a lively Emblem of Meekneſs; gentle, &amp; free from Fierceneſs, &amp; goeth to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without that Noiſe and Reſiſtance which ſome other Creatures make. Thus Jeſus under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt Sufferings, neither murmured againſt God, nor reviled Men; but ſilently and quietly bore that Puniſhment which was due to his People for their Iniquities, Iſai. 53.7. <hi>He is brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before her Shearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And it may be principally, <hi>becauſe he is the great Antitype, who was offered to God in Sacrifice once for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World,</hi> John 1.29. In this Alluſion there ſeems to be an eſpecial Reference to thoſe Sacrifices which were offered to God under the Levitical Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and did prefigure Jeſus Chriſt particularly, to the <hi>Lambs</hi> which were frequently offered to God as bloody Sacrifices. The daily Sacrifices offer'd Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, were <hi>two Lambs,</hi> Exod. 29. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. And the <hi>paſchal Lamb</hi> did in an eminent Manner typify Jeſus Chriſt our <hi>Paſſover,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was ſlain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Sacrifices under the Law were kill'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Blood, which is their Life, pour'd out at the Altar: So our Lord Jeſus was ſmitten with the Sword of Juſtice, and his Blood was ſhed on the Croſs, when he gave his Life a Ranſom for many. No leſs a Price than the Blood of him who is God,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005685_0007_1026BF8603AD8F10"/>
was ſufficient for the Redemption of his People, <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible Things, as Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold, from your vain Converſation received by Tradition from your Fathers; but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without Blemiſh and without Spot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. DOCT. <hi>The Lord Jeſus, the Lamb ſlain, is worthy to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. In what Reſpects, and upon what Accounts may our Lord be ſaid to be worthy of what is here aſcribed to him? 2. We may enumerate the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Particulars, and ſhew that our Lord is worthy of all and every one of them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>In what Reſpects, and upon what Accounts may our Lord be ſaid to be worthy of what is here aſcribed to him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in general, I may anſwer, He is worthy in a ſtrict and proper Senſe, upon account of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Dignity of his Perſon, as the Son of God; and upon account of the Merit of his Obedience as God-Man Mediator.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Our Lord Jeſus is worthy of this Aſcription of Praiſe <hi>upon account of the infinite Dignity of his Perſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he is the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in the ſacred Trinity, he is the Brightneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Glory, and is worthy to be glorified as God. The Name of God is in him, and he is one with the Father in the eſſential Perfections of the divine

And indeed this may be ſaid to be the Ground and Foundation of all; however the next Reaſon and Motive here ſeem to be his perfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience as Mediator, to which his divine Nature communicates infinite Worth and Value; ſo that he purchaſed the Church with his own Blood, a compleat Deliverance from all the Evil of Sin, and the full Enjoyment of God for ever in Heaven; which leads me to the ſecond Thing,</p>

Wherefore God hath alſo highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name: That at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow, of Things in Heaven, and Things in Earth, and Things under the Earth: And that every Tongue ſhould confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi> The Son of God may now, as the Head of the Church, challenge all Power, Riches and Glory; whatever is needful to perfect the Glory of his exalted State, and to put him into a Capacity to beſtow on his People all the Benefits of that eternal Redemption which he has purchaſed.

But we are now ſpeaking of his Power as God-Man Mediator. Now look upon him in this Character, and he receiveth his Power as a Gift from the Father. <hi>All Power is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. No mere Creature is worthy to receive univerſal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; to be King over all. But Jeſus is worthy to receive Power and Dominion over all Creatures, both in Heaven and Earth. And this mediatorial Kingdom is given him as a Reward of his infinite Condeſcention in his Humiliation, and with an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Regard to the Salvation of his People.—<hi>And ſet him at his own right Hand in the heavenly Places: Far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but alſo in that which to come: And hath put all Things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all Things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.20,—22. <hi>Angels,</hi> even the higheſt Order of them, Thrones and Dominions, are moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to him, and fulfill his Pleaſure; they are all <hi>miniſtring Sprits</hi> under him <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 1.14.</note>.

In a Word, He rules in the Midſt of his Enemies, and when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, makes them his willing People in the Day of his Power. He ſets up his ſpiritual Kingdom when and where he pleaſeth, giving his Covenant-People the Laws and Ordinances of his Houſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing the ſaving Bleſſings of this Kingdom on all his faithful People, who by his Word and Spirit are made willing to ſubmit to him as their Prince and Saviour. Yea, he has the lower Orders of Creatures put under him, the Beaſts of the Field, the Fowl of the Air, and the Fiſh of the Sea. And even the Winds and the Seas obey him. And this his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Kingdom muſt abide 'till all the glorious Ends of it are accomplished. <hi>He muſt reign till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.25. Even the laſt Enemy, Death, ſhall be deſtroy'd, when he ſhall appear in the great Day of Judgment to the Salvation of his People; and after the Work of that Day is done, conduct them to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory. Surely our Lord is then worthy to be praiſed as the moſt powerful, his Dominion ruleth over all, and he is every Way equal to this high Office. He is <hi>the blſſed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Lord Jeſus is worthy to receive <hi>Riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None may in this Reſpect be compar'd with him. The Riches of the whole World are his. Earthly Princes may have a Right to govern; but this doth
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005685_0012_1026BF925CFA3680"/>
not give them the Property and Poſſeſſion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of their Subjects. But now, the Lord Jeſus has the full Poſſeſſion of all Things in Heaven and Earth, of all Riches, whether temporal or ſpiritual. He is the high Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth. All Things are Chriſt's, and ſo his People have a Right to them according as he ſees them needful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them. <hi>Whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the World, or Life, or Death, or Things preſent, or Things to come, all are yours. And ye are Chriſts,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. All being in his Hand, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates Grace and Glory, and every good Thing to his People. Agreeably the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the <hi>Philippians, My God ſhall ſupply all your Need according to his Riches in Glory, by Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 4 c. 19. We read of Chriſt that <hi>he was rich,</hi> 2. Cor. 8.9. Indeed he became <hi>poor,</hi> had not where to lay his Head; but then this was that he might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe all Riches for his People; And now it has pleaſed the Father that <hi>in him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. As Mediator, our Lord inherits all Things. The <hi>Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulneſs thereof,</hi> Pſal. 24. And ſo is the Abundance of the Seas, and Treaſures hid in the Sand. And he gives theſe Things to whom he will, a large Portion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to the Men of this World. And tho' his Followers are not ſeldom of the poor of this World, yet we muſt remember, that the little they enjoy is better to them than the Abundance of many Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for their Saviour gives Meat to them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mindful of his Covenant; and beſtows infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly better Things, they are rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom. Which brings me to ſay, that all <hi>ſpiritual Riches,</hi> the Riches of Grace and Glory
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005685_0013_1026BF95D9862248"/>
are Chriſt's. And accordingly he invites them that are convinced of their ſpiritual Poverty, to come to him for <hi>Gold tried in the Fire, that they may be rich,</hi> Rev. 3.18. And promiſeth, that he will cauſe them that love him to <hi>inherit Subſtance,</hi> and that he will <hi>fill their Treaſures,</hi> Prov. 8.21. What an inexhauſtible Stock of Merit is laid up in him, in whom God declares his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, the many and great Tranſgreſſions of all true Believers! What inexhauſtible Stores of Grace are treaſur'd up in him, thro' whom God makes all Grace abound towards his People, and enricheth them with every good and perfect Gift! All the Riches of the Kingdom of Heaven are his. We read of the <hi>holy Jeruſalem,</hi> deſcending out of Heaven from God, that the City was pure Gold—the Foundation of the Wall garniſh'd with all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of precious Stones, the Gates twelve Pearls, the Street pure Gold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. What Riches are here ſhadow'd out to us by Metaphors taken from the moſt coſtly and precious Things of this Life? And if this hath a next Reference to a glorious Church State upon Earth, the Argument riſeth from the leſs to the greater. What an immenſe Treaſure is laid up for God's People in Heaven! Upon which they ſhall live moſt gloriouſly and happily, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of the Kingdom, and that for ever and ever. And yet all this is a purchaſed Poſſeſſion, bought with the Blood of Chriſt, and by him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtowed on them. <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the Kingdom.</hi> Well may the Riches of Chriſt be called <hi>unſearchable Riches;</hi> well may we aſcribe Praiſe to him as the moſt wealthy, who is appointed <hi>Heir of all Things,</hi> Eph. 5.8. Heb. 1.2.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Behold! a greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi> in Wiſdom. He who is the Lamb ſlain, is <hi>the only wiſe God,</hi> and none may be compar'd with him, in this Reſpect. <hi>In him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. He is the <hi>Wiſdom of God,</hi> Luke 11.49. Look upon him as the <hi>Creator</hi> of all Things, in Wiſdom has he made them all. And all created Wiſdom is as nothing compar'd with his, <hi>His Angels he chargeth with Folly,</hi> Job 4.18. Look upon him as the <hi>Ruler</hi> of all Things, his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom are every Way equal to the vaſt Extent of his Government. Our Lord is perfectly acquainted with all Things in Heaven and Earth, and need not, as earthly Princes, ſee with other Men's Eyes. Nor is it poſſible that he ſhould be chargeable with any Overſight in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government. His Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, and all Things are open before him. <hi>Hell is naked before him, and Deſtruction hath no Covering,</hi> Job 26.6. So that there is no Place in which his Enemies may hide themſelves from him; nor is there any Wiſdom or Counſel that can prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Our Lord bruiſeth the Serpent's Head, turns the Counſels of the moſt crafty <hi>Ahithophel's</hi> into Fooliſhneſs, and over-rules their deepeſt laid Plots to their own Confuſion, and the Advancement of his Kingdom. Well may our Lord ſay, as Prov. 8.14. <hi>Counſel is mine, and ſound Wiſdom: I am Underſtanding.</hi> And if you conſider him as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> of his People, God has in him abounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in all Wiſdom and Prudence. In the Contrivance and effecting our Redemption by Jeſus

Chriſt, we behold the manifold Wiſdom of God, and may well cry out, in the higheſt Admiration, as Rom. 11.33, 34. <hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! How unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out? For who hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counſeller?</hi> This great and moſt difficult Work was committed to Chriſt, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made the leaſt Miſtake in the Diſcharge of it: He acts in this moſt important affair for the higheſt and moſt worthy End, by the moſt ſuitable and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Means, and carries on the Work with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Wiſdom, thro' a thouſand oppoſing Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that ſo as to overcome them all. Surely that Prophecy was eminently fulfill'd in him, Iſai, 11.2, 3. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the Fear of the Lord: And ſhall make him of quick Underſtanding in the Fear of the Lord.</hi> His Name is juſtly called <hi>wonderful Counſeller.</hi> Indeed all Wiſdom is in him as Light in the Sun, and he hath in all Ages communicated it to his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as was neceſſary to make them wiſe to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; till the Day ſpring from on high viſited them in the Light of the glorious Goſpel.

The Son of God hath the infinite Power of the Godhead to uphold him; ſo that none can ſtay his Hand, or ſay unto him, What doeſt thou. He works, and none can hinder him. This mighty One holds all Events in his Hand, acting above ſecond Cauſes, or contrary to the ordinary Courſe of them, at his Pleaſure; ſo that <hi>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong, neither yet Bread to the Wiſe, nor yet Riches to Men of Underſtanding, nor yet Favour to Men of Skill, but Time and Chance happeneth to them all,</hi> Eccl. 9.11. All Creatures are as nothing when ſet in Oppoſition againſt him. We read, He ſhall feed his Flock like a Shepherd—, and then follows,

who hath meaſured the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand, who hath weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Balance?

What an Idea doth this give us of his vaſt Strength! Surely there can be no Reſtraint of the Lord to ſave by many, or by few, for all Nations are as nothing before him, as the Duſt of the Balance, of no Weight, and blown away with the leaſt Breath. The Kings of the Earth become weak as other Men, when ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their Subjects; but the Strength of Chriſt is in himſelf, infinite. He doth not make uſe of Inſtruments becauſe he ſtands in Need of them; but becauſe he would put Honour upon his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Our Lord is repreſented as coming from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> the Land of his Enemies, travelling in the Greatneſs of his Strength, his Garments ſtain'd with the Blood of his Enemies: And he ſays, <hi>I have trodden the Wine-preſs alone,</hi> I will tread them in mine Anger—<hi>Mine own Arm brought Salvation</hi>

If that Inquiry therefore be made, <hi>Who is this King of Glory?</hi> The Anſwer muſt be, <hi>The Lord ſtrong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle,</hi> Pſal. 24.8. The moſt powerful of our Lord's, and his Church's Enemies are as nothing in his Hand, he can deſtroy them with more Eaſe than we can move a Finger. <hi>Thy right Hand, O Lord, is become glorious in Power; thy right Hand, O Lord, hath daſhed in Pieces the Enemy,</hi> Exod. 15.6. Agreeably he is repreſented to <hi>John</hi> in the Context, v. 6. as having <hi>ſeven Horns,</hi> emblems of Strength, and that in Perfection. And then our Lord's Strength reacheth beyond all humane Force, to change and ſubdue the Hearts of Men. The moſt mighty <hi>Monarchs</hi> can command only the Obedience of the outward Man. But here's a King that ſets up his Kingdom in the Hearts of his Subjects. When he rides forth conquering and to conquer, the moſt ſtubborn and obſtinate Sinners fall down under him, and being renew'd by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, have his Laws written on their Hearts. Pſal. 45.3,—5. <hi>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O moſt Mighty: With thy Glory and thy Majeſty. And in thy Majeſty ride proſperouſly, becauſe of Truth and Meekneſs, and Righteouſneſs: And thy right Hand ſhall teach thee terrible Things.

            <p>I put theſe together. Our Lord deſerveth theſe upon the Account of his infinite Excellencies, and the Diſplay he has made of them in his wonderful Works, particularly this great Work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and may demand, as his Due, that Honour and Glory which are incommunicable to the higheſt Order of Creatures. When he is brought into the World, the Command is given, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1.6. And now, <hi>We ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of Death, crown'd with Glory and Honour,</hi> Heb. 2.9. Yea, made higher than the Heavens, c. 7. v. 26. And <hi>the Father judgeth no Man: But hath committed all Judgment to the Son: That all Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Father,</hi> John 5.22, 23. The Angels and glorified Spirits adore him, caſting down their Crowns before him. We need not here critically examine into the Diſtinction between Honour and Glory; they comprehend that glorious Dignity which our Lord is advanc'd to at the right Hand of God, and that high Eſteem and Devotion, together with all the Expreſſions of them, which he has in the heavenly World.

Matth. 10.37, 38. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more than me, is not worthy of me.

As in over-ruling the Views and Determinations of our honoured Fathers in the civil Government, and then in giving them ſuch remarkable Aſſiſtances in managing a Buſineſs in a Manner new, and attended with many Difficulties: In ſpiriting ſo many effective Men to offer themſelves ſpeedily as Voluntiers in this hazardous Enterprize: In the very uncommon Moderation of the Winter and Continuance of fair Weather, whereby a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opportunity was given of expediting this arduous Affair, in equipping Ships of War with Tranſports in a ſhort Time: In preſerving us from the Small-Pox, when awfully threatned near the Time of embarking: In giving ſuch a safe and proſperous Voyage: In ſending ſo ſeaſonably to our Help a Number of his Majeſty's Ships of War needful to prevent Succours going to the Enemy, and to defend us by Sea: In ordering the Weather ſo favourable for the Landing our Forces on the Enemy's Shore,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005685_0028_1026BFBAB256EEB0"/>
and for tranſporting our Artillery by Land: In the great Security in which our Enemies were ſurpriz'd by the formidable Approach of our Fleet, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den landing; and their conſequent contemptible Oppoſition, which rather turn'd to our Advantage, and againſt themſelves. Behold! they flee with Loſs, and intimidated precipitantly deſert their Grand Battery, and give it up to us; and thus ſome of their heavieſt Cannon are turn'd againſt themſelves: And in this Way did our good God encourage his People with the Joy of his Salvation, even upon their firſt Landing, an Earneſt of what he would further do for them. In delivering up ſome of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Ships into our Hands, eſpecially that large Ship of War ſo full of Men and Stores, that had ſhe forc'd her Way in the Fog, our Enterprize might have been defeated; but God forbid it.

In directing and helping our unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Soldiers ſo ſpeedily and dextrouſly to raiſe their Batteries againſt the Town, and Iſland Fort; and then to play their Cannon and Mortars with ſuch Skill and Succeſs that the Town is greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs'd, and the Iſland Battery ſoon made too hot for the Beſieged, they take to the Water for ſome Relief. And to crown all, in inclining the Enemy

to ſurrender the Day before a general Aſſault was to have been made by Land and Sea, which muſt in all Probability have coſt many precious Lives, and the Event have been doubtful. Whereas now, by the good Hand of God upon us, we have a City ſtrongly fortified by Nature and Art, deliver'd up without any great Effuſion of Blood, our own or our Enemies, which muſt have caſt a Damp even upon the Joy of Victory. Bleſſed be God the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of Men!
