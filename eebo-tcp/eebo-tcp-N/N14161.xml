            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>MATTHEW XXV. 31—46.</bibl>
                  <p>When the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory. And before him ſhall be gathered all nations: And he ſhall ſeperate them one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats. And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an-hungered and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me drink: I was a ſtranger and ye took me in: Nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ye cloathed me: I was ſick and ye viſited me: I was in priſon and ye came unto me. Then ſhall the righteous anſwer him, ſaying, Lord, when ſaw we thee an-hungered and fed thee? or thirsty and gave thee drink? When ſaw we thee a ſtranger and took thee in? or naked and cloathed thee? Or when ſaw we thee ſick or in priſon and came unto thee? And the King ſhall anſwer and ſay unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Then ſhall he ſay unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was an-hungered and ye gave no meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink: I was a ſtranger and ye took me not in: Naked and ye cloathed me not: Sick and in priſon and ye viſited me not. Then ſhall they alſo anſwer him, ſaying, Lord, when ſaw we thee an-hungered, or a thirst, or a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not minister unto thee? Then ſhall he anſwer them, ſaying, Verily I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of theſe, ye did it not to me. And theſe ſhall go away into everlasting puniſhment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p>

            <p>IT is the intention of this diſcourſe, to explain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the ſenſe of this paſſage of ſcripture. And ſince ſcripture is the beſt interpreter of itſelf, we ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017924_0003_0FA378AB461FFE40"/>
the various repreſentations in the text, with the general tenor of the ſacred oracles.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Our Lord here gives us a particular and lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the general judgment. "When the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he ſhall ſit upon the throne of his glory. And before him ſhall be gathered all nations, &amp;c." This deſcription of the great day reſembles that of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other inſpired writers. Enoch alſo, the ſeventh from Adam, propheſied of it, ſaying, "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his ſaints to execute judgment upon all." Solomon ſays, "God ſhall bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul declares that God hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead." We are told the fallen angels are "reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day." And the apoſtle John be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in viſion this great, and glorious, and ſolemn ſcene. "I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life: And the dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the books according to their works." Theſe declarations are too explicit to need any comment; they literally ſpeak the language of the text, and confirm the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation it gives of the general judgment: Which is alſo agreeable to the nature and apprehenſions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as well as the character of the Deity and the preſent diſpenſations of divine providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017924_0004_0FA378AC06278FC0"/>It is, in the firſt place, perfectly conſonant to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men as moral agents. They are endued with perception, reaſon, memory, conſcience, and all the powers and faculties which are requiſite to moral agency. And being moral agents, they are proper ſubjects of law and moral government. The Supreme Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will treat them but according to their nature, to call them to an account for all the deeds done in the body, and give them a juſt recompenſe of reward. Hence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man carries in the very frame and conſtitution of his nature an irreſiſtible evidence of a future judgment.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, this is agreeable to the natural appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of mankind. As they are ſenſible they lie open and naked to the view of the omniſcient God, ſo they naturally expect he will call them to an account for all the inward motions and exerciſes of their hearts as well as outward actions of their lives. The man who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues his hand in the blood of his fellow-creature, though concealed from every other eye but the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, has a ſecret fearful apprehenſion of the righteous judgment of God. And, though he is neither accuſed nor ſuſpected of his crime, yet his own conſcience binds him over to the judgment of the great day. This is the ſecret voice of nature, which has diſcovered itſelf on many occaſions. The Barbarians, when they ſaw the viper on Paul's hand, "Said among themſelves, no doubt this man is a murderer, whom though he hath eſcaped the ſea, yet vengeance ſuffereth <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to live." The mariners in the ſhip with Jonah, when they found themſelves in danger of periſhing by a mighty tempeſt, "Said, come let us caſt lots, that we may know for whoſe cauſe this evil is come upon us" And when Joſeph's brethren were thruſt into priſon, and ſubjected
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017924_0005_0FA378ACC4908C70"/>
to great and unexpected misfortunes, they immediately recollect their cruel and unnatural treatment of their brother, as the procuring cauſe of their preſent calamities. "They ſaid one to another, we are verily guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear: Therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us." All men thus feel the natural connection between moral evil and phy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſical, between ſinning and ſuffering, between guilt and puniſhment. Hence every man's conſcience preſages a future day of retribution, when he muſt give an account of himſelf to God, as the ſupreme and final Judge.</p>
            <p>And this is further confirmed by the rectitude of the divine character and government. Since the Author of Nature is infinitely holy, juſt and good, he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conduct agreeably to theſe divine attributes in the government of moral beings, and diſpenſe rewards and puniſhments according to their reſpective characters. The preſent ſtate of things, however, clearly evinces that the day of retribution is yet to come. Here, as Solomon obſerves, all things come alike to all, there is one event to the righteous and the wicked, and no man knoweth either love or hatred, by the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of divine providence towards him. But as things cannot always continue ſo under the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Being of perfect rectitude; ſo the preſent ſtate of the world is a clear demonſtration of a future general judgment, when the Supreme Being will review the conduct of all his intelligent creatures, and reward the righteous and puniſh the wicked according to their works.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Our Lord ſpeaks of one diſtinction in the characters
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017924_0006_0FA378AD86551BE8"/>
of men, which will abſorb all other diſtinctions, and divide the whole world into two claſſes at the laſt day. "Before him ſhall be gathered all nations: And he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats: And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come, ye bleſſed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> my Father, &amp;c.—For I was an-hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in: Naked and ye clothed me: I was ſick, and ye viſited me: I was in priſon, and ye came unto me. Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, &amp;c.—For I was an-hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ye took me not in: Naked, and ye clothed me not: ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not."</p>
            <p>In many reſpects the righteous and the wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble each other. They are often alike as to their natural powers and abilities. In this view, Abſalom, Joab and Ahitophel reſembled Moſes, David and Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. There is alſo a reſemblance in their natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and diſpoſitions. Abſalom and the young man in the goſpel, were perhaps, in this reſpect, as amiable as Moſes, or the beloved diſciple who leaned on Jeſus' breaſt. Theſe, and many other circumſtances which ariſe from birth, rank, fortune, religious denominations, &amp;c. are common both to the righteous and the wicked, and will not characteriſe mankind at the laſt day. But there is a difference in the HEARTS of men, which forms a capital diſtinction in their characters, and will finally place ſome on the right, and ſome on the left hand of their Judge. And this is the diſtinction, which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017924_0007_0FA378AE45725538"/>
our Lord here mentions and deſcribes. He repreſents the righteous as poſſeſſed of that divine love and charity, by which they ſought the glory of God and the good of their fellow creatures in all their actions. But he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the wicked as actuated by a low, mean, merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, contracted diſpoſition, which confined all their views and purſuits to their own good. Both theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are deſcribed by the apoſtle Paul. His diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of charity or divine love is in theſe words. "Though I ſpeak with the tongues of men and of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and have not charity, I am become as ſounding braſs, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it profiteth me nothing." So ſays our Lord in the text: But the deſcription continues. "Charity ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave itſelf unſeemly, <hi>ſeeketh not her own,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas the contrary diſpoſition, the apoſtle ſays, makes "men lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without natural affection, truce-breakers, falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſure, more than lovers of God." Heat and cold, light and darkneſs cannot be more diametrically oppoſite in their nature and effects, than theſe two diſpoſitions are. And ſince all mankind are governed by one or the other of theſe two principles of action, ſo there is an eſſential diſtinction in their characters, which juſtly denominates
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017924_0008_0FA378AF04BAC8F0"/>
them all either righteous or wicked. Accordingly we find the ſcripture every where takes notice of this capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſtinction in the characters of men, and marks it by ſuch diſcriminating epithets as theſe—the godly and the ungodly—the holy and the unholy—the juſt and the unjuſt—ſaints and ſinners—the friends of God and the enemies of God—the children of light and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkneſs—the children of God and the children of the devil.</p>
            <p>As this diſtinction is of great importance, and cloſely connected with the ſubject before us, we ſhall conſider it a little more particularly.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Being, in the courſe of providence, hath acknowledged and-paid a viſible regard to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between the righteous and the wicked. In deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing the character of Noah, he repreſents him as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially different from the reſt of mankind at that day. "God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt: For all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the earth:— And the Lord ſaid unto Noah, come thou, and all thy houſe into the ark: For thee have I ſeen <hi>righteous</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me in this generation." Here God diſtinguiſhed the <hi>righteous from the wicked,</hi> and, to exhibit a public and viſible regard to this diſtinction, he ſaved the righteous and deſtroyed the wicked.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe aſſerted and vindicated the diſtinguiſhing character of Job. "The Lord ſaid unto Satan, Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evil" The great accuſer of the brethren diſputed the truth of this divine declaration.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017924_0009_0FA378B024E41780"/>
"Then Satan anſwered the Lord, and ſaid, Doth Job fear God for nought? Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all he hath on every ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the work of his hands; and his ſubſtance is increaſed in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face." As if he had ſaid, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſingular in the character of Job. He conducts no otherwiſe than any other perſon would in the ſame ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let any other man receive equal tokens of thy love and favour, and he will make equal returns of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and obedience. Sinners love thoſe that love them. He is, like all other men, entirely governed by merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary motives. Therefore only touch his intereſt, and ſtrip him of thoſe peculiar favours thou haſt laviſhed upon him, and he will drop the maſk, diſcover his hypocriſy, and curſe thee to thy face. To wipe off theſe aſperſions from Job's character, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Satan that he acted from truly noble, diſintereſted motives, God gives him leave to try him with any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions or calamities ſhort of death. Satan with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure makes the experiment. He brings a train of evils upon Job in thick ſucceſſion. He ſtrips him of his wealth. He ſlays his ſervants. And to cloſe the ſcene, he rends from his heart, the dear objects of his affections, by the ſudden and ſurprizing death of his children. Thus he tumbles him, in a moment, from the ſummit of human glory into the depths of human woe. Here is a fair trial. And what is the effect? Does he curſe God as Satan predicted, and as an unholy, unſubmiſſive heart would naturally prompt him to do under ſuch a ſevere, corrective ſtroKe? Nothing more remote. "Then Job aroſe, and rent his mantle, and ſhaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worſhiped, and ſaid,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017924_0010_0FA378B08608A1C8"/>
Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked ſhall I return thither. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord." Here is, as far as can be, a viſible demonſtration of the eſſential difference between nature and grace, between a ſaint and a ſinner.</p>
            <p>On another very memorable occaſion, God explicitly acknowledged the reality and importance of this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He had reſolved to deſtroy Sodom. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to the execution of this deſign, he revealed his purpoſe to Abraham, who immediately breaks forth into the moſt fervent interceſſion for thoſe miſerable objects. And this is the language in which he addreſſes the Moſt High. "Wilt thou deſtroy the righteous with the wicked? That be far from thee to do, after this manner, to ſlay the righteous with the wicked: And that the righteous ſhould be as the wicked, that be far from thee, ſhall not the Judge of all the earth do right? God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly replies to this and his repeated importunity, that if he found fifty, or forty-five, or forty, or thirty, or twenty, or even ten righteous perſons in the city, he would ſpare the whole place for their ſakes. And when neither of theſe numbers could be found, he delivered juſt Lot, as a ſtanding monument that the Judge of all the earth would do right. Such are the public, viſible, ſtriking teſtimonies, which God himſelf hath borne to the diſtinction between the righteous and the wicked.</p>
            <p>David mentions and deſcribes this diſtinction almoſt in every pſalm. It may ſuffice to quote the firſt as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the reſt. "Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the council of the <hi>ungodly,</hi> nor ſtandeth in the way of <hi>ſinners,</hi> nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the <hi>ſcornful.</hi> But his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017924_0011_0FA378B1454D21C8"/>
delight is in the law of God; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he ſhall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in ſeaſon; his leaf alſo ſhall not wither, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth ſhall proſper. The <hi>ungodly are not ſo:</hi> but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Therefore the <hi>ungodly ſhall not ſtand in the judgment,</hi> nor <hi>ſinners</hi> in the congregation of the <hi>righteous:</hi> but the way of the <hi>ungodly ſhall periſh.</hi>" If it be ſaid, this pſalm refers to Chriſt, it is ſufficient to obſerve that there is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it from any deſcription of his perſon or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, nor from any part of it being applied to him in the new-teſtament.</p>
            <p>The book of Proverbs is, in a manner, one continued contraſt between the righteous and the wicked.</p>
            <p>The declarations of Chriſt on this head deſerve ſpecial attention and regard. His ſermon on the mount con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a beautiful deſcription of the diſcriminating charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the righteous. "Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit: For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Bleſſed are they that mourn: For they ſhall be comforted. Bleſſed are the meek: For they ſhall inherit the earth. Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs: For they ſhall be filled. Bleſſed are the merciful: For they ſhall obtain mercy. Bleſſed are the pure in heart: For they ſhall ſee God." That Chriſt here intends to diſtinguiſh ſaints from ſinners, in reſpect to the inward motions and affections of their <hi>hearts,</hi> is not only evident from the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription itſelf, but from the obſervation which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſubjoins. "For I ſay unto you, That except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017924_0012_0FA378B20668EE20"/>
kingdom of heaven." And in the concluſion of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he more particularly deſcribes the nature and eſſence of the diſtinction, which he had before been ſpeaking of. "Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy: But I ſay unto you, Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully uſe you, and perſecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt. For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the ſame? And if ye ſalute your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren only; what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans ſo? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Our Lord here repreſents the children of God as bearing his divine image, and poſſeſſing his divine ſpirit, which diſtinguiſhes them from the reſt of mankind who are utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſuch a holy and heavenly temper. And in his conference with Nicodemus, he points out the ſource from whence they derive this ſpecial grace, and who it is that makes them to differ. "Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God. That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh: and that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit: marvel not that I ſaid unto you, Ye muſt be born again."</p>
            <p>We have only to add the teſtimonies of the apoſtles to this important diſtinction. St. Paul declares, "If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his." Again, "If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature: Old things are paſſed away; behold, all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new." And he repreſents ſaints as diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017924_0013_0FA378B2C5430FA8"/>
not only from ſinners, but from themſelves whilſt in a ſtate of nature, by the ſpecial influences of the divine Spirit. "And you hath he <hi>quickened,</hi> who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, wherein in time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the children of diſobedience: Among whom we all had our converſation in times paſt; in the luſt of our fleſh, and of the mind: And were by nature the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, even as others." And in another place, after mentioning a catalogue of the blackeſt characters, he reminds the ſaints, "That ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God." The apoſtle John in the firſt chapter of his goſpel, ſays, "As many as received Chriſt, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God." And in the third chapter of his firſt epiſtle, he inſiſts on the ſame diſtinction as a matter of high importance. "Little children, let no man deceive you (by pretending there is no difference between ſaints and ſinners, for) he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous, even as he, that is Chriſt, is righteous: He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin is of the devil; for the devil ſinneth from the beginning. Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin; for his ſeed remaineth in him: And he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, becauſe he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the devil: Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that loveth not his brother." Thus the eſſential diſtinction between the righteous and the wicked appears to be perfectly conſonant to the whole tenor of the ſacred oracles.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017924_0014_0FA378B3861EB238"/>III. Chriſt further aſſerts that the righteous and the wicked ſhall be ſeperated from each other, and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively rewarded and puniſhed at the laſt day. "And he ſhall ſeperate them one from another, as ſhepherd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth his ſheep from the goats: And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand; Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." This repreſentation of the proceſs of the laſt day falls in with the natural apprehenſions of mankind. They naturally expect a future judgment, and they as naturally expect the judgment of God will be according to truth, and proceed upon the immutable principles of perfect rectitude.</p>
            <p>And we have ſufficient grounds to expect this, from many inſtances of the divine conduct. God ſeperated the fallen angels from the reſt of the heavenly hoſts, and doomed them to a ſtate of darkneſs and deſpair. He approved and preſerved Noah, whilſt he condemned and deſtroyed the ungodly world. He preſerved juſt Lot from the ruins of Sodom. And he diſtinguiſhed Moſes and Aaron, Caleb and Joſhua from that evil generation, who were doomed to fall in the wilderneſs. Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances preſage a more general and perfect diſplay of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributive juſtice at the laſt day. And in this light they are conſidered and improved by the inſpired writers of the new-teſtament. The apoſtle Peter urges them as inconteſtible proofs of future rewards and puniſhments. "For, ſays he, if God ſpared not the angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, and delivered them into
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017924_0015_0FA378B4462038D8"/>
chains of darkneſs, to be reſerved unto judgment; and ſpared not the old world, but ſaved Noah the eighth perſon, a preacher of righteouſneſs, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into aſhes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an <hi>enſample</hi> unto thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly; and delivered juſt Lot, vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked: —The Lord knoweth how to deliver the <hi>godly</hi> out of temptations, and to reſerve the <hi>unjuſt unto the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be puniſhed.</hi>" And the apoſtle Paul reaſons in the ſame manner upon the divine conduct towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted Iſraelites. "But with many of them God was not well pleaſed; for they were overthrown in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Now all theſe things happened unto them for <hi>enſamples</hi>; and they are written for <hi>our admonition,</hi> upon whom the ends of the world are come." Theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces leave us no room to doubt, that God will finally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe rewards and puniſhments to all mankind with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rectitude and impartiality.</p>
            <p>Nor is this leſs evident from the whole tenor and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> which ſets the rewards of the righteous, and puniſhments of the wicked after death, in the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt light. The goſpel not only proclaims di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy to all penitent and believing ſinners, but on the contrary, denounces inevitable deſtruction to all who finally reject the offers of life. Accordingly our Lord, when he ſent forth his apoſtles to preach the goſpel, gave them ſpecial charge to proclaim its ſolemn ſanctions as well as its gracious propoſals. "And he called unto him the twelve, and began to ſend them forth by two and two.—And he ſaid unto them, In what place ſoever ye enter into an houſe, there abide till ye depart from
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017924_0016_0FA378B51642F980"/>
that place. And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, ſhake off the duſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your feet, for a teſtimony againſt them. Verily, I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah, <hi>in the day of judgment,</hi> than for that city." After Chriſt's reſurrection, and juſt before his aſcention into heaven, he gave a commiſſion to his apoſtles, and to all their ſucceſſors in the miniſtry, to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel wherever divine providence ſhould call them. And their commiſſion runs in this ſolemn form. "Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature: He that believeth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned." Here is the very genius and ſpirit of that goſpel, which is to be unfolded and inculcated by all the miniſters of Chriſt in every age of the church. And according to this ſummary of the goſpel, future rewards and puniſhments appear to be not only conſiſtent with the goſpel, but an eſſential part of it. Indeed the goſpel gives as full aſſurance of the deſtruction of unbelievers, as of the ſalvation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and as infallibly fixes the certainty of future puniſhments as of future rewards.</p>
            <p>This truth evidently runs through the whole frame and contexture of the goſpel, and is interwoven with all its peculiar and leading ſentiments. We might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the doctrine of election, divine ſovereignty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, &amp;c. But we ſhall only mention the terms of ſalvation, which are the cardinal precepts of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Repentance is one of theſe. It is much inſiſted on both in the old teſtament and new. Solomon ſays, "He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper: But whoſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017924_0017_0FA378B6346AD2C0"/>
and forſaketh them, ſhall have mercy." David tells us, "The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit: A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe." Chriſt alſo declares, "He came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance. And he expreſly told ſinners, on a certain occaſion, "Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh."</p>
            <p>Faith in the Mediator is a term of the divine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. "He that believeth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaved: But he that believeth not ſhall be damned."</p>
            <p>Love to Chriſt is a condition of divine approbation at the laſt day. "If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathama maranatha." That is to ſay, let him be accurſed when the Lord cometh to judgment.</p>
            <p>A forgiving ſpirit is likewiſe neceſſary in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain divine forgiveneſs. "When ye ſtand praying for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give if ye have ought againſt any: That your Father alſo, which is in heaven, may forgive your treſpaſſes. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your treſpaſſes."</p>
            <p>And it is equally neceſſary to perſevere in all chriſtian graces and duties, in order to receive the end of our faith, even the ſalvation of our ſouls. "Now the juſt ſhall live by faith: But if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him. But we are not of thoſe who draw back unto perdition: But of them that believe to the ſaving of their ſouls." Theſe terms of ſalvation ſpeak for themſelves. If they have any meaning, they muſt mean that thoſe who comply with them ſhall be ſaved; but thoſe who reject them ſhall be loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:017924_0018_0FA378B685F6B008"/>The doctrine of future rewards and puniſhments may receive additional proof from many expreſs declarations of ſcripture. To recite every paſſage in favour of this truth, would be to tranſcribe a great part of the bible. We ſhall therefore only mention a few which are the moſt plain, and pertinent to our ſubject. We read in the ninth pſalm, "The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God." There was a ſet of men, in the days of Malachi, who ridiculed all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental religion and vital piety. They ſaid it was a vain thing to ſerve God, to walk mournfully before him, or to keep his ordinances. They called the proud hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and applauded the workers of iniquity. In contraſt with ſuch perſons, the prophet points the characters and future proſpects of the righteous in the moſt lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. "Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>her; and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord and thought upon his name. And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, in the day when I make up my jewels; and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him. Then ſhall ye return, and diſcern between the righteous and the wicked; between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not."</p>
            <p>The apoſtle Paul ſpeaks equally plain and determinate on this head, in the ſecond chapter of Romans. "But we are ſure the judgment of God is according to truth, againſt them that commit ſuch things. And thinkeſt thou, O man, that judgeſt thoſe that do ſuch things and doeſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgment of God? Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long ſuffering; not knowing that the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017924_0019_0FA378B747BAD220"/>
goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up to thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wrath, againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who ſhall render to every man according to his deeds: To them, who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, and honor, and immortality; eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every <hi>ſoul</hi> of man (not ſin of man, but <hi>ſoul</hi> of man) that doth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile."</p>
            <p>To theſe may be added the declarations of Chriſt. "Wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." "Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name? And in thy name caſt out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you: Depart from me, <hi>ye that work iniquity.</hi>" "Fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul: But rather fear him, which is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell."</p>
            <p>To enforce theſe ſolemn warnings, our compaſſionate Redeemer, as it were, ſets before our eyes the certainty and danger of future puniſhments, by a number of well-choſen and ſtriking parables. To this end he ſpoke the parable of the vineyard—of the ſower—of the rich fool
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017924_0020_0FA378B8064BC930"/>
—of the marriage ſupper—of the ten virgins—of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents—of the tares—and of the rich man and Lazarus. Each of theſe parables would greatly ſerve to illuſtrate the ſubject before us, but eſpecially the two laſt; which, therefore, we beg leave to recite at large. The parable of the tares is in the thirteenth of Matthew. "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which ſowed good ſeed in his field: But while men ſlept, his enemy came and ſowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was ſprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares alſo. So the ſervants of the houſholder came, and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt not thou ſow good ſeed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? He ſaid unto them, an enemy hath done this. The ſervants ſaid unto him, Wilt thou that we go and gather them up? But he ſaid, nay; leſt while ye ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harveſt: And in the time of harveſt, I will ſay unto the reapers, Gather ye together firſt the tares, and bind them in bundles, to burn them: But gather the wheat into my barn." Our Lord's expoſition of his own parable ſuperſedes any other comment. It is this. "He that ſoweth the good ſeed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good ſeed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one: The enemy that ſowed them is the devil; the harveſt is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire; ſo ſhall it be in the end of the world. The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and <hi>them which</hi> do iniquity: And ſhall caſt <hi>them</hi> (not their <hi>ſins,</hi> but them perſonally) into a furnace of fire: There ſhall be weeping and knaſhing
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017924_0021_0FA378B8C6137350"/>
of teeth. Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth in the kingdom of their Father."</p>
            <p>The parable of the rich man and Lazarus, in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Luke, gives us a ſtill more viſible and affecting repreſentation of the miſeries of the damned. "There was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day. And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of ſores; and deſiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: Moreover the dogs came and licked his ſores. And it came to paſs that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's boſom. The rich man alſo died, and was buried: And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſeeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his boſom. And he cried and ſaid, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and ſend Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue: For I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham ſaid, Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe Lazarus evil things: But now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And beſides all this, between us and you there is a great gulph fixed: So that they which would paſs from hence to you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence. Then he ſaid, I pray thee therefore that thou wouldeſt ſend him to my father's houſe; for I have five brethren, that he may teſtify unto them, leſt they alſo come into this place of torment. Abraham ſaith unto him, They have Moſes and the prophets: Let them hear them. And he ſaid, nay, Father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he ſaid unto him, if they hear not Moſes and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017924_0022_0FA378B986373F60"/>
neither will they be perſuaded though one riſe from the dead." Nothing ſhort of dreadful experience can give us clearer evidence of future torments than this parable; nor afford a better comment upon our Lord's repreſentation of the final ſeperation between the righteous and the wicked, and their reſpective rewards and puniſhments at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more contained in the text, which deſerves particular notice, and that is,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The endleſs duration of future rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. "Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And theſe ſhall go away into <hi>everlaſting</hi> puniſhment: But the righteous into life <hi>eternal.</hi>" This is the general voice of ſcripture. The prophet Daniel ſays, "Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to <hi>everlaſting</hi> life, and ſome to ſhame, and <hi>everlaſting</hi> contempt." The apoſtle Paul aſſerts, that "the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Who ſhall be puniſhed with <hi>everlaſting</hi> deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." In Rev. 20th, 3d, the apoſtle John tells us, "He ſaw Satan caſt into the <hi>bottomleſs</hi> pit." This epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet, which we meet with no leſs than ſix times beſides in this book. expreſſes in the ſtrongeſt manner the never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ending miſeries of the wicked, the ſmoke of whoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is repeatedly ſaid to aſcend forever and ever. Our Lord once before aſſerted the eternity of future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments as clearly as he does in the text. "If thy hand offend thee cut it off: It is better for thee to enter

into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never ſhall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: It is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be caſt into hell, into the fire that never ſhall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: It is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be caſt into hell-fire: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." In this laſt paſſage the eternity of hell-torments is expreſſed in terms which admit of no evaſion. Our Lord's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here turns upon the infinite diſparity between tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal pains. Duration is the only point to be illuſtrated. And finite is here ſet in contraſt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite duration. And this infinite duration is expreſſed by a variety of epithets, which are, of all others, the moſt plain, determinate and unexceptionable.</p>
            <p>As to the words—eternal—everlaſting—forever and ever—they generally ſignify a duration which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely boundleſs, and are to be taken ſo here, unleſs there be ſome ſpecial reaſon for reſtricting them to a limited duration. When they are applied to ſubjects which are in their <hi>own nature temporary</hi>; this naturally leads us to underſtand them in a limited and reſtricted ſenſe. But when they are applied to the ſouls of men which are immortal, the ſubject allows us to interpret them in their moſt common and extenſive meaning. The ſouls of the wicked may exiſt as long as the ſouls of the righteous, and therefore the miſeries of the former may run paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with the happineſs of the latter. And this is aſſerted in the text. The ſame word in the original is uſed to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017924_0024_0FA378BB05B793C8"/>
expreſs the duration of future puniſhments, which is uſed to expreſs the duration of future rewards. "And theſe ſhall go away into <hi>everlaſting</hi> puniſhment: But the righteous into life <hi>eternal.</hi>" The Greek word here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered eternal and everlaſting, is rendered ſo fifty-ſeven times in the new-teſtament; and there are but two places in the new-teſtament, where the word eternal or everlaſting comes from any other Greek word. The ſame Greek word is likewiſe uſed both in the old and new teſtament, to ſignify the eternity of the divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Gen. 22, 23. Iſaiah 40, 28, and 26, 4, and 57, 15. Pſalm 41, 13. and 90, 2, and 93.2, and 106, 48. Daniel 12, 7. Rom. 16 26. 1 Tim. 1, 17.</note> And the Earl of Nottingham hath ſhown, that this Greek word ſignifies eternity in the writings of Plato, Ariſtotle, Plutarch, and the beſt Greek authors, and that they have no better word in their language, by which to expreſs a proper eternity or endleſs duration.<note n="†" place="bottom">See his criticiſms on thoſe words in his anſwer to Mr. Whiſton, Ed. 9. p. 36, 37, 38.</note> Indeed Dr. Hartley, who maintains that the miſeries of the damned will finally ceaſe, allows that the ſcripture expreſſions concerning the eternity of hell-torments are ſufficiently plain and determinate, and would eſtabliſh the point if any mere expreſſions could poſſibly do it, which, however he abſolutely denies. And though Mr. Seigvolk and others ſay, the Greek words which the inſpired writers here made uſe of to expreſs the eternity of future puniſhments, only ſignify <hi>an age, or ages, or ages of ages, or periodical eternities of</hi> 50, 100, 1000, 2000 <hi>years continuance,</hi> yet they do not tell us what other words could have been uſed to expreſs an abſolute eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with more certainty and preciſion, or more to their ſatisfaction. According to their criticiſms, if the inſpired
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017924_0025_0FA378BC2634B360"/>
writers had really intended to aſſert the endleſs duration of future puniſhments, they could not have done it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no word in any language, which primarily ſignifies an abſolute eternity. But theſe and all other critics, however, are obliged to own, that the inſpired writers have uſed ſuch expreſſions as <hi>ſometimes ſignify eternity,</hi> and acknowledge that the ſenſe of ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ought to be determined by the nature of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to which they applied, and the connection in which they are uſed. Hence there appears no force in the criticiſms which have been made upon the words, by which the eternity of future puniſhments is expreſſed in the ſacred oracles. So far as words, or mere expreſſions can determine the matter, it is abſolutely certain, that both the miſeries of the wicked, and the happineſs of the righteous will run parallel with the interminable ages of eternity.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any thing in ſcripture or reaſon to take off the force of theſe expreſſions, or lead us to imagine the wicked will ever be releaſed from puniſhment and reſtored to the divine favour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have no reaſon to think ſo from the nature of ſin. All allow that ſin and guilt are inſeperably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and therefore that every ſin deſerves <hi>ſome</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But many imagine, that no tranſient, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary act of a finite creature can contain ſuch malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and guilt, as to deſerve an <hi>eternal</hi> puniſhment; and therefore that the damned muſt finally be releaſed from puniſhment, upon the foot of equity, having paid the uttermoſt farthing which they owed to divine juſtice. And if their guilt ſhall ever ceaſe, we may be aſſured their puniſhment will alſo ceaſe, for the Judge of all the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017924_0026_0FA378BC8A2A91D0"/>
earth will do right, and puniſh them no longer than they deſerve. But who, in the whole circle of the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent creation, can tell us when their guilt, or deſert of puniſhment will ceaſe? <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi> are inſeperably connected. <hi>Guilt</hi> can no more be ſeperated from ſin than <hi>criminality.</hi> There is no ſin without criminality, and no criminality without guilt, or deſert of puniſhment. Therefore both the criminality and guilt of a crime muſt continue as long as the crime continues, or till it ceaſes to be a crime and becomes an innocent action. But can murder, for inſtance, which is a crime in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, ever become a virtue? Can time, or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or ſufferings, or even a divine declaration, alter its nature, and render it an innocent action? Virtue and vice, ſin and holineſs are founded in the nature of things, and ſo muſt forever remain immutable. Hence that which was once virtuous, will forever be virtuous; that which was once vicious, will forever be vicious; that which was once praiſe-worthy, will forever be praiſe-worthy; that which was once blame-worthy, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be blame-worthy; and that which once deſerved puniſhment, will forever deſerve puniſhment. Now if neither the nature of ſin can be changed, nor the guilt of it taken away, then the damned, who have once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment, will forever deſerve it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently God may, in point of juſtice, puniſh them to all eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no ground to expect that the puniſhments of the damned will ever ſoften and purify their hearts, and ſo prepare them, in ſome diſtant period, to exchange the regions of darkneſs for the manſions of bliſs. Among others Dr. Hartley and Chevalier Ramſay build their ſtrongeſt hopes of the final reſtitution of all lapſed beings
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017924_0027_0FA378BD45703258"/>
to the divine favor, upon this foundation. They ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the puniſhments of the wicked will naturally ſoften and meliorate their hearts, and finally qualify them for the ſociety and enjoyments of the bleſſed. They ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God's ultimate view in puniſhing the wicked after death is to reclaim them, and bring them to good. They look upon ſuch perſons as die in impenitence and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as peculiarly <hi>perverſe</hi> and <hi>obaurate,</hi> whom none of the mild methods of providence and grace could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſubdue and reclaim in this life, and therefore God is reduced to the diſagreeable neceſſity of purging and purifying them by the harſh and ſevere means of hell-torments. They imagine God conſtantly deſires and uniformly purſues the happineſs of every individual of the human race, and will bring them all to pure and permanent felicity as ſoon as he can poſſibly do it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>their moral freedom</hi> and <hi>inveterate habits</hi> of ſin. And "as God cannot be eternally fruſtrated in his deſigns; as finite impotence, folly and malice cannot forever ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount infinite power, wiſdom and goodneſs; as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Lamb ſlain cannot be forever void and of no effect; reprobate ſouls and angels cannot be forever unconvertible, nor God unappeaſeable, nor moral and phyſical evil undeſtructible. Wherefore infernal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments muſt at laſt ceaſe, and all lapſed beings be at length pardoned and re-eſtabliſhed in a permanent ſtate of happineſs and glory, never more to fall again. This is the end and conſummation of all things, and the deſigns of all God's promiſes and puniſhments."</p>
            <p>But is there any thing in divine revelation to ſupport this hypotheſis? That God viſits the righteous, in this life, with pains, trials and afflictions for their <hi>ſpiritual benefit,</hi> he hath expreſly told us, and they have ſound
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017924_0028_0FA378BE0616D298"/>
to be true by happy experience. "My ſon, deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked of him. For whom the Lord loveth he chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, we have had fathers of our fleſh, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not much rather be in ſubjection unto the father of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and live? For they verily for a few days chaſtened us after their own pleaſure; but he for our <hi>profit,</hi> that we might be partakers of <hi>his holineſs.</hi>" And David grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledges that he derived real benefit from the divine corrections. "Before I was afflicted, I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray; but now have I kept thy word. I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and thou in faithfulneſs hath corrected me." Thus God lets his children know the ſalutary nature of his fatherly chaſtiſements. But where do we find the leaſt intimation in ſcripture, that God intends to puniſh the wicked in a future ſtate, for their <hi>benefit,</hi> as he here corrects his children for their ſpiritual good: Hath he not, on the contrary expreſly aſſured the wicked, that he intends to puniſh them, after death, not to <hi>ſave,</hi> but <hi>deſtroy</hi> them, not to expreſs his love towards them, but his indignation and wrath? This is the plain import of the ſentence to be denounced againſt them at the laſt day. "Depart from me ye <hi>curſed,</hi> into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels." "Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, ſaith the Lord." "If I whet my glittering ſword, and mine hand take hold of judgment; I will render <hi>vengeance</hi> to mine <hi>enemies,</hi> and will reward them that <hi>hate</hi> me." "What if God, <hi>willing to ſhew his wrath,</hi> and make his power known, endured with much long ſuffering the <hi>veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction.</hi>" Here the wicked after death are repreſented as the <hi>enemies</hi> of God, and as the objects
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017924_0029_0FA378BEC63850D0"/>
of his wrath; and he is repreſented as puniſhing them to <hi>reward</hi> them for their wickedneſs, and to expreſs his wrath and diſpleaſure towards them, without the leaſt regard to their amendment and benefit. But if future puniſhments were intended as fatherly chaſtiſements to purify the wicked, and qualify them for the eternal joys of heaven, why are they then repreſented as expreſſive of divine wrath, indignation and vengeance, inſtead of the tender mercy of God towards his offending but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved offspring? The truth is, theſe expreſſions put it beyond doubt, that God has diametrically oppoſite ends in chaſtiſing the righteous in this life, and puniſhing the wicked in the next. And we may be aſſured God can and will make his own <hi>means</hi> anſwer his own <hi>ends.</hi> As he deſigns future puniſhments ſhall not <hi>ſoften,</hi> but <hi>harden,</hi> ſhall not <hi>ſave</hi> but <hi>deſtroy</hi> the wicked; ſo they will even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually have this, and no other effect upon them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, we find this confirmed by the moſt inconteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible evidence. A puniſhment of near ſix thouſand years continuance hath hitherto, in no meaſure, ſubdued or ſoftened the heart of Satan, who ſtill remains an avowed and malignant enemy to God and man. The ſignal plagues ſent in rapid ſucceſſion on Pharaoh, inſtead of ſoftening, <hi>hardened</hi> his ſtubborn heart, and made him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fold more a veſſel of wrath fitted to deſtruction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divine <hi>purpoſe</hi> and <hi>prediction</hi> concerning him. And the tremendous judgments which fell on the ſubjects of Satan's kingdom, at ſhe pouring out of the ſixth vial had the ſame <hi>hardening</hi> effect and impreſſion on their impenitent hearts. "The fifth angel poured out his vial upon the ſeat of the beaſt: And his kingdom was full of darkneſs, and they knawed their tongues for pain, and blaſphemed the God of heaven, becauſe of their pains and their ſores, and <hi>repented not of their deeds.</hi>"
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017924_0030_0FA378BF860E2008"/>
Hence we are to conclude that the vials of divine wrath to be poured on the enemies of Chriſt at the laſt day, inſtead of ſoftening and meliorating their hearts, will only ſerve to confirm and increaſe their malignant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, to render them more odious to God, and more unmeet for the ſociety and enjoyments of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: And being thus eternally unqualified for heaven, they will never find admiſſion into thoſe realms of love and unpolluted bliſs. Beſides,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no intimation in the word of God, that thoſe who are once ſeperated from the righteous at the laſt day, ſhall ever be united to them again. Our text and many other paſſages of ſcripture clearly aſcertain the time, manner and reaſon of the ſeperation between the righteous and the wicked, but there is not a text to be found, which intimates when, how, or for what reaſon they ſhall be re-united. Every repreſentation of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral judgment naturally leads us to ſuppoſe, that God will then finally ſettle all the affairs of mankind, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverſably fix their characters and conditions for eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Accordingly none of the moſt able writers, that we have met with, in favour of the final happineſs of all lapſed beings, have preſumed to tell us <hi>when</hi> this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant event ſhall take place, or the miſeries of the damned ſhall ceaſe. But if God intended to releaſe them, one would imagine, that he would have made it known in his word, and relieved them from that intolerable deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, to which they may now be liable for ages of ages. Why ſhould be ſo particularly fix, and reveal, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the day when their puniſhments ſhall commence, but never give the leaſt hint concerning the time and circumſtances of their releaſe? Is not this bare ſilence a ſtrong preſumption that they ſhall never be releaſed, and a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017924_0031_0FA378C04615F3F0"/>
full demonſtration that no man can <hi>prove</hi> that they ever will?</p>
            <p>N. B. This Diſcourſe may be divided here.</p>
            <p>NOW if the above obſervations have fully eſtabliſhed the eternity of future puniſhments, then we are obliged to believe the doctrine, whether we can anſwer all the objections made againſt it, or not. It would be very abſurd for a man to deny his own exiſtence, the exiſtence of his fellow creatures, and the earth's annual productions of herbs, fruits and flowers, becauſe, after all his philoſophical reſearches, he is unable to inveſtigate the <hi>mode</hi> of the divine operation in creation and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And it is equally a ſurd to diſbelieve the being of God, the inſpiration of the ſcriptures, or the <hi>eternity</hi> of future puniſhments, becauſe there may be ſome things connected with theſe ſubjects, which lie beyond the ſphere of human comprehenſion. It is not the intention of theſe obſervations, however, to preclude an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any objections that may be urged againſt the eternity of hell-torments, or any other doctrine of the goſpel; or to inſinuate that we are bound to believe real contradictions and abſurdities; but only to prepare the mind to look at the difficulties which we propoſe to conſider, with candour and impartiality; and lead us to reſt our faith upon the firm foundation of real evidence.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that
<q>by the ſeperation between the ſheep and the goats in the text, is not to be underſtood a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration between ſaints and ſinners, but only a ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between <hi>ſin</hi> and the <hi>ſinner.</hi> The <hi>ſins</hi> of men ſhall be ſeperated from their <hi>perſons,</hi> and their perſons ſhall be ſaved, whilſt their ſins, and the father of them, the

devil ſhall be deſtroyed.<note n="*" place="bottom">See a late catechiſm, which, <hi>perhaps injuriouſly,</hi> claims the merit of a <hi>female</hi> production.</note> This our Lord teacheth in the parable of the tares, and the apoſtle Paul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth to be true, when he ſays, ſpeaking of his own <hi>evil</hi> conduct, <hi>It is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, it is eaſy to obſerve, that though a ſinner may become a ſaint, and a ſaint may become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy, or free from all in-dwelling ſin and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet the relation between him and his paſt ſins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſſolved. It will, for inſtance, forever remain true, that the apoſtle Paul perſecuted the church of Chriſt, and that ſin will always be his. He hath never ſinned ſince he arrived to heaven, and never will ſin again, yet the connection between him and his paſt ſins will forever remain and be <hi>felt,</hi> ſo as to enhance his own happineſs, and diſplay the riches of divine grace towards him. The notion therefore that ſin can be perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected from the ſinner, that it can be burnt up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or annihilated is a groſs abſurdity.</p>
            <p>Beſides our Lord tells us in plain terms, that by ſheep and goats, he means <hi>all nations.</hi> And he uſes theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors in the ſame ſenſe in which other inſpired writers uſe them. Sheep ſignify <hi>good</hi> men, and goats <hi>bad,</hi> in many other places of ſcripture. <note n="†" place="bottom">John 10, 15, 26, 27, 28, 29. Dan. 8. Zach. 10, 3.</note> But if any one would <hi>feel</hi> the abſurdity of ſuppoſing that goats repreſent <hi>ſins,</hi> let him only read the text according to this conſtruction. "Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto <hi>them</hi> on his left hand, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, ye curſed <hi>ſins,</hi> into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the devil and his angels.

            <p>It is objected farther, that
<q>Chriſt as mediator was ſo united to mankind, that his actions were theirs, his obedience theirs, and his ſufferings theirs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he hath as fully reſtored the whole human race to the divine favour, as if they had all obeyed and ſuffered in their own perſons. The divine law now hath no demands upon them, nor condemning power over them. Their ſalvation ſolely depends upon their union to Chriſt, which God conſtituted and eſtabliſhed before the world began. And by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that union, they will all be admitted to heaven, at the laſt day, and not one of Chriſt's members, not one of Adam's race will be finally loſt.</q>
Mr. Relly ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Treatiſe on union. Boſton Ed. p. 22.</note>

            <p>This is the corner ſtone, this is the ſole foundation which ſupports the ſcheme of <hi>univerſal</hi> ſalvation as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Mr. Relly, Mr. Murray, and their followers. If this ſhould give way, their whole fabric falls to the ground, and their hopes periſh. We ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this point with particular attention.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe that mankind were "with Chriſt through all the circumſtances of his birth, life, death, reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glory," is repugnant to the plaineſt dictates of common ſenſe. Chriſt was born of the virgin Mary; was circumciſed the eighth day; was, at thirty years old, baptized of John in Jordan; was, after this, led into the wilderneſs, where he faſted forty days and forty nights, and baffled all the devices of Satan; and being thus prepared, he went forth preaching the goſpel, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick, caſting out devils and raiſing the dead; till finally, he was betrayed by Judas, condemned by Pilate, crucified between two malefactors, buried by Joſeph of Arimathea, and after lying three days and three nights in the grave, he aroſe from the dead, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up into heaven, and ſet down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high. Were any, much leſs, the whole human race with Chriſt in all theſe circumſtances of his birth, life, death, reſurrection and glory? Where is the man who is conſcious of being, acting, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with Chriſt in any of theſe extraordinary and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017924_0035_0FA378C3470ED2E0"/>
ſcenes? But had there been ſuch an union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and mankind, that his obedience was theirs, his ſufferings theirs, and his glory theirs, they muſt all, in every age of the world, be conſcious of having the ſame motives, the ſame affections, the ſame ſorrows, and the ſame joys that he had; and of doing the ſame miraculous actions that he did. But what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord had Chriſt with Belial? What union of heart with an ungodly world? Was he not pure, and harmleſs, and <hi>ſeperate</hi> from ſinners, through the whole courſe of his life and conduct upon earth?</p>
            <p>It may, perhaps, be ſaid that this is an unfair repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the matter, and that by "Chriſt's being in mankind, and they being in him," is only intended, that according to a certain divine conſtitution, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what Chriſt did and ſuffered as being done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by mankind perſonally. The anſwer to this is obvious. No divine conſtitution or appointment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, could make Chriſt's perſonal obedience and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ours. A divine conſtitution cannot alter the nature of things, nor effect impoſſibilities. Can we conceive that it is now in the power of the Supreme Being, by a new, poſitive conſtitution, to make Chriſt the betrayer of Judas, the crucifier of his crucifiers, and the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator of all the ſin and wickedneſs of the whole human race? But it is no more impoſſible for God to do this now, than it was from eternity, to make a conſtitution, by which, not only the actions of Chriſt and of Judas, but the actions of Chriſt and of all mankind ſhould be the ſame. The ſuppoſition of a divine conſtitution relieves no difficulty here. The notion that all mankind were "with Chriſt through all the circumſtances of his birth, life, death, reſurrection and glory," is as abſurd as the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017924_0036_0FA378C4050B07E8"/>
doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, of which no man can form an idea.</p>
            <p>And beſides all this, it is entirely unſcriptural. It is not to be found among any of the unions which are mentioned in the bible. We there find indeed the union between the human and divine natures in the perſon of the Mediator. Chriſt often aſſerted both his humanity and divinity. He proclaimed himſelf not only the Son of Man, but the Son of God; and profeſſed to be not only David's Son, but David's Lord. Accordingly, the Jews, who underſtood the true import of ſuch phraſes, conſidered him as aſſuming divinity and equality with God the Father; for which they accuſed him of the crime of blaſphemy. And our Lord, to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, never denied, but maintained his claim to the laſt; which claim was founded upon the union between his human and divine nature. Hence the apoſtle John tells us, "The word was made fleſh and dwelt amongſt us." And we read, "Great is the myſtery of godlineſs; God manifeſt in the fleſh." Such an union of the two natures in the perſon of Chriſt, was neceſſary to qualify him for the work of redemption. For the divine nature ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately conſidered, could neither ſuffer, nor obey; and the human nature ſeperate from the divine, could not atone by obedience and death; but both theſe natures being united in the perſon of Chriſt compleatly qualified him for the mediatorial work. Beſides, this union was alſo requiſite in order to point out the objects for whom he made atonement. He would appear to die for thoſe, in whoſe nature he died. Had he took upon him the nature of angels, and died in their nature, this would have proclaimed him the Mediator betweeen God and <hi>them.</hi> But inaſmuch as he did not take upon him the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017924_0037_0FA378C4C55A1248"/>
nature of angels, but that of the ſeed of Abraham, this proclaimed him the Mediator between God and <hi>man.</hi> Now if Mr. Relly had only aſſerted the neceſſity of ſuch an union as this, in order to render the ſufferings of Chriſt in the room of mankind, conſiſtent with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attributes, we ſhould have had no diſpoſition to diſſent from him. For we grant it would have been inconſiſtent with the divine truth, juſtice, mercy, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and love, to have ſubjected Chriſt to thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which he endured in the room of ſinners, had he not been united to human nature, and ſo become the Mediator between God and man. But Mr. Relly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking this union between Chriſt and <hi>innocent</hi> human nature, maintains that Chriſt was <hi>united</hi> to <hi>ſinful man, and partook of their guilt,</hi> and on that account <hi>deſerved</hi> to ſuffer, in point of <hi>juſtice.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> In this view indeed, the ſufferings of Chriſt appear perfectly juſt, but not in the leaſt degree <hi>meritorious,</hi> for there can be no <hi>merit</hi> in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a <hi>juſt puniſhment.</hi> So that had it been poſſible for ſuch an union to have exiſted as Mr. Relly pleads for, it would have defeated the ends of Chriſt's death, and prevented an atonement for ſin.</p>
            <p>The ſcripture likewiſe mentions an union between Chriſt and the <hi>elect.</hi> A certain number of mankind were choſen to ſalvation from eternity, and given to Chriſt, in the covenant of redemption, as the reward of his ſufferings. Theſe are called the <hi>elect,</hi> or the <hi>church,</hi> and often alluded to in ſcripture, particularly in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſages. "Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſings in heavenly places <hi>in Chriſt</hi>; according as he hath choſen us <hi>in him,</hi> before the foundation of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017924_0038_0FA378C5846A14C8"/>
the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love." "Be thou partaker of the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the goſpel, according to the power of God; who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> before the world began." "Ye alſo, as living ſtones, are built up a <hi>ſpiritual houſe,</hi> an <hi>holy prieſthood,</hi> to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo it is contained in the ſcripture, behold I lay in Zion a <hi>chief corner ſtone, elect precious</hi>; and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him ſhall not be confounded. Unto you therefore, who believe, he is precious: But unto them who are diſobedient, the ſtone which the builders diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the ſame is made the <hi>head of the corner</hi>; and a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them who ſtumble at the word, being diſobedient, <hi>whereunto alſo they were appointed.</hi> But ye are a <hi>choſen</hi> generation, a royal <hi>prieſthood,</hi> an <hi>holy nation,</hi> a <hi>peculiar</hi> people." Theſe, and many other paſſages of ſcripture ſpeak of the <hi>elect,</hi> and ſpeak of them as <hi>peculiar,</hi> and <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the reſt of mankind. All the world are not the elect, but the elect are thoſe who from eternity were choſen out of the world, and who are repreſented in ſcripture, as entirely diſtinct from the world. Our Lord hath taken care to fix and determine this matter with great preciſion. He ſays in the 24th of Matthew, "And many falſe prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall <hi>deceive many,</hi> and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders, inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very <hi>elect</hi>" Here the elect are diſtinct from the <hi>many</hi> that were to be deceived. Again, in the 15th of John, Chriſt tells his followers, "If the <hi>world</hi> hate you, ye know it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017924_0039_0FA378C6460F5C70"/>
love his own: But becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have <hi>choſen</hi> you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." In the 17th chapter, he hath theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. "I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me <hi>out of the world.</hi> I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, <hi>becauſe they are not of the world,</hi> even as I am not of the world."</p>
            <p>Now as the elect were choſen to ſalvation from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> as the means, and <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> as the reward of his ſufferings and death; ſo it may be truly ſaid, that there hath been a certain <hi>union or connection</hi> between Chriſt and the elect <hi>from eternity.</hi> But beſides this, there is another more intimate and <hi>vital</hi> union between Chriſt and the elect, which commences <hi>in time</hi>; but ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure forever. For whom God predeſtinates, them he alſo calls; and whom he calls, them he alſo juſtifies; and whom he juſtifies, them he alſo glorifies. Hence, ſays, the apoſtle, ſpeaking of the ſucceſs of his labours among the Gentiles, "<hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</hi>" All the elect are brought in this life, by the influences of the divine Spirit, to repentance and <hi>faith.</hi> And <hi>in faith,</hi> this vital union to Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences. The believer then becomes united to Chriſt <hi>in his affections, views,</hi> and <hi>intereſts.</hi> He loves what Chriſt loves, and hates what Chriſt hates. He has the ſame views of the divine Majeſty, of the divine law, of ſin, and of himſelf, that Chriſt has. And he has a joint intereſt with Chriſt in the love of God, in the protections of providence, and in all the bleſſings which reſult from the work of redemption. This union is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that which ſubſiſts between Chriſt and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Accordingly he prays, in the 17th of John, that this union might commence, in time, between him and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017924_0040_0FA378C704838480"/>
thoſe whom his Father had given him from eternity. "Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo who ſhall <hi>believe</hi> on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they may alſo <hi>be one in us.</hi>" This union makes the principal figure in the ſacred writings, and is oftener al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to there than any other. It is on account of this union, that ſaints or believers, in diſtinction from the world, are ſaid to <hi>die</hi> with Chriſt, to be <hi>crucified</hi> with Chriſt; to be <hi>buried</hi> with Chriſt; to be <hi>quickened</hi> with Chriſt; to <hi>riſe</hi> with Chriſt; to <hi>live</hi> with Chriſt; to be <hi>circumciſed</hi> with Chriſt; to be <hi>baptiſed</hi> with Chriſt; to be <hi>compleat</hi> in Chriſt; to <hi>be members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones.</hi> And it is on account of this union, that Chriſt and the church are ſo often prefigured and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the various metaphors or Adam and Eve; of Adam and his poſterity; of the huſband and wife; of Aaron and his robes; of the vine and its branches; of the head and its members; and of the corner ſtone and ſuperſtructure.</p>
            <p>Theſe unions, which we have now mentioned and deſcribed, are the only ones reſpecting Chriſt and men, that are to be found in the ſacred oracles. And theſe are ſo far from bearing the leaſt affinity to that union between Chriſt and <hi>all</hi> mankind, which Mr. Relly pleads for, that they are utterly inconſiſtent with it, and ſubverſive of it. It theſe be true, that muſt be falſe. And if theſe be true, thereto one or other of them, muſt every paſſage of ſcripture, which ſpeaks of men's union to Chriſt, neceſſarily refer; and of courſe, leave Mr. Relly's notion of union as deſtitute of all ſupport from divine revelation, as from reaſon and common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:017924_0041_0FA378C7C51047A8"/>But it may be ſtill urged in ſavour of the univerſal ſalvation of mankind, that
<q>Chriſt taſted death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, and made full atonement for the ſins of the whole world. And it is prepoſterous to imagine that any of thoſe who have been redeemed by the precious blood of the ſon of God, ſhould be finally loſt.</q>
I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, this objection ſuppoſes that God is obliged, <hi>in juſtice,</hi> to ſave all mankind. Therefore,</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſuppoſes that mankind ſtand in no need of <hi>divine forgiveneſs.</hi> For if the price of redemption which Chriſt hath paid, hath fully diſcharged the debt which ſinners owed to God, then they now owe him nothing, and if they owe him nothing, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be forgiven; and therefore can never with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety uſe that petition in the Lord's prayer, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors." Wherefore.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there can be no grace diſplayed in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners, by the goſpel. For it they all <hi>deſerve</hi> to be ſaved, it is an act of <hi>juſtice,</hi> but not of <hi>grace,</hi> for God to ſave them. Though the apoſtle indeed tells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that they are "juſtified <hi>freely by his grace,</hi> through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt." But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this objection is entirely founded in a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion of the nature of Chriſt's atonement. It was not the intention of Chriſt, by his obedience and death, to make <hi>void</hi> the law, to alter the <hi>nature</hi> of ſin, to <hi>move</hi> God <hi>in mercy,</hi> or <hi>oblige</hi> him, <hi>in juſtice,</hi> to ſave ſinners; for all this was impoſſible. But his deſign was, to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> the law, to <hi>condemn</hi> ſin in the fleſh, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the dignity of the divine character and government,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017924_0042_0FA378C8850FDE30"/>
and thereby open a door for the diſplay of divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and forgiveneſs towards a periſhing world. The death of Chriſt indeed hath removed all the obſtacles, which before ſtood in the way of the exerciſe of divine mercy; and that is all. God is no more obliged, <hi>in point of juſtice,</hi> to ſave ſinners, than if Chriſt had never died, and made atonement for ſin. If God ſaves any of the human race now, it is an act of <hi>mere grace,</hi> and not of <hi>juſtice.</hi> Hence the <hi>extent</hi> of Chriſt's atonement does not in the leaſt determine, whether more or leſs, whether a part or the whole of mankind will finally be ſaved. This can be determined only by the <hi>divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,</hi> and <hi>gracious promiſes</hi> to Chriſt, which, as we have ſhown, all concur to reprobate the notion of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid by ſome, that
<q>God being from eternity perfectly and independently bleſſed, could have no other motive in giving being to his creatures than <hi>their good,</hi> and of conſequence, he muſt infallibly bring them all, ſooner or later, to a ſtate of perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though this objection is not void of plauſibility, yet it ſeems to carry ſomething in it extremely abſurd and diſhonorable to the divine Majeſty. For the Supreme Being to have himſelf entirely out of view in all his works, and to make every thing i. he univerſe ſolely ſubſervient to the good of the creature looks like ſetting the creature above the infinitely great Jehovah! Beſides, if the Deity aims ſolely at the good of the creature, why ſhould not the creature aim ſolely at his own good, and make his own happineſs the ſole object of all his deſires and purſuits? And why ſhould God blame
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017924_0043_0FA378C9A1C6AAE0"/>
him, if in the purſuit of this object, he caſts off fear, reſtrains prayer, and loves and ſerves the creature more than the Creator? Moreover, if the Divine Being aims ſolely at the good of every individual perſon, why hath he not made every man perfectly happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through every ſtage and period of his exiſtence? Why hath he made this world an Aceldema, a field of blood, and ſcene of every evil, where men are born to trouble as the ſparks fly upward? Why hath he not rather poured one continued, uninterrupted ſtream of happineſs upon <hi>us,</hi> as he hath upon the angels above, who have never felt one <hi>ſinful</hi> paſſion, nor one <hi>painful</hi> ſenſation ſince their exiſtence? Perhaps it will here be ſaid, that though God aims ſolely at the good of the intelligent creation <hi>in general,</hi> yet this does not neceſſarily imply that he muſt <hi>conſtantly</hi> ſeek and promote the good of <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual.</hi> We grant it, and abide the conſequence, which is this. If the good of the intelligent creation <hi>in general,</hi> may <hi>ſometimes,</hi> require God to give up the good of <hi>individuals,</hi> then it may, for aught we know, require him to give up the good of <hi>individuals forever.</hi> If the <hi>general good</hi> of mankind once required the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> deſtruction of Pharaoh and his hoſts, who knows but <hi>the general good</hi> of the whole intelligent creation, may alſo require their <hi>eternal deſtruction?</hi> Therefore allowing that God does, in this ſenſe, aim ſupremely and ſolely at the <hi>general</hi> good of the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent creation, yet he may nevertheleſs make myriads and myriads of <hi>individuals</hi> finally and eternally miſerable.</p>
            <p>There is, however, no reaſon to think that God had, from eternity, no other view in all his works of creation and providence, than the <hi>general</hi> good of the <hi>created</hi> ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. This ſuppoſition ſeems to originate from a falſe
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:017924_0044_0FA378CA06EEDF30"/>
conception of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> of the Divine Being. God is not an infinite <hi>Intelligence,</hi> who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſtitute of all <hi>propenſions.</hi> He is not, as the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curians dream, an infinite <hi>Stoic,</hi> who is entirely unaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, and indifferent to, all created and uncreated objects. But he is a Being of infinitely clear views, of infinitely wiſe deſigns, and of infinitely <hi>ſtrong propenſities and affections.</hi> And the perfect, undiſturbed, eternal <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> of all theſe, is abſolutely eſſential to his infinite, immutable bleſſedneſs. Though God was indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly bleſſed from eternity, independently of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet not independently of his own views, purpoſes and affections. Could we only ſuppoſe it poſſible, that God's purpoſes and deſigns ſhould now be eraſed from his mind, or that he ſhould now find himſelf unable to carry them into execution, this would prove an eternal diminution of the divine bleſſedneſs. But ſince known unto God are all his works from the beginning; ſince they have always ſtood preſent to his view, as fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, they have been an eternal ſource of ineffable ſatisfaction, ſelf-complacency and delight. Now if God be capable of great and noble deſigns, if he be capable of great and noble exertions, and capable of taking a <hi>true, real, infinite pleaſure and delight</hi> in all his works, then it is eaſy to conceive that he might make his own <hi>pleaſure, his own bleſſedneſs</hi> or <hi>glory</hi> the grand and ſupreme object in all his works of creation and providence, and have but an inferior and ſubordinate reſpect to the good of the creature. Accordingly the ſcripture repreſents this as his ultimate and ſupreme end in the creation of the world. "The Lord hath made all things for himſelf; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil." Prov. 16.4. The apoſtle ſays, that "of him, and through him, and to him are all things." Rom. 11.36. And it is the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:017924_0045_0FA378CAC583E168"/>
general voice of heaven, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power; for thou haſt created all things, and for <hi>thy PLEASURE,</hi> they are and were created." Beſides, the whole courſe of providence from the beginning to this day, clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates that God hath ſought his own glory ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the good of the creature but ſubordinately in all his conduct. He expelled the rebel angels from heaven, deſtroyed the old world, and burnt up Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, not for <hi>their good,</hi> but for his <hi>own glory.</hi> And we know the perdition of Pharaoh and of Judas was not deſigned for <hi>their good,</hi> ſince Chriſt hath ſaid of the one, that it had been good for him, if he had never been born, and God hath told us, he raiſed up the other, that his name might be declared throughout all the earth Hence the ſupreme and ultimate ends of the Deity in the creation of the world, afford no evidence in favour of the <hi>univerſal</hi> ſalvation of the human race. It may be conſiſtent with God's original and eternal deſigns, for aught we know, to continue the miſeries of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all eternity.</p>
            <p>We often hear the infinite love and mercy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity pathetically urged as an irreſragable argument againſt the eternity of future puniſhments. It is ſaid,
<q>this doctrine repreſents the divine benevolence as far below the pity and compaſſion that are found in the human heart. A parent's love cannot endure the thought that the dear offspring of his own bowels ſhould be made fuel for quenchleſs flames. And the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent man on earth does not even <hi>wiſh</hi> that his worſt enemy ſhould lie down in eternal ſorrow, and dwell with everlaſting burnings. Much leſs can the kind parent of the univerſe, who is good unto all,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:017924_0046_0FA378CB85189C78"/>
and whoſe tender mercies are over all his works, find it in his heart to doom any of the human race to the pains of hell <hi>forever.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This objection appears to be rather an addreſs to the ſoft and tender paſſions of human nature, than an appeal to the cool and impartial dictates of right reaſon. The weaker paſſions of our animal nature, recoil in the view of thoſe acts of public juſtice, which, our reaſon, our conſcience, and our <hi>real</hi> benevolence <hi>approve,</hi> and which the <hi>divine</hi> authority hath abſolutely required. But who would hence conclude that <hi>our</hi> love and compaſſion tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the tender mercies of the Deity? Did not Noah preach an hundred and twenty years to a ſtupid and impenitent world? Did he not offer up ſtrong prayers and cries to the Father of Mercies; that he would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly avert the dire deſtruction which hung over their guilty heads? And did he not riſe in fervor and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, as the period of their day of grace and ſpace of repentance drew nigh? How then muſt he have felt when he ſtood a ſpectator of their final doom! Who can deſcribe or conceive the tender emotions of his heart, the painful conflicts and tumults of his breaſt, when the tremendous ſcene opened to his view! When he beheld the rains falling, the fountains of the great deep break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and all nature in convulſions; and heard the waves roaring, and a guilty world, day after day, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praying, and rending the heavens with their laſt, expiring groans! But ſhall we imagine that God was equally <hi>ſhocked</hi> on this ſolemn occaſion! No! He, (if we may be allowed the compariſon) ſtood, like Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, with ſtern juſtice on his countenance, and beheld his beloved, but guilty offspring receive the due reward of their deeds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:017924_0047_0FA378CC44674220"/>With what fervent importunity did Abraham beſeech the Moſt High to ſpare the devoted cities of Sodom and Gomorrah? And next morning, when he repaired to the place where he had ſtood and prayed before the Lord, and looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the ſmoak of the country went up as the ſmoak of a furnace, how did it awaken every tender feeling of humanity and benevolence? But who will hence conclude that the Father of Mercies had leſs love and compaſſion towards the workmanſhip of his own hands, than Abraham? Hence nothing but our danger can equal our deluſion, if we imagine the Divine Being to be altogether ſuch an one as ourſelves, and judge of the divine clemency by our own. What if Noah, what if Lot had done ſo! What if Noah had ſaid, "I know the world is become univerſally corrupt. I know the earth is filled with violence. I know God hath told me his patience is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to one hundred and twenty years. But I know my own heart recoils at the thoughts of their deſtruction, and it is my ſincere deſire and prayer to God that they might be ſaved. And I alſo know God is infinitely more kind, and gracious, and merciful than I am. I will therefore neglect the ark, and build my houſe on the ſand, and fear no evil." But behold! the floods come, the winds blow, and the ſtorms beat on his houſe, and it falls, and great is the fall of it! What if Lot had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the divine threatnings as a mere mockery, like his ſons-in-law, would he not have periſhed with them in the ruins of Sodom? And is it not equally dangerous to reaſon in the ſame manner now, againſt the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the wrath to come?</p>
            <p>But ſtill, ſays the objector, is not God a God of love?
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017924_0048_0FA378CD06B53578"/>
and is it the nature of love to puniſh, eſpecially its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved objects? I anſwer, yes; it is the genuine ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of <hi>true</hi> love, under certain circumſtances to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. True love to his child, induces the kind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent parent to uſe the rod of correction for his good. So ſays Solomon, "He that ſpareth his rod, hateth his ſon, but he that <hi>loveth</hi> him, chaſteneth him betimes." So whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth.
<q>But this reaches not the caſe,</q>
replies the objector.
<q>I can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive that love ſhould puniſh its beloved object for its good; but will it extend further? Will it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh more than the benefit of the object puniſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires? Will it therefore puniſh forever?</q>
No doubt it will, when the <hi>good of the object puniſhed is not the end</hi> propoſed by the puniſhment. It is not always the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of puniſhment to conſult the <hi>good</hi> of the object puniſhed. This is never the caſe with reſpect to <hi>capital</hi> puniſhments in this life. It is <hi>love</hi> to his country, or a tender regard to the <hi>public</hi> good, that induces the civil magiſtrate to condemn the traitor or murderer to a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ignominious death. It was love to God that fired the breaſt of Phineas, when he ruſhed into the camp of Iſrael, and ſlew Zimri and Kozbi. And then it was conſidered, approved and rewarded by the God of love. "And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, Phineas the ſon of Eleazer, the ſon of Aaron the prieſt, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Iſrael <hi>(while he was zealous for my ſake among them)</hi> that I conſumed not the children of Iſrael in my jealouſy. Wherefore ſay, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. It is love to the objects injured, and not to the objects puniſhed, that dictates the nature, degree and duration of their puniſhment. Thus it is God's love to himſelf, to his ſon, to his law, and to the general good of the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017924_0049_0FA378CE63FA24E0"/>
univerſe that induces him to puniſh the wicked after death. And as his infinite love to theſe objects will eternally remain, ſo it will induce him to puniſh the wicked <hi>forever.</hi> His love will burn to the loweſt hell. Hence we find the moſt exemplary acts of divine juſtice are repreſented in ſcripture as the expreſſions of divine <hi>mercy.</hi> "O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is <hi>good</hi>; for his <hi>mercy</hi> endureth forever. To him that by wiſdom made the heavens; for his mercy endureth forever. To him that <hi>ſmote in Egypt in their firſt born</hi>; for his mercy endureth forever. And brought out Iſrael from among them; for his mercy endureth forever. But <hi>overthrew</hi> Pharaoh and his hoſts in the Red Sea; for his mercy endureth forever. To him that <hi>ſmote</hi> great kings; for his mercy endureth forever. And <hi>ſlew</hi> famous kings; for his mercy endureth forever. <hi>Sihon king of the Amorites</hi>; for his mercy endureth forever. And <hi>Og</hi> king of Baſhan; <hi>for his mercy endureth forever.</hi>" Here the diſplays of divine juſtice are conſidered as the diſplays of the ſame <hi>goodneſs</hi> which firſt gave birth to the creation of the world But to whom is the diſplay of this juſtice, a <hi>mercy?</hi> To the wicked? Nay, but to the Iſrael, to the church of God. Hence the degree and duration of the puniſhments of the wicked will always hold proportion to the degree and duration of the <hi>divine love</hi> to the righteous. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God repreſents his <hi>punitive juſtice</hi> as the neceſſary fruit and effect of his infinite goodneſs and mercy. When Moſes requeſted a ſpecial manifeſtation of his glory. He told him he would cauſe all his <hi>goodneſs</hi> to paſs before him. And to do this, he proclaimed himſelf "the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth—and that will by no means <hi>clear guilty.</hi>" Thus it appears that divine <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> may, and infallibly will <hi>puniſh</hi> the wicked <hi>forever,</hi> if the <hi>good</hi> of the univerſe requires their <hi>eternal</hi> puniſhment.</p>

<q>muſt diſturb the joys of the bleſſed. For how can thoſe pure and benevolent ſpirits behold, <hi>without pain,</hi> multitudes of their fellow-creatures, whom they love as themſelves, eternally weltering under the vials of divine wrath.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this it may be obſerved,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the puniſhments of the damned are the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays of <hi>divine juſtice</hi> towards <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that they are the diſplays of <hi>divine goodneſs</hi> towards the <hi>bleſſed.</hi> Hence,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as diſplays of <hi>divine goodneſs,</hi> the heavenly hoſts ought not only to <hi>approve</hi> of them, but to <hi>rejoice</hi> in them, and <hi>praiſe</hi> God for them. And hence,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the ſcripture tells us, that the pure ſpirits above do rejoice in and praiſe God for the eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he inflicts upon his and their enemies. Upon the fall of myſtical Babylon, it is ſaid, "Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apoſtles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for God hath avenged you on her." "And after theſe things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, ſaying, Alleluia: "Salvation, and glory, and power unto the Lord our God: For true and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> are <hi>his judgments</hi>; for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his ſervants at her hand. And again they ſaid, Alleluia. And her ſmoak riſe up <hi>forever and ever.</hi>"</p>
            <p>It is ſaid,
<q>If God ſhould ſave ſome of mankind and finally puniſh others, then he <hi>would be a reſpecter of perſons.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:017924_0051_0FA378CF4565C660"/>To this it is ſufficient to reply, that divine inſpiration aſſures us, that God's rewarding the righteous and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the wicked is <hi>the very thing,</hi> which demonſtrates him to be no reſpecter of perſons. "But if ye call on the Father, who, <hi>without reſpect of perſons, judgeth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every man's work,</hi> paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear." 1 Pet. 1.17. "And whatſoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the reward of the inheritance; for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt. But he that <hi>doeth wrong,</hi> ſhall <hi>receive for the wrong which he hath done:</hi> And there is <hi>no reſpect of perſons.</hi>" Coloſſ. 3.23, 24, 25. And the apoſtle tells the finally impenitent ſinner, that God will render to every man according to his deeds: To them, who, by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality; eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; indignation, and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile. <hi>For there is no reſpect of perſons with God.</hi>" Rom. 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 11.</p>
            <p>It is further urged againſt the eternal puniſhments of the wicked, that
<q>though God is obliged to fulfil his <hi>promiſes,</hi> yet he is not obliged to fulfil his <hi>threatnings</hi>; and therefore notwithſtanding he hath threatened eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction to the finally impenitent, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hence abſolutely determine that he will make them eternally miſerable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This objection does, in a great meaſure, if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely defeat itſelf. For it ſuppoſes,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that God has really threatened eternal deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:017924_0052_0FA378D0055FBB80"/>Secondly, it ſuppoſes that God may conſiſtently with tice make them eternally miſerable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it ſuppoſes that it is utterly impoſſible for us to know and <hi>prove,</hi> that he will <hi>not puniſh</hi> them <hi>eternally,</hi> becauſe this cannot be known unleſs God has <hi>promiſed</hi> not to <hi>fulfil</hi> his threatenings, which is abſurd.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it ſuppoſes that it is <hi>probable</hi> that he will <hi>puniſh</hi> the wicked <hi>forever.</hi> Divine threatenings muſt, at leaſt, imply that it is in ſome meaſure <hi>probable,</hi> that God will fulfil them, or elſe they imply nothing, have no meaning, and anſwer no end. And this probability is greatly corroborated by the many inſtances, which the ſcripture gives us, of God's fulfilling his threatenings. He threatened to deſtroy the old world, in the ſpace of an hundred and twenty years. And accordingly at the time appointed he deſtroyed them. He threatened to judge and deſtroy the Egyptians, after a period of four hundred years. And when the time of the promiſe and threatening came, he overthrew the Egyptians, and ſet the ſeed of Abraham free from the houſe of bondage. He threatened deſtruction to the Canaanites, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them accordingly. He threatened a ſeventy years captivity to his people Iſrael, and he fulfilled his threatenings. He threatened the total exciſion of the Jews, their city and temple, and they were cut off at the time predicted. He threatened the ruin of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven churches of Aſia; and his threatenings have long ſince been fulfilled. He threatened the utter extinction of Babylon and Ninevah, and his threatenings have had a moſt exact and punctual accompliſhment.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Newton on the prophecies.</note> Theſe and many other inſtances which might be adduced,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:017924_0053_0FA378D0C5D3D628"/>
afford a ſtrong probability and preſumption that God will fulfil all his threatenings according to their <hi>real na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>import.</hi> Nor does the caſe of Ninevah rightly underſtood ſuppoſe the contrary. God's threatenings againſt Ninevah were evidently <hi>conditional,</hi> agreeably to that divine maxim in the 18th of Jeremiah. "At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation—If that nation, againſt whom I have pronounced <hi>turn</hi> from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them." And Jonah and the king of Ninevah evidently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the threatening with this <hi>implied</hi> condition; or why did Jonah preach, or the Ninevites faſt? Beſides,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, this objection ſuppoſes that it is as certain, <hi>as it can be,</hi> that God will puniſh the wicked <hi>eternally.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make this more certain than the <hi>divine threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings.</hi> If God's threatenings do not fix the certainty of future and eternal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> puniſhments beyond doubt, then if God really intends to puniſh the wicked to all eternity, he cannot make them certain of it in this life, for he can give them no higher evidence of it than his expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and threatenings. So that if they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this evidence, neither would they be perſuaded, though one roſe from the dead. Accordingly God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that <hi>his threatenings</hi> are as much to be relied on as <hi>his promiſes,</hi> and that his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>divinity</hi> are <hi>pledged</hi> in both. Thus his promiſes and threatenings are ſet upon a level in the 18th of Jeremiah. "At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to deſtroy it; if that nation, againſt whom I have pronounced turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017924_0054_0FA378D18462B9F8"/>
and to plant it; if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the <hi>good</hi> wherewith I ſaid I would benefit it." Here God exhibits the ſame evidence of the truth and certainty of his threatenings as of his promiſes. And in other places he ſets them both on the ſame immutable footing. "If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land." Here is a promiſe. "But if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the ſword. Here is a threatening. And then both are confirmed, by the following emphatical aſſeveration, "<hi>for the mouth of the LORD hath ſpoken it.</hi>" And this mode of aſſeveration is often uſed with reſpect to the divine threatenings as well as promiſes. The threatenings againſt Tyre run in this ſolemn form: "Therefore, thus ſaid the LORD GOD, Behold I am againſt thee, O Tyrus, and I will cauſe many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come up againſt thee, as the ſea cauſeth his waves to come up. And they ſhall deſtroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will alſo ſcrape her duſt from her, and make her like the top of a rock; it ſhall be a place for the ſpreading of nets in the midſt of the ſea: <hi>For I have ſpoken it ſaith the Lord.</hi>" Ezek. 17. 3, 4, 5. This threatening proved true, and was fully accompliſhed many ages ago <note n="*" place="bottom">See Newton on the prophecies.</note> There is another threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening againſt God's own people of the ſame tenor. "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee. <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it; it ſhall come to paſs, and I will do it.</hi>" Ezek. 14.13, 14. Thus it appears that God's <hi>threatenings</hi> have the ſame ground of certainty as his <hi>promiſes.</hi> They are both founded on the infallible veracity, and abſolute immutability of Him <hi>who cannot lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:017924_0055_0FA378D24581CA40"/>Another objection is this.
<q>If ſin and miſery be not totally aboliſhed, and all mankind finally ſaved, then Satan will triumph, and Chriſt will fail of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of his principal ends in the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is to bruiſe the ſerpent's head, and deſtroy the works of the devil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this it may be replied, in the firſt place, that <hi>merely the aboliſhing of ſin and miſery</hi> will not deſtroy the works of the devil, and bruiſe the ſerpent's head. For ſuppoſing in any period of eternity, ſin and miſery ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly aboliſhed, Satan would ſtill have cauſe to triumph, that he had brought an indelible ſtain upon the divine character, and done an irreparable injury to his creatures, and ſo far fruſtrated the kind and benevolent purpoſes of the Deity in the work of creation. Unleſs,</p>
            <p>Secondly, all the ſin and miſery which he had proved the means of introducing into God's world, are <hi>turned againſt him,</hi> and made inſtrumental of bringing <hi>more glory</hi> to God, and <hi>more happineſs</hi> to the univerſe than if they had never exiſted. When this is done, Satan is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conquered, his <hi>head</hi> is bruiſed, and his works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the ſin and miſery of ages, can be made the means of bringing <hi>more glory to God,</hi> and <hi>more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to the univerſe, than if they had never exiſted; then the ſin and miſery of the damned through eternity, may prove the means of promoting the ſame ends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Therefore, in order effectually to deſtroy the works of the devil; and bruiſe the ſerpent's head it may be abſolutely neceſſary that Satan and multitudes of his followers ſhould be eternally miſerable. Accordingly the ſcripture repreſents Chriſt as triumphing over Satan,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:017924_0056_0FA378D365FDC4E0"/>
by turning all his ſchemes and works againſt him, and finally caſting him and his adherents into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit, under the wrath of God, and the everlaſting contempt of the heavenly world. And thus Chriſt is exalted, and his enemies are made his footſtool.</p>
            <p>Having ſhown that there will be a general judgment —that there is an eſſential diſtinction between the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the wicked—that agreeably to this diſtinction, they will be ſeperated at the laſt day, and rewarded and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to their works—that their reſpective re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments will endure <hi>forever</hi>—and that there be no <hi>ſolid</hi> objections againſt theſe ſolemn and intereſting truths; it only remains to conclude this diſcourſe with ſuch reflections as are naturally ſuggeſted by the ſubject.</p>
            <p>It is obvious to remark, in the firſt place, that every ſcheme of <hi>univerſal</hi> ſalvation is utterly deſtitute of any foundation in the word of God. The foregoing obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations equally ſtrike at the root of this opinion, in whatever ſhape it appears, or on whatever ground it is built. Various ſchemes have been purſued to eſtabliſh the notion of the final reſtoration and happineſs of all lapſed beings. This notion perhaps was firſt conceived in the fertile brain of Origin, who, like other great and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> opinion of his tranſpired with ſeveral others equally abſurd and romantic. He maintained—that "the ſouls of men do pre-exiſt—that through their fault and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they appear here inhabitants of the earth cloathed in terreſtial bodies—that the myſtery of the reſurrection is this, that we ſhall be cloathed with heavenly or aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial bodies—that after long periods of time the damned

ſhall be delivered from their torments, and try their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes again in ſuch regions of the world as their natures fit them for—and that the earth, after her conflagration, ſhall become habitable again, and be the manſions of men and other animals; and this in eternal viciſſitudes."<note n="*" place="bottom">Phenix, Vol. 1. Page 11.</note> Such crude and undigeſted notions were propagated by Origin, which probably would have dropt into oblivion ages ago, had not the <hi>name</hi> of their author carried more weight with ſome, than the ſtrength of his arguments. Out of this rubbiſh, however, the Romiſh clergy formed the abſurd doctrine of Purgatory. And after them, Chevalier Ramſay, Dr. Hartley and others have built, on the ſame foundation, the doctrine of the final reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all lapſed beings to the divine favor.</p>
            <p>Others have founded their expectation of the final happineſs of the whole intelligent creation on the infinite goodneſs and mercy of the Supreme Being. They ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the <hi>endleſs</hi> miſery of the creature cannot be reconciled with the nature of his crime, nor the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs love and benevolence of the Deity. This ſcheme hath been generally adopted by deiſtical writers.</p>
            <p>And, of late, Mr. Relly hath deviſed another method of arriving to the ſame concluſion, and maintained that <hi>all</hi> men will be ſaved by virtue of their <hi>union</hi> to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>But the notion of univerſal ſalvation, in every form of it, is ſo abſurd, that it hath never met with <hi>general</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:017924_0058_0FA378D485158768"/>
among thoſe that have called themſelves Chriſtians. They have never adoped it as an article in any of their formulas, creeds, or confeſſions of ſaith. Even the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church have not embraced it. They do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that every ſinner will have the benefit of purgatory, but ſuppoſe multitudes are ſo guilty as to be ſent direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hell, and ſhall there remain forever. Only a few individuals have believed and propagated this doctrine, in any age of the world, as Dr. Hartley frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. His words are theſe. <note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations on man, 1 Vol. Page 467, 468.</note> "It is farther to be obſerved, that the fear of death is much increaſed by the exquiſiteneſs of the puniſhments threatened in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate, and by the variety of the emblems, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, analogies, and evidences, of natural and revealed religion, whereby all the terrors of all other things are transferred upon thoſe puniſhments; alſo by that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar circumſtance of the ETERNITY of them, which ſeems to have been a general tradition previous to the appearance of chriſtianity, amongſt both Jews and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and which has been the doctrine of the chriſtian world ever ſince, ſome <hi>very few</hi> perſons excepted." This general diſbelief of the doctrine of univerſal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bears a very dark aſpect upon the truth of it. For had it been true, and plainly revealed in the ſacred ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, it is ſtrange that the chriſtian world could never yet be brought to embrace it; eſpecially ſince it is a doctrine ſo every way adopted to pleaſe and gratify all the natural deſires of the human heart.

lead mankind to reject, and nothing to embrace the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>eternal</hi> puniſhments, had it been <hi>falſe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is next to a miracle, that the chriſtian world ſhould, for ſo many ages, embrace the doctrine of <hi>eternal</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and reject <hi>that</hi> of univerſal ſalvation, had not the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation been really <hi>falſe,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of eternal puniſhments <hi>moſt evidently true.</hi> In no caſe, perhaps, the general voice of the chriſtian world ought to have more weight than in this; eſpecially ſince it ſo fully concurs with the general voice of ſcripture. We have ſeen that all the doctrines, declarations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, promiſes and threatenings of the goſpel conſpire to condemn the notion of univerſal ſalvation. Indeed had the bible been written on purpoſe to refute it, we can hardly conceive that it could have contained any thing more plain, full and determinate againſt it. And Chevalier Ramſay acknowledges, that "St. Jerom, St. Gregory, of Nyſſa, St. Auguſtin, and St. Cyril, of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, attacked and confuted this opinion, as maintained by Origin, before the fifth general council held at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople." <note n="*" place="bottom">Philoſophical Principles, 2 Vol. Page 245. <hi>&amp; ſub finem.</hi>

            <p>If there be an eſſential difference between ſaints and ſinners; if they ſhall be ſeperated from each other, at the laſt day, and eternally rewarded and puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works, as we have endeavoured to ſhow in the preceeding diſcourſe, then the notion of univerſal
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:017924_0060_0FA378D605F302A0"/>
ſalvation, eſpecially as maintained by Mr. Relly and his followers, is fundamentally wrong and abſolutely fatal. Their doctrine teaches, that holineſs and piety are empty names; that faith, love, repentance, humility and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, are no other than hypocriſy, pride and idolatry; that it is impoſſible for a man to prevent his ſalvation by the moſt irreligious, abandoned, profligate life; that there is no eſſential difference between the righteous and the wicked; that they ſhall not be ſeperated at the laſt day, but Cain, Pharaoh, Haman, Herod, Judas, Pilate, and all the reſt of the impenitent world, ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the kingdom of glory, and no human ſoul be finally ſhut out. Such a doctrine as this is replete with infinite miſchief. It ſtrikes at the root of all experimental religion. It confounds all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of virtue and vice. It deſtroys all diſtinction of characters. It ſaps the foundation of morality. It takes off every reſtraint from vice. It opens the ſtood gates of iniquity. It renders even God, and Chriſt, and the prophets and the apoſtles, the miniſters of ſin. It ſpeaks peace to the wicked, to whom, faith God, there is no peace. It has indeed every ſignature of a damnable doctrine. There are many errors, no doubt, in regard to the modes and forms, and ſome of the doctrines of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which, though they cannot abide the clear light of the laſt great day, will not exclude men from the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, or the kingdom of heaven.

againſt them, Depart, ye curſed, into everlaſting are, prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
            <p>Some ſeem reluctant to pronounce abſolutely upon the fatal tendency of this doctrine, and chuſe only to ſay, if it be <hi>true,</hi> we are as ſafe as thoſe who embrace it. But we ought nather to ſay, if there be no future judgment then we are all ſafe, but not otherwiſe. Admit a future judgment, and there remains no room for doubt, whether God will make at difference between him that ſerveth him, and him that ſerveth him not; between him that ſweareth, and him that feareth an oath. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſuppoſition that no diſtinction will be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the righteous and the wicked at the laſt day, wholly ſuperſedes the neceſſity and even propriety of a general judgment, Why ſhould God appoint a day, in which, to judge the world in righteouſneſs, if no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were to be judged, no characters to be examined, and no diſplays of retributive juſtice to be made! "Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for what a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. For he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption: But he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting."</p>
            <p>Did the human heart naturally prefer light to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and truth to error, it would be ſufficient to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the truth and expoſe the error and leave every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to follow the cool dictates of his own underſtanding. But ſince the caſe is quite the reverſe, it becomes proper to addreſs the hearts and conſciences, the hopes and fears of men, and give divine truths all the advantages which they neceſſarily derive from the motives of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Hence the apoſtles addreſſed mankind on the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:017924_0062_0FA378D785FF6A68"/>
weighty concerns of the ſoul, with great ſolemnity, tenderneſs and pathos. "Knowing therefore the <hi>terror</hi> of the Lord, we perſuade men." "Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God." Supported and directed by ſuch examples as theſe, there needs no apology for addreſſing thoſe who are particularly concerned in this ſerious ſubject, and warning them againſt the fatal dangers to which they are ominently expoſed.</p>
            <p>There are many, at this day, who are labouring to reaſon themſelves out of the belief of all truth both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and divine; and boaſt of arriving to a certainty that all things are uncertain. But it may be queſtioned whether the human mind, which is formed to ſee and feel the force of truth, will permit any man to approach nearer to perfect <hi>ſcepticiſm,</hi> than perfect knowledge. By an habit of reſiſting truth, however, ſome may have unſettled their minds reſpecting divine things, at leaſt; and become expoſed to embrace <hi>error,</hi> if any thing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of truth in matters of religion. And for this reaſon, they are very liable to fall in with the deluſive ſcheme of univerſal ſalvation, which hath a tendency to diffuſe ſome glimmering rays of light in their dark and deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minds. But let ſuch be entreated to awake from their reveries, and attend to the great realities with which they are ſurrounded and connected. Eternal rewards and puniſhments are ſubſtantial realities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe them to be ſo or not. By ſhutting their eyes againſt them, their danger is not in the leaſt diminiſhed, but greatly enhanced. The period is haſtening when they muſt be thoroughly awakened from their deluſive dreams. The ſolemn ſcenes of the laſt day will draw the curtain
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:017924_0063_0FA378D845DEC6F0"/>
aſide, and open upon their aſtoniſhed minds the great realities which we have deſcribed. And theſe objects, which, at a diſtance, made Felix and Belſhazzar tremble, will equally ſhock their guilty ſouls, whenever their preſence can no longer be reſiſted. A realizing ſenſe of guilt, and folly, and the divine wrath will make any human heart ſtoop, and fill it with unutterable anguiſh, horror and deſpair. O! that they would therefore turn from ſuch gloomy proſpects, and attend to thoſe lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous truths, which will pour a flood of light into their raviſhed minds, and give them that joy which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
            <p>There is a larger number than theſe, perhaps, who are making ſwift and bold advances in the cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and leave no methods unemployed to diſcredit divine revelation, and ſubvert the foundations of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. They need not tell the world their motives. Were they not convinced that the bible contains the doctrine of eternal puniſhments, they would not wrack their inventions to find arguments to perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others that the ſcriptures are a cunningly deviſed fable. Let this doctrine be eraſed from the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and every deiſt would become its votary, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his Bolingbroke, Voltaire or Cheſterfield for that ſacred volumn. It is this doctrine alone that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels them to renounce a book, which bears ſo many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures of divinity, and which they are compelled to acknowledge contains the moſt excellent inſtructions, inſtitutions and commands. But ſo <hi>weak is their infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> we preſume they would rejoice to find the bible on their ſide, to confirm their wavering hopes and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proſpects of future happineſs. And this is what the ſcheme of univerſal ſalvation propoſes. It flatters them
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:017924_0064_0FA378DC0709D970"/>
the bible is their friend, and announces eternal felicity to them and to all mankind. Accordingly numbers of a deiſtical turn have become converts to this agreeable doctrine, and many others are eminently expoſed to fall into the fatal ſnare. But this is flying from the iron weapon and ruſhing on the bow of ſteel. For if any diſcard the bible becauſe they imagine it does contain the doctrine of eternal puniſhments, or embrace it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think it does not, they will infallibly meet with diſappointment and ruin in the end. There is one way and but one, in which, they may eſcape the wrath which is to come, and that is, by repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. This is the only foundation of hope, that God hath provided and revealed; nor can any other foundation be laid, which will not give way, when the winds blow, and the ſtorms of divine wrath beat upon the guilty ſoul.</p>
            <p>The ſons of pleaſure, who indulge to every ſinful gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, find it exceedingly difficult, in their ſerious intervals, to ſtifle their natural apprehenſions of guilt and puniſhment, and therefore readily catch hold of any thing which promiſes them impunity in the paths of vice. The doctrine of ſalvation for <hi>all</hi> men, without exception, or diſtinction of characters, perfectly gratifies their hearts and coincides with their reigning views and purſuits. Accordingly, when this is propoſed to their belief, they will, if poſſible, yield their aſſent, and ſhake off thoſe painful fears of the wrath to come, through which, they have all their life time been ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. But let them beware of this ſlender ſhelter. It will infallibly deceive and diſappoint them. The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the doctrine is a ſtrong indication of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to the goſpel of Chriſt, which was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:017924_0065_0FA378DCC56D34B8"/>
by perſons of an immoral, profligate character. When John preached Herod was offended. When Chriſt preached the whole congregation was filled with wrath. And when Paul preached upon <hi>righteouſneſs, temperance,</hi> and <hi>judgment to come,</hi> the looſe and abandoned Felix trembled. And it is the genuine tendency of the doctrines of the goſpel to convince profligate ſinners that they are in the gaul of bitterneſs and bonds of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. They may therefore be aſſured that the ſoothing doctrine of univerſal ſalvation is diametrically oppoſite to the truth as it is in Jeſus. Let them not then liſten to the pleaſing deluſion, and bleſs themſelves, ſaying, we ſhall have peace, though we walk in the imagination of our hearts, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt. For the Lord will not ſpare them, but his anger, and his jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſhall ſmoak againſt them, and all the curſes that are written in the book of God ſhall lie upon them forever. "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: <hi>But know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgment." "Be not deceived:</hi> Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners ſhall inherit the kingdom of God."</p>
            <p>There is another claſs of men whoſe caſe borders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſpair, and calls aloud for the prayers and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every pious heart: I mean thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their former faith, and built all their hopes for eternity upon the ſlender foundation, <hi>that no man can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be loſt.</hi> My friends, are you <hi>certain</hi> that without love, without ſaith, without holineſs, you can ſee the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:017924_0066_0FA378DD85DC0000"/>
Lord? Are you <hi>certain,</hi> notwithſtanding all the divine threatenings, there is no wrath to come? Are you <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> that men cannot be under ſtrong deluſions, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie, that they may be damned? Are you <hi>certain</hi> that you can appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt with ſafety? Are you <hi>certain</hi> that there is no meaning in this ſaying of our compaſſionate Redeemer, "What is a man profited, if he ſhould gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?" In a word, are you <hi>certain,</hi> it is abſolutely impoſſible, that your precious and immortal ſouls ſhould be loſt forever? If not, what an amazing riſk do you run, to ſuſpend all your eternal intereſts upon a ſingle point of <hi>mere ſpeculation,</hi> which ſtands condemned by the concurrent voice of reaſon, of conſcience, of ſcripture, and of the chriſtian world! But (to uſe nearly the words of an eminently great and pious divine) if you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to enquire no farther into the matter now, give me leave, at leaſt, from a ſincere concern, that you may not heap upon your heads more aggravated ruin, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, that you would be cautious how you expoſe yourſelves to yet greater danger, by what you muſt yourſelves own to be unneceſſary, I mean, <hi>Attempts to pervert others from believing the truths of the goſpel</hi> Leave them, for God's ſake, and for your own, in poſſeſſion of thoſe pleaſures, and thoſe hopes, which nothing but the truth as it is in Jeſus can give them; and act not as if you were ſolicitous to add to the guilt of an infidel the tenfold damnation, which they who have been the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters and deſtroyers of the ſouls of others, muſt expect to meet, if thoſe divine threatenings which they have ſo adventrouſly oppoſed ſhould prove, as they certainly will, the moſt ſerious, and to them the moſt dreadful, truths. If I cannot prevail here, but the <hi>pride of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:017924_0067_0FA378DE44406CB8"/>
a ſuperiority of underſtanding</hi> ſhould bear on ſuch readers, even in oppoſition to their own favorite maxims of the <hi>innocence of error,</hi> and the <hi>equality of all religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſocial virtue,</hi> to do their utmoſt to trample down the truths of the goſpel with contempt; I would however diſmiſs them with one propoſal, which I think the importance of the affair may fully juſtify. If you have done with your examination into the promiſes and threatenings of the goſpel, and each of you determine to live and conduct himſelf as if they were aſſuredly falſe, ſit down then, and <hi>make a memorandum of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</hi>
               <q>On ſuch a day of ſuch a year, I delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately reſolved, that I would live and die rejecting all <hi>experimental</hi> religion. This day I determined, not only to renounce all <hi>vital piety,</hi> but alſo to make it a ſerious part of the buſineſs of my life, to deſtroy, as far as I poſſibly can, all regard to it in the minds of others; in calm, ſteady defiance of that day, when the followers of Chriſt ſay, he ſhall appear in ſo much majeſty and terror to execute the vengeance threatened to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</q>
Dare you write this, and ſign it? I firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that many a man, who would be thought an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaliſt,</hi> and endeavours to increaſe the number, would not do it. And if you in particular dare not do it, whence does that ſmall remainder of caution ariſe? The cauſe is plain. There is in your conſcience ſome ſecret apprehenſion, that theſe oppoſed, theſe rejected, theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided truths of the goſpel may, after all <hi>prove true.</hi> And if there be ſuch an apprehenſion, then let conſcience do its office, and convince you of the impious madneſs of acting as if they were <hi>moſt certainly and demonſtrably falſe.</hi> Let it tell you at large, how poſſible it is that <hi>haply you may be found fighting againſt God</hi>: That, bold as you are in deſying the terrors of the Lord, you may poſſibly fall
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:017924_0068_0FA378DF09A79E60"/>
into his hands; may chance to hear that deſpiſed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which when you hear it from the mouth of the eternal Judge, you will not be able to deſpiſe: I will repeat it again, in ſpite of all your ſcorn, <hi>you may hear</hi> the King ſay to you, <hi>Depart accurſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any thing farther needs to be added, it is by way of direction, how to ſhun the baneful influence of theſe dangerous opinions, which it is the buſineſs of ſome, at this day, to propagate with great apparent zeal.</p>
            <p>And here the firſt thing that occurs is, to ſearch the ſcriptures, which are the infallible ſtandard of truth and error. We ſhould carry every doctrine, which offers it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to our belief, "to the law and to the teſtimony," and abide that divine deciſion. The rule is perfect. The only danger lies in the miſapplication, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is too often the caſe. No corrupt principle of a religious nature, hath ever failed to preſs the bible into its ſervice, and claim the ſanction of divine authority. But though ſome disjointed ſentences in the word of God, may ſeem to countenance the moſt abſurd and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious opinions, and their votaries may fly to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſanctuary for protection; yet the ſacred oracles taken in their general connection, fully reprobate every falſe ſcheme of religion that ever has been, or ever can be deviſed. They draw ſuch a character of the Supreme Being, of Jeſus Chriſt, of the Divine Spirit, of the human heart, and of the genuine nature and effects of pure and undefiled religion, that the <hi>doctrines according to godlineſs,</hi> may be clearly diſtinguiſhed from all their counterfeits. The ſcriptures in general have a plain, determinate,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:017924_0069_0FA378E146F53830"/>
conſiſtent meaning, which may be clearly underſtood. Therefore no two oppoſite doctrines of religion can both be agreeable to the word of God; but one or the other muſt neceſſarily ſtand condemned by it. Hence, for inſtance, if the doctrine of eternal puniſhments be really <hi>agreeable</hi> to the bible, as we have endeavoured to ſhow, then the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation is entirely <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to it, and not one text that can be found, does, in its true ſenſe, give the leaſt degree of evidence in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. This being the caſe, there is all encouragement to ſearch the ſcriptures, to ſee which of theſe two dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite doctrines is true. It would be ſtrange indeed if this could not be determined by every <hi>honeſt</hi> enquirer. If any are in doubt therefore, we would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to take heed to this ſure word of prophecy, which is able to make them wiſe unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>In the next place, there is caution to be uſed againſt the ſeduction of thoſe who propagate corrupt and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſentiments. Be not deceived by their pretenſions to ſuperior penetration and knowledge. Men of the ſtrongeſt minds and moſt extenſive literature have often committed the groſſeſt blunders in their religious ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and then employed all their learning and abilities to maintain and propagate them. Some of the enemies of divine revelation, and of the peculiar doctrines of the goſpel, have diſplayed ſhining talents and a profuſion of learning, in pleading the cauſe of error, and attempting to ſhake the pillars of our holy religion. And many of their admirers appear to have been dazzled and allured into their ſnares by an implicit faith in their great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But this betrays weakneſs. Great men are not always wiſe: They are liable to err; and therefore we
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:017924_0070_0FA378E205B2BD80"/>
ſhould examine their opinions as well as thoſe of other men, and admit them only upon the foot of real evidence.</p>
            <p>Nor are we to be biaſſed in favour of men's licentious principles, on account of their amiable moral characters. It is a juſt obſervation of Dr. Brown, that men of ſtrict morality have often diſſeminated the moſt licentious and pernicious doctrines. It is well known, that Epicurus, the father of doctrinal licentiouſneſs, never lived up to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but maintained a regular and exemplary life. Spinoſa, the father of ſpeculative <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> was a man of ſobriety and apparent devotion. Lord Herbert, who was, if not the father, yet the principal advocate for <hi>Deiſm</hi> in the laſt century, appears to have had a ſerious mind, and a conſcientious regard to duty. And we Know that ſome of the advocates for univerſal ſalvation, are men of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able natural diſpoſitions and fair moral characters. But ought we hence to entertain a more favourable regard for atheiſm, deiſm, or any other licentious doctrines. By no means. Thoſe principles are ſtill to be ſhuned at the peril of our ſouls.</p>
            <p>Nor again, are we to believe the propagators of error, though they throw out the moſt pompous and ſolemn aſſeverations of their ſincerity, impartiality and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intercourſe with the Deity, and concern for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Tho' we ſcruple not their ſincerity, yet we ſcruple the propriety of throwing out the profeſſion of it, which can have no tendency to enlighten, but only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the minds of the credulous. This, which we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to call an artifice, is often employed by the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for univerſal ſalvation. Mr. White, in his treatiſe
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:017924_0071_0FA378E2C5F4A880"/>
on the univerſal reſtoration of all ſinful creatures to the divine favour, <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 6.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> makes the moſt ſolemn aſſeverations of his ſincerity and ſacred regard for the divine glory. His expreſſions are theſe,
<q>And here I do in the fear of God moſt humbly proſtrate myſelf before his divine Majeſty, and in the deepeſt ſenſe of my own darkneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from him, do with all my might beg of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs I am endeavouring to repreſent to others, that if ſomething like this platform and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of things, be not agreeable to that revealed and natural light he hath given to us, that my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be interrupted and my deſign fall, and that the Lord would pardon my attempt: and I know he will do ſo, for he hath given me to have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concern for this matter, than as I apprehend it to be a moſt glorious truth, witneſſed to both by the ſcriptures of truth and by the moſt eſſential principles of our own reaſon, and which will be found at the laſt opening of the everlaſting goſpel, to recover in that opening a degenerate world.</q>
Mr. Relly holds out the ſame lure to his readers, to place an implicit faith in the rectitude of his views, and the divinity of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. In a preface to one volume of his writings, he aſſures his readers that his diſcourſes were delivered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore, without any previous ſtudy or forethought, and flowed from his lips as they were dictated by the divine ſpirit. For ſays he, I followed that divine direction given to the apoſtles, "Take no thought beforehand what ye ſhall ſpeak, neither do ye premeditate: for it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Holy Ghoſt." How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptous is it for any man, at this day, to pretend to imitate the apoſtles in this reſpect! and eſpecially for
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:017924_0072_0FA378E386226F40"/>
Mr. Relly, who in his writings every where ridicules all experimental religion, inward, piety, holy affections, and chriſtian graces and tempers!</p>
            <p>Error often employs ſuch <hi>artifices</hi> as truth neither needs nor approves. They ſometimes, however, prove ſucceſsful, and deceive the inattentive and unguarded. Thoſe who uſe them therefore are dangerous perſons, and their corrupting influence is ſtudiouſly to be avoided. Their doctrines are fatal if imbibed; and even when they are not fully adopted, they tend to harden the heart, and ſtupify the conſcience. The bare thought that ſome maintain that all will be ſaved, begets a ſecret hope that poſſibly it may be true, and that there is not ſo much danger in <hi>impenitence</hi> and <hi>unbelief</hi> as many have long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined, and pretended. Therefore to hear the <hi>univerſaliſts</hi> preach, or read their writings, merely to know what they can ſay in defence of their errors, is like Eve's liſtening to the reaſoning of the ſerpent, and may, in the event, prove equally fatal. Accordingly the ſcripture character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes falſe teachers, and warns you to avoid them. The apoſtle Paul, who was troubled with the perverters of the goſpel, treats them with great plainneſs and ſeverity. "But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other goſpel unto you, than that which we have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, let him be accurſed. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, if any man preach any other goſpel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." The apoſtle John directs man to have no intimate connection with falſe teachers. "If any come unto you, and bring not this doctrine, that is the doctrine of Chriſt mentioned in the preceeding verſe, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed. For he that biddeth him God ſpeed, is partaker of his evil deeds."
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:017924_0073_0FA378E4442441C8"/>
And Solomon gives a ſimilar caution and direction. "Ceaſe, my ſon, to hear the inſtruction that <hi>cauſeth to err.</hi>" Thus you have not only the voice of reaſon, but the voice of God to warn you to ſhun the preſence and influence of thoſe that lie wait to deceive.</p>
            <p>The laſt direction is, to repent and believe the goſpel. This will place you beyond the reach of all fatal errors. When your hearts are eſtabliſhed with grace, you will no longer be liable to be carried about with diverſe and ſtrange doctrines. When you yield cordial obedience to the divine will, there is a promiſe that you ſhall know of doctrines whether they be of God. When you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpel from the <hi>heart,</hi> it will be out of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan or any of his inſtruments to deceive you. When you ſincerely love God, all things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for your good, and prepare you more and more for the great, and glorious, and ſolemn ſcenes, which death, judgment and eternity will ſoon open to your view. But ſo long as you remain in a ſtate of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and unbelief, you are in imminent danger of making ſhip wreck not only of your faith, but of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and immortal ſouls. Though you ſhould eſcape every fatal error, and in ſpeculation, clearly underſtand every doctrine of the goſpel, yet if you hold even <hi>the truth</hi> in unrighteouſneſs, you will certainly periſh. An ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox creed and a fair <hi>external</hi> appearance are of no avail, in point of divine acceptance, without a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, and an <hi>unfeigned love</hi> of the truth. For <hi>with the heart</hi> man believeth unto righteouſneſs: And <hi>without holineſs</hi> no man ſhall ſee the Lord. Therefore let the wicked forſake his way, and the <hi>unrighteous</hi> man <hi>his thoughts</hi>: And let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:017924_0074_0FA378E505E8AA30"/>
pardon. Nor is there the leaſt excuſe for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's delay. Behold, now is the accepted time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, now is the day of ſalvation. Life and death are now ſet before you. This is the only day of grace and ſpace of repentance you will ever enjoy. You are now placed between two vaſt eternities of happineſs and woe. You are therefore of all the creatures of God, in the moſt critical, ſerious and ſolemn ſituation. Your life, or your death, your happineſs, or your miſery for a boundleſs eternity, is ſuſpended on the ſlender thread of life. And death is advancing with rapid ſpeed to ſeal up your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the judgment of the great day; when in the view of the aſſembled univerſe, you muſt hear your doom, and either riſe with the righteous to manſions of eternal bliſs, or ſink with the wicked down to regions of eternal darkneſs, horror and deſpair! Be intreated then, O ſinner, to agree with thine adverſary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, leaſt he deliver thee to the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be caſt into priſon. Verily thou ſhalt by no means come out thence, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing.!!</p>
