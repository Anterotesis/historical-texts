            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HORRORS OF OAKENDALE ABBEY.</head>
            <p>IN the gloomy month of November, when the mountains in Cumberland were almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by the heavy black clouds which hung be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their tops, and a thick drippling rain ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left the few ſcattered cottages of Oakendale diſcernable, the peaſants were all retired to their habitations; and through this thick atmoſphere the ſtately ruins of the antient Abbey appeared like a black maſs of immenſe length, and could only be diſtinguiſhed as a building, by the glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering twinkling of the ſmall panes of glaſs from ſome of the many windows which were diſperſed, without uniformity, in this gloomy ſtructure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035640_0003_10069263A8603E20"/>
The church clock had ſtruck five, when a loud knocking at the cottage of Aaron Giles (who was intruſted with the keys of the Abbey) rouſed him from a ſlumber to which the labours of the day, and the ſtillneſs of the evening, had compoſed him, and cauſed a ſtrange alarm to the reſt of his family, conſiſting of a notable Dame, now ſeated at the ſpinning-wheel, a beautiful girl about fourteen years of age, and two ſtout boys, who were quietly eating a piece of brown bread.—"Lord," cried the wife and daughter, both in the ſame breath, "what can that be!—Don't open the door, father," ſaid the girl, "for fear it ſhould be one of the ſpirits from the Abbey."</p>
            <p>The repeated knocking ſufficiently awakened Aaron, terrified the reſt of the family, and a voice demanded inſtant admittance.</p>
            <p>Aaron, half bold, and half afraid, regardleſs of the entreaties of thoſe about him, ventured to undraw the bolt, and aſk "Who was there?"</p>
            <p>"You muſt open the door," replied a quick voice, "and deliver to me the keys of the Abbey."</p>
            <p>Aaron, who had by this time opened the door ſufficiently to diſtinguiſh a ſervant well mounted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035640_0004_10069266A58963E8"/>
with a livery great coat on, entirely loſt all fear and replied, "The keys of the Abbey! why, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body would venture there at this time of night what can they be wanted for?"</p>
            <p>"For a lady," replied the ſervant, "who will be here within two hours, and you muſt go with me; and your wife muſt come alſo, to make a fire, and get things in a little order and comfort for my Lady."</p>
            <p>"Order and comfort for my Lady!" ſaid Aaron, (holding the door faſt in his hand) "I am ſure there is no order or comfort to be had there."</p>
            <p>"No, no," ſaid his wife, advancing fearfully; nobody don't like to go there in day-time, much more when it is dark; and maſter muſt not deliver the keys to any but my Lord himſelf, or to Muſter Acre, the ſteward."</p>
            <p>"Prithee, give me the keys," ſaid the ſervant "and keep me here no longer; for I have orders, both from my Lord and Mr. Acre, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

bit; as for going to the Abbey, it was ſooner ſaid than done.—Why," ſaid he, "you do not know what you aſk; we might be carried away, and never heard on any more. I never ventures in there without two or three as ſtout as myſelf with me, and then we be juſt frightened out of our lives."</p>
            <p>"Never fear," replied the footman, who had by this time diſmounted, and was advancing into the houſe; at the ſame time taking a piſtol from his pocket, which he held in a menacing manner, ſaying, "What the devil are you afraid of? Why, I will engage to blow up all the ghoſts in the country, if you will give me a draught of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to drink, for I am deviliſh dry."</p>
            <p>The good woman, tremblingly replied, "She would give him ſome cyder, provided he would put up the piſtol, and not be blaſphemous; and the poor little girl, who with her brothers had fled to the further corner of the room, on ſeeing the piſtol which he ſtill held in his hand, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fell upon her knees, and begged him not to kill them, for none of them had done any harm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:035640_0006_1006926DC8EDE768"/>
The beauty and innocence of this girl ſoftened the valiant boaſtings of the footman; and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly returned the piſtol to his pocket, ſaying. "No, my pretty dear, I have no intention to hurt you."</p>
            <p>During this time, Aaron was reading a letter the ſervant had given him, which contained an order from Lord Oakendale, for his inſtantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Abbey for the reception of a Lady, who would be there on that very evening. Aaron, terrified at the idea of the undertaking, and yet ſeeing the neceſſity of his obedience, inſtantly ſummoned two of his neighbours, who, together with the footman and himſelf, prepared with lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erns to venture into that Abbey, which, even in the day-time, none of the inhabitants ever dared to enter, and which had been the terror of many generations. Some of the rooms were habitable, and it occupied in length many hundred feet of ground. A great part of it conſiſted of low crumbling walls, long paſſages, or cloiſters, and it had a communication with the village church. It was likewiſe ſuppoſed that there were vaults and ſubterraneous paſſages under the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The thickneſs of the walls beſpoke the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035640_0007_10069272EFEB74C0"/>
of its date, and the ſtrength of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip defied the ravages of time; indeed no perſon in theſe parts pretended to trace its origin. For the laſt hundred years it had deſcended with the Earldom of Oakendale; but was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to have been inhabited for more than a few days.</p>
            <p>The tradition of the country recorded a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful murder that had been perpetrated in one of the rooms, which was evidently ſtained with blood; and various tales were handed down to poſterity, with additional wonders according to the prolific fancy of the relater.</p>
            <p>One circumſtance had lately impreſſed the minds, of the villagers with an aſſurance of its being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of ſupernatural powers, which was, that of a young man (about three months before the preſent period) having arrived at the village, demanded the keys, and determined to explore the Abbey alone, and no trace or veſtige having ever ſince been diſcovered concerning him. The keys were found in the doors; nor was the horſe he came upon ever enquired after!

Giles, with bed-clothes and other neceſſaries, In order to prepare for the expected Lady. The children followed with trembling ſteps, equally afraid to be left at home as to proceed with their mother.</p>
            <p>Upon entering the great door, which was plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a porch like that of a church, its ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weight creeked upon its maſſy hinges, the echoes of which ſounded with a tremendous noiſe. A ſmall narrow paſſage led to a large hall, with high grated windows; at the four corners of which were narrow paſſages leading to different apartments. In the centre of the hall were two folding doors, which opened into a ſpacious room, the top of which terminated into a dome of great height; a ſtaircaſe on the right led to various rooms, long galleries, narrow paſſages and cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; long ranges of building extended on each ſide of the part they had entered, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the only habitable place in this immenſe pile of building; and in theſe the walls were ſo damp, and even of thoſe that were covered, the hangings were ſo ragged, and the whole ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of furniture, that not the moſt diſtant idea of comfort could be imagined for the poor Lady.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035640_0009_1006927ACA6919A0"/>
who was the expected inhabitant of this gloomy manſion.</p>
            <p>After having ſwept away the cobwebs, and cleared ſome of the dirt, the good woman began to conſider where the poor Lady was to ſleep, for as yet they had not ventured up ſtairs; nor did they know if there was ſuch a thing as a bed-lodging to the Abbey. Not one of them would ſtir a foot without the reſt attended; even the valiant footman would not proceed alone, altho he pretended to bluſter and throw open the doors one after another, ſwearing at, and defying all the ghoſts in Chriſtendom; whilſt the more timid inhabitants of the village ſtared with fear and aſtoniſhment at his temerity.</p>
            <p>Beds there were, but ſcarcely in a condition to accommodate any one; and, when Dame Giles ſurveyed the tattered velvet of the curtains, and beheld the nodding teſter of immenſe height, ſhe derived a ſecret comfort from the compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this, and much in favor of her own humble chamber at the cottage.</p>
            <p>Having arranged every thing in as much order as the time and place would admit, and having
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035640_0010_1006927D886E4788"/>
met with nothing to alarm or terrify them, they ſat down in expectation of the arrival of the Lady. They had not waited long before a chaiſe and four horſes (with ſome difficulty, on account of the weeds and briars which impeded their way to the porch) drew up. When the chaiſe door was opened by the footman a very beautiful young Lady appeared, eager to jump out. She was followed by another, who ſeemed older, and, as an attendant, every way inferior to the Lady herſelf; the attractions of whoſe perſon at once inſpired the hearts of the beholders with equal wonder, pity and aſtoniſhment, that ſo charming a young creature ſhould be conſigned to ſo dreary and wretched a ſolitude.</p>
            <p>If they were loſt in wonder and ſurpriſe at her beauty, how infinitely more was their admiration excited when, in the moſt melodious accents and engaging manner, ſhe addreſſed the woman and the gazing peaſants, by aſking them "If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided there, and if they could aſſure her there were no other perſons in the Abbey?</p>
            <p>"Lack-a-day!" ſaid Dame Giles, "we be none on us to ſtay here; we only comed to make a fire, and get a little ready for your Ladyſhip
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035640_0011_10069282CDEF8140"/>
and I'm <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as how you'll find it very lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome being in this diſmal place by yourſelves."</p>
            <p>"Not at all," returned the Lady, "provided I am unmoleſted."</p>
            <p>Dame Giles looked grave, and thought within herſelf that was not certain; but ſhe would not ſay any thing that might occaſion fears of evil ſpirits to this young Lady, who ſeemed entirely free from any ſuch apprehenſions, and for whom ſhe conceived the higheſt veneration, mixed with the tendereſt pity, for being deſtined to an abode in her opinion, ſo dangerous.</p>
            <p>When ſhe attended her to the apartment where the bed was, and apologized for the coarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſheets and bed clothes, which had been furniſhed from her cottage, the Lady gave a look of ſurpriſe at the antiquity of the bed, and the gloomy magnificence of the room, which was large, with an immenſe fire-place; a long gothic window on the right, on the ſmall pains of which were painted ſerpents, dragons, and ſuch unmeaning and hideous monſters; a ſmaller window was placed in a corner on the left, and the ragged tapeſtry repreſented ſtill more horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble figures, all of which waved in life-like move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035640_0012_100692848D23C500"/>
as the air (admitted by the door) fanned the looſe hanging on which they were repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—She ſurveyed in ſilence the diſmal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the whole; and then ſaid (with a ſigh) "I ſhall find no fault I believe; but ſhall proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſleep quieter than I have done for many nights paſt, in pleaſanter rooms, and beds that ſeemed better calculated for repoſe."</p>
            <p>The perſon who had come with her ſeemed to ſurvey every thing with a countenance of horror, and an expreſſion of fear; and, turning to the young Lady, ſaid, "My dear Madam, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that we can ſtay in this melancholy place alone? Why, I never ſaw any thing half ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; I ſhall not, I am ſure, cloſe my eyes in that frightful bed. Cannot you," addreſſing Dame Giles, "ſtay with us to night?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied the other; "I cannot, at the ſame time thinking ſhe would not, for all the world."</p>
            <p>The young Lady, whoſe name was Laura, ſaid to her companion, "Why, ſurely you are not afraid of ghoſts! and at preſent: I ſee nothing elſe to fear here; but, addreſſing herſelf to the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035640_0013_10069288AA5E4C58"/>
daughter of Dame Giles, who was cloſe to her mother, ſhe ſaid, "Perhaps you will ſtay with us, my little maid; and when there are three of us we cannot be afraid."</p>
            <p>"No," ſaid Peggy, "I wo nut ſtay."</p>
            <p>"Well, as you pleaſe," ſaid Laura; "and as I am much fatigued, I will not detain you any longer."</p>
            <p>Dame Giles repleniſhed the fire, left them a ſufficient number of lights, and departed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to come there early in the morning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their breakfaſts. Meantime the footman had been giving orders to Aaron to go to the next market town, and provide them with every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their accommodation. He then deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter into the hands of Laura, and then reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectfully withdrew. He returned to the cottage with Aaron, and the other two men; where, mounting his horſe, he rode away.

Having left Laura and her companion in the Abbey, and the inhabitants of Oakendale quietly taking their repoſe, it may be neceſſary to give the reader ſome account of the family to whom the Abbey belonged, and how Laura came to be its preſent inhabitant.</p>
            <p>The preſent Lord Oakendale had ſucceeded in a lenial deſcent to the Earldom and eſtates of Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale. His great-grandfather was the only one that the oldeſt inhabitant of the village could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and that memory was impreſſed by wicked and atrocious deeds, ſaid to have been committed by this old Earl, ſince which time it had never been inhabited more than for a few days, when the preſent Lord's father brought down a beautiful woman, who was his wife, and mother to the preſent Earl; her picture was ſaid to be ſtill in one of the rooms.</p>
            <p>It was currently reported, that various figures had been ſeen flitting about after twilight; ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſions had appeared, ſmeared with blood; and the ghoſt of a lady, who was ſuppoſed to have been murdered in one of the rooms, was uſually ſeen after it was dark looking through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, with ſtreams of blood running from her
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035640_0015_1006928AA198E038"/>
throat. Tales of this nature had filled the minds of the ſimple villagers with dreadful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but what had given more reaſonable colour and ſtrength to theſe fears were, two circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which had happened within only a twelve-month of each other; one was, that of a young gentleman's never being heard of after going to explore the Abbey; the other, of another gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's endeavoring to ſleep there, who was ſo extremely terrified by noiſes, howlings and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, that, although a determined and reſolute man, he was obliged to relinquiſh the deſign, and to paſs the remainder of the night with one of the villagers in a cottage.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale, the preſent Earl, had never ſeen the Abbey; he had no doubt heard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, but, being a very diſſipated man, he gave no heed to them, much leſs had any deſire to have them inveſtigated. He was the eldeſt of two brothers, who were the only ſurviving ſons of a numerous progeny. Their diſpoſitions, manners, perſons and ſentiments, were, from their earlieſt childhood, ſo totally oppoſite, that not the moſt diſtant ſimilarity could ever be diſcovered. Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert, the elder, who was the preſent Earl, was
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035640_0016_1006928FEC0BE100"/>
haughty, imperious, vindictive, vain and artful, and, if any ſpring of latent virtue aroſe in his heart, it was ſuppreſſed and overpowered by theſe vices. His perſon was far ſuperior to his mind; for there, indeed, the graces ſhone forth with conſpicuous luſtre. He was tall, well proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of a bold and manly countenance. His brother William, though leſs in ſtature, was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well made, and had the moſt engaging and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive features. An expreſſive countenance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played a mind fraught with every manly virtue that could adorn a chriſtian and a ſoldier. At a very early age he entered the army, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf in the ſervice of his country by more than one noble and gallant action; during which time his brother was leading a life, not only of inactivity, but of unlimited debauchery of every kind. Two years after the death of the late Earl, he found himſelf ſo embarraſſed and his fortune ſo little equal to his expences, that he was under the neceſſity of repairing it by a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in which love formed no part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>

Miſs. Rainsford, the only child of Lord W<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven, was the exact counterpart of her lover, if the appellation of lover could be given to one whoſe motives were guided by the deſire of wealth or ambition; an union, founded upon ſuch a baſis, could be productive of nothing but ſatie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſcord; her fortune was perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to him, and having ſecured that, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a determined hatred to her. She followed her inclinations entirely; and, as they entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a mutual indifference for each other, contempt and averſion ſoon followed.</p>
            <p>Meantime William returned from the field of battle crowned with laurels and univerſal eſteem. His many virtues called forth the envy and hatred of his brother, who could by no means bear to ſee himſelf ſo far eclipſed; and as this jealouſy rankled in his heart, under the ſpecious cover of love and regard he continued to undermine his advancement, and prevent his gaining that rank to which his merits ſo juſtly entitled him.—Unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, and judging of every heart by his own, William could not ſee through the hypocriſy of Lord Oakendale; and with a contented mind he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently waited the diſpenſations of fortune. Thus
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035640_0018_10069296D298E128"/>
looking forward with hope, with tender adieus to his brother, to whom he looked as his only relation and beſt friend, he embarked with his regiment for the Eaſt Indies. In the mean time Lord Oakendale continued his diſſipated life, and, having no children, he had formed no ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conjugal felicity. He had met with Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra in a very obſcure part of South Wales, where he had been bathing the preceding autumn. He was wonderfully ſtruck with her beauty, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together pleaſed with her manners. From the firſt moment he beheld her, he was determined to poſſeſs her perſon; and finding, upon acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that an uncommon, delicacy and virtuous principle governed all her actions, he carefully concealed from her that he was a married man till he had learned her ſituation, and had, as he thought, made an intereſt in her affections, and ſecured every bar which might oppoſe his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But, as her hiſtory will make a principle part of this work, we ſhall only at preſent inform our readers, that he had ſent her to this diſmal abode, under the idea that the horrors of the place, and the obſcurity of the village, would ſooner diſpoſe a mind, like hers, to coincide with his wiſhes, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

The letter the footman had left with her was from his Lordſhip, containing an apology for his having conſigned her to ſo melancholy and rude a ſituation; aſſuring her that he ſhould not intrude upon her retirement without her permiſſion, and concluding with his unalterable love and reſpect.</p>
            <p>After Dame Giles and the other villagers had left Laura and ſhe heard the gate of the Abbey locked upon her, a ſound which terrified her more fearful companion, ſhe opened and peruſed Lord Oakendale's letter, which having careleſsly read, and gathering ſatisfaction from his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of not coming there, ſhe propoſed going to bed, with the idea of enjoying a better night's reſt than ſhe had experienced for many of the paſt: but her companion wiſhed to ſit up, being, as ſhe declared, afraid to conſign herſelf to ſleep in ſo diſmal a room, and ſtill more diſmal looking bed. Laura, who entertained no fears of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, determined to undreſs herſelf, and ſeek that repoſe of which ſhe ſtood in need; and Mary, her companion, being equally afraid to ſit up, if Laura ſhould go to ſleep; therefore, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly, prepared to do the ſame. Laura, whoſe body was fatigued, and her mind totally diveſted
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035640_0020_1006929C13D299A8"/>
of fear, ſoon fell into a profound ſleep; but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without ever having heard any tales concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Abbey gave way to the fancies ſhe form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its appearance; and a thouſand appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, of ſhe knew not what, made her afraid to open her eyes, or to ſhut them, and by that means deſtroyed every idea of reſt. She ſeveral times attempted to awake Laura, but found it impoſſible; ſhe was therefore obliged to attend to the various noiſes which aſſailed her ear, without being able either to communicate her fears, or receive any comfort from her companion. The account ſhe gave in the morning, was, that ſoon after ſhe had been in bed, ſhe plainly heard the ſound of doors opening and ſhutting, and upon liſtening more attentively, ſhe heard voices whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, and footſteps at, or very near, the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door. All theſe relations, when repeated in the morning to Laura, ſhe treated as idle chimeras of a fearful apprehenſion; declaring ſhe had never in her life ſlept better, and that it was her fixed reſolution to explore every part of the Abbey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enſuing night.</p>
            <p>Dame Giles, attended by her daughter, arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Abbey with their breakfaſts; and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035640_0021_100692A1C316B5E0"/>
pleaſed at finding them ſafe where ſhe had left them, began making the fire, and moving about with more alacrity than ſhe had done the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night; but gave little or no anſwer to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories of Mary concerning the Abbey, and who or what beings beſides themſelves were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the inhabitants of it.</p>
            <p>Dame Giles ſaid, "She knew of nobody being in it but themſelves;" and, not willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her fears, added, "That the paſſages were long and narrow, and the wind might whiſtle and draw through them like voices."</p>
            <p>Laura, whoſe beautiful countenance, refreſhed by ſleep was animated with uncommon luſtre, laughed at their converſation; again declaring her intention of taking a ſurvey of the Abbey, as well as walking round the hills which ſeemed to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round it; the beauty of which ſhe admired as ſhe viewed them through the ſmall caſements of the windows.</p>
            <p>The ſun ſhone upon the tops of the hills, and its ſilver rays, which reflected upon the froſty turf with a dazzling whiteneſs, gave it a cheerful appearance.—"Tell me not, ſaid ſhe, of voices
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035640_0022_100692A372769058"/>
and noiſes, here is nothing to create fear; hark, how the robin twitters his gentle note; and ſee how the froſt glitters upon the verdure! The winds only beſpeak the wintry ſeaſon, but noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſpire notions either of fear or dread. Ah! would fortune but ſmile upon me with the ſame benign aſpect that the face of nature does, how little I ſhould have to regret; and how well ſhould I be pleaſed to remain all my days in this ſequeſtered retirement? But, alas! no ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs awaits me—a poor unprotected orphan, without a claim upon any human being, nothing but my own courage and virtue to guard me from the power of a villain! Ah me! my own reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the bittereſt accompaniments of my ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude." During this ſoliloquy, which burſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily from the oppreſſed heart of Laura, her two companions ſtood in mute attention, the one knowing or partly gueſſing, that ſhe had juſt reaſon for her complaints, and the other ſtaring at her without well underſtanding the meaning of her ſpeech; which, being uttered in a pathetic voice, and in ſentiments rather above her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, induced her to entertain the idea of her being mad, and brought there for confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035640_0023_100692A6682F9CE8"/>
but when Laura turned her lovely face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and the pearly tears chaſed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther down the faireſt cheeks that nature ever formed, whilſt her expreſſive eyes ſeemed to aſk for pity's ſoothing voice, the gentler paſſions ſtole upon the heart of Dame Giles; ſhe felt the moſt tender pity for the fair object before her, and, in a melting ſtrain, ſhe replied, "God help you, my poor young lady; ſure no body would go to hurt ſo ſweet a creature!" and looking at Mary, as if to gather ſome information from her concerning who and what they were, ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, "Ah, ye muſt comfort one another, ſeeing, as I ſuppoſe, ye be ſent here by our Lord's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and to be ſure it is a melancholy place, and ſom how I never thought as I could a been in it ſo long at a time; but uſe makes perfect, and I bent ſo feared now as I was laſt night; and when I comes again to get your dinners, I thinks I ſhant be afeard at all."</p>
            <p>"No," ſaid Laura, "here is nothing to be afraid of; and I muſt deſire you will give me the keys of all the rooms in the Abbey, that I may have the ſatisfaction of going over them."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:035640_0024_100692AA11E4FA78"/>
"Why," ſaid Dame Giles, "then here they be (at the ſame time giving her a bunch of ruſty keys); but I think as how you had better be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this here room, and them that ye ſee below, for I believe the others be but diſmal pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by all account; for I never ſeed them ſince I was a little un, and then went but a little way, and we was a good many on us."</p>
            <p>"And what did you ſee?" ſaid Mary, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</p>
            <p>"Laws, Madam!" ſaid Dame Giles, "I cant remember;" and ſo ſaying ſhe haſtened to leave them to make the ſearch by themſelves, leſt they ſhould have requeſted her to accompany them.</p>
            <p>She was no ſooner gone, and their breakfaſt over, than Laura, taking up the keys, ſaid, "Come Mary, let us begin our ſurvey. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe myſelf great amuſement from the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I deſire you will have no fears."</p>
            <p>Mary looked as if ſhe had rather have been excuſed; but caſting her eyes round the room with a fearful kind of obſervation, the ſun, which glimmering through the narrow panes of glaſs,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035640_0025_100692ADD1E5AA40"/>
diffuſed a cheering light, and rendered every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject leſs gloomy than it had appeared the night before by only the light of the candles; ſhe therefore conſented to attend Laura, who led the way; and having left their chamber, ſhe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her right along a low dark gallery, on the ſides of which ſome doors opened into ſmall rooms, moſt of them dark, and others admitting but ſmall portion of light, entirely without furniture except an old high backed chair, or the remain of an old ſtuffed couch.</p>
            <p>The end of the gallery terminated in a narrow ſtone ſtair caſe, down which Laura, followed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ome ſubterraneous abode.</p>
            <p>Laura endeavored to ſummon all her courage, and, regardleſs of her companion's entreaties, was venturing to explore the cloiſter, when a ruſtling noiſe made her ſtart, and retreat from the low arch which led to its entrance.</p>
            <p>Mary ſcreamed with affright, and ſtood with her hands held before her eyes, left they ſhould encounter ſome ſight too terrific for her to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Laura likewiſe trembled; the boughs of the yew tree waved their dark branches againſt the window, and the whole appearance of the place augmented her fears. She took her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion's arm, and was haſtily preparing to return, when a large trunk, or coffer, which ſtood in one corner of the room, attracted her notice, and ſhe
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035640_0027_100692B3064C26F0"/>
inſtantly accounted for the ruſtling, by ſuppoſing that a rat or mouſe might be withinſide of it; and, as this idea diſpelled her fears, and renewed her courage, ſhe advanced to the place where it ſtood, determined to lift up the lid, and ſee what it contained. She did ſo; but how was ſhe ſtruck with horror and aſtoniſhment, when the ſkeleton of a human body preſented itſelf to her affrighted view! She gave an involuntary ſcream, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the lid from her trembling hand, the ſound, echoing through the hollow roofs, vibrated with terror upon her palpitating heart; and ſhe had juſt ſufficient power to ſay to Mary, in a tremulous voice, "Let us be gone."</p>
            <p>Mary, who had not ſeen what the trunk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but remained ſome paces behind, with her hands covering her eyes, on perceiving that Laura had diſcovered ſomething frightful, was ſtill more alarmed, and haſtily advanced to make an eſcape from a room, which, from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe beheld it, had filled her with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Laura had juſt ſtrength enough to lock the door, and then proceeded back again to their own apartment, which, in compariſon with thoſe they had been viewing, appeared light and pleaſant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:035640_0028_100692B842943F70"/>
Mary congratulated herſelf on her return, and told Laura ſhe hoped ſhe had now enough of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the Abbey, which preſented nothing but diſmal places and frightful objects; and ſhe had no doubt was haunted by ſome of the people who had, ſhe was ſure, been murdered there; nor had ſhe any doubt but their ghoſts would appear at night, and inform them who were their murderers.</p>
            <p>Laura begged ſhe would not give way to ſuch idle fancies. "That I have been frightened," ſays ſhe, "I confeſs; and I alſo confeſs, that I am aſhamed of myſelf for being ſo. A little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and recollection will conquer my fears, and enable me, at ſome future day, to put my deſign in execution, and ſurvey every part of the Abbey. What was there to fear in ſeeing the bones of a fellow-creature, whoſe peaceful aſhes were as qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly depoſited there as in the mouldering earth? As to ghoſts, ſhe believed in no ſuch thing; it was not the dead from whom ſhe had any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and ſhe would never believe that the righteous Judge of all the earth, and on whom alone ſhe placed her confidence, would ſuffer her to be viſited and terrified for the ſins of former
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035640_0029_100692B9E8828778"/>
ages. If any neceſſary diſcoveries were to be made thro' her means, ſhe might, and ought to be thankful for being conſidered as an inſtrument worthy to bring good out of evil. That we ſhould be alarmed at the ſight of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when they had no longer any power to hurt us, was a ſad proof of the weakneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of our nature, and ſhe owned ſhe felt the force of that depravity in having been ſo much frightened at what ſhe had ſeen; and although ſhe could not boaſt of any ſuperior courage, yet it ſhewed her the neceſſity of making the utmoſt of that reaſon which had been ſo liberally diffuſed in our compoſitions for the beſt and wiſeſt purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es." Thus ſhe reaſoned, and having no one to oppoſe her arguments (for Mary ſat in ſilent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of her judgement and eloquence), ſhe had worked herſelf up to a kind of enthuſiaſtic courage, and ſaid ſhe would again venture to complete her deſign, and would not even aſk Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to accompany her, if ſhe had any fears; for her own part ſhe felt equal to the attempt, and was riſing in order to put her deſign in execution, when Mary beſought her to deſiſt: "Pray," ſays ſhe, "defer it till Dame Giles comes at dinner time, and perhaps ſhe will go with you; for, as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035640_0030_100692BD7223B568"/>
to myſelf, I cannot accompany you; and I ſhould be as much afraid to ſtay here alone."</p>
            <p>Laura allowed herſelf to be perſuaded, and had leſs difficulty in getting Mary to take a walk with her on the outſide of the Abbey before the ſun went down, for ſhe had no ſort of objection to turning her back upon ſo diſmal an abode, and would have been heartily glad never to have ſet her foot in the inſide any more. They according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeded down the ſtaircaſe, and out of the door through which they had entered the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night.</p>
            <p>Laura had now an opportunity of obſerving, that the Abbey was ſituated in a deep valley, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by hills of an enormous and ſtupendous height, whoſe craggy tops ſeemed to bend over the ſpace that contained a few ſcattered cottages, which, with a ſmall old church and the Abbey, formed the whole of the village. She proceeded to a riſing ground to the right of the building, from whence ſhe had a more perfect view of the Abbey, the length of which appeared to be ſome hundred feet, though it ſeemed much longer than it really was from the lowneſs of the ſtructure. The church was a building of the ſame date; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035640_0031_100692C08D0DC818"/>
was ſometimes performed in it by a neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clergyman, but it appeared, as well as the Abbey, in a very decayed ſtate. A low arch, or cloiſter, ſeemed to run from the right wing of the Abbey, and joined the church-yard.</p>
            <p>Upon examining the ſituation of the windows, and particularly the yew-tree near one of them, Laura was convinced that this arch was the ſame that encloſed the paſſage, or cloiſter, which led from the diſmal room wherein ſhe had ſeen the ſkeleton; and ſhe again reprobated her fears when ſhe conſidered that, as the cloiſter communicated with the church-yard, it was eaſy to ſuppoſe a ſkeleton might well be conveyed to a place ſo near it, for want of room, or for ſome other reaſon; and vexed that this idea had not occurred to her ſooner, ſhe again condemned her fearfulneſs, and determined to make a ſecond attempt as ſoon as another day preſented itſelf.</p>
            <p>The hour now approaching when the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to got dreary, and obſerving Dame Giles coming to prepare their dinner, ſhe propoſed to Mary to return to the Abbey, who followed her companion, although with reluctance; for ſhe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035640_0032_100692C254F0D318"/>
had much rather have encountered the inclemency of the weather, or any other inconvenience, than again venture into the gloomy Abbey; the whole of which Laura was ſo deſirous of exploring, that ſhe was with difficulty perſuaded from making the attempt, even though the day was ſhutting in.</p>
            <p>The night paſſed like the preceding one, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that Laura, when awakened by Mary, almoſt fancied ſhe heard a faint whiſper at the chamber door; but ſhe was unwilling to give credit to ſuch improbable alarms, and was reſolved to place them to thoſe impoſitions of fancy, which the ſtillneſs of the night, and the ſituation of the place might naturally inſpire.</p>
            <p>Her courage completely returned with the light of the morning, and ſhe aroſe pleaſed with the ſcheme ſhe had projected of examining every corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as well as every room in the Abbey, feeling herſelf ſuperior to any fears the enterpriſe might occaſion. For this purpoſe ſhe requeſted Dame Giles would ſtay with Mary during the time ſhe ſhould be gone; and ſhe really felt ſo courageous that ſhe preferred going alone, leſt Mary's fears, by ſuggeſting fooliſh fancies, might create ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like them in herſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:035640_0033_100692C7E7F20B30"/>
She firſt proceeded down the great ſtair caſe, and examined the rooms below, of which ſhe had not taken ſufficient notice either on her entrance, or when ſhe went to walk. The hall was large, dark, and the paving decayed; a ruſty helmet, and a large ſword of an immenſe length, hung againſt a wall half covered with green damp, a folding door, with a top pannel broke, opened to a large room, in the form of a rotundo, with a high arched win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, on which were emblazoned many coats of arms on painted glaſs. Heraldry was Laura's fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourite ſtudy, but ſhe could not give up the preſent time to inveſtigate the arms of the houſe of Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale, ſo much was ſhe bent upon making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries more gratifying to her curioſity. On the left of this room, a door, which appeared in better preſervation, and more modern form than any of the others, attracted her notice. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly opened it, and a full length picture of a Lady, in a Vandyke dreſs, arreſted her attention. The frame had been gilt, and was of heavy carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work; but ſeemed falling to decay, and the canvaſs in ſome places was looſened from it. The portrait exhibited a countenance of the moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive kind; the complexion was beautiful, and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035640_0034_100692CA483DE4D0"/>
the features regular. Laura's eyes were rivetted to it. She could not account for the faſcinating expreſſion which allured her attentive obſervation; ſhe ſtood contemplating the ſoft features till ſhe almoſt fancied the ſweet mouth ſmiled upon her, and ſhe was reluctantly withdrawing herſelf from ſo pleaſing a portrait, in the countenance of which ſhe felt, ſhe knew not how, intereſted; when a faint expreſſion of ſurpriſe burſt from her lips, at obſerving upon the floor near the picture, a ſattin letter-caſe of her own work! Ah! well did ſhe recognize the parting gift ſhe had preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Eugene—her earlieſt lover—her firſt friend—her long lamented Eugene! What ſenſations did the ſight produce! "Ah!" ſays ſhe, "he muſt have been here; what could have brought him to this ſequeſtered place, and where is he now?"</p>
            <p>The laſt idea reſted with a fearful pauſe upon her terrified imagination, which inſtantly ran through a train of melancholy and ſad reflections. She ſtood loſt in wonder and amaze, and her thoughts bewildered in a labyrinth of ſtrange perplexity! The idea of the ſkeleton in the trunk ruſhed upon her recollection with a terrible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment that it might be Eugene's and ſhe felt her blood curdle with horror at the thought. She lo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

all fear of her own ſituation in the ſurpriſe the above circumſtance had occaſioned. She ſtood fixed with the letter-caſe in her hand, the identity of which ſhe could not doubt, having the name of Laura worked, not only by her own hand, but in her hair in the inſide, upon which her eyes reſted in a kind of ſtupor; and in this ſituation ſhe would have remained had not the ſound of footſteps down the great ſtair-caſe rouſed her from her reverie, and made her turn her head not with fear, but in expectation of ſeeing ſome new wonder; it was, however, only Mary and Dame Giles, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought every moment an hour ſince her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and dreading leſt ſomething had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, their impatience and curioſity for once conquered their fears, and by an effort of courage they ventured down the great ſtairs in ſearch of her. Laura could have excuſed the intruſion, and, upon finding her pale and trembling, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded ſhe had been fearfully alarmed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her to return with them up ſtairs. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent anſwers to their queſtions confirmed their belief that fright had affected her ſenſes, and they offered her all the conſolation they could. When ſhe returned to the chamber ſhe recovered in ſome degree, but ſtill remained low and loſt in recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:035640_0036_100692D1992ABBD8"/>
The next day ſhe told Mary ſhe had met with a ſurpriſe, but no fright; and added that ſhe had ſo little fear, ſhe ſhould again walk over the Abbey, and begged ſhe might not be interrupted. Thus ſome time paſſed, and, although ſhe made ſeveral attempts to viſit the room, which contained the ſkeleton, ſhe never found her courage quite equal to the enterpriſe; and, though ſhe reaſoned upon the abſurdity of her fears, and determined to go there, yet her ſteps generally led to the room where ſhe had found the letter-caſe, and where the beautiful picture always attracted her admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and engaged her ſtay.</p>
            <p>Meantime Lord Oakendale grew impatient that he heard nothing from her. The footman had ſeveral times been diſpatched to the village in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to enquire how ſhe bore her ſolitude, and if ſhe made no complaints; for Lord Oakendale was in hopes that, by placing her in this dreary Abbey, with no companion but Mary, (whoſe education and manner of life had not been ſuch as could render her mind congenial with Laura's) as ſhe could have no reſources from books, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other amuſement, her ſpirits would become ſo
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035640_0037_100692D75264D4F0"/>
depreſſed, and her mind ſo enervated, that ſhe would gladly fly to him for ſuccour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, rather than be condemned to a hateful ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, like that of Oakendale Abbey.</p>
            <p>Laura's character he had quite miſtaken, or rather he had no idea of ſo noble a mind inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a form which he conſidered only as a volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary. Finding, therefore that the footman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways returned with accounts of her being content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and making no complaints, he determined, as ſoon as the ſpring ſhould be a little advanced, to make her a viſit at the Abbey; and not without the diabolical idea, that, if he could not prevail upon her to be favorable to his wiſhes, the Abbey was a place well calculated for the very worſt deſigns.</p>
            <p>Theſe intentions, however, were confined to his own breaſt, as the fitteſt receptacle for them. Not the moſt diſtant hint was given of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaſt Laura, upon hearing it, might medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate an eſcape, although that was a circumſtance next to impoſſible to be effected, from the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place.</p>
            <p>Meantime as the days grew longer, ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently walked with Mary to the diſtance of a
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035640_0038_100692DA8CD43DA0"/>
mile or two; the views were pictureſque, wild, and romantic; and when ſhe climbed to the top of the hills ſhe had a proſpect of a beautiful lake, which ſometimes afforded her a diſtant hope of eſcape, as ſhe had heard that theſe lakes were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in the ſummer by the admirers of pictureſque landſcape. The Abbey loſt much of its horrors by being inhabited by ſo fair a form, and the peaſants of the village would now venture as far as the gate, and even peep in at the windows, diveſted of their former fears. When the weather was rainy, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra made a long gallery in the Abbey her walk, and Mary grew ſo fearleſs that ſhe would remain in the chamber by herſelf, although ſhe ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſaying ſhe heard noiſes and whiſpering in the night.</p>
            <p>Laura had never yet been in the room which contained the ſkeleton, ſhe often deſigned it, and had once or twice made the attempt; but the idea that it might be Eugene's always threw a fearful gloom upon her heart; and having queſtioned Dame Giles concerning the viſitors to the Abbey ſince her remembrance, ſhe once told her of a gentleman's never having been heard of after having the keys to let himſelf into the Abbey. This account filled Laura's heart with cruel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035640_0039_100692E0545DCE60"/>
and confirmed conjectures which at times her imagination would raiſe up. In thoſe moments ſhe ſuppoſed a gang of banditti conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſubterraneous vault, who ruſhing upon Eugene at the moment he was exploring their ſecret haunts, having robbed and murdered him, had put his body in the trunk, had careleſſly drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the letter-caſe in the room where ſhe found it.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſad reflections ſometimes deterred her from making the attempt, and other times raiſed her reſentment and her courage at the ſame time; and when the thoughts of her ſituation occurred to her, it gave her a contempt for life; ſhe would ſay, "Yes, I will brave the ruffians, and gladly ſhare the fate of my dear Eugene. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps my bones may then be depoſited in the ſame trunk with his, and in death at leaſt we ſhall not be divided." But ſuch wild imaginations were generally ſuppreſſed, and deemed improper by her better judgment; and ſhe would then be thankful to Providence, who had given her ſtrength of mind to reſiſt ſuch idle deluſions, and ſubmit, with reſignation and gratitude, to him, whoſe diſpenſations had, in many inſtances, been ſo manifeſted in her favor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:035640_0040_100692E1F56553A8"/>
She was ruminating upon ſubjects of this nature one evening, when ſhe was walking alone in the gallery by moonlight. The brightneſs of that luminary ſhone full upon the apartment, and ſhe was amuſing herſelf with obſerving its reflecting the narrow caſements to almoſt the breadth of the gallery. She next contemplated her own ſhadow as ſhe walked; but, how was ſhe aſtoniſhed, and how did ſhe ſtand aghaſt, when ſhe ſaw another ſhadow beſides her own, which appeared larger, and to be that of a man! Her fortitude at once forſook her; ſhe flew to the door of the gallery, and in a faint voice called Mary. Mary was in the chamber; ſhe ſtood motionleſs with ſurpriſe and terror; but having a little recovered ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the chamber, where ſhe found Mary almoſt as much frightened as herſelf, at being left alone at that time in the evening.</p>
            <p>Laura, as ſoon as her trembling breath would allow her to articulate, related the cauſe of her fright, and begged Mary would return with her to the gallery, in order to inveſtigate this phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon; but no perſuaſion could prevail on Mary to accompany her; on the contrary, ſhe
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035640_0041_100692E707434C78"/>
was for faſtening up the door of the chamber, as ſoon as poſſible, to prevent either the ſhadow or the real ſubſtance from viſiting them.</p>
            <p>Laura ruminated upon the circumſtance till (as uſual) her fears became leſs; ſhe conſidered that, by ſome oblique reflection of the moon, two figures might be reflected from one; and ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to go to the gallery again, and try, in every direction, how her own ſhadow might be reflected, and lead her to the miſtake; and ſhe eaſily fancied that her fears had magnified the figure, and likewiſe given it the reſemblance of a man.</p>
            <p>Vexed at the idea of being appalled at her own ſhadow, and reſolving inſtantly to be cconvined ſhe again ſet forward to the gallery, which ſhe found ſtill and quiet as ſhe had left it. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged her boldly to advance to the end of it, and to try, in every direction ſhe could place her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in what manner her ſhadow might be reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo as to give it the repreſentation of two figures; but, after walking, ſtanding ſtill, both towards the windows, and at a diſtance, croſſing the gallery in every different part, and placing herſelf in every light, yet ſtill ſhe could perceive
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035640_0042_100692E97A707EB8"/>
nothing but her own ſingle ſhadow! Having tired herſelf with conjectures, and vexed that ſhe could make no diſcovery, ſhe haſtened back to her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, where ſhe paſſed the night, reſtleſs and uneaſy, vainly endeavouring to account for the appearance ſhe had ſeen, without the moſt diſtant clue to lead her to it.</p>
            <p>The unaccountable appearance of this ſhadow occupied her thoughts for ſeveral days, and ſhe at laſt perſuaded herſelf that it muſt have been the deception of her own ſight, which, although pretty good, might for once have deceived her, eſpecially as ſhe made the ſame experiment the ſucceeding night at the ſame hour; but it led to no diſcovery, for ſhe could ſee but one ſhadow; and having, by degrees, and by reaſoning upon the impoſſibility, conquered every idea of fear it had at firſt occaſioned, ſhe again reſumed her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of looking at the room which contained the ſkeleton.</p>
            <p>One day, that had been uncommonly rainy, which had prevented her taking her favorite walk upon the hill, and her mind was unſettled, from having no employment to fill up the time, or to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035640_0043_100692ECB3086C30"/>
chace away the melancholy which her ſituation inſpired, after much conſideration, ſhe determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bend her ſteps down the ſtone ſtair-caſe. For this purpoſe ſhe ſummoned all her reſolution, and having, with fervent devotion, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf to that Power, who always protects the innocent, and whoſe mercy is infinite, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the room, the lock of which turned eaſily as before; ſhe ſurveyed it with compoſed attention. The trunk ſtood exactly in the ſame place; ſhe lifted up the lid, and the ſame ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſkeleton preſented itſelf to her view. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated it with a mixture of horror and pity. "Ah!" ſays ſhe, "would I could know what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-enveloped theſe bones; perhaps thou art en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to my tendereſt regards." The idea that it might be the remains of the murdered, loved, Eugene, occurred to her ſad memory, and the tears fell from her eyes in large drops upon the object which excited them.</p>
            <p>From this melancholy ſpectacle ſhe turned to the dark cloiſter which, as ſhe ſuppoſed, led to the church-yard. The gloomy appearance of the entrance for a moment intimidated her, and ſhe was almoſt inclined to go back, when a ray of courage enlivening her ſpirits, ſhe grew reſolute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:035640_0044_100692F01C58F158"/>
and determined to proceed. She ſtooped her head as ſhe entered the arch, and found it quite dark; but as ſhe advanced it grew lighter, and ſhe perceived that ſhe deſcended, and the roof then admitted of her ſtanding upright. She likewiſe found that the light proceeded from ſome open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the end, which ſhe conjectured was the open air, and that the end of the cloiſter would bring her to the church-yard; ſhe therefore bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced, when, upon a nearer approach, ſhe perceived that the light glimmered through ſome looſe boards in the form of a partition, without a door, or any apparent opening. She looked through the cracks, and perceived it was a room, and that the light proceeded from a caſement at the end of it. She puſhed hard againſt it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to get in; but it ſeemed beyond her ſtrength. She felt diſappointed, and was turning back the way ſhe had come, when an impulſe of curioſity impelled her once more to look through the cracks of the boards, in order to take a more accurate ſurvey of a place which ſeemed fenced off for ſome particular purpoſe. She then fancied ſhe ſaw ſomething like white linen hang up on the oppoſite ſide; but ſhe could not diſtinguiſh it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035640_0045_100692F5DCDCFE08"/>
as the confined place through which ſhe looked prevented her. She likewiſe fancied that ſhe heard a ſlight noiſe; but ſhe was determined not to let any trifling ſound, occaſioned, perhaps by the wind, or a thouſand other cauſes, alarm and divert her from her purpoſe; ſo keeping her eye fixed, and cloſe to the diſjointed boards, whilſt her body was perfectly ſtill, her eye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to ſcrutinize and inveſtigate every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it could collect through a ſpace ſo narrow; when, after a ſlight noiſe, and a ſhade of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rather darkening the view, a large rolling eye-ball met her own, and ſhe inſtantly ſunk down; at the ſame time giving a faint inward ſcream: the ſhock was more than ſhe could bear. For a few moments all her faculties were ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and her limbs, which had refuſed to ſupport her, ſeemed ſtiffened with fright and aſtoniſhment. She attempted to riſe ſeveral times before ſhe could accompliſh it; and when ſhe ſtood up, ſhe made ſeveral efforts before her trembling legs could ſupport her ſufficiently to walk. Her mind was a chaos of horror and confuſion; ſhe invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily bent her ſteps to return; and, having feebly tottered <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:035640_0046_100692F7D597ADF0"/>
ſit down upon the trunk which contained the ſkel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eton, in order to reſt, and prevent her falling a ſecond time.</p>
            <p>Her heart throbbed as if it was burſting, and a violent flood of tears afforded her ſome relief. She ſat for ſome minutes looking ſtedfaſtly at the entrance of the cloiſter, expecting every moment ſomething to arreſt her affrighted ſenſes. All continued ſtill; nothing more horrible could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear than ſhe had already ſeen, and ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quite unequal to the taſk ſhe had undertaken. After finding herſelf a little recovered, ſhe haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back as faſt as her trembling limbs could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her, determined never more to endeavor at an inveſtigation which ſhe found had too ſerious an effect upon her ſpirits.</p>
            <p>When ſhe returned to the chamber, her pale and terrified countenance, with her eyes red, and almoſt ſtarting from their orbits, convinced Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ſhe had encountered ſomething extremely horrid, and ſhe was as much afraid to enquire as the other was incapable of anſwering, left ſhe ſhould hear more than her weak mind could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:035640_0047_100692FD0350A9D0"/>
Laura threw herſelf upon the bed in an agony of grief and terror; her mind was too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed by what ſhe had ſeen, to let reaſon bear any influence. She found her ſpirits had received a ſhock, which they could not well bear; ſhe now blamed herſelf for having attempted to make an inveſtigation which had led her to encounter ſo much terror.</p>
            <p>Mary could get but few anſwers to her queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore gave up aſking her.</p>
            <p>Laura continued many days in a motionleſs kind of apathy, and a ſlow fever preyed upon her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. She made many melancholy reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her cruel ſituation, which only added to her depreſſion. From this, however, ſhe was rouſed by the daughter of Dame Giles, who, as ſhe was one day ſetting the room in order, and ſeeing Laura look grave and low, aſſumed a delighted countenance, and ſaid, "This ould place will be quite another thing ſoon."</p>
            <p>"Why," replied Laura, "what ſhould make it another thing?"</p>
            <p>"Oh!" ſaid the girl, "but I believe I ſhould not tell you."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:035640_0048_1006930075175AB8"/>
"Yes," ſaid Laura, "You may tell me any thing; I ſhall not betray you."</p>
            <p>"Why, then," ſays the girl, "but 'tis a great ſecret, and mother would kill me if ſhe knowed as how I talked about it; but my Lord is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome o'the rooms are here to be made ſo foin!"</p>
            <p>"And who told you ſo?" replied Laura. "And when does he come? and are you certain of it?"</p>
            <p>All theſe queſtions ſhe aſked Peggy in a breath, and with a wild ſurpriſe; but Peggy could not, or would not, divulge more information than ſhe had already communicated; and Laura was left to meditate upon the intelligence with as many, or, perhaps, more cruel reflections than her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent fright had occaſioned.</p>
            <p>Various apprehenſions aſſailed her imagination, and not a ray of comfort ſhone upon her recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all was dreary in the perſpective. Her mind was now as active as it had been before paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. Her fears of ſupernatural ſpirits, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed murderers, gave way to thoſe of more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; and ſhe fearleſsly traverſed many parts
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035640_0049_10069303F89F8778"/>
of the Abbey, although ſhe did not venture to the part of it where ſhe had been ſo much terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Indeed ſhe never could perſuade herſelf to believe in ghoſts. That there were beings in the Abbey beſides themſelves ſhe had received ocular demonſtrati<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s; but of what nature they were, ſhe was totally ignorant; and her mind had been too much confuſed and oppreſſed to form the moſt diſtant conjecture. Now that her fears had, by Peggy's intelligence, been rendered alive to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the retroſpection furniſhed her with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences not altogether impoſſible; and, upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning with herſelf upon the ſubject, ſhe thought it more than probable, that Lord Oakendale had cauſed and ordered theſe appearances, in order to intimidate her, that ſhe might fly to his arms for refuge againſt alarms which ſeemed ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. She knew the whole village was his property, and all the inhabitants were his vaſſals. From ſuch a combination it were eaſy to place people in unfrequented parts of the Abbey to whiſper and make noiſes to occaſion terror. The ſkeleton, the ſhadow, and the eye-ball, might be managed by his Lordſhip's contrivance; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they loſt their terror, and ſhe looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035640_0050_100693080C421F60"/>
all that was paſt as an artful deluſion, pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed to further and complete his purpoſe; ſhe, therefore, as heretofore, condemned herſelf for being ſo eaſily impoſed upon, and determined henceforward to diſregard all appearances, and, if poſſible to think of making her eſcape.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to Mary ſhe did not think her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in her intereſt to truſt her with any ſcheme ſhe might project; neither did ſhe poſſeſs cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or ſtrength of mind, to be of ſervice to her in any dangerous enterpriſe; ſhe therefore thought it moſt prudent to rely upon her own manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and entirely truſt to her own contrivance for the furthering of any plan, by which ſhe might hope to eſcape from a ſituation ſo perilous.</p>
            <p>She had, by theſe ſuggeſtions, worked up her mind to a degree of boldneſs, bordering upon deſperation; and, in a rhapſody of diſtreſſed cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſhe exclaimed, "Would ſome airy ſpirits did indeed inhabit this Abbey, who would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect innocence, and ſhield me from the ſnares of villainy and terror!"</p>
            <p>As ſhe finiſhed the laſt words, ſhe was ſtartled by a noiſe like the ſhutting of a door, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant footſtep; but, as ſhe had made up her mind as
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035640_0051_10069309C1D09D68"/>
to diſregarding the noiſes, and indeed fear of that nature ſeemed to be entirely baniſhed from her breaſt, ſhe only turned about with a contemptuous expreſſion of countenance, and fell into a medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on her eſcape. As ſhe had never been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited walking round the Abbey, up the hills and in the vicinity of the village, ſhe formed the reſolution of extending her walk ſo as to get quite away, taking the firſt path that offered, after ſhe had got from the village.</p>
            <p>The idea charmed her, and but one difficulty aroſe to prevent her deſign; and that was, the walking out by herſelf, as Mary had always been her companion in the walks ſhe had hitherto tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and indeed would be afraid to be left alone in the Abbey.</p>
            <p>The idea of leaving one, whoſe fears ſhe knew would nearly overpower her ſenſes, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter of difficulty, but of regret; and ſhe truly felt for the diſtreſs Mary would experience when night approached, and ſhe found herſelf alone, deſerted by her companion.</p>
            <p>The tender and affectionate heart of Laura could not endure the idea of acting ſo cruel a part to one, who in no inſtance had ever ſhewn
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035640_0052_1006930F19AE7680"/>
her the leaſt unkindneſs. To be ſure her virtues where of that negative kind, that ſhe could form no reliance upon her friendſhip, but then, on the other hand, ſhe had been in ſome degree, the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen companion of her ſolitude, and to leave her a prey to ſufferings her mind was not able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, was a cruelty of which Laura was incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and could not put inpractice, even if her eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape had depended upon thoſe terms; ſhe therefore, after much conſideration, told Mary, "Not to be alarmed if ſome of the ſpectres, which haunted the Abbey, ſhould entirely carry her off, as they had done the gentleman concerning whom Dame Giles had told them, for that ſhe was determined to venture over every part of it, and it might be ſhe might never return; for ſhe had already ſeen and heard enough to know that ſomething beſides themſelves reſided there, and ſhe therefore adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to be prepared for her abſence."</p>
            <p>Mary, terrified at hearing her talk in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, begged her to deſiſt from any ſuch deſign repreſenting, and recalling to her recollection, how much ſhe had been alarmed at her laſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as well as by the circumſtance of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:035640_0053_10069312780C1948"/>
Laura, however, was not to be perſuaded, and told Mary ſhe was prepared for any alarm, and only adviſed her, in caſe ſhe ſhould not return be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night, not to ſtay in the Abbey by herſelf; but, before the evening was far advanced, to go down to the cottage of Aaron Giles, and beg his protection.</p>
            <p>Mary did not heſitate to promiſe ſhe would not ſtay there by herſelf; for nothing, indeed, would have induced her to be there alone.</p>
            <p>Laura, having arranged the plan ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Mary, whoſe comfort was by no means her leaſt object, left the Abbey in order to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre, and, at the ſame time, uſe Mary to the cuſtom of her going out without her; and, had any thing encouraging offered, to purſue her plan. But the evening being remarkable fine, the peaſants were all out of their houſes, and ſhe did not think this a time favourable for facilitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her deſign; ſhe therefore gave up the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and returned to the Abbey, waiting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently for a more favourable opportunity.</p>
            <p>Meantime ſome of the rooms were cleaning out, and evident preparations were making for his Lordſhip's arrival.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:035640_0054_100693156610ACB8"/>
Some days had now elapſed ſince Laura had ſpoken to Mary on the ſubject of her being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away. She had formed various plans, but as yet had put none in execution; time wore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and ſhe was in continual fear of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by a viſit from Lord Oakendale. This kept her mind in a conſtant perturbation, and haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened her determination. On a fine afternoon, therefore, ſhe ſtrolled out by herſelf, and Mary impatiently awaited her return.</p>
            <p>The evening began to cloſe, when Mary's fears for Laura, and ſtill greater apprehenſions for herſelf, aroſe to a pitch of miſery and uneaſineſs ſhe could by no means ſupport! She flew down the ſtairs, and, opening the great door, ſhe threw her eyes about with a wild ſtare of amazement; and, being afraid either to return, or to follow any of the paths ſhe had ſometimes frequented with Laura, ſhe ran as faſt as her legs could carry her to the cottage of Aaron Giles, and terrified and ſurpriſed the whole family, by ſaying, with wild affright, "That the ghoſts had carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Laura, and ſhe would not for the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Abbey by herſelf, for ſhe was ſure they would take her next."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:035640_0055_10069318D21618B0"/>
They knew not what to make of her ſtory, and, partly believing, and partly incredulous, they ſallied out to the Abbey, where, vainly waiting, wondering, and calling to no purpoſe for near two hours, they concluded poor Laura had met with ſome cruel diſaſter, and they returned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate to the cottage. They lamented the fate of the unfortunate Lady, and ſtill more their own, when his Lordſhip ſhould not find her at his arrival, which was now hourly expected; in which expectation we ſhall, for the preſent, leave them, to give ſome account of Laura, for whom our readers may probably be more intereſted.</p>
            <p>The evening, on which ſhe left the Abbey, was uncommonly fine, and invited her to deſcend the other ſide of that hill, from which ſhe had more than once taken a view of the lake and the adjacent country. She would round the hill, and followed the firſt path to her left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it turned in ſeveral directions, and ſhe was puzzled which to purſue. After aſcending and deſcending amidſt a woody covert of brambles and high buſhes, ſhe found herſelf in a thick wood at the bottom of the hill, which ſhe ſtill thought looked very near her. She was now in a cloſe dell, and looking about to ſee the way ſhe thought beſt to follow, ſhe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035640_0056_1006931BF8949E80"/>
perceived an arch overgrown with ivy, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it might lead her into a more open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended tract, ſhe fearleſsly entered it. The arch narrowed upon her; ſhe nearly touched the roof, and it grew dark, yet ſhe proceeded;—it was a hiding place from her purſuers, if it was nothing more. Fear ſeemed to make no part of her compoſition, and, having walked a conſiderable way, ſhe perceived ſome broken ſteps; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſcended them, a ſmall door half open, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to invite her to enter; and a room, extremely reſembling thoſe ſhe had ſeen in the Abbey, led her to ſuppoſe that the winding of the wood had only brought her back again to the ſame place from which ſhe had taken ſo much pains to eſcape. She felt vexed and diſappointed; but curioſity compelled her to prove the certainty of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
            <p>The room afforded but little light, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted by chaſms in the wall; yet ſhe thought ſhe perceived a door at the end; and, as ſhe was now almoſt certain it was the Abbey, ſhe was in hopes of returning to the apartments they occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied before Mary ſhould have quitted them; for, although her fears were pretty well ſubſided, yet the idea of being alone all night in the Abbey
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035640_0057_1006931FA4D7BF58"/>
was not altogether ſo comfortable; and ſhe thought, if Mary was gone, ſhe would follow her to the cottage of Aaron Giles. She was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as to the door at the other end of the room; it was faſtened on the ſide next to her, and ſhe undrew (as ſhe thought) a ruſty bolt, and was advancing into another appartment, when a ſight, more horrible than imagination can form, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf to her. The dead body of a woman hung againſt the wall oppoſite to the door ſhe had entered, with a coarſe cloth pinned over all but the face; the ghaſtly and putrified appearance of which beſpoke her to have been ſome time dead.</p>
            <p>Laura gave a fearful ſhriek, when a tall figure, dreſſed only in a checked ſhirt, ſtaggered towards her. The face was almoſt black; the eyes ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtarting from the head; the mouth was widely extended, and made a kind of hallow gutteral ſound in attempting to articulate.</p>
            <p>Laura ſtood motionleſs; the figure paſſed her, and went through the door-way by which ſhe had entered, and the ſound of the footſteps dwelt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ear till they ſeemed loſt by diſtance. She trembled exceedingly; ſhe was afraid to follow and ſhe was equally afraid to ſtay. After ſome
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035640_0058_10069324F42D96F8"/>
moments of dreadful ſuſpence, ſhe turned her eyes to the ſhocking figure of the dead body; nature ſhrunk from the ſight, and recoiled at the idea; ſhe moved ſlowly to the door, thinking, if ſhe could once morce regain the wood, ſhe ſhould be more ſafe than where ſhe was. Alas! how were her fears increaſed, and her ſituation rendered ſtill more dreadful, when ſhe found (upon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to open the door) a ſpring lock on the other ſide had been miſtaken for a bolt; that it was now cloſe ſhut, and ſhe had no poſſible means of getting it open. The horrid creature that had paſſed her had gone through with ſo much violence that the door clapped after him, whilſt ſhe was contemplating the other dreadful figure with which ſhe was now ſhut up; nothing could be conceived more full of terror! The room was damp, and a ſmall grated window only ſerved to ſhew her the ghaſtly appearance of the body, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtill more terrific by the faint light which reflected on the face, and ſerved to ſhew Laura that night was approaching. Her fears increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhe crept about the room as far as poſſible from the melancholy object, and kept her eyes turned to the door of this diſmal place, from
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035640_0059_1006947D5A9079E0"/>
whence ſhe had not the moſt diſtant hope of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eſcape.</p>
            <p>With a mind tortured by the moſt cruel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, ſhe could think of no expedient whereby to relieve her diſtreſs. She made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral attempts to open the door, but all were inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. The little ſtrength ſhe had was become ſtill leſs by trembling, and a faint ſickneſs occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by terror. She ſhut her eyes to avoid the painful object before her. She fancied ſhe heard groans. The idea of periſhing for want was the leaſt of her fears. About midnight ſhe heard footſteps gently approaching the door; a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering light ſhone under it, and diſplayed more fully the horror of her ſituation, all her courage was ſummoned to her aid, and all her courage could ſcarce ſupport her in this extremity of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. She had turned her back upon the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as an object too ſhocking to look at; and ſhe now crept up in a corner of the room, on the ſame ſide with the door, where ſhe ſtood cloſe, ſtill hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſcape from ſhe knew not what; but the love of life is ſo ſtrongly implanted in our nature, that when the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>larm of death comes, under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever circumſtances, we make the laſt attempts to preſerve it, however feeble they may be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:035640_0060_10068EFEE402B060"/>
Thus ſhe ſtood trembling, awaiting a fate which ſhe every moment expected would be decided, when the door gently opened, and two men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; the one carried a lantern, and the other a large board; and, as with aſtoniſhed looks, they advanced towards her; her heart died within her, ſhe ſunk down, and ſaw and heard no more!</p>
            <p>On recovering ſhe found herſelf laid on a coarſe bed, with an old woman ſtanding by her, whoſe looks teſtified ſatisfaction when ſhe opened her eyes. As ſoon as ſhe could ſpeak, ſhe inquired "if ſhe was ſtill in Oakendale Abbey?"</p>
            <p>"No," ſaid the woman; "you are in my cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and I have been fearfully frightened leſt you were dead."</p>
            <p>"Thank God," ſaid Laura, "I am once more with a human being; and pray tell me by what, or whoſe means I came here?"</p>
            <p>"Lawkaday!" ſaid the woman; "I knows no more than you do: Chriſtian charity made me take you in, when two men brought you here to be recovered. They aſſured me you was not dead, and would be better in a ſhort time; I was
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035640_0061_10069340587F7818"/>
loth to truſt them, and now I'm afraid I ſhall get into trouble; for I thinks you be the ſame Lady that has lived ſo long with the ſpirits in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey."</p>
            <p>"Whatever I am," ſaid Laura, "I entreat you to tell me how far I am from that hateful Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and if there is a road leads to it from the little wood?"</p>
            <p>"Aye, ſure there is," ſaid the woman, "and it is hard by. Laws! I don't wonder you have been almoſt frightened to death, if you have been in that ſhocking place; why, nobody before ever ventured to ſtay there."</p>
            <p>Laura felt herſelf extremely weak, and begged the woman to give her ſome water. She brought her other refreſhments; and, after ſhe was a little revived, her thanks were moſt devoutly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly offered to Providence, not only for her preſervation from danger, but alſo for enab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her to preſerve her ſenſes under circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo truly frightful, and ſufficiently calculated to deprive her of them. She enjoined ſecrecy to the woman on the ſubject of her having been in the Abbey, as well as of her having been now under her roof. She felt her mind more eaſy on
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035640_0062_100693429983F3B0"/>
the woman's aſſuring her, ſhe herſelf ſhould be afraid to have it known that ſhe was there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Lord was a powerful rich man; and yet ſhe ſhould never forgive herſelf to be the cauſe of ſending a fellow-creature to the Abbey, which was not fit for chriſtian folks to live in.</p>
            <p>The morning was now far advanced, and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra thought it would be beſt to wait the return of the evening before ſhe again attempted her eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. She likewiſe found herſelf too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, and too low, from the ſufferings of her ſpirits, to begin another enterpriſe till they were, in ſome degree, recruited; ſhe therefore compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf, as well as her ſituation would admit of, till the evening; although ſhe by no means thought herſelf ſafe ſo near the Abbey, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but her inability would have prevented her from quitting the cottage immediately. In the evening ſhe found herſelf tolerably refreſhed, and her deſire to eſcape, aiding her reſolution, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the old woman; at the ſame time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating her to be ſecret, and, with amazing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (conſidering what ſhe had ſuffered) ſet forward on her ſecond expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:035640_0063_10069345F3587C48"/>
She ſaw the Abbey at a ſmall diſtance on her left; and she was determined to take ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as to ſteer clear of again encountering ſo frightful an abode.</p>
            <p>Behold her then once more endeavouring to gain an aſylum from tyrannic power and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural terror. Truth and innocence guided her ſteps, and conſcious virtue shielded her from cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice. The rays of the evening ſun, shone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her beauty, and she followed the firſt path to her right, which led her along a fine valley. The air revived her ſpirits; she walked very faſt, without ſeeing either village or houſe of any ſort. The evening began to cloſe in, and every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemed to thicken the atmoſphere. She feared she should be obliged to ſome tree or hedge to shelter her from the approaching dews of the night; yet she did not repent her enterpriſe; on the contrary, she was thankful that fortune had thus favoured her eſcape, and that she was in a country where she had nothing to fear from wild beaſts, and she could meet with nothing more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific than she had encountered the preceding night. With reflections like theſe she continued her walk, and caſting her eyes round to find ſome ſpreading tree, or sheltering bush, under which
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035640_0064_1006934958136FD8"/>
to reſt, she ſpied a few ſcattered cottages almoſt concealed under the ſide of a hill; her ſpeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled, and she ſoon found herſelf within ſight of the hamlet. A girl, about twelve years old, dreſſed in a coarſe blue woollen jacket, without either shoes or ſtockings, who walked at ſome diſtance before her, and a parcel of geeſe, which came ſtretching their necks and hiſſing at her, were the only objects she ſaw.</p>
            <p>The girl turned into a cottage, and Laura cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly followed her; an elderly woman ſat near the chimney carding ſome wool, and the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, though clean, had every appearance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty. The woman ſtarted at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Laura, whoſe dreſs and deportment were ſuperior to what she was generally accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to ſee; and throwing aſide her work, and dropping a courteſy, she aſked her "if she was come from the Grove, and what she was pleaſed to want."</p>
            <p>Laura, with a ſweetneſs peculiar to herſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "that she wanted nothing but shelter for the night; and if she would have the goodneſs to allow her to ſit in that room till the next morning dawned, she would in no way incommode her."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:035640_0065_1006934AEB7ABCC0"/>
"Lawkaday!" ſaid the woman, "you might ſleep with our Mary-Ann for the matter o'that; but if ſo be, as you have loſt your friends, or miſſed your way you'd better go up to the Grove; ould Madam has a power of money, and is main good to ſtrangers. When John comes home from work he'll go and ſhew you the way."</p>
            <p>Laura thanked her, but ſaid, "ſhe had rather ſtay where ſhe was, at leaſt for this night, and perhaps ſhe might get them to ſhew her the way to the Grove in the morning."</p>
            <p>During this time Mary-Ann had given the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm to the little republic, and ſeveral ragged children were gathered round the door. The good woman ſoon diſperſed them, and telling her daughter to bring in ſome fire-wood, ſhe ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout making a cheerful blaze, which gave her cottage ſuch an appearance of comfort, as a more ſplendid apartment ſeldom exhibits:
<q>
                  <l>The cricket chirrups in the hearth;</l>
                  <l>The crackling faggot flies.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Laura felt herſelf pleaſed, and ſafe, which brightened every object before her; and ſhe was contemplating the ſimplicity of the whole, when a rough-looking, hard-featured man, who was
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035640_0066_1006935090E64B40"/>
the owner of the cottage, made his appearance. His wife ſaid to him, "Maſter, here is a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman comed to ſtay all night with us; but I'd fain perſuade her to go up to Madams."</p>
            <p>John ſtared at Laura, but ſaid nothing; when ſhe ventured to aſk him, how far they were from Oakendale?</p>
            <p>"Nine miles," ſaid John; "and I would no go there at this time o'night for all you could give me."</p>
            <p>"Nor I neither," thought Laura to herſelf, ſurpriſed that ſhe had walked ſo far.</p>
            <p>"No," ſaid the wife, "that is a fearful place by all account; ſuch frightful ſights ha been ſeen there, as makes a body ſhake but to think on; and bloody murders ha been committed there former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no doubt!"</p>
            <p>If Laura was ſatisfied and pleaſed with her hoſt and hoſteſs, they were not leſs ſo with her gentle manners and obliging behavior; and entertained no ſuſpicion to the diſadvantage of their gueſt, whom they preſſed to partake of the beſt they had to produce; and ſhe joyfully ſhared the coarſe, but clean, bed of Mary Ann.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:035640_0067_10069352586E70B8"/>
The next morning, not knowing where to bend her courſe, and thinking ſhe ſhould be more ſecure from Lord Oakendale's ſearch, ſhould he be diſpoſed to make any after her, under ſome ſafe protection, ſhe liſtened to the advice of the cottagers, and begged they would conduct her to the Grove, where reſided the good lady of whom they had ſpoken ſo highly, and whoſe name was Greville. The Grove was ſituated about a mile from the cottage, and the towers of an antient ſtructure peeped from between the lofty elms and oaks that encompaſſed its ſtructure, and gave it its name.</p>
            <p>As they approached the manſion, Laura rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated on the mode of introducing herſelf to the lady of the houſe, and could deviſe no better than by declaring the truth, and entreating her protection, which from the cottager's reports ſhe was encouraged to hope would not be denied her.</p>
            <p>When they arrived at the houſe they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the houſe-keeper, a comely looking woman, about fifty years of age, dreſſed in a plain old faſhion ſtyle, with a bunch of keys by her ſide. When Laura requeſted to be introduced to Mrs.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035640_0068_1006935587B4EE50"/>
Greville, the houſe-keeper <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> who ſhe was to name?</p>
            <p>Laura bluſhed, and a tear ſtarted into her eyes upon the recollection that ſhe knew no name to which ſhe had any juſt claim; and, with a ſigh returned. "I have been taught to believe that the name of Unfortunate will introduce me to your lady, and ſecure me a favorable reception."</p>
            <p>The houſe-keeper, glancing an eye of pity on her, led the way, and introduced her to Mrs Greville, a venerable old lady, who, taking off her ſpectacles, politely ſaid, "I have not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of knowing you, young lady; but that, I dare ſay, is owing to the defect of my ſight and memory."</p>
            <p>"Alas! no," replied Laura; but here her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſituation recurring to her mind too forcibly to be ſuppreſſed, ſhe again burſt into tears. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this was the beſt introduction ſhe could have choſen, as a paſſport to the tender heart of Mrs. Greville. She looked at Laura with the eyes of pity, and taking her by the hand, ſaid, in the kindeſt accents, "Sit down, young lady, and compoſe yourſelf; you ſeem fatigued, and ſhall take ſome refreſhment before you gratify a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,

which is, I own, ſtrongly excited, and be aſſured, prejudiced in your favor.'</p>
            <p>Saying this, ſhe diſmiſſed the houſe-keeper for ſome chocolate; and, in the mean time, Laura ſo far recovered herſelf as to ſay, "Dear Madam, you ſee before you a forlorn creature thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, without country, friends, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to protect me; not even a relation from whom I can claim either name or affinity!"</p>
            <p>"Then," ſaid Mrs. Greville, "ſurely you are the more entitled to the protection of ſtrangers."</p>
            <p>Laura thanked her by the moſt grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements; and, having drank her choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, began the following hiſtory of herſelf:</p>
            <p>"My infant remembrance," ſaid ſhe, "fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me with ideas of a country different from this. A gentleman, careſſing me, in ſcarlet clothes, with a ſaſh and gorget, and other glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appendages, dazzled my young ſight, and made an impreſſion on my memory like a diſtant dream. I can recollect a beautiful woman ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to her arms when the gentleman was gone; and, as ſhe kiſſed me, the tears fell from her eyes in drops upon my frock. I remember too that I
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035640_0070_1006935CF6A5AB78"/>
was called Laura. The next circumſtance that dwelt upon my recollection, was that of ſitting upon the lap of a black woman, who told me I ſhould ſee my papa and mama no more; that I muſt be very good, and ſhe would love me. She taught me my prayers, and the meaning of words; but ſhe omited to tell me my name. She treated me with great tenderneſs, and I conceived an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for her. Soon after ſhe put me on board a ſhip with ſeveral people of my own color; and, after hugging and embracing me with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſhe left me. I cried after her as the only being of whom I had any knowledge, and I could not eaſily be reconciled to any other. The motion of the veſſel firſt made me ſick, and then lolled me to ſleep. When I awoke I cried again; but was ſoothed by ſome women on board, and told that I was going to ſee my relations. I ſoon grew accuſtomed to the ſhip, and to the people about me, although I was too young to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any of their converſation, or know whither we were going. As far as my early age, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time, would allow me to judge, we were ſome months at ſea; when one morning I was frightened by a confuſed noiſe, which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035640_0071_1006936059ECAC48"/>
by a continued firing of cannon. The whole ſhip's crew ſeemed in alarm, and I was huddled with the reſt of the women, into a dark part of the veſſel, which I had never ſeen before. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſeemed terrified, and felt the contagion of fear, though I knew not what we had to dread. In a ſhort time a number of men, who ſpoke in a different language to that I had been uſed to, and were almoſt without clothes, ruſhed into the place where we were confined and began to drag the women about, in whoſe ſcreams and cries I joined: All appeared in confuſion, when two or three better dreſſed men came, and, ſpeaking in a commanding tone, there ſeemed to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regulation obſerved; but they did not trouble themſelves with me, except to ſhut me in with the reſt.</p>
            <p>"Previous to this ceremony, and upon hearing a ſhout, in what I afterwards knew to be the French language, one of the women took a ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed packet from a trunk, which ſhe ſaid belonged to me, and with a ſtring faſtened it round my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, telling me (for I ſhall remember her words) that was the only teſtimony of my name and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage; adding, that I muſt never let any body take it from me. Her intention was no doubt
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035640_0072_10069363EB4BA228"/>
good; but ſhe would no doubt have done better to have taught me my name, and ſo impreſſed it on my memory, that I might not now have been the deſtitute and forlorn creature I feel myſelf; but I was then too young to obſerve the omiſſion.</p>
            <p>"Soon after this we arrived, as I ſuppoſed, at our deſtined port, where we were dragged out of the veſſel, and put into waggons; when, after a tedious journey of ſeveral days, during which I ſuffered cold and hunger to the extreme; we were at length brought to a large city, which I heard was Paris. If I was before wretched, though at that time I felt the ſenſation without knowing by what name to deſcribe it, how much was my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery increaſed when we were all crammed into a French priſon!</p>
            <p>"On my firſt being taken out of the waggon, a tall frightful man, with a wide mouth, held me in his arms, and made a motion as if he would eat me! I was terrified, and cried; but no cries were regarded, and we were hurried into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which contained ſome hundreds of wretches like ourſelves. My clothes and linen were of a finer texture than thoſe of my companions; I was
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035640_0073_10069367450DAF98"/>
therefore, regardleſs of my cries, ſtripped, and clad in a very coarſe and filthy garb. I held the paper, which was tied round me, faſt with my little hands; but I was brutally forced to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh my hold, and it was wantonly torn from me. After this I remembered nothing for many days; I turned my head this way, and that way, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſtench of the priſon; but could in no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection find a wholeſome air. When I recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from what I ſuppoſe was a fever and deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, I found myſelf ſtretched upon a wretched bed with ſeveral others, and ſome of the dead bodies were removing to their laſt abode. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood none of the language, and my firſt wiſh was for freſh air. As I was lying in this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, a gentleman entered the room, whoſe countenance and appearance was different from any I had ſeen before. He felt the pulſe of ſome of them, and ſpoke the language I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. I wiſhed to attract his notice, and my eyes followed his countenance whitherſoever it turned. At laſt he approached the bed on which I was laid, and coming to the ſide of it, examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my features with attention.</p>
            <p>"I longed to ſpeak to him; but I had ſcarce ſtrength, and ſtill leſs courage to make ſuch an
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035640_0074_10069368E80715E8"/>
effort; but when he took my burning emaciated hand in his I ventured to claſp his fingers whilſt the tears ſtreamed from my eyes.</p>
            <p>"He tenderly returned the preſſure, ſaying, "Poor child, to whom doſt thou belong? and what is thy name?"</p>
            <p>"I faintly anſwered, Laura; and I am very ſick. He gave me ſomething which he poured out of a bottle, and which ſeemed of a reviving quality; and when the perſon, who attended the room three or four times a day, and locked us up, came in, he conferred with him ſeveral minutes in the French language, frequently pointing to me as he ſpoke.</p>
            <p>"The next morning an old woman, whom I had before ſeen buſy about the bodies of thoſe that died in the room, came and took me from the bed, waſhed me, and put upon me ſome coarſe but clean linen, led me out into the air, and gave me ſome better refreſhment than I had lately taſted. I was then put into a coach in which ſat the gentleman I had ſeen the day before. He ſpoke to me in the kindeſt accents, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew my gratitude by a thouſand childiſh endeavours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:035640_0075_1006936E6D264210"/>
"When the coach ſtopped, I was led by my benefactor into a handſome room, where ſat a lady of a moſt benign countenance: "This my dear," ſaid the gentleman, leading me to her, "is the poor child of whom I ſpoke yeſterday, and whom you have ſo kindly conſented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; ſhe has been very ill and is weak at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but I am ſure ſhe has a greatful heart."</p>
            <p>"I paid my reſpects to the lady in the beſt manner I was able; and ſhe ſaid, "Poor thing, ſhe ſhall be taken care of; and I think ſhe looks like a gentleman's child." I felt my heart glow with pleaſure at this obſervation; and I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that it gave me more delight than all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes they beſtowed.</p>
            <p>"In a few days I was ſtill better habited; and I told my benefactors, whoſe names were du Frene, all that I knew and could remember of my hiſtory. They had no children, and they conceived a parental regard for me, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by the moſt filial affection. They were French; but he was of Engliſh extraction, and both were Proteſtants. He had reſided many years in Paris, where he practiſed ſurgery, and had been in high repute in that profeſſion, and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035640_0076_1006937284ABD4D0"/>
which he now followed from motives of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rather than from lucrative ones, as he was in very good circumſtances.</p>
            <p>"My dear Madame du Frene was the only mother I had ever known. She grew every day more fond of me. She had me taught every neceſſary accompliſhment, as well as every uſeful employment; and the principles of religion and virtue, which ſhe practiſed in their fulleſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſhe inſtilled into my mind as the brighteſt ornaments I could poſſeſs.—Indeed, they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch luſtre, from her bright example, that I wanted no incitements to be at leaſt an humble imitator of her many virtues. Were I to dwell upon all her excellencies, my ſtory would not ſoon come to a concluſion. Nor had Monſ. du Frene leſs merit; I know not which of them ſhewed me moſt fondneſs; and when I grew up, their tender care of me, as a child, was changed into unremitting anxiety and ſolicitude. When I was addreſſed by the appellation of Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle du Frene, their eyes ſparkled with pleaſure; and this was often the caſe, for I knew no other name; and after all the enquiries M. du Frene could make, concerning the parcel which was
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035640_0077_100693763538A628"/>
faſtened to my breaſt on my entrance into the priſon, no diſcovery could poſſibly be made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it; for which reaſon it was natural to ſuppoſe that it contained ſomething valuable—beſides the identy of my birth and name, which alone we ſhould have no difficulty in recovering.—Whenever I expreſſed uneaſineſs at the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of not knowing to whom I owed my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with what enraptured fondneſs would theſe dear parents call me their adopted child, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me that I ſhould never feel the want of ſuch endearing ties! I hope I returned their affection by the moſt filial love and duty; but youth is giddy, and we never know the value of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing till it is no longer in our power to ſet a juſt eſtimate upon it. Ten years endeared me to this kind protection, upon which I look back with delight. I learned to ſpeak the language fluent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though Engliſh was as much ſpoken in M. du Frene's family as French. No expence was ſpared on my education, dreſs, or amuſement, and I moved in a circle far above the ſphere of life in which M. du Frene was placed; but it was their pride to have me introduced, and ſee me careſſed by people of rank; and M. du Frene
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035640_0078_100693783696C6F8"/>
was well received by theſe perſons on account of his extraordinary merit.</p>
            <p>"It was in the midſt of theſe happy days, when M. du Frene received letters from his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in England, who was in the ſame profeſſion, appriſing him of the arrival of a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of the name of Rayneer, who was ſent to be under his care, in order to be made a profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the language, and to complete his education.</p>
            <p>"I was in the habit of hearing fine things from the beaux who fluttered round me in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic places, and ſometimes diſtinguiſhed a man of ſenſe and good breeding from the empty coxcomb and the licentious rake; but none had made an impreſſion beyond the moment in which they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed me, and my heart had never as yet palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in favor of one man more than another; but the time was now approaching when I could no longer make this boaſt. Eugene Rayneer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; his figure, his voice, his manner, all were captivating in the extreme. He did not live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame roof with me; but he had lodgings near us, and there were but few hours out of the twenty-four in which we were not together. Ah! how dangerous it is to throw into each
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035640_0079_1006937BF7B031F0"/>
other's company two young people nearly of an age, and between whoſe diſpoſitions a ſimilarity of ſentiments cannot fail to form attachment!—What pleaſant hours did we paſs together! But I will not, dear Madam, tire you with a repetition of our love, the remembrance of which is painful becauſe it is paſt. Suffice it to ſay, that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed mutual vows without conſidering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability there was of our ever being united. He ſeemed to know but little of his family, and ſtill leſs of his fortune: but nature had been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly laviſh of her favors, and his own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors had not been wanting to render him a moſt accompliſhed young man. His temper was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and good, but rather inclined to be impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. My dear M. du Frene uſed frequently to lament that he had not ſufficient authority over him to keep him from errors occaſioned by this diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>"One day that we were at dinner M. du Frene was ſuddenly, and with an air of myſtery, called out. He inſtantly obeyed the ſummons, and did not return for ſome time. I knew not what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the mind of Madame; but my own heart foreboded a thouſand fearful images during an hour's abſence of M. du Frene, At his return
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035640_0080_1006937F5A202BE0"/>
we both expreſſed curioſity at the face of anxiety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with which he appeared: and, after a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's ſilence, he ſaid, "That fooliſh boy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene, has engaged in a diſagreeable adventure, and has got an ugly wound in the recontre."</p>
            <p>"At the mention of a wound I felt my blood ruſh into my face, and a violent beating of my heart ſucceeded. He went on by ſaying, "He hoped there was no danger in the wound; but he underſtood it was the conſequence of a challenge given by Eugene to a perſon of conſequence, who was likewiſe wounded, and whoſe friends he feared would not eaſily be appeaſed." What terror did theſe words convey to my already oppreſſed mind! Several days paſſed in this cruel uncertainty. Madame du Frene frequently viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eugene; but ſhe always returned with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy countenance, and I had ſcarce ever cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to aſk her any queſtions.</p>
            <p>"One day ſhe returned with cheerful looks, and mine caught the pleaſing ſympathy. She put out her hand to me, and ſaid, "My dear Laura, I can now congratulate you on the complete reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Eugene. At the ſame time I will inform
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035640_0081_10069380F0E165B0"/>
you, that you have been the cauſe of a wound which had nearly been fatal.</p>
            <p>"How, my dear Madame," I replied, "can I have been the cauſe of ſuch an accident? and, if I have, how ought I to rejoice that the danger is over?"</p>
            <p>"Sit down, my love," ſaid Madame; "be compoſed, and I will tell you the whole. Eugene was playing at billiards with the young marquis of—, only ſon of the Duke de St.—. They had played ſeveral games, and the marquis, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſucceſsful, was very deſirous that Eugene ſhould win ſome of the games back again; but Eugene wanted to be with you, he grew impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and uttering ſome haſty words, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis replied, "Oh! you want to be with that little Bourjeoiſe, the ſurgeon's daughter; ah! ſhe is a tempting little creature; but ſhe may wait till our games are more evenly decided."</p>
            <p>"Eugene heard no more. He inſtantly gave the challenge, and they as inſtantly ran each other through the body. Both fell at the ſame moment, and would have both died from loſs of blood, had not one of the waiters fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately diſcovered them. It would be impoſſible
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035640_0082_10069384317FEFA0"/>
to ſay which of their wounds was moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The ſymptoms of the marquis were moſt favorable, becauſe his mind was not ſo agitated as Eugene's; nevertheleſs they were both extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous, and the Duke of—would have ſhewn no favor to his ſon's antagoniſt had he loſt him. Thank God they are now in a fair way of recovery, and both have exchanged forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and till this favourable event, M. du Frene and myſelf have preſerved a ſtrange and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſilence towards you; but, unleſs we could give you more favorable accounts, we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to keep you in ignorance. But now, that every thing is in ſo proſperous a train, we would have you partake in the general joy."</p>
            <p>"I thanked my dear Madame, by the moſt grateful acknowledgements, for all her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and my heart overflowed with praiſe and thakſgiving for my Eugene's recovery. I long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee him, but I had not courage to make the requeſt. Madame du Frene anticipated my wiſhes, and ſaid, "There can, I think, be no impropriety in your going with me to ſee Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene; I know the ſight of you will complete his cure."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:035640_0083_100693879BEB7218"/>
"I wanted no intreaty to pay a viſit in which my heart was ſo much intereſted; and I had the pleaſure of finding Eugene perfectly well, except weakneſs. To me he never looked or ſpoke in a more captivating manner. In a few days he walked out; our interviews were more frequent than ever, and I fooliſhly thought that all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune was comprehended in the illneſs of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene; and now, that he was well and again reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored to me, I had nothing but happineſs before me. Alas! how little do we know how fortune varies her favors, and diſpenſes a chequered ſcene to moſt mortals.—I could not diveſt myſelf of extreme partiality for Eugene, and found a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his company, which I had never experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced from the frivolity of a Frenchman; and when the moſt ſenſible remarks, and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt attentions, were received from a man whoſe external appearance beſpoke the nobler qualities of his mind, my heart gave the trueſt teſtimony to his merits; nor did I affect to diſown them to my dear Madame du Frene; to her I had confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all my grief, and all my joy. She would allow me to expatiate on the merits of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Eugene with all the glow of affection which warmed my breaſt; ſhe loved me too tenderly to
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035640_0084_1006938D0D4A5418"/>
check the fond effuſions which afforded me ſo much delight; and when I fancied that I was poſſeſſed of his affections, nothing I thought, could interrupt my happineſs, or reverſe my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:—She would only inſinuate in the gentleſt accents, and with the moſt perſuaſive arguments, that I muſt not expect complete happineſs; that all our lives were liable to the caprice of fortune, and whoſe changes human nature was born to encounter, and muſt ſubmit.—Perfect bliſs was the lot of none, nor was even a large portion of happineſs poſſeſſed by many; ſhe would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſh to prepare my mind, and make it equal to meet the diſpenſations of all human events, that ſo I might ſecure that peace, which the world can neither give nor take away.</p>
            <p>"Thus was I, by her dear precepts, in ſome degree fitted for thoſe many difficulties and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers I have already encountered; and to her, next to God Almighty, I am indebted for this fortitude which has hitherto ſuſtained me." But to return to my ſtory.</p>
            <p>"One morning Eugene ſhewed me a letter he had received, which recalled him to England. He ſaid it came from a gentleman who was his
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035640_0085_1006938E9F8411C8"/>
guardian, and whom he was bound to obey. There were ſome ſentences in the letter, which were couched in ſuch terms as led us both to think, that when the writer talked of forming improper connexions, by remaining too long in one place, he alluded to our intimacy.</p>
            <p>"Eugene at firſt declared he would not obey the mandate, and that he had long enough ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the controul and caprice of thoſe whom he really believed had no right to direct, or take any part in his conduct. As to myſelf, I was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally incapable of giving advice; but there was no occaſion; M. du Frene decided for us. He alſo had received a letter on the ſame ſubject, and Eugene's fate was determined. If ever there was a moment in which my love for M. du Frene was abated, it was when he peremptorily told him he muſt not delay his departure. I felt as if I had received a blow, which deprived me of all my faculties; nor could all the aſſurances of Eugene's faith and everlaſting love reconcile me to the idea of loſing him. I conſidered his departure as the deprivation of all my happineſs; nor could all the admonitions of Madame calm my feelings. Indeed thoſe dear parents lamented his loſs almoſt as much as myſelf; and when the day arrived on
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035640_0086_10069391EF520F38"/>
which he was to take his leave, I ſcarce knew which of us were moſt concerned.</p>
            <p>"M. du Frene preſſed him to his heart, and conjured him never to forget friends to whom he was ſo dear; and Madame ſaid a thouſand kind and affectionate things to him. As to myſelf, I ſtood like the picture of deſpair; and when Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene preſſed me to his boſom, I felt as if my whole exiſtence was at an end, and I could not articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a ſentence. Ah! too juſt was my preſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we ſhould never meet again. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to write, and (if poſſible) to return; but never, from that ſad hour, did we hear or ſee any more of him; and from that time happineſs ſeemed to have fled with my loſt Eugene.</p>
            <p>"M. du Frene was a politician. What grief did that circumſtance occaſion to Madame! We uſed all our perſuaſions to keep him at home, and to take no part in the broils which began to be very general; but it was to no purpoſe that we urged him to be neuter; He was too much attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his king to bear quietly the diſaffection which prevailed, and every where began to ſpread itſelf. All our entreaties were uſed in vain; a whole year paſſed in this unpleaſant ſtate, and no
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035640_0087_100693952D48D1B8"/>
intelligence of Eugene arrived to ſooth the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hours, rendered ſtill more irkſome by M. du Frene's frequent quarrels and uneaſineſs, by the melancholy which always pervaded his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the continual dread we were under of ſome new calamity happening to the ſtate.</p>
            <p>"In this diſtreſſed condition we continued till the fatal tenth of Auguſt, 1792; that era of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſgrace to the French nation, when Paris was deluged in human gore. On that ſad day M. du Frene had gone from home early in the morning, and I had been vainly endeavoring to perſuade Madame du Frene that her fears were needleſs, when a loud knocking at the door, and a tumult, made me venture to look through the window; when ah! how does my ſoul ſicken at the remembrance! I ſaw my ever dear, my more than parent's head, ſtuck upon a pike, reeking and clotted with blood! I uttered a ſcream, and hid my eyes with my hands; when Madame du Frene coming to my aſſiſtance, diſcovered the dreadful object which had occaſioned my terror! She gave a piercing ſcream, which, methinks, now vibrates on my ear, and dropped ſenſeleſs on the floor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:035640_0088_1006939A9AEAF9D8"/>
"Greatly as I was affected, I exerted myſelf to aſſiſt and recal her to life, which it was ſome time before ſhe ſhewed any ſigns of. When ſhe, in ſome degree, recovered, ſhe obſerved a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence upon the ſubject of the horrible ſight we had both of us but too plainly ſeen. Her ſighs, indeed, were deep and bitter; but it ſeemed as if ſhe could not bear to name the ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtance which occaſioned them, and to which ſhe muſt have been witneſs. We had ſcarce time to recollect ourſelves, and my dear Madame du Frene ſhewed but little ſigns of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when ſome of our friends aſſembled at our houſe, and earneſtly entreated we would loſe no time in making our eſcape, if we wiſhed to avoid the cruel fate which ſome of thoſe deareſt to us had experienced. We neither of us ſeemed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently intereſted to prolong our wretchedneſs, or attend to their remonſtrances, and we appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to wiſh for death than to avoid it; but our friends uſed ſuch preſſing ſolicitations, and begged ſo earneſtly, that we would leave Paris with them, that we began (though reluctantly) to put up our valuables, and to prepare for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. Little as I cared for life, or had any
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035640_0089_1006939C452CDC10"/>
proſpect to invite its continuance, yet the name of England ſounded with a ſweet ſenſation. A thouſand tender ideas were aſſociated with that country; and the fond remembrance of Eugene played round my heart amidſt the ſorrows that encompaſſed me. I joined my endeavors to rouſe Madame du Frene from her lethargy of woe, and to fly whilſt it was yet in our power; and having ſucceeded, we left Paris that night, and travelled with as much expedition as the French carriages could make, till we got to Boulogne, where we found the town crowded with emigrants, waiting to croſs the water.</p>
            <p>"When the wind was fair, and the veſſels were ready, we were hurried down to the quay in ſuch numbers, and put on board in ſo much confuſion, that I was unfortunately ſeparated from my dear Madame du Frene, and put on board of a merchantman.</p>
            <p>"As ſoon as I found myſelf ſeparated from her, I entreated, and offered largely to the captain if he would ſet me on ſhore again; but he was deaf to all my cries, and ſaid he would not loſe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My miſery was not to be deſcribed! I found myſelf encompaſſed by ſtrangers; and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035640_0090_100693A01F75AE30"/>
what was worſe, I underſtood we were to be ſet on ſhore on the Welch coaſt.</p>
            <p>"As to the fate of Madame du Frene, from that hour to this, I have remained in total igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance about it; and it has been an everlaſting cauſe of ſorrow to me!</p>
            <p>"We landed in Milford Haven, at a place which appeared almoſt uninhabited; and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only of an inn and a few houſes. It might be conſidered as a bathing place, but of little reſort. I fixed my reſidence in a ſmall lodging near the ſea, to which my eyes were inceſſantly turned, in the hope of ſeeing ſome veſſel which might bring Madame du Frene to the ſame ſpot.</p>
            <p>"Moſt of the people who landed with me, diſperſed to different parts of England; but as I could think of no place to prefer to this, I thought it beſt, for the preſent, to remain where I was. I was attended by a young woman of the village, named Mary Morgan; ſhe was neat, and well behaved; and I paſſed moſt of my time in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with her on the beach. I wiſhed to go to London, as the moſt likely place to hear of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame du Frene; but I was afraid to go there
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035640_0091_100693A314AFC2D8"/>
alone, there not being in that vaſt metropolis one perſon with whom I could claim acquaintance.</p>
            <p>"It happened one evening that, as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the beach with Mary, I perceived my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obſerved by a good looking man, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be about forty years of age, and who ſeemed to eye me with uncommon attention. There was ſomething in his perſon and manners, which not only attracted my notice, but alſo my partiality. Our eyes met; and, as I was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill on the beach, I was not diſpleaſed at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accoſted by him with ſome general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the place we were in, and the ſea proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>"The next day we met upon the ſame ſpot, when our converſation was again renewed. We talked on various ſubjects, and he told me his name was Thoranby; that he lived in London, and generally came every ſummer to ſome place of this kind for the benefit of ſea-bathing, and to be retired.</p>
            <p>"Upon his ſaying that he lived in London, I imprudently replied, "That of all places I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go there;" at the ſame time telling him that part of my hiſtory which had ſeparated me
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035640_0092_100693A4EDDAD888"/>
from my more than mother, and my ardent wiſh to find her again.</p>
            <p>"He ſeemed pleaſed with the affectionate duty I expreſſed; and, after paying me ſome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on my extreme ſenſibility, he ſaid, "He had a ſiſter in London, who would, he was ſure, be happy to receive me; and would unite her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to mine in order to diſcover Madame du Frene." How did my heart overflow with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude at this unexpected invitation! Young and unacquainted as I was with the arts of men, I haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily accepted his offer; and, indeed, my joy and impatience to begin my journey was too conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to be concealed. Accordingly it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that he ſhould ſet out on the next day, in order to prepare his ſiſter for my arrival; and that in three days after I ſhould follow with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who had agreed to accompany me to London.</p>
            <p>"Nothing could exceed my eagerneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience for the arrival of the day on which I was to ſet out; and I ſcarce gave myſelf time for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſt, and none at all for reflection. The hope of meeting my dear Madame du Frene, together with that ſecret wiſh which ſtill glowed in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of hearing ſomething of Eugene, was cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035640_0093_100693A977992780"/>
with ſuch fond imagination, that I had almoſt realized my wiſhes to a certainty; and when we entered London, my fancy had formed ſo many fair ideas, by which I was wholly engroſſed, that I hardly attended to the aſtoniſhed exclamations of poor Mary, at the ſight of the ſtreets, number of people, carriages, &amp;c. &amp;c. which to me, who had lived ſo long in Paris, was nothing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; but when the carriage drove up to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry magnificent houſe in Portland Place, my heart felt an unuſual oppreſſion; and, for the firſt time, ſuggeſted to me the impropriety of following to London a perſon of whom I knew ſo little; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, reflections of this kind were now too late. The chaiſe ſtopped; the bell was rung, and two footmen, in ſplendid liveries, uſhered me through the hall, up a ſtone ſtaircaſe.</p>
            <p>"My aſtoniſhment increaſed as I aſcended the ſteps. Mr Thoranby had told me he lived in a handſome houſe in London; but I had no idea it was ſo ſuperb, ſtill leſs that his ſiſter lived in this elegant ſtyle. I fancied there muſt have been ſome miſtake, and a variety of reflections ruſhed with rapidity upon my mind, and a thouſand forebodings, of I knew not what, agitated me ſo
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035640_0094_100693ABA13C29D8"/>
much, that I fancied I did not hear diſtinctly whom the ſervant addreſſed.</p>
            <p>"Mr Thoranby (who then made his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) by the appellation of "my Lord;" but when he approached to receive me, with a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſmile of exultation, my heart died within me, and I faintly exclaimed, "I am betrayed."</p>
            <p>"It was in vain that his lordſhip endeavored to ſooth me, after having acknowledged that he had deceived me reſpecting his having a ſiſter, as well as his name and rank. I at once ſaw my ruined ſituation; and I exclaimed on the cruelty of his conduct, demanding immediate releaſe. He pleaded the moſt ardent love, proteſting that he could not live without me. Finding me deaf to his vows, and reſolute in my determination, this wretched Lord Oakendale confeſſed to me that he was a married man!</p>
            <p>"Yes, my dear Laura," ſays he, "you ſhould pity rather than condemn a man who is united to a woman for whom he can conceive nothing but averſion, and who is in no reſpect calculated for domeſtic happineſs, whilſt his heart is enraptured by your virtues, and abſolutely devoted to your ſervice; nothing but this prior <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>"I had ſcarce patience to hear him to the end—"Marry me! (I replied) is it poſſible that your vanity can ſuggeſt ſuch an idea? Did you bring me here to dazzle me with your ſplendor, as a means to gain me to your purpoſe? When I firſt became acquainted with you, it was your age which ſecured my confidence; and now that I find you are ſuch a depraved character—" I was proceeding; but I found I had touched a ſtring the moſt diſcordant to his ear, that of his age.</p>
            <p>"Peace, madam," ſaid he; "nor dare to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult me thus. Age, indeed! know, ſilly girl, that you are in my power; and if you provoke that power; I warn you to take the conſequence." With theſe words he haſtily quitted the room, leaving me to reflect upon my diſtreſſed ſituation, with the additional torment of ſelf-accuſation for having brought myſelf into his power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:035640_0096_100693B50E500060"/>
"During two whole days I ſaw nothing of his lordſhip, though I learned from Mary (who was ſtill allowed to attend me) that he was in the houſe, and that all the ſervants had orders to obey me in every thing, except aſſiſting me to leave it. She likewiſe informed me, that lady Oakendale was no further from London than Hampſtead. Various were my conjectures upon his conduct. Sometimes I thought he would relent, and give me my liberty; at others, that he was only medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating further miſchief. I had no hope of making my eſcape; for the rooms I was allowed to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py were not in the front of the houſe, and only looked into a cloſe paved court, from whence I could not poſſibly get out, were I to attempt the windows. My mind was harraſſed by ſleepleſs nights and continual fatigue.</p>
            <p>"On the third morning Lord Oakendale enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the apartment; he ſhewed ſome degree of compaſſion at my pale and altered looks; and then ſaid, "You have fooliſhly rejected all my offers; but ſurely that muſt proceed from a haſty judgment, and becauſe you have not well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them. However as I cannot bring myſelf
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035640_0097_100693B86E5FBFF8"/>
to part with you entirely, I have thought of a plan which will give you an opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my offers more deliberately; and let me add, with leſe haughtineſs. I mean to ſend you down to an old Abbey in Cumberland, with Mary to accompany you, or any other of my domeſtics whom you may prefer. It is true, you will be but ill accommodated; but for that you may thank your own obſtinacy, and you will there have leiſure to conſider my propoſals with the attention they deſerve."</p>
            <p>"The idea of an Abbey made me ſhudder; but when I conſidered I ſhould be releaſed from my preſent priſon, and that he ſaid not a word of going with me, I thought it moſt prudent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble; I therefore told him, in a milder tone than I had ſpoken before, that I was ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low whitherſoever my deſtiny ſhould lead me; that I choſe Mary for my companion, and that I would conſider of what he had ſaid with more moderation. A ſmile of approbation ſat upon his countenance as I uttered the laſt ſentence. He took me tenderly by the hand, and ſaid, "Then I will inſtantly order the carriage to be got rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:"
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035640_0098_100693BA64B7A498"/>
and having aſſured him it ſhould not wait for me, he quitted me to give the neceſſary orders.</p>
            <p>"The moment he was gone, a gleam of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction overſpread my mind at the idea of leaving that deteſted houſe. At the ſame moment a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itory regret occurred at the thoughts of leaving London; that London, to which I had haſtened with ſuch rapidity, and which probably contained all that was moſt dear to me; yet, to gain, in ſome degree, my liberty, and to leave Lord Oakendale was my firſt object; and I reſolved to make no more haſty determinations; nor even attempt to make my eſcape without a great deal of delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumſpection. Mary conſented to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me; but it was evidently with reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The ſplendor of Lord Oakendale's eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment had attracted her admiration, and ſhe wiſhed to ſtay longer and ſee more; but ſhe was a fooliſh uninformed creature, and on that ſcore I excuſed her; and thinking ſhe was a more truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty companion than any Lord Oakendale could furniſh me with, I preſſed her to accompany me; at the ſame time giving her ſome money for the ſervices ſhe had already done me, and in order to ſecure her future fidelity; we therefore ſtepped
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035640_0099_100693C0255CD990"/>
into the carriage, which I found was loaded with proviſions, that we might have no occaſion to ſtop, except for change of horſes. We were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by two ſervants on horſe-back, and ſuch precautions taken, that it would have been in vain to have meditated an eſcape. How ardently did I wiſh to be attacked by robbers, as the only means I could foreſee of gaining my liberty; but no ſuch good fortune happening, we, after a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing journey, arrived at Oakendale Abbey."—And here Laura continued to relate all the terrors ſhe had experienced in that place, as well as the manner of her eſcaping; not omitting to inform Mrs. Greville the circumſtance of her finding the letter caſe ſhe had given to Eugene.</p>
            <p>When ſhe had finiſhed her ſtory, Mrs Greville ſaid, "Indeed, my dear young lady, your ſtory is replete with uncommon circumſtances of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and I am as much intereſted by it, as I am ſurpriſed and entertained. If your appearance prejudiced me in your favor, your uncommon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and merit entitle you to my regard and protection, which you may be aſſured of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as long as you are diſpoſed to continue under my roof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:035640_0100_100693C2720C7060"/>
"I have (continued the good lady) a nephew, who is married to a very amiable woman; his name is Sir George Orland, and they paſs great part of the year with me; you will, I am ſure, like each other, and if you pay them a viſit in London, they will protect you from the attempts of Lord Oakendale as well as aſſiſt your inquiries concerning thoſe ſo deſervedly dear to you."</p>
            <p>Laura could not find words ſufficient to thank Mrs. Greville for her extreme kindneſs; and, having exhauſted the effuſions of her grateful heart, ſhe began aſking Mrs. Greville ſome queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as to what ſhe knew, or had ever heard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Oakendale-Abbey.</p>
            <p>"Why," returned Mrs. Greville, "when you named Oakendale-Abbey, as having reſided there, I confeſs I ſhuddered at the idea; nevertheleſs I would not have you ſuppoſe that I believe in any of the idle reports current in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood; for they are carried to a degree of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity and ſuperſtition beyond all credit. When they tell you of men and women being ſeen car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their heads in their hands, and of monſtrous eyes looking through the windows flaming with
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035640_0101_100693C7C193ABD8"/>
fire, one is more inclined to laugh at ſuch idle tales than to be alarmed by them. But I muſt own I have long ſuſpected there was ſome myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be unfolded at the Abbey; but of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I cannot even gueſs. The ſurpriſing things you witneſſed there confirms this belief, and I wiſh it were ſeriouſly inveſtigated.</p>
            <p>"It is now many years ſince I ſaw the inſide of the Abbey; and it was by no means a fit reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the fair inhabitant whom I went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit; it muſt be now infinitely worſe, and a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place to ſend a young perſon to! I only won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how you could ſupport yourſelf under ſuch circumſtances; and it is like the reſt of Lord Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale's conduct."</p>
            <p>"My dear Madam," ſaid Laura, "I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Abbey had not been inhabited ſince the memory of any perſon now living; who then could you go there to viſit?"</p>
            <p>"Indeed," replied Mrs. Greville, "I ought to explain myſelf; for what I ſaid muſt ſeem as myſterious as any of the ſtories which are related. I went to ſee a picture of the preſent Lord's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which, upon ſome family feuds, was ſent down to this Abbey as a puniſhment, or rather
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035640_0102_100693CA08EE7020"/>
mortification, to the perſon it repreſented. He was allowed to be an uncommonly and well finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed picture, and was done by an Italian maſter; and the ſweetneſs of the countenance exceeded any I ever ſaw, except that I am now beholding!"</p>
            <p>Laura bowed her thanks for the compliment, and aſked Mrs. Greville "if the picture did not hand in a room which ſhe deſcribed; and if it was not in the Vandyke taſte?"</p>
            <p>Mrs. Greville replied, "that it was, and was a beautiful full length portrait."</p>
            <p>"Yes," ſaid Laura, "it was in that room that I diſcovered the letter-caſe; and I can never be perſuaded but Eugene muſt have been in that apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for I think (ſhe added, with a ſigh) he would not have parted with it to any one elſe."</p>
            <p>"That is, indeed," ſaid Mrs. Greville, "a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinary circumſtance, and which time only can diſcover, and will, I have no doubt; for depend upon it, my dear, you will live to ſee the clouds diſperſe, which at preſent ſeem to hang over you; and you will one day meet with the reward your merit deſerves.—In the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while make yourſelf eaſy under my protection;
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035640_0103_100693CF5F25E850"/>
and wait with patience the will of that all wiſe diſpoſer of events, who never deſerted the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and who is a Father to the fatherleſs."</p>
            <p>Laura ſaid ſhe had every reaſon to be grateful to Providence, who had, in ſo many inſtances, ſhewn a manifeſt interpoſition in her favor, and never more than by placing her under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection where ſhe now felt herſelf ſo happily ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; and in which ſecure aſylum we will, for the preſent, leave her, and return to give ſome account of Lord Oakendale, who on arriving at the Abbey, and finding Laura had eſcaped, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came outrageous, and almoſt frantic with diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
            <p>Mary was interrogated with violence and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, as an accomplice in the plan; but ſhe declared her innocence with ſo much ſimplicity, that his lordſhip's anger at length gave way to belief, and he conſented to her entreaties of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent back again into Wales.</p>
            <p>His diſappointment added freſh fuel to his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and his reſentment; for he vowed ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on the poor devoted Laura, ſhould he ever get her again into his hands, of which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but little doubt; knowing that without
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035640_0104_100693D2A7959F08"/>
either horſe or carriage, or any one to aſſiſt her, ſhe could not have eſcaped far from the village; and that, by bribes and promiſes, he ſhould very ſoon have her again in his power. He determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſleep that night at the Abbey, in the ſame bed which had been occupied by Laura and Mary. Another was fitted up in an adjoining room for his ſervant.</p>
            <p>It was the firſt time in his life he had ever been in the Abbey. He thought it horrible and gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and he would have felt ſome compaſſion for Laura, for having been conſigned to ſuch a place, had not her recent flight ſteeled his heart with reſentment, and ſhut every avenue to pity.</p>
            <p>The idea of ſupernatural appearances had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſince he was a child, diſturbed his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he therefore, diveſted of all fear, compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to take a refreſhing portion of ſleep, in order to be the better enabled to make a more vigilant purſuit after Laura the next day. He had not, however, been in bed two hours before he was very much ſurpriſed by a foot-ſtep, and a low murmuring voice, which apeared to be not far diſtant. He called his ſervant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:035640_0105_100693D5A98F9278"/>
The poor man readily obeyed the ſummons, for he had been equally alarmed. He entered the room pale and trembling, and was going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his fears; but Lord Oakendale felt his val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our return, and being aſhamed to confeſs his fright to his ſervant, he only ſaid there were rats in the houſe; talked loud, bluſtered, and ordered his ſervant to return to his bed.</p>
            <p>In about an hour the ſteps and the voice were heard again. The idea that Laura was conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome part of the Abbey occuring to his mind, he haſtily called up his ſervant, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to bring lights, he prepared himſelf to ſearch the Abbey. The man having heard the report of its being haunted, and being already very much alarmed at what had paſſed, was not quite ſo willing to enter into ſuch ſervice, and endeavoured to perſuade his Lord to wait for the morning; but this ſuggeſtion only ſtimulated Lord Oakendale to begin the ſearch, having worked up his mind to the firm opinion that he ſhould find Laura. They each took a light, and proceeded through all the apartments; Lord Oakendale with his ſword drawn in his hand, ſwearing to murder the firſt perſon he found, if
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035640_0106_100693D890426638"/>
they ſhould endeavour to ſcreen Laura from his poſſeſſion. He likewiſe exhorted his ſervant to be courageous, and to follow his example.</p>
            <p>The man ſtood greatly in need of the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for as he tremblingly led the way, and carried the lights, he expected to loſe his ſenſes by the ſight of ſome tremendous apparition; and when Lord Oakendale opened the ruſty locks and creaking doors, he thought his heart would have died within him.</p>
            <p>When they approached the room, in which was the trunk and ſkeleton, Lord Oakendale made a ſtop.—The gloomineſs of its appearance, rendered doubly ſo by the ſtill dark hour of the night, had a momentary effect upon his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he reſumed his courage, and ſurveyed the room. The ſervant trembled, and ſcarcely lifted up his eyes. They approached the trunk wherein the ſkeleton was depoſited. Lord Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale ordered his ſervant to lift up the lid; and the light had no ſooner glanced upon the ghaſtly figure, than the man, dropping the lid from his hand, exclaimed, "God preſerve us! here is a dead man, bigger than a giant, with ſaucer eyes, and huge limbs!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:035640_0107_100693DE317CDE78"/>
"Ridiculous!" exclaimed his Lord, at the ſame moment examining it himſelf, though not without feeling a chill at this relic of mortality; and he was for a moment undetermined whether or not to proceed, when the idea of Laura again renewed his courage, and he advanced to the cloiſter, and following the light carried by the terrified ſervant, arrived at the partition, which preſented neither a door, or any means of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, whatſoever.</p>
            <p>This circumſtance ſtrongly excited his curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and this aided by diſappointment, brought him to a deſperate pitch of reſolution; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the boards were but thin, he ſet his whole force againſt them, and, with a terrible craſh, they all at once gave way. A confuſed rumbling noiſe aſſailed his ears; but how were all his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtiffened with horror at the ſight of a human body, apparently dead, but ſitting upright in a coffin!</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale ſtarted at the ſight; the ſword dropped from his hand, and he ſtood petrified with terror and amazement. The ſervant had fallen down, and nearly extinguiſhed the light; and as Lord Oakendale ſtooped down to preſerve
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035640_0108_100693E20593AC60"/>
it, he fancied a cold hand graſped him. His trembling legs ſcarce ſupported him from this ſcene of terror! The ſervant was nearly deprived of his ſenſes. His maſter aſſiſted him to riſe, and haſtily turning towards the cloiſter, they made the beſt of their way through the apartments they had before ſo minutely examined, ruſhed out of the Abbey, and alarmed the village!</p>
            <p>The clock ſtruck four, and ſome of the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants were already riſing to their work: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lordſhip, as they ſuppoſed, making his eſcape from the Abbey, they, concluding he had ſeen ſomething to terrify and alarm him, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round, with a hope of being gratified by ſome marvelous adventure; but his Lordſhip was in no humour to relate wonders. He ordered horſes to the carriage, and getting into it, beſtowed ſomething like a curſe upon Laura, the Abbey, and all the infernal ſpirits that inhabited it.</p>
            <p>In this diſpoſition he purſued his way to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Various were his conjectures during his journey; and he could form his ideas into no ſyſtem of probability as to the ſtrange and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable ſights he had beheld at the Abbey. He
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035640_0109_100693E5F8DC1760"/>
reſolved, indeed, to have them thoroughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated on ſome future occaſion; but he never intended again to encounter them himſelf. He ſuffered great uneaſineſs on account of Laura. He ſound he loved her with ſincere affection. Her idea dwelt upon his heart with more uneaſy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations than he had ever before experienced, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his love for her was neither founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſteem or delicacy. But he was a mere ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt; yet a ſomething of tender anxiety was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with his paſſion for her. "Where could ſhe be, and to what evils and ſufferings might ſhe be expoſed?" Theſe were intruding queſtions that forced themſelves with compaſſionate tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon a heart but little alive to the ſofter feelings of humanity. In this ſtate we will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave him for the preſent, in order to give our readers an account of ſome other perſonages who have as yet appeared but in the back ground of the hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Lady Oakendale, of whom we have ſaid that ſhe was the only daughter of Lord Weſthaven, and that her immenſe fortune was the only induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Lord Oakendale had for making her his wife, was, as has been before related, by no means calculated to ſooth the brow of care, by
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035640_0110_100693E8FA6B23A0"/>
which her Lord was now oppreſſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they had conceived an averſion bordering upon hatred for each other. But, in order to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucidate her hiſtory, we muſt go back to a very early period of her life. She was an only child, and had loſt her mother when ſhe was very young; and from that circumſtance might date all her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, as ſhe was conſigned to the care of a governeſs, and other mercenary dependants, whoſe chief object was to inculcate in her the idea of her own conſequence, by continually reminding her of her great fortune ſhe would in future poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, as well as the high rank ſhe held in life.</p>
            <p>After being taught the various accompliſhments neceſſary for her ſituation, in ſo ſuperficial a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they could neither be an entertainment to others, nor any reſource to herſelf, ſhe ſound a void in her mind, which ſhe would ſometimes endeavour to fill up by attempts at fancy-work, of ſome ingenious device peculiar to the ſex; but on theſe occaſions ſhe was always informed, that ſuch employments were by no means fit for her to engage in; and that there were people ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent who would be glad to do ſuch little ſervices for the gratuity which ſhe had it ſo amply in her power to beſtow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:035640_0111_100693EC062B5880"/>
Thus was her mind (perhaps naturally good) withdrawn from every ſource of inſtruction or amuſement, and left to the idle workings of phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic conceits, which will always, if not ſubdued by rational amuſements, lead to an indolent laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, totally deſtructive of every moral and ſocial virtue.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe was of an age to appear at her father's table, and be indroduced by ſome of his acquaintance to public places, her whole mornings were ſpent in trying on various caps, and other dreſſes; conſulting her glaſs, and aſſorting her ribbands and feathers to her complexion, and the color of her hair. Her perſon was neither hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or otherwiſe; her ſkin was fair, but her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were irregular and wanted animation; and ſhe had acquired an air of hauteur, which, being unaccompanied by grace, bordered upon ill-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</p>
            <p>Lord Weſthaven, after the death of his wife, grew fond of drinking, and engaged in a diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of life, neither conſiſtent with his age or ſtation. He loved his daughter, as ſomething very nearly allied to himſelf; but he took no pains to regulate her conduct, or to improve her
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035640_0112_100693EDEAFF1480"/>
underſtanding. He frequently brought men home to dinner, whoſe free converſation was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppreſſed by her preſence, nor regulated by propriety; and from theſe ſhe heard toaſts and ſentiments by no means proper for her contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation; which gave her a bold aſſurance, but little conſiſtent with the delicacy of the feminine character.</p>
            <p>She was known to have an immenſe fortune, and of courſe was addreſſed by every man who wiſhed to advance his own.</p>
            <p>An officer in the guards, of the name of Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, was the moſt aſſiduous in his attentions to her; and, indeed, for a time, kept all the reſt at a diſtance. He had an uncommon fine perſon, and was ſufficiently well ſkilled in the ſcience of faſhion and flattery to render himſelf agreeable. He ſtudied her diſpoſition with the niceſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, being well aware that her father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned her for a man of rank, having no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of that nature at that time, he was reſolved to ſupplant thoſe that had; he therefore thought he had only to ſecure her affections as the prelude to the poſſeſſion of her fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:035640_0113_100693F24F6200E8"/>
She loved Vincent as a girl of her education and diſpoſition would naturally do, who was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by his perſon, and pleaſed with his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But ſhe knew he could not introduce her into the rank in life her ambition led her to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe muſt fill, and ſhe could not endure the ſound of plain Mrs Vincent; yet the idea of a tender lover, encouraged in ſecret, and met by ſtratagem, enraptured her imagination, and was ſo conſonant to her wiſhes, that what ſhe firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a charming amuſement for her leiſure hours, became a ſerious conſideration, and in the end, a ſource of increaſing miſery.</p>
            <p>It happened about this time that the Earl of Oakendale was introduced to her by her father; and, after a few interviews, ſhe was told to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as her lover and deſtined huſband.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale was a man whom Miſs Rainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford might have liked, had not her heart been devoted to Vincent; yet the idea of being a Counteſs, with all the flattering appendages of a title, gave a preponderancy to the ſcale of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and made her accept of Lord Oakendale's propoſals, and her father's commands, without any ſeeming reluctance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:035640_0114_100693F46A33F098"/>
Meantime Vincent could not bear to loſe the golden prize, and have the mortification to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, what he had thought ſo well ſecured to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, given to another. Thus fired with jealouſy, and diſappointed in his ambitious views, he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated miſchief and revenge. Firſt he thought to induce her to conſent to a clandeſtine marriage; but the idea that, in caſe of high reſentment from her father, ſhe might, inſtead of a large portion, not bring him a ſhilling, proved a too weighty conſequence, and he durſt not riſque ſuch a chance.</p>
            <p>The next ſuggeſtion wore a more feaſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Miſs Rainsford loved him paſſionately, though he believed ſhe loved title and ſplendor better; the only way then to ſupplant his rival, and ſecure his intereſt, was to make a marriage with him neceſſary to ſave her reputation. There were tender moments, in which Miſs Rainsford's prudence might yield to love, and probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences might bring even the Earl to ſolicit a marriage, to which, under no other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he would have conſented.</p>
            <p>Having concerted this plan; not indeed the moſt honorable one, but ſuch as might well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the nature of the parties concerned,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035640_0115_100693F8FB54A110"/>
he ſtudied, at the next private interview, the moſt inſinuating addreſs, and the moſt pathetic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. He knew the exact ſtate of Miſs Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's heart, and upon what principle all her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents were guided. He lamented, in terms of deſpair, his cruel and unmerited fate; he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his love was founded upon the nobleſt baſis, that of affection for her alone; whilſt Lord Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale's was merely for her fortune, without the ſmalleſt particle of paſſion for that enchanting perſon, which was the ſole object of his adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet ſuch was his regard, ſuch his ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, that he would renounce all hope, and yield her to his hated rival; whilſt he tore himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, never more to behold her, and ſought, in the field of battle, that death which alone could releaſe him from the miſery of his preſent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>This was a language too perſuaſive, and too powerful, for the tender feelings of Miſs Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Charmed with ſuch flattering deluſions ſhe could refuſe nothing to ſo fond and tender a lover; her melting heart acknowledged all his influence, and ſhe became his miſtreſs. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while the ſtolen enjoyments became ſweeter by repetition; but what were the mortifying reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035640_0116_100693FD25562AA0"/>
ſhe underwent, when a ſhort time ſhewed the effects of their illicit connexion.</p>
            <p>This was the boundary of Vincent's wiſhes, and he concluded his fortune made; yet ſuch was the ſtrange and unnatural diſpoſition of Miſs Rainsford, whether ambition got the better of all ſofter ties, or from whatever cauſe her mind was influenced, ſhe no ſooner diſcovered her ſituation than ſhe conceived a mortal averſion to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of her diſgrace; and, contrary to all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and to his utter aſtoniſhment, ſhe gave every encouragement to the match with Lord Oakendale. Struck with averſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt to the woman, who could be capable of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo contrary to delicacy and every feminine virtue, his heart recoiled at the idea of a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with her, and he ſecretly triumphed in the diſgrace of his rival.</p>
            <p>Meantime ſome embarraſſing circumſtances oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured relating to the ſettlements of eſtates, and neceſſarily delayed the match, which Miſs Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford could not, with propriety, haſten. Her ſituation, therefore, was become truly dreadful; and before the completion of the ſettlements, ſhe found herſelf four months advanced in her preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035640_0117_10069400022387F8"/>
by the man whom ſhe had ſacrificed to her ambition; and which ambition ſtill urged her to complete the ſacrifice by giving her hand at the altar to Lord Oakendale. The conſequence of this marriage has before been deſcribed.</p>
            <p>Driven to the laſt extremity, within two months of her time, every day making it more difficult to conceal her ſituation, and finding it impoſſible, from the date of her marriage to impoſe the fruit of her guilt upon her Lord, ſhe had recourſe to the counſel and opinion of a confidante—the woman who had been her favored attendant from her youth, and to whoſe pernicious flattery, and improper advice, ſhe, in ſome degree owed her ruin!</p>
            <p>This woman's name was Marcel; ſhe was a native of France, and had improved the deceit and hypocriſy of that country by the loweſt vices of this; ſhe ſeemed, however the proper friend, upon this trying emergency. After lady Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale had bribed her to ſecrecy, ſhe intruſted her with the whole hiſtory of her amour; and, having conſulted upon the wiſeſt and moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent methods, ſhe ſuggeſted that of retiring into the country, under the pretence of ill health,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:035640_0118_10069402F4E824C8"/>
where ſhe would remain till after her delivery; and this was the more eaſy to put in practice from the little attention Lord Oakendale had ever ſhewn to his lady ſince their marriage; for he ſeemed never in the ſmalleſt degree, intereſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing ſhe did, or ever paid the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to her health, or any thing that concerned her. Thus was ſhe at full liberty to purſue her own plan and inclinations.</p>
            <p>Every thing therefore was arranged, and ſhe went to a retired village in Buckinghamſhire; where, paſſing for the widow of an officer, ſhe was delivered of a ſon in the preſence of only the accoucheur, and her faithful confidante.</p>
            <p>The former had been engaged to ſecrecy upon his honor, for he was above taking a larger bribe than his ſee; and Marcel was to provide a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nurſe, and entirely undertake the charge of the infant.</p>
            <p>The gentleman employed upon this occaſion was by nature humane, and from principle gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Without prying into the reaſons which made ſecrecy neceſſary, he always wiſhed to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the effuſions of natural affection from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to her offſpring, under whatſoever circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035640_0119_1006940623CDB5E0"/>
it might be produced; he therefore took the ſmiling babe to the ſight of lady Oakendale, in the hope that its helpleſs innocence might plead for maternal protection. But no ſooner had ſhe caſt her eyes upon the unfortunate object of her diſgrace, than ſhe gave a ſhriek of abhorrence, and begged he would take the odious brat from her ſight!</p>
            <p>Shocked at her inhuman exclamation, he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly wrapped up the infant, ſaying, "Poor child! this unnatural behavior will lead me to diſcover the myſtery of thy birth; and amply ſhall thy unfeeling mother provide for thy neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities."</p>
            <p>He proved his words; for he made ſuch enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as ſatisfied his curioſity, and juſtified he meaſures he took to ſee that the child was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly nurſed; and during its infancy and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he repeatedly obtained large ſums from lady Oakendale for its education; for he made no ſcruple to inform her ladyſhip that he knew the whole ſecret, which he threatened to expoſe and diſcover, unleſs ſhe acquieſced in his demands. In reality he could only gueſs at the tranſaction; but as her allowance for pin-money was very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035640_0120_1006940A024BC8A8"/>
and he had taken an uncommon fancy to the child, as it advanced in years, he took the entire charge of him, and choſe that the boy's education ſhould be upon the moſt liberal plan.</p>
            <p>Nothing was omitted that could improve his capacity, and give him every advantage; and he had attained the age of twenty years, adorned with every grace and accompliſhment, which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of perſon and a natural underſtanding, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by the higheſt cultivation, could beſtow, without ever experiencing one glance of parental favor.</p>
            <p>There was no part of his life, in which he had been led to ſuppoſe himſelf the ſon of this humane guardian of his youth.</p>
            <p>After repeated interrogatories to gain the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to whom he owed his being, Mr. F—informed him; that he was really ignorant of the name of his father, but he knew his mother, and that ſome time or other he ſhould be introduced to her. This time was now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Mr F—was brother to Monſieur du Frene, to whom he had ſent Eugene, in order to make a proficiency in the French language; and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035640_0121_1006940D417E56E8"/>
likewiſe to gain that poliſh ſo neceſſary for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed character, and to which the eaſy manners of the French nation generally contributed.</p>
            <p>The duel, in which he had ſo unfortunately engaged, together with the tender attachment he had formed with Laura, were improprieties of a ſufficient magnitude for Mr. F—to recall him to England; and to take care that none of the many letters, in which he vowed eternal conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Laura ſhould ever be forwarded from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. If, in this inſtance, Mr. F—ſhould be blamed for duplicity and unjuſt dealing, it muſt be allowed in his favor, that he conſidered Eugene as a pledge of honor, for whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct he muſt one day be accountable. He had ſtolen him from his nurſe at a very early age, and ſecreted him from lady Oakendale and Marcel, in order to reſtore him as a poliſhed gem when the time arrived, that his virtues ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Had Eugene fallen in love with any other than an adopted child of his brother's, he would have let the progreſs of their attachment taken its courſe; as it was, his conſcience would not allow of Eugene's forming a connexion, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035640_0122_1006940F009E1C90"/>
far beneath his birth, until he had been properly acknowledged by thoſe to whom he was united by the deareſt ties.</p>
            <p>Lady Oakendale, from the hour of her marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, had never experienced a moment of felicity, except that which ſhe derived from a round of diſſipation, and moving in the vortex of faſhion. Her Lord never cared for her. The fortune ſhe had brought him was the only inducement he ever had for making her his wife; and neither of them had endeavored to render the marriage ſtate hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, by any attempts to pleaſe the other.</p>
            <p>Lady Oakendale had, ſoon after her marriage, the mortification to hear that Captain Vincent had ſucceeded to a title and eſtate, by the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected death of a diſtant relation. He was now Edward Lord Vincent of Vincent Caſtle, in the kingdom of Ireland. He had been twice marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but had no children by either of his wives, and the title and eſtate at his death would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to a very diſtant branch, if he left no heir; but he had a power of appointing a ſucceſſor to his eſtate, though not to his title.</p>
            <p>The fruit of his intrigue with lady Oakendale often occured to his remembrance. He had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035640_0123_10069414721E0078"/>
made any inquiries of her ladyſhip concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and ſhe, on account of her having the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret profoundly obſerved, had carefully kept him from every information concerning the event. Lord Vincent, now wiſhing more than ever to know if he was a father, and feeling the neceſſity of appointing an heir to his vaſt fortune, cauſed an indirect application to be made to her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip concerning his offſpring, and to know if it now exiſted.</p>
            <p>Alarmed at this unexpected demand, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified left the ſecret ſhould be diſcovered, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſent for Mr. F—, deſiring him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, as far as poſſible, the ſon ſhe knew he had taken under his care, as it was now become a matter of the utmoſt importance to her, that his birth ſhould be buried in oblivion; and as ſhe had aſſured Lord Vincent that the child had died in its infancy, it became neceſſary to engage Mr. F—to corroborate the falſhood.</p>
            <p>Having, therefore, explained her motives, Mr. F—found this was the moment of diſcovery for which he had ſo long wiſhed and was likely to be fortunate for his young favorite; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined to diſſemble and acquieſce in her
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035640_0124_100694189696A378"/>
demands till he had gained the wiſhed for intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; he therefore told her ladyſhip, that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely depended upon herſelf to ſecure his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by informing him, without reſerve, who was the real father of that ſon, whoſe future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment alone depended upon a true information.</p>
            <p>She at firſt reſolutely refuſed to make the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; he knowing it would be in vain to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, or to urge any plea of the injuſtice ſhe was doing her ſon, or to addreſs her tender feelings, he only peremptorily inſiſted upon knowing the truth, as the only terms upon which he would keep the ſecret.</p>
            <p>After a very long and obſtinate reſiſtance, and making the future concealment of her ſon the condition of her confeſſion, ſhe informed him, that Lord Vincent was his father.</p>
            <p>Mr. F—was elated with pleaſure at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſeeing the noble youth, the darling of his hopes, ſo happily placed; and, inſtead of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to let him remain where he then was, in another kingdom, he immediately ſent for him home, determined to keep him under his own eye till the time arrived when he ſhould introduce
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035640_0125_1006941BEB952290"/>
him to his father, leſt the machinations of lady Oakendale might fruſtrate his deſign. Nor were theſe apprehenſions needleſs; for her ladyſhip, having informed her faithful confidante of the reſult of Mr. F—'s buſineſs, this artful woman inſtantly foreſaw the conſequences, and begged her ladyſhip, as ſhe valued her reputation and peace of mind, to counteract the deſigns of Mr. F—; which ſhe thought might eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, by demanding to have an interview with her ſon, in which Mr. F—might be preſent when her ladyſhip ſhould affect ſo much fondneſs for her ſon, that Mr. F—might be ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deceived, that he would be induced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt him to her care; after which ſhe would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to have him concealed.</p>
            <p>Meantime Mr. F—recalled Eugene from France, and it ſeemed now a proper time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce him to his mother. In conſequence of this plan, ſo coincident with theirs, and ſo well calculated to facilitate the deſigns of Marcel, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene was accordingly introduced to his mother in the preſence of Mr. F—; who, partial, in the higheſt degree, to the young man, could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but when a mother beheld the offſpring of
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035640_0126_1006941DAE430480"/>
her fondeſt love in the perſon of one of the fineſt figures nature ever formed, and animated by the moſt intereſting countenance that could adorn the human frame, her heart would undergo a change of ſentiment, and a thouſand tender nameleſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations would betray the feelings of a mother. Nor was he quite miſtaken. Lady Oakendale, depraved as ſhe was, could not behold the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating figure and manly beauty of his features, ſoftened to a tenderneſs of expreſſion at being in the preſence of a parent, without emotions to which ſhe had before been a ſtranger; and when he threw himſelf at her feet, with the moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate duty, a tear ſtole down her cheek; and, preſſing him to her boſom, ſhe had no occaſion to have recourſe to diſſimulation to impreſs the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal embrace.</p>
            <p>Her trembling voice could ſcarce articulate a ſentence, and ſhe would have continued holding him to her heart, till the callous texture had been ſoftened to the moſt virtuous ſenſibility, had ſhe not been recalled to recollection by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Marcel; who, obſerving the ſoft ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the ſight of her ſon had inſpired, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded her of the dangerous conſequences that might attend her giving way to them; and lady
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035640_0127_1006942286560A30"/>
Oakendale inſtantly reſumed her compoſure, and ſteadily preſerved her purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. F—ſaw that ſhe had been ſeriouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and the ſight gave him infinite ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he could not entirely rely upon a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter like her's, and happily ſuſpecting that ſhe was, in ſome degree, acting a part, he would not therefore be perſuaded to leave Eugene with her; but promiſing ſhe ſhould ſoon be indulged with another interview, he took him away, and loſt no time in preparing his mind to expect the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of a father alſo, though he did not yet think proper to inform him who he was.</p>
            <p>Lord Vincent was now in Ireland, and Mr. F—impatiently waited his return to England, when he would reſtore him a ſon every way wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the honours of his houſe and name; and from whom he expected Eugene would meet with a more ſincere reception than he had received from his mother. He was at the ſame time particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cautious to conceal Eugene, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the knowledge of lady Oakendale, till the time came when he ſhould be ſafe under the protection of Lord Vincent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:035640_0128_1006942646E51748"/>
The lively diſpoſition of Eugene could but ill brook the reſtraints impoſed upon him by Mr. F—, and could not conceive any danger ſhould ariſe from his going whitherſoever his fancy led him.</p>
            <p>He had one night been at Ranelagh, in order to amuſe his mind, which became oppreſſed in the extreme, on account of never hearing any thing of his beloved Laura. He had written let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after letter, fraught with the tendereſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of regard, and everlaſting conſtancy, all of which were intercepted by Mr. F—, for the reaſons heretofore mentioned.</p>
            <p>The horrid accounts every day received from Paris, filled his mind with the moſt cruel appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; and, although he tried to divert his fears from ſo melancholy a ſubject, by frequently running to places of public reſort; yet he always returned with a double portion of wretchedneſs, as they only recalled back the remembrance of ſimilar ſcenes paſt with his beloved Laura.</p>
            <p>When he returned from Ranelagh the above mentioned evening, he was unhappy more than uſual. He told Mr. F—he had been in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a gentleman who had given him ſo
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035640_0129_10069429EE91B8F0"/>
charming a deſcription of the Lakes in Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Cumberland, that if any thing could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his melancholy, and divert his imagination, it would be a viſit to thoſe celebrated Lakes, and to rambling about that romantic and delightful country. Mr. F—thinking he might in ſuch an excurſion, be more out of the reach and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of lady Oakendale, than he was by ſtaying in London, thought it beſt to make no oppoſition to his requeſt; and Eugene, therefore, obtained leave to make a tour to the nothern part of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, where, he ſaid, he ſhould find ſome young friends, with whom he had formed an intimacy at ſchool. Mr. F—could not refuſe ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a requeſt, and imprudently ſuffered him to depart without any attendant.</p>
            <p>Having promiſed to write very frequently, Eugene took an affectionate leave of Mr. F—, with no other weight upon his mind than that which aroſe from his being ignorant of the fate of Laura.</p>
            <p>After a fortnight had elapſed, and Mr. F—had heard not from Eugene, he began to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed. He took every method in his power to gain intelligence of him, but without effect. His
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035640_0130_1006942D4C29A1D8"/>
mind underwent a tormenting ſuſpenſe, for he really loved him like a ſon; and, although he did not chaſe to inform lady Oakendale whither he was gone; yet ſuch were his ſuſpicions of her, that he cauſed ſuch an application to be made to her as he thought might bring him ſome inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; but all to no purpoſe; ſhe pleaded igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his deſtination and pretended great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern at the circumſtance.</p>
            <p>Mr. F—ſuffered the moſt poignant grief; he accuſed himſelf for allowing him to depart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and on this ſcore he endured many bitter reflections.</p>
            <p>As time wore away, the ſweet hope of preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wiſhed for ſon to a fond father, which ſon juſtified by his merit and accompliſhments, and even exceeded the moſt ſanguine hopes of the moſt partial parent; theſe hopes, and flattering ideas, at length gave place to the bitter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the loſs each had ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>The continual advertiſements he cauſed to be inſerted in the daily papers, beſides hand-bills, and every other inquiry which could lead to a diſcovery, were ineffectually continued for many
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035640_0131_1006942EEE0E8700"/>
months, without bringing him the ſmalleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or clue, to recover his favorite.</p>
            <p>Fatigued with repeated diſappointments and not knowing what further methods to purſue, he waited upon Lord Vincent, the firſt hour he heard he was arrived in England, informing that nobleman that he was a father; but that his mind was torn with perplexity as to the preſent exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of that ſon, on whoſe virtues and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments Mr. F—expatiated with the fond partiality of a parent.</p>
            <p>Lord Vincent felt a glow of parental affection riſe in his boſom, which was every moment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed on the recital of his merits, and ſoon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned an impatient deſire of beholding him.</p>
            <p>When Mr. F—mentioned his recent loſs, Lord Vincent was firmly perſuaded that lady Oakendale was privy to the concealment; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when Mr. F—informed him, that he ſuffered Eugene to go alone; and that he had ſince his departure, diſcovered that he had a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interview with lady Oakendale the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſet out upon his tour, and informed her to what part of England he was going to make his excurſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:035640_0132_10069433CC36DC90"/>
Perſuaded in this opinion, they debated upon the meaſures to be purſued, which would be moſt likely to bring her ladyſhip to make the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They agreed to begin by gentle methods, and treating with her by the moſt friendly and ſecret perſuaſions; and if this failed, to make more decided and arbitrary conditions.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, and during theſe negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Lord Oakendale's mind ſuffered ſo much painful uneaſineſs, as to produce a ſlow fever; he felt a cruel diſappointment at the loſs of Laura, for whom he had conceived the moſt ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and the manner of her diſappearance, together with the dreadful and unaccountable phantoms <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Abbey, had ſo much agitated his imagination, that it was ſometime before he could bring his reaſon to that ſtate of compoſure, which was neceſſary in the projecting a ſcheme he had planned for inveſtigating the horrors which had ſo impoſed upon his underſtanding at the Abbey.</p>
            <p>He had formed and rejected many deſigns for this purpoſe, when lady Oakendale, before he adopted any, was ſeized with a violent illneſs; the conſequence, (as Mr. F—ſuppoſed) of the
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035640_0133_100694359F5B7F10"/>
negociation between her and Lord Vincent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the concealment of Eugene.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale ſeldom gave himſelf much trouble about her, and her indiſpoſitions were as little regarded as herſelf; but this became of a very ſerious nature; and, upon his lordſhip's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſired to attend her ſick bed-chamber, he obeyed the ſummons with unuſual alacrity, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly hoping that he ſhould not only be releaſed from a bondage, from which he had never deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſmalleſt comfort or ſatisfaction; but ſhould yet be honorably bleſſed with the hand of his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Laura, could ſhe ever again be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Elated with theſe hopes, he haſtened to her apartment with no unpleaſing ideas; and, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an artful dejection into his countenance, he was approaching her bed with a tender expreſſion of enquiry; when he ſtarted, and was diverted from his purpoſe by the ſurpriſe of beholding her with Lord Vincent on one ſide of the bed, and Mr. F—on the other, attended by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the law taking notes from her confeſſion.</p>
            <p>The moment ſhe beheld Lord Oakendale ſhe ceaſed ſpeaking. Her eye-lids fell, a ſudden convulſion affected her articulation, and ſhe had
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035640_0134_1006943ADC2E33F0"/>
only time to pronounce, in a trembling voice and diſjointed words, "My—ſon!—Oakendale Abbey!—" when ſhe ſunk down and expired!</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale, much as he had wiſhed for her death, was ſhocked at its ſudden approach; and, not being able to comprehend the ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſtill more aſtoniſhed at her naming a ſon, together with Oakendale Abbey, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of her faithful confidante, Marcel, "who was in the room?</p>
            <p>"Why, Lord Vincent, and the other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, were preſent?</p>
            <p>"And if her lady was in her right ſenſes when ſhe talked of a ſon, and Oakendale Abbey?"</p>
            <p>The confuſion of the ſcene, and the ſudden diſſolution of lady Oakendale, prevented every one preſent from giving an immediate anſwer; and Mr. F—ſeeing Marcel inſtantly about to quit the room, inſtead of anſwering to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory of Lord Oakendale, he eagerly ſeized her arm, and leading her up to his lordſhip, ſaid, "There is much to be explained, my Lord, and I look upon this woman to be able to give the cleareſt account of the myſtery which yet remains
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035640_0135_1006943DEF245C00"/>
unfolded; for this reaſon it ſeems proper to have her ſecured."</p>
            <p>Lord Vincent joined in this propoſition; and, having collected proper aſſiſtance for the ſecurity of Marcel, the reſt of the party left the room of the deceaſed, and were joined by the gentleman of the law, who proceeded to read the minutes he had taken from her ladyſhip's dying confeſſion. They conſiſted of a faithful relation of her being four months advanced in her pregnancy by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Vincent, then an officer in the guards, at the time ſhe was married to Lord Oakendale.</p>
            <p>That finding it impoſſible to impoſe upon his lordſhip, by pretending the child to be his, ſhe confided her ſecret to Marcel; by whoſe contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhe was in five months after her marriage delivered of a ſon, at—in Buckinghamſhire.</p>
            <p>That this was managed the more eaſily, on account of the ill terms upon which ſhe lived with her Lord.</p>
            <p>That Marcel had engaged to ſecrete the child, and keep it at nurſe, which ſhe did, at a very little expence, till the end of five years; when the woman, who had taken the charge of it, told them "that he had been ſtolen from her."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:035640_0136_1006944129F9CDC8"/>
That this circumſtance gave them no great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs till about three years after, when Mr. F—declared himſelf to have been the perſon who had taken the child away, and from that time made large demands upon her for its educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, always threatening her with a diſcovery in caſe of non-compliance.</p>
            <p>That within the laſt two years Mr. F—had inſiſted upon her ſeeing the young man, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted a confeſſion from her of his real father, to which, after great reluctance, ſhe yielded, and conſented to ſee her ſon. She confeſſed, that the interview made her feel herſelf a mother; but the idea of his being introduced into the world as the ſon and heir of Lord Vincent, filled her with perpetual alarm of a diſcovery, and made her ſuppreſs all her tender feelings, and again have recourſe to Marcel, to continue ſome method of ſecuring the preſervation of her fame, before Lord Vincent made a public acknowledgment of him as his ſon. Various methods were ſuggeſted; but none ſeemed proper to adopt, till the idea of travelling alone was artfully contrived to allure him from Mr. F—; and the gentleman, who
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035640_0137_1006944301FB1480"/>
met him at Ranelagh, was by them engaged for the purpoſe of facilitating their deſign; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ordered, that his curioſity ſhould be excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the accounts of Oakendale Abbey, he was there entrapped, and ſecured in a ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of it, where, to the beſt of her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he now remained.</p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of lady Oakendale's confeſſion; and an oath of confirmation was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to her by the gentleman of the law, who was alſo a juſtice of the peace. She found, however, her mind was not relieved by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, unleſs Lord Oakendale was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her guilt, and would pronounce her pardon; and, being ſenſible that the hour was appoaching, when the moſt ample confeſſion would not leſſen her crimes whilſt one particle of diſſimulation remained, ſhe begged to ſee Lord Oakendale, declaring her intention of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging her deception, and imploring his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but the deſign was ſufficient, and we hope accepted; ſhe was, therefore ſpared the confuſion of confeſſing to him, whom ſhe had moſt injured, by the Miniſter of Death, who, on the moment
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:035640_0138_100694481B6D02E8"/>
of Lord Oakendale's approach, prevented her adding more than the above-mentioned words.</p>
            <p>Having recovered their ſurpriſe, and given ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary orders for the interment of her ladyſhip, Lord Oakendale was equally deſirous with Lord Vincent to make the inveſtigation of Oakendale Abbey. He had no doubt but Laura had been entrapped, as well as Eugene; and the impatient deſire he had of making her his wife, increaſed his anxiety, and even poſſeſſed him with the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of jealouſy, leſt Eugene, being in ſimilar circumſtances with herſelf, might be captivated with her charms, and endeavor to make his eſcape with her. Stimulated with ideas of this nature, his mind was kept in a perpetual agitation, and his impatience would ſcarcely allow time for the neceſſary preparations to be made for the journey, and to collect proper perſons for ſo arduous an undertaking.</p>
            <p>Marcel would not, or could not, give them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more information than what has been already related. She declared ſhe had never ſeen Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale Abbey, although ſhe had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Eugene was at this time concealed there; ſhe was however, kept in cloſe cuſtody.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:035640_0139_10069449CFB174C0"/>
Lord Oakendale determined, that if Laura was found, no forms of ceremony ſhould for an hour retard his marriage with her. He conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the confeſſion Lady Oakendale had made of her duplicity and infidelity a ſufficient releaſe from the marriage covenant; and which gave him full liberty to form a ſecond union, long before the uſual time of mourning was expired for the firſt. It was not to be ſuppoſed he ſhould be upon any terms of great cordiality with Lord Vincent; yet, as the preſent caſe made him as intereſted a perſon as himſelf in the projected diſcovery, he allowed himſelf to wave all animoſity for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to confer with Lord Vincent upon the plan of operation neceſſary to be made upon the occaſion.</p>
            <p>At length the arrangements were all adjuſted, and a choſen ſet were appointed to accompany the two Lords, Mr. F—and the lawyer, into Cumberland, in order to diſcover both Eugene and Laura, and to eraſe the Abbey to the ground, if it was neceſſary to facilitate the ſearch.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale was elated with hope, and would allow no ſuggeſtion to intrude that bore the moſt diſtant idea to any circumſtance that was
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:035640_0140_1006944F4C88FC00"/>
not conſonant to his wiſhes. Laura, the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laura, ſhould now be lady Oakendale, and put in immediate poſſeſſion of all his wealth. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had painted her with additional allurements; and her having been ſo long confined in a ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous abode, would render her more alive to freedom, and grateful for his ſplendid offers. With theſe flattering hopes he endeavored to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile the tedious hours that intervened before the time fixed for their departure.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the day before they were to begin their journey, he was indulging in one of the above delightful reveries, when a ſervant opened the door of his library, and informed him that a gentleman wiſhed to ſpeak with him upon buſineſs of importance, which could not be truſted to a meſſenger.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale peeviſhly ordered him to be admitted, at the ſame time determining that no buſineſs whatſoever ſhould occaſion a delay to the projected expedition. Accordingly a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged clergyman was uſhered into the room, and, after the uſual compliments had paſſed, he aſked
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:035640_0141_100694514C0299A8"/>
Lord Oakendale "if he had any relation in the Eaſt-Indies?"</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale replied, "Yes, he had once a brother, whom, he believed, was ſlain in battle in the Eaſt-Indies."</p>
            <p>The gentleman whoſe name was Martin, then proceeded to inform his lordſhip, "that a few weeks ſince he was called upon to attend one of his dying pariſhioners, whoſe conſcience ſeemed to labor under ſome very heavy oppreſſion; and who ſaid he had been on board a ſhip coming to England from the Eaſt-Indies, when ſhe was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by a French privateer. That there were ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral paſſengers on board, amongſt whom was a little girl, who had a ſmall bag of quilted ſatin tied round her neck, which ſhe always held with great care, and conſequently he ſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſomething valuable. Indeed, he heard one of the women on board ſay that it did, and caution the child not to part with it. That he had frequently meditated to get it from her, but never had an opportunity till the day they were taken to the priſon in Paris; when, ſeeing one of the French ſoldiers tearing it from the neck of the child, he perſuaded him that it was only a charm
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:035640_0142_10069456D982FD98"/>
againſt infection; and, by making ſome trifling exchange, ſecured the bag for his own. Upon opening it, he found it contained ſome jewels of value, carefully concealed, by being quilted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſatin. There was likewiſe a miniature picture of an officer, and a written paper, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying who the child was. The picture and the paper he preſerved; but the jewels he ſold, and found the money amounted to ſome hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>The picture and the paper he always wiſhed to have reſtored to their right owners, and, upon the exchange of priſoners, he made ſome enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the relations of the child; but, finding they were perſons of conſequence, he was afraid to make any application to them, left it might lead to a diſcovery of the theft. The time he ſaid was now come, when he would give worlds never to have had them in his poſſeſſion; nor could he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect one ſingle ſatisfaction or pleaſure that the money for which the jewels ſold had given him; that he ſincerely repented having wronged the child; that he begged I would pray to God to forgive him; and all the reſtitution he could now make, was to place the picture and the paper in my hands, beſeeching me, if poſſible, to find out
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035640_0143_10069458791553B8"/>
the child, or its relations, and to reſtore what yet remained of their property. He added, that he had lately met with a woman who had been taken priſoner with the child, and who ſaid it had been put on board, and intruſted to her care by a female negro, who had lived with its parents; and that the child was carried from the priſon by a ſurgeon, of the name of du Frene, who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Mr. Martin having finiſhed his relation, Lord Oakendale tremblingly opened the paper. The firſt thing that ſtruck his ſight was the picture of his brother; that brother upon whom he had beſtowed ſo little care or anxiety, and whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act reſemblance, now before his eyes, recalled to his recollection his many virtues, and filled his heart with remorſe and regret that he had ſo cruelly neglected them, and paid ſo little regard to his memory. Having paid this late tribute of affection, he proceeded to open the paper, which contained the following lines, written in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's own hand:</p>

               <pb n="145" facs="unknown:035640_0144_1006945DCE5E6FB0"/>
"This paper, picture and jewels, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Laura Carleton."</p>
            <p>No ſooner had Lord Oakendale read this paper than the colour forſook his cheeks; his eyes gliſtened, and he held the paper in his trembling hand, while he preſerved a profound ſilence. A flaſh of conviction ruſhed upon his mind that Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra might be, and was in all probability his own niece; that Laura, whom he was upon the point of making his wife. He heſitated for a few ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds in the faint hope that ſome miſtake might prove the matter to be different; but the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were too ſtrong to admit of any doubt; and however he might wiſh to diſbelieve the facts, an impulſe of a different nature from what he had hitherto experienced, made him ſhudder for his own crimes, at the ſame time that he felt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common intereſt in the fate of Laura.</p>
            <p>He again looked at his brother's picture: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he examined the hand writing: it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly his brother's, for it was a remarkable hard; and again it recalled to his remembrance the thouſand virtues which had marked his character, and the little value that had been placed upon
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035640_0145_1006945F8C495AF0"/>
them by thoſe who ſtood in the neareſt relation to him. Should Laura really be his neice, and the only ſurviving branch of the houſe of Oakendale, with what pleaſure ſhould he allow her the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that fortune, to which ſhe derived as much claim from her virtues, as from heriditary right!</p>
            <p>Such are the ties of nature, that his pride ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulted in calling that woman niece, whom he had a ſhort time before deſigned and ſolicited for proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution.—During the time theſe reflections were paſſing in his mind, he ſat muſing without uttering a word: but at laſt recollecting Mr. Martin, he thanked him with unfeigned ſincerity, and told him he had every reaſon to believe that he had ſeen the perſon, who exactly anſwered the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the child, and whom he had no doubt was his neice.</p>
            <p>He then proceeded to thank Mr. Martin for the trouble he had taken to convey the inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to him: and, without telling him by what means ſhe came there, he added, that he verily believed ſhe was at this time concealed in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior part of an old Abbey belonging to himſelf in Cumberland. That the next morning had

been fixed for their journey there, to make an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry which the preſent information he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived would greatly accellerate.</p>
            <p>Mr. Martin congratulated Lord Oakendale on the proſpect of finding his niece; and here it may not ſeem improper to give our readers a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of Laura's father, in order more clearly to elucidate the identity of her birth.</p>
            <p>We have already mentioned that Captain Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Carleton embarked with his regiment for the Eaſt Indies.</p>
            <p>After being driven by contrary winds, they found themſelves chaſed by an Algerine Corſair.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of the Engliſh determined to ſtand an engagement, in which they were victorious, and very ſoon boarded the Corſair. On her way to Sallee, to pay the ranſom of her brother, who was a captive, there was a Greek Lady, of illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious birth, and exquiſite beauty, and with her four female attendants, who were taken priſoners. The gallantry of the Engliſh officer was exerted in acts of attention and conſolation to the fair Greeks, who, together with the riches of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:035640_0147_1006946686B64EB8"/>
made it a prize worthy the bravery of their nation.</p>
            <p>The beauty of the chief captive whoſe name was Zempronia, was the ſubject of univerſal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: and the captain of the veſſel appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to her his cabin, and gave her every accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation that could render her ſituation ſuch as to make her forget ſhe was his priſoner: yet nothing could leſſen or ſooth her affliction: ſhe wept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, and every effort of attention was only anſwered by the moſt heart-rending ſighs and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations: one of her attendants, about the age of ſixteen, appeared the leaſt unhappy. Her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching ſmiles, and captivating graces, faſcinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart of William Carleton; a ſlight wound he had received in the engagement ſeemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite all her pity, and ſeveral tender glances had betrayed a reciprocal paſſion.</p>
            <p>If the elegant perſon and accompliſhments of William had attracted the admiration of Zelima, he was no leſs enamoured of the fair Greek. She learned his language with facility; but in that of love ſhe was ſtill a greater proficient: and, by the time they arrived at the port of Grand Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where they were to releaſe the lady and her
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:035640_0148_1006946983ABBA50"/>
attendants, Zelima's heart was not leſs wounded than her lover's at the cruel idea of ſeparation. She was charmed with all that he poſſeſſed. Her religion, her country, and her laws, were all ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificed to the powerful paſſion of love; and an Engliſh prieſt, then reſiding at that port, tied the indiſſoluble knot.</p>
            <p>She took leave of her miſtreſs Zempronia with regret, but not with reluctance; all her duty, love and obedience, were alone due to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and ſhe attended her beloved William to the Eaſt, where her tender affection, and unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting attention, rendered him the happieſt of men.</p>
            <p>He wrote to Lord Oakendale an account of his marriage with the fair Grecian, and anticipated the pleaſure he ſhould derive from preſenting this lovely creature to his brother and ſiſter, when the concluſion of war ſhould allow him to return to England; but Lord Oakendale made his marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſervant a pretence for never anſwering any of his letters; and three years after, when the Honorable William Carleton's name appeared in the liſt of thoſe that were killed in battle, Lord Oakendale's heart only palpitated with a ſecret
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035640_0149_1006946D5ED53428"/>
joy, that the many virtues, and univerſal good character of his brother, would no longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid, and be a reſtraint upon his own vices He put on the exterior of mourning; but he made no ſort of inquiry after the widow of William Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or wiſhed to hear that he had left an inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to his many virtues.</p>
            <p>Thus were the ties of blood diſſolved, and a deſerted orphan left to ſeek that protection from ſtrangers which ſhe had a right to claim from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſo near to her. William Carleton had been a bad economiſt; he had a ſmall younger brother's fortune, and his generous heart was too compaſſionate, and too liberal, to his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to allow him to be affluent. He was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, too much engaged with his preſent felicity to make proviſion for future misfortune, and he was killed by a random ſhot in the moment of victory!</p>
            <p>The fatal wound which deprived him of life was rendered ſtill more poignant by the reflection of leaving Zelima but ill-provided for. She, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, did not experience the want of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for no ſooner were the fatal tidings brought her of William's death, than her heart ſickened,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035640_0150_1006946F0CDE8E40"/>
and ſhe only ſurvived to caſt a mournful look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mangled corpſe of her huſband, gave a convulſive ſhriek, and expired, leaving a female, infant "unpitied, and forlorn!"</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale threw off all remembrance of his brother with his mourning, and from that time never thought more of the connexion. He followed his pleaſures with unremitting avidity, till after the courſe of a few years, when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution began to warn him by frequent intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the career, in which he was ſo deeply engaged, would ſome day be interrupted.</p>
            <p>In theſe moments of admonition he wiſhed for he knew not what comforts and reſources; real friends he had none. The tender endearments of a family he had never known, and his heart felt an aching void for thoſe dear attentions and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudes, which can only be experienced from the tendereſt ties.</p>
            <p>In theſe irkſome hours, the death of lady Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale was his ultimate wiſh, and opened to his fancy an inviting path, when he might be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to marry ſome beautiful young creature, without fortune, whoſe gratitude would ſecure to him her affections, and whoſe youth and health
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:035640_0151_10069473EBAB36E8"/>
would inſure heirs to his poſſeſſions. But at the time theſe wiſhes were formed his hopes were vain; for lady Oakendale was then by no means likely to give him ſuch a chance. Her health was her firſt care, and, to an excellent conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe added the moſt ſtudious attention to its preſervation, living by rule, and ſtudying the whole vocabulary of wholeſomes. Neither did her preſent conduct afford him any other hope of breaking the marriage fetters; for amidſt the few virtues ſhe did poſſeſs, ſhe adhered ſtrictly to that of chaſtity, allowing no kind of mercy to thoſe who had been only ſuſpected to have violated the marriage vow.</p>
            <p>Such were Lord and lady Oakendale; when the former, finding his life every day more unhappy, and viewing the infirmities of old age at no great diſtance from him, he endeavored to beguile the tedious length of the ſummer-days, by viſiting different water places, which were ſituated in the moſt unfrequented and obſcure parts of England, where he went by another name, in order to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his favorite propenſities; ſo that, when he returned to London, and again aſſumed his name and character as a ſenator, he might condemn thoſe vices he had not only been practiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035640_0152_10069477AF4B50A8"/>
but ſeducing the innocent and unwary to fall into.</p>
            <p>It was during the laſt ſummer that he had made an excurſion to an interior part of South Wales; from whence his fancy led him to Milford-Haven, where, as he was one evening ſtrolling near the ſea, he accidentally met with Laura, the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon charms of whoſe perſon attracted his notice, and he ſoon formed a plan of becoming acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her, which ſucceeding, he in a ſhort time, found himſelf violently attached.</p>
            <p>Her beauty was the leaſt of her merit, and a certain refinement and delicacy which pervaded her whole manner, checked the licentious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes which the charms of her perſon occaſioned, and he found it neceſſary to be more upon his guard, and to act with more circumſpection in the preſent caſe, than any he had ever before encountered.</p>
            <p>Her ſenſible converſation, the obſervations ſhe had made upon the world, as far as ſhe had ſeen it, would have made her an entertaining compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, had no other charms captivated his ſenſes; but, alluring as ſhe was both in mind and perſon, he found it impoſſible to reſiſt ſo engaging an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035640_0153_1006947AFA8F8038"/>
he therefore diſcovered as much as he could of her ſtory, and found her chief misfortune, and which ſhe moſt lamented, was the loſs of a lady who had brought her up, and from whom ſhe was divided in her paſſage from France.</p>
            <p>Having gathered thus much from her own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he concluded ſhe was the natural daughter of Monſieur du Frene, who had preſented her to his wife as a foundling; that Monſieur was dead, and in all probability ſhe would never again ſee Madame.</p>
            <p>From theſe circumſtances he conſidered her as a lawful prize for him, and would have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately offered her a ſettlement as a miſtreſs, had not a certain dignity, and modeſt ſuperiority in her manner, awed his freedom, and prevented his making ſuch a propoſal. He was, however, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to loſe her, and therefore formed the plan of enticing her to London, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of placing her with a ſiſter till ſhe ſhould diſcover Madame du Frene.</p>
            <p>His inſinuating manners and addreſs ſoon gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the unſuſpicious heart of Laura; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him as old enough to be her father; but for that reaſon he was ſtill better calculated to
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035640_0154_10068EFD49F4FEF8"/>
be her friend, and ſhe was charmed with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of placing her with his ſiſter. She felt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration and eſteem for Mr. Thoranby (the name he had aſſumed) and it was not till ſhe arrived in London that ſhe diſcovered the whole of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which, when he endeavored to palliate and excuſe by pleading the moſt ardent love, ſhe ſolemnly vowed to ſacrifice her life to her honor; and, as we have before obſerved, he ſent her to Oakendale Abbey, in hopes that the ſolitude of the place would induce her to lend a more favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ear to his wiſhes.</p>
            <p>How did the retroſpection of this part of his conduct now fill the mind of Lord Oakendale with corroding thoughts! A ray of gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of all events, who had not permitted him to commit a crime at which his ſoul ſhuddered, diffuſed over him ſenſations to which he had hitherto been a ſtranger. He made an ample confeſſion to Mr. Martin of all his conduct, and lamented his errors in ſuch terms of contrition and penitence, that Mr. Martin gave him all poſſible conſolation, and readily joined the party, who were waiting to make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſearch at Oakendale Abbey; to which
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035640_0155_10069482B3572488"/>
place their journey was completed as expeditiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as poſſible.</p>
            <p>On their arrival at Oakendale, every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſtate they had left it; and no veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ige of any human being appeared to have trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſed its gloomy apartments. They proceeded to the room which had, on more occaſions than one, cauſed ſo much terror, being now a very ſtrong party, properly armed, and every way deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to inveſtigate the myſtery.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale himſelf led the way. The virtuous principle upon which he now ſearched for Laura, actuated his mind with a manly reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and he felt none of thoſe perturbed trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings which had aſſailed his heart on a former occaſion.</p>
            <p>In one hand he firmly graſped a piſtol, in the other a ſhort ſword; and having excited his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants boldly to follow his example, whatever they might encounter, he proceeded into the cloiſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="unknown:035640_0156_10069486ABA87F98"/>
All was ſtill and ſilent, and by force they made their way into the room which terminated it. It was totally dark, and they were obliged to light their candles before they could even diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh each other!</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were aſſiſted by the lights, they perceived that the windows, through which very little light could have been admitted, were entirely ſtopped up, and this ſeemed to have been done very lately.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale was convinced it was the very ſame apartment he had been in before; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing now bore a different aſpect! nothing appeared in the room but a large table, and ſome looſe boards. There were evident marks of blood upon many parts of the floor, and in one corner lay a human ſcull! Lord Oakendale ſhuddered! The idea of Laura and murder trembled in his heart; at the ſame time that it renewed his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and animated his purſuit. "We will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed," ſaid he, "and inveſtigate this accurſed myſtery, or die in the attempt."</p>
            <p>"The ſcull cannot be Laura's" ſaid Mr. F—;"it could not have been in this ſtate from the time
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035640_0157_100694884E30D3E8"/>
ſhe has been miſſing;" yet it might be Eugene's, and the thought reſted upon his imagination with a ſickening horror!</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale, having ſearched every part of the room to no purpoſe, ordered the floor to be taken up; when, as the men were beginning to execute his orders, they diſcovered a trap-door, which was inſtantly opened, and they deſcended down ſeveral winding ſteps into a huge vault, which ſeemed to extend under the church. They lighted more candles, and left no part unſearched. No object preſented itſelf; but they picked up bones and ſculls in various parts of the vault.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale fired his piſtol; nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned but the vibration of its ſound; after which a perfect ſtillneſs was obſerved, and a deep hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low groan arreſted the ears of every one preſent. They turned to the left, from whence the ſound of the groan proceeded, and perceiving a hollow arch, they advanced towards it; but could only be admitted ſingly, as the ſides were too cloſe, and the roof too low to ſtand upright in.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale ſtill led the way, and the reſt followed. He had again charged his piſtol, and
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035640_0158_1006948DB62081A0"/>
he carried his ſword and a candle in the other hand.</p>
            <p>Having advanced ſeveral paces, ſomething was thrown in his eyes by an inviſible hand, and for a moment he was in total darkneſs! He again fired his piſtol; and as ſoon as the ſound ceaſed, a faint voice exclaimed, "O God, my deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is at hand!" The reſt of the lights came up, and diſcovered a hedious figure of a man, with an uplifted bar of iron in his hand ready to ſtrike a fatal blow on the firſt perſon who advanced. He was inſtantly ſeized, and made to deliver the keys of a grate which opened to a very ſmall room.</p>
            <p>Having ſecured the man, and entered the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in one corner of it appeared an emaciated figure, altered indeed; but in whoſe thin and pallid countenance Mr. F—inſtantly recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the features of his dear Eugene! He flew to embrace and to preſent him to Lord Vincent; whilſt Lord Oakendale felt himſelf diſappointed, and involuntarily exclaimed, "Where is my Laura!"</p>
            <p>At the name of Laura, Eugene, whom the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and the joy of the ſcene had till then rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:035640_0159_100694FAC8BB4290"/>
ſpeechleſs, replied, "Laura! What Laura! Can ſhe be in this place of horror?"</p>
            <p>"This is no time for explanation," ſaid Mr. F—; "let us return to the leſs gloomy parts of the Abbey; and as the man, who guarded this infernal dungeon, is ſecured we may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly force him to a confeſſion of what we ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſh to know; in the mean time let us, my dear boy, give you all the aſſiſtance in our power; and revive you by ſome immediate refreſhment."</p>
            <p>Eugene, altered and oppreſſed by the cruel confinement he had ſo long ſuffered appeared ſcarcely the ſame; yet ſtill a ſmile of grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to thoſe who had ſo unexpectedly procured his enlargement, prejudiced them all in his favor; and the proſpect of liberty, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the joy of beholding the faces of thoſe whom he knew to be his friends, animated his eyes, and gave a glow to his pale cheeks.</p>
            <p>Lord Vincent preſſed him to his boſom, and acknowledged him for his ſon; and, although his whole appearance bore teſtimony to his wretched condition, yet an open countenance, and manly deportment, diſtinguiſhed the graces of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his ſentiments, ſuch as he was able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035640_0160_10068F20D7B6D4D0"/>
did credit to, and confirmed the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which the good Mr. F—had beſtowed on him.</p>
            <p>Being returned to the other apartments, Lord Oakendale aſked Eugene, in a melancholy tone of voice, if he had, during his confinement, ever ſeen or heard of a young lady in the Abbey?"</p>
            <p>Eugene replied "that he had not." He ſaid, "on the day he had gained the keys of the Abbey, he thought to amuſe himſelf with obſerving the ſtructure of the rooms, without ſuppoſing that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny human beings, beſides himſelf were within<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of it. The inhabitants of Oakendale, and particularly the man from whom he had the keys, had told him of ghoſts and ſpectres;—but this made him only the more eager to reconnoitre the place; and not being the leaſt apprehenſive of any ſupernatural cauſes, he fearleſſly walked about the rooms, in which he ſaw nothing either to engage his attention, or excite his fears; till at laſt coming into one of the rooms on the firſt floor, he was attracted by a portrait, not in very good preſervation, but whoſe features and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance bore ſo ſtriking a reſemblance to Laura,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:035640_0161_10068F24417AE800"/>
that he was fixed to the ſpot, and ſtood gazing at it with ſurpriſe and admiration.</p>
            <p>"He had juſt taken from his pocket a ſmall letter-caſe, in which was a little ſketch he had himſelf attempted upon vellum, of the ſweeteſt features in the world; and was examining and comparing the likeneſs, when he heard footſteps, and inſtantly found himſelf pinioned down and ſecured. All reſiſtance was in vain, and he was hurried down to the grated room in the vault from whence they had now ſo happily releaſed him; and where he was only ſupplied with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſaries, debarred of light, and every ſocial comfort.</p>
            <p>"He had" he ſaid, "during his confinement, ſeen many different faces in the perſons who guarded him, and brought his proviſions, and each were uniformly ſilent to the queſtions he conſtantly put, in order to gain information of the place he was in, and their deſigns. Once he had attempted to eſcape, but was only more cloſely guarded afterwards. He had heard ſtrange noiſes, and had reaſon to believe that ſome ſecret practices were carried on in the Abbey; but of what nature he could not give the moſt diſtant
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035640_0162_10068F2762CF6080"/>
gueſs. His ſpirits had ſunk to a degree of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs paſt all deſcription at the idea of never gaining his liberty, and his mind had given way to the moſt cruel deſpair, when he was rouſed only to a kind of callous indifference upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the firſt piſtol; but when he heard the ſecond fired, and ſaw through the grate that the guard was agitated, and gathered up the duſt to throw at ſome object which appeared with a light, he felt a ray of comfort to which he had long been a ſtranger, and which he had ſo joyfully experienced by his enlargement."</p>
            <p>The next ſtep was to interrogate the guard, who, after an obſtinate ſilence, ſaid, "That he was hired for the purpoſe of guarding the grate, and was relieved in the office by another, who was ſomewhere about the Abbey." But, after many promiſes and threatnings of future rewards and puniſhments, and, after having abſolutely diſclaimed the knowledge of any other perſon being confined in the Abbey, he confeſſed, "he had been hired by a ſet of people, whoſe buſineſs it was to ſteal dead bodies, and bring them to the Abbey for defection; that there was a private door from the church-yard into the cloiſter, where they uſed to be brought and depoſited in the room
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:035640_0163_10068F2A6C927238"/>
which they had partitioned off for the purpoſe, and which has before been deſcribed; that the bo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es were afterwards thrown into the vault from the trap door; that this had been a practice for many years; and, by having the range of the Abbey, they had taken care to preſerve it for themſelves by taking methods to frighten, and effectually keep away every gueſt that made any attempt to inhabit it." He added, moreover, "that they frequently procured bodies that were hanged at, or near Carliſle; and that a man, who was hanged for murder in the neighborhood, and whoſe body was brought there, and haſtily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in an obſcure room, had as was ſuppoſed, returned to life, and made his eſcape; for on two men going at midnight to fetch him upon a board to the diſſecting room, they found him gone, and in his place a young lady, who had ſunk into a fit with terror upon their approach, and whom he believed they conveyed to a hut in the village. That ſome daring adventurers had lately broke in upon them; but their appearance had, as he ſuppoſed, terrified them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in their attempts; but, from the time, of the young man's being a priſoner there, and their
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035640_0164_10068F2DC89AE180"/>
having been pretty much alarmed, they had thought it moſt prudent to take away their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements till the young man was either removed or releaſed. That he did not believe any perſon had ever been murdered there, though many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had been brought from places both near and diſtant, and many ſkeletons had been depoſited in different parts of the Abbey, as well to alarm thoſe who might ſee them, as to preſerve them; and whenever any perſon came to ſtay there, they took care to whiſper in the paſſages, and make other noiſes, to prevent their remaining in the Abbey. That he remembered hearing one of the gentlemen, he called his maſter, ſay he alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lady, by coming through a trap-door into a gallery where ſhe was walking by moon-light, though he believed ſhe only ſaw his ſhadow."</p>
            <p>Thus was this great myſtery at once explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ghoſts of Oakendale Abbey were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the dead; but brought thither by thoſe unfeeling monſters of ſociety, who make a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſtealing our friends, and relations from the peaceful grave where their aſhes, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are depoſited in reſt!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="unknown:035640_0165_10068F313B28CA68"/>
The next enquiry to be made, was that of knowing by whoſe orders Eugene was entrapped in the Abbey; but of this the preſent informer could give no intelligence.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale queſtioned him very cloſely concerning the lady whom the men had convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the hut in ſo alarming a ſtate; but this man could give no further account of her than he had already mentioned; and all that could be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered was, that the time, in which he ſaid it happened, correſponded exactly with that in which Laura was miſſing from the Abbey.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale was unhappy. The thoughts of Laura, and what might be her fate, engroſſed all his attention; nor was Eugene leſs anxious on the ſame ſcore. The idea of her being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Abbey with himſelf, filled his mind with a romantic extravagance of fancy, that they muſt be deſtined for each other.</p>
            <p>The wild ſallies of his imagination, or the more ſerious and penſive ſentiments, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a mind formed for every noble purpoſe, charmed Lord Vincent; whilſt Lord Oakendale viewed him with a kind of ſullen hauteur, which
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035640_0166_10068F3532B965B8"/>
might be well accounted for by the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his birth; yet, when Eugene conſidered him as the uncle of his Laura, a thouſand att n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive aſſiduities were offered to his ſervices; and it was with difficulty Lord Vincent could prevail upon him to accompany him back to London, in order to be introduced as his ſon and heir. His heart dwelt upon the diſcovery of Laura and he would have given worlds to have been deputed the chief employer in ſuch an inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>Duty to his father at length prevailed, and he reluctantly bid adieu to Lord Oakendale, who was determined to ſtay in the neighborhood of Oakendale, being perſuaded that Laura was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where concealed in its vicinity; and he offered large rewards to any perſon who ſhould bring him intelligence of her abode.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe ſet on foot a proſecution, and an order to apprehend, or cauſe to be apprehended, thoſe wretches who had, for ſo many years, been the terror of Oakendale, and by their diabolical practices made the Abbey be conſidered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for evil ſpirits. But all his exertions on this ſcore proved fruitleſs; the perpetrators of
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035640_0167_10068F9C868547F0"/>
theſe acts taking care to ſecure themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Meantime Laura enjoyed, with Mrs. Greville, all the comforts, as well as elegancies, for which ſhe ſeemed by nature calculated.</p>
            <p>The amuſements, which filled up her time, ſerved, in ſome degree, to drive from her mind thoſe gloomy ideas, which, when indulged by indolent muſings, never fail to diveſt the mind of its proper energy, and to caſt a ſhade of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly diſcontent upon every object. Her fancy, indeed, would ſometimes wander back to paſt ſcenes, and recollection would exhibit the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hours when, with her dear Eugene, ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed whole days, delighted and beloved, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the evil that awaited her, and of thoſe many dark hours which had ſucceeded them; that Eugene ſhould never have made any inquiry, or ſent one letter to her before ſhe left France, was what ſhe could not place to any account but that of her evil deſtiny; it was ſtrange and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet ſhe was ſure his heart was faithful, and ſome untoward accident had been the cauſe why two hearts, ſo firmly united, and formed for each
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035640_0168_10068F9F747AA588"/>
other, were now ſo totally divided and torn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</p>
            <p>Theſe were ſad reflections, and ſhe indulged them as little as poſſible.</p>
            <p>As the ſpring advanced, Mrs. Greville ſhewed her many beautiful parts of the country, and they were viſited by the diſtant neighbors. Sir George and lady Orland were expected; and Laura, though ſhe knew not why, felt a cheering hope as the time approached. At length the evening arrived, which brought Sir George and his lady to the Grove. Mrs. Greville preſented Laura to them as a very valuable acquiſition, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had beſtowed upon her ſince ſhe laſt ſaw them.</p>
            <p>After the uſual ſalutations and compliments, lady Orland ſtept back, and led in a lady, ſaying, "I have likewiſe an acquiſition to introduce to you;" when Laura, turning her eyes to the lady as ſhe advanced, they were faſcinated with the ſight of her dear and ever-valued Madame du Frene. The joy was mutual, and they ruſhed into each others arms with unfeigned tranſports of delight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="unknown:035640_0169_1006948FACE92970"/>
Lady Orland had received Madame Du Frene into the houſe in the capacity of a governeſs to her only daughter; and ſhe had diſcovered ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amiable traits in her character, and her whole conduct and deportment had been ſo uniformly calculated for the truſt repoſed in her, that lady Orland never wiſhed to conſider her in any light, but that of a polite and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed viſitor; and had given her ſo many proofs of her friendſhip and regard, as gave her every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to forget ſhe was an emigrant. Madame Du Frene had frequently mentioned and lamented the fate of her beloved Laura, and her joy was now completed in finding her under the protection of the worthy Mrs. Greville.</p>
            <p>After having related to each other their various adventures ſince the time of their ſeparation, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame du Frene told Laura, that in one of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, whom chance had thrown in her way to London, ſhe had met with the woman, to whoſe care Laura was intruſted, in her voyage from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia; that ſhe was now ſervant at a hotel in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, was ready to give any teſtimony concerning her charge as far as ſhe knew; but ſhe was in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expectation of a brother from the Eaſt-Indies,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035640_0170_10069493316441B0"/>
who would bring a more particular account of the name and parents of Laura, as ſhe had ſent him word of her having been taken priſoner, and ſtripped of every thing that could direct her to find her relations.</p>
            <p>Laura's heart glowed with gratitude to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for having ſo miraculouſly preſerved her, and raiſed her up friends in a country, where as yet ſhe had no knowledge of ſuch a claim; and ſhe doubted not but the diſpenſations of his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power would enable her to find ſome being to whom ſhe could prove her kindred, and pay that filial duty with which her heart overflowed.</p>
            <p>Thus was Laura ſituated during the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that had been paſſing at Oakendale Abbey.</p>
            <p>The ſociety at Mrs. Greville's wanted not any addition. If the idea of Eugene ſometimes croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the fancy of Laura with a painful ſenſation, ſhe ſuppreſſed even the ſigh which the memory of paſt ſcenes, and the conviction that they would not return, would occaſion; for ſhe knew that the happineſs of this world muſt admit of much alloy, and her preſent ſituation was ſuch, that ſhe had no other cauſe for regret.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="unknown:035640_0171_1006949682B39EB0"/>
Meantime Lord Oakendale was indefatigable in his endeavors to recover his niece, and had at laſt received the pleaſing intelligence that ſhe was at Mrs. Greville's. He loſt not a moment to go there, charmed with the knowledge that ſhe was under ſuch a reſpectable protection.</p>
            <p>It was after one ſultry day that Laura, with the reſt of Mrs. Greville's family, were ſitting near the point of a rock, contemplating the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect which commanded the view of a beautiful lake. She was reflecting upon her happy ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and only indulging one fearful and diſtant wiſh for a certain object ever dear to her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, when a ſervant, addreſſing Mrs. Greville, announced Lord Oakendale.</p>
            <p>Laura ſtarted, and ſcreaming, ſaid, "Ah! hide me, hide me, from that wicked man!"</p>
            <p>"Fear nothing, my love," ſaid Mrs. Greville; "you have friends here ſufficient to protect you, and Sir George will wait upon his lordſhip to know his buſineſs."</p>
            <p>Sir George inſtantly aroſe to obey his aunt, and promiſed Laura that ſhe ſhould never be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from them whilſt he had an arm to defend her. He inſtantly left them, and Laura kept clinging
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:035640_0172_1006949A8962DCD0"/>
to Madame du Frene when they perceived Lord Oakendale and Sir George advancing towards them.</p>
            <p>Laura trembled, but was determined to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon up courage to ſupport and exert herſelf, when Lord Oakendale flew to embrace her with the appellation of "my deareſt niece."</p>
            <p>Laura ſtood amazed, and fancied that her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of hearing deceived her, or that Lord Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale was practiſing ſome new deception; but when he ſtood for a moment in ſilent admiration, and ſhe ſaw the tears roll down his manly cheeks, a ſympathetic tear relieved her boſom, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret impulſe chaced away her fears. Lord Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale, in a few words, explained the myſtery; and ſhe had the inexpreſſible felicity of embracing an uncle.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale preſſed her to his boſom with parental fondneſs; and drawing from thence a miniature, ſuſpended by a ribband, he held it to Laura, ſaying, "Behold your father's juſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in this picture, which was torn from thy infant neck by ruffians; yet preſented by thy penitent uncle."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="unknown:035640_0173_1006949E574759C0"/>
Laura received it with joy, and ſhe knelt to her uncle with filial love and obedience. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was every where diffuſed around, and her heart glowed with laudable pride when Lord Oakendale thanked Mrs. Greville for her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded kindneſs to his niece, Laura Carleton, for ſuch he had no doubt ſhe was; he therefore paſſed a few days at Mrs. Greville's, in joys to which he had hitherto been a ſtranger; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was now near fifty years of age, he had ever been debarred from the felicity of domeſtic ſociety. He found Laura (when ſhe was diveſted of fear and embarraſſment) a charming companion. When ſhe related her hiſtory and ſufferings, he could not ſufficiently admire her ſtrength of mind, her reſolution, and above all, her reſignation. In ſhort, he perfectly doted on her; and loſt no time in ſending for the teſtimony of the woman's brother, who had brought her over, and of whom Madame du Frene had ſpoken. The man was lately arrived, and brought with him a duplicate of the paper Mr. Martin had before delivered to Lord Oakendale, written in his brother's own hand.</p>
            <p>Madame du Frene was ready to affirm, that Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra was the identical child her huſband had brought from the French priſon; but, beſides all this teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035640_0174_1006949FFA15ACB8"/>
Laura's own remembrance and account furniſhed the ſtrongeſt proof. The confirmation was beyond a doubt; and if there had been any remaining teſtimony wanting from coincidence of circumſtances, the uncommon likeneſs ſhe bore not only to her father, but to the picture of her grandmother, which had ſo attracted poor Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene in Oakendale Abbey, was proof ſufficient; and the fondneſs which Lord Oakendale felt for the only offſpring of his family, wanted no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating teſtimony that their blood flowed from the ſame ſource. Indeed when he looked back upon the ſtrange events which had brought them together, and made known their affinity, he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the hand of heaven which had ſo miraculouſly ſaved him from one of the worſt of crimes. And as he gazed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unſpeakable fondneſs, on the fair form of his lovely niece, he conſidered her as a rich bleſſing ſent to comfort the remainder of his days here; and by working a reformation in his conduct, to give him hopes for thoſe of hereafter.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale teſtified his moſt grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements to Madame du Frene for her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal care of Laura, and to whoſe good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he placed the uncommon merit ſhe poſſeſſed. When he gave a recital of the ſearch which he
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035640_0175_100694A52B840F78"/>
had made to inveſtigate the myſtery of Oakendale Abbey, he engaged the fixed attention of his auditors; but when he came to give the account of finding Eugene, and of his long confinement in the dreary vault, the deſcription he gave of his perſon and manners, convinced Laura that it could be no other than her dear Eugene; the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of whoſe cruel impriſonment and ſufferings, ſoftened her heart with the tendereſt pity, and rendered him ſtill more dear.</p>
            <p>When Lord Oakendale mentioned the poor emaciated figure in the grated room, whom Mr. F—called Eugene, Laura aroſe with great emotion, and expreſſed a trembling impatience for the concluſion of a fate in which ſhe was ſo nearly intereſted. Lord Oakendale took but little notice of her perturbation; he would not allow his heart for a moment to admit the idea of an union with Eugene. Whatever might be his merits, a ſomething, relating, no doubt, to his birth, made his mind recoil at the bare ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet Laura, with all her happineſs, and all her titles, was but a wretch, if divided from that her fondeſt hope; but ſhe was now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a new ſcene.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="unknown:035640_0176_100694A6EDE33910"/>
Lord Oakendale and his niece, having grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expreſſed their thanks to Mrs. Greville and all her family, for their hoſpitality and kindneſs, took their leave of the grove, and ſet out for London, where Lord Oakendale welcomed Laura as miſtreſs of his houſe, and ſole heireſs to the fortunes of Oakendale. She was viſited by a numerous train of company; ſome, who had heard her ſtory, from real regard and friendſhip; others, from curioſity, and a deſire of finding ſome flaw in a character ſo conſpicuouſly ſuperior! But her faſcinating manners gained her univerſal admiration. She ſhone in the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant circles, in which her eyes continually wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in purſuit of an object dearer to her than all the world.</p>
            <p>It happened one evening, at an aſſembly, to which ſhe went unaccompanied by Lord Oaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, that ſhe heard Lord Vincent announced. Her heart fluttered at the ſound, and, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after ſhe beheld her loved Eugene.</p>
            <p>He did not immediately perceive her; but the moment his eyes encountered that fair form, which his heart had ever adored, he waited not for the ceremony of a formal introduction. He
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:035640_0177_100694AC4D9D32F0"/>
made his way to her; he ſeized her hand, and for a few moments they forgot that the eyes of a whole aſſembly were rivetted upon them.</p>
            <p>Laura was covered with bluſhes; and ſome of thoſe malignant ſpirits (who, envious of her charms, and the ſplendor in which ſhe ſhone, were continually upon the watch to lower her merit) inſtantly took the hint, and a burſt of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured whiſpers aſſailed her ear. A lady, who was her chaperon, relieved her embarraſſment, by making room for Eugene to fit by her, with whom ſhe entered into chat, as if ſhe had been one of his moſt intimate acquaintance, although ſhe had never ſeen him before.</p>
            <p>This not only made Laura feel more eaſy, but alſo gave Eugene an opportunity of uttering a thouſand tender inquiries, in which his heart was truly intereſted. The matter of his writing to her was cleared up to the entire ſatisfaction of both parties, who had each lamented the ſilence of the other. The ſubject of the Abbey was but ſlightly touched upon. It was evident they had both been confined there at the ſame time; and this idea afforded ſenſations too tender to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in their preſent ſituation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="unknown:035640_0178_100694AE89123078"/>
Eugene could not withdraw himſef from the ſide of Laura, notwithſtanding ſhe repreſented to him the impropriety of ſo particular a conduct; and it had, indeed, given occaſion for a thouſand obſervations replete with witticiſms and ſarcaſm. "Two ſuch ſtrange adventurers ought to come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether!—They had made out a moſt delightful romantic ſtory!—It was pity ſo much invention ſhould ever be divided!—How they muſt triumph at having ſo finely duped the two doating Lords!"</p>
            <p>Such irony as this was the moſt prevailing converſation of the different parties who formed the aſſembly; but ſome few there were who ſaw them in a more candid and favorable light, who admired their virtues, and ſeriouſly wiſhed to ſee them happily united.</p>
            <p>Laura returned home with her ſpirits uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly exhilerated. Lord Oakendale obſerved it; and, as ſhe always gave him an account of whatever happened to her when he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe would not now omit the circumſtance of meeting with Eugene; well knowing that, had ſhe not thought it right to have no concealments of this nature, he would have heard it from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report; and ſhe likewiſe knew that no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035640_0179_100694B33AA71360"/>
could be continued without Lord Oakendale's approbation.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe had related the account of their meeting, and had candidly expreſſed her pleaſure at ſeeing Eugene, Lord Oakendale bit his lip; his countenance betrayed evident diſpleaſure; and, after taking three or four turns acroſs the room, he ſaid, "I hope, Laura, your heart has no ſhare in the intereſts of this Eugene; there are circumſtances in relation to that young man, which ſhould make ſuch a connection extremely obnoxious to me; beſides, I have other views for you." Having ſaid this, he wiſhed her good night with leſs tenderneſs than uſual.</p>
            <p>The moment he was gone Laura burſt into tears. The oppoſition Lord Oakendale had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed gave her extreme uneaſineſs; and ſhe had ſo much of the obſtinacy inherent to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her compoſition, that this very oppoſition only drew cloſer the links her inclinations had formed. Her fond imagination had never before ſeen Eugene in ſo fair a light. What were ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, honors, fortune, ſhe had almoſt ſaid friends, in compariſon with her loved Eugene! To him ſhe would ſacrifice all her hopes, and all her proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects;
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035640_0180_100694B5B8C0B3A8"/>
and with theſe reſolutions ſhe retired to reſt; but her mind was diſturbed; and when ſhe ſaw her uncle in the morning, his diſconcerted brow beſpoke uneaſineſs; of which thinking her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the cauſe, ſhe relaxed ſomething of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, and offered him the moſt ſoothing atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>It was not very likely to ſuppoſe that Lord Oakendale could wiſh to ſee Eugene the huſband of his niece. He had indeed, acted in concert with Lord Vincent at the diſcovery of the myſtery at Oakendale Abbey; but ſince that time all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between them was broken off, and he never wiſhed to have it renewed by any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, ſtill leſs by that of an union between Eugene and Laura, whom he loved with paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate fondneſs; and would have made her any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but that on which alone her happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>
            <p>Thus was their felicity interrupted. Eugene and Laura ſometimes met, and never without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the cruelty of their deſtiny. She return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lord Oakendale's kindneſs by the moſt duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention; but ſhe could not bring herſelf to
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035640_0181_100694B9790E04A0"/>
renounce her lover; neither would ſhe marry him without her uncle's conſent. She hoped time would make an alteration in his ſentiments, and from that hope ſhe drew comfort and reſignation to herſelf; but could not ſo eaſily impreſs it upon her more impatient lover.</p>
            <p>Lord Vincent loved Eugene too well to oppoſe his wiſhes; though, perhaps, he might, as well as Lord Oakendale, have formed connexions more pleaſing to himſelf; yet he acquieſced in all his ſon approved, of whom he was extremely proud, and had, by an act of parliament, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him to take his name, and ſucceed to his eſtates; he was, therefore, in point of rank and fortune, a match for the daughter or niece of the proudeſt Peer; yet the circumſtances of his birth were ſuch as could not fail to be obnoxious to the Oakendale family, and could by no power be done away; though his father's intereſt at court was ſuch, that, (as the immediate heir to his title was now dead) he had obtained a new patent, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing his Peerage on his natural ſon, Eugene.</p>
            <p>Meantime Lord Oakendale found his health de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline with rapidity; and he formed the fond wiſh of ſeeing his beloved Laura ſettled in marriage
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035640_0182_100694BDB7CA3230"/>
with ſome man worthy her vaſt fortune, and ſtill greater merit. He conſidered her attachment to Eugene as a childiſh partiality, which would yield to better proſpects and a lover of his choice. With theſe ideas he introduced the ſon of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friend, Sir Charles Burlington. He was a young man of good character and handſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but he was five years younger than Laura, and was taken from the Univerſity without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen more of the world than a ſchool-boy, in order to facilitate ſo deſirable an union; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Sir Charles had a very good unincumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſtate, which muſt deſcend to this young man, yet a match with Laura Carleton was beyond their moſt ſanguine expectations.</p>
            <p>When he was introduced to Laura, ſhe could ſcarcely prevent her countenance from ſhewing marks of contempt and ridicule at the idea of his being her huſband; for his appearance was more childiſh and youthful than was common at his age, and the embarraſſment he felt on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion added to his juvenile addreſs. She received him with politeneſs, but with a determined reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution never to conſider him in any other light but that of an acquaintance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="unknown:035640_0183_100694C2418B14A0"/>
Sir Charles Burlington was delighted with the proſpect, and overwhelmed Miſs Carleton with unmeaning compliments and overſtrained civility. He might, indeed, be ſaid to be courting for his ſon, who ſat ſtaring at Laura without once ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to give an opinion or utter a ſentence. Even Lord Oakendale himſelf was conſcious of the impropriety and diſproportion between them; but the fear of ſeeing his niece united to Eugene would have reconciled him to yet greater diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Laura avoided as much as poſſible all particular converſation with her uncle. She ſaw his health decline fait, and ſhe could not bear the idea of giving him uneaſineſs. She gave up all her time to attendance on him, and could ſeldom be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to leave him. One night ſhe went to the Opera, where ſhe was met by Eugene, who placed himſelf by her; and in a few minutes young Burlington appeared in the pit, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceremony, thruſt himſelf between them.</p>
            <p>Laura felt herſelf angry, and Eugene, having gained a place on the other ſide of her, aſked, "if he ſhould turn the boy out of the houſe?" which Burlington having heard, reſented with all
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:035640_0184_100694C49D996480"/>
the impetuous fury and violence of youth; and not content with abuſing Eugene, in very groſs terms, he called to ſome Oxonians, his friends, who were in the gallery, to come and give their aſſiſtance to a deviliſh <hi>row</hi> that was going to begin.</p>
            <p>Laura grew alarmed; the eyes of the audience were turned round towards them, and ſeveral glaſſes in the boxes were employed to bring a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er view of the contending parties.</p>
            <p>The lady, who came with Laura, had two daughters with her, who had never before been at an Opera; it would, therefore have been a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el mortification to have taken them away before it was nearly half over; neither was her carriage come for her.</p>
            <p>But Laura could not bear to be the object of wonder, and, perhaps, ridicule; and ſhe earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſted Eugene to get her a chair, and ſhe would go home.</p>
            <p>Eugene readily obeyed her command, and led her out of the pit, followed by Burlington, who expreſſed himſelf in the moſt childiſh and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome terms. The truth was, he had been drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035640_0185_100694CA8743E4D0"/>
and fluſhed with liquor. The idea of being the oſtenſible lover of Laura, gave him airs of boyiſh conſequence, that had diſturbed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the evening, but could not be conſidered in a ſerious light.</p>
            <p>Eugene regarded it as no otherwiſe worth his notice, than as it had diſcompoſed Laura, and deprived him ſooner of her company. This he was telling her as he was going to put her into the chair, when young Burlington advanced, and ſeized her hand, which ſhe drew from him with a look and expreſſion of reſentment; when juſt as he was about again rudely to take hold of her, one of the chairmen inſtantly perceived, and immediately knocked him down. Eugene, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying any regard to the circumſtance, put her into the chair, and attended her to Lord Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endale's houſe, in Portland-Place. He waited to ſee that ſhe was perfectly recovered, and heard the following diſcourſe from the chairman, who had knocked down young Burlington:</p>
            <p>"Arrah, my dear young lady, I hope you will not be after being angry at my lending a blow to the lad who was after being impertinent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, my dear ſhoul, we be old acquaintance.
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035640_0186_100694CC14FC21A0"/>
Arrah ſure I cannot miſtake, when I took you for an angel ſent to deliver poor Patrick from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; aye you're the ſame cratur that opened the door, and let me make my eſcape after I was dead, and was going to be diſjointed by the hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds at Oakendale; and you be too kind heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring me again into trouble, ſeeing as I would be after ſarving you with my heart's blood.'</p>
            <p>Laura ſtared at this harrangue of the chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and after ſome recollection recognized, in the figure and features of this Hibernian, the very ſame man ſhe had beheld in ſo frightful a ſituation in Oakendale Abbey; when, as he ſaid, he had been hanged, and cut down before he was dead; and, having been thrown into this room, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for diſſection; when recovering, her open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door releaſed him! She was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at the circumſtance, to which ſhe could not but give credit. She gave him ſome money, and deſired he would come again the next day, when ſhe aſſured him no harm ſhould befall him; but ſhe knew that Lord Oakendale wiſhed to ſee and converſe with every perſon that could give him any information of the tranſactions of the Abbey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="unknown:035640_0187_100694D135F0EA08"/>
Patrick faithfully promiſed to attend in the morning, by which time Laura prepared Lord Oakendale for ſo extraordinary a viſitor; whom when he arrived, gave the following account of himſelf, "That he was born at Carrick, in Ireland and at a proper age was bound appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to a ſhoemaker, with whom he nearly ſerved his time; but getting acquainted with ſeveral bad people, he ran away from his maſter, and joined the White Boys, with whom he committed ſeveral outrages and violent depredations, for which he was frequently affraid of being brought to juſtice, but good fortune always befriended him, and, after various eſcapes, he came to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where he engaged in ignoble employments, and at laſt ſerved in the honorable ſtation of lamp-lighter!</p>
            <p>"That one evening when he was lighting the lamps at Lord Oakendale's door, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, from one of the balcony windows, accoſted him and enquired his birth and education, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, if he ſhould not like to fill a more lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and honorable employment than that of lamp-lighter? He replied, "He was ready to undertake any buſineſs whereby he might raiſe
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035640_0188_100694D39BE10A08"/>
his fortune, except that of committing murder, and that he could never bring himſelf to do;" up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſhe aſſured him, that it was not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit murder that ſhe wiſhed him to change his profeſſion; but only to follow, and bring her an exact account of a certain young gentleman, whoſe abode ſhe pointed out, and for which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he ſhould be very handſomely rewarded.</p>
            <p>Nothing could better ſuit his inclinations and his genius, than ſuch an idle profitable buſineſs. He accordingly ſerved her in this capacity with ſuch indefatigable zeal, that he gave her an exact account of all the young gentleman engaged in; and, about a fortnight after this, he was ſent down to Cumberland to give information to ſome particular perſons that the above mentioned young gentleman would be in ſuch a place, at ſuch a time, where, he believed, he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken and detained. That after he had undergone an examination, as to his fidelity and ſecrecy, he was employed to aſſiſt thoſe wretches, and peſts of ſociety, called reſurrection men, who brought numbers of bodies to Oakendale Abbey. They were generally received in the night; and the perſon, who was chief ſuperintendant, and who paid the men who procured the bodies, was
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:035640_0189_100694D8EFC5B0C8"/>
named Marcel, and was brother to the woman of that name, who lived with lady Oakendale, and was the ſame that ſpoke to him when he was lighting the lamp.</p>
            <p>Patrick continued to inform his lordſhip that he grew tired of the employment, and thought it a ſhocking one; he therefore ran away, and joined a ſet of coiners in the neighborhood of Penrith, where they were ſoon after diſcovered, taken, and brought to condign puniſhment.</p>
            <p>At his trial he ſaw his old maſter Marcel, at the ſight of whom (to uſe his own expreſſion) his blood ran cold; for he ſuppoſed he was only come to watch for his condemnation, and like a crow after carrion, beſpeak his body. This was really the caſe; for Patrick ſaid he remembered nothing after the fatal words of condemnation had paſſed upon him. His mind was all in a ſtate of confuſion; and, if any thoughts did occur, they were only on the wretched ſtate to which his body would be ſubjected after he was dead; nor could the clergyman, who attended him, impreſs any ideas of that more immortal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material part of him, which could not ſuffer by the hands of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:035640_0190_100694DA82803E58"/>
The firſt idea of recollection he experienced. (after the noiſe of the crowd and the mob that attended him to the gallows had ceaſed) was of extreme pain in his head and neck, and a violent oppreſſion upon his lungs. He ſtruggled for a few ſeconds, and gained reſpiration; a miſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes ſeemed to vaniſh, and he recovered ſufficient ſight to perceive he was in a room with a dead body hung up on one ſide of it. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly occurred to him that he was in the Abbey. He was horribly frightened, and he tried to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate; but found his throat ſo ſwelled that he could only utter a guggling kind of ſound; when in a moment the door of the room gently opened, and a beautiful creature entered, whom he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be an inhabitant of that world into which he had been launched; yet, notwithſtanding the appearance of this fair object, his firſt idea was that of making his eſcape which he inſtantly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by paſſing through the door ſhe had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Tranſient as was the glance he had of her countenance, it nevertheleſs made an impreſſion never to be effaced, and the remembrance of this fair image coming to releaſe him from a place which contained all the horrors of death, created
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035640_0191_100694DF38FD4390"/>
in him a penitence for his paſt crimes, which would, he hoped in ſome degree, atone for the commiſſion of them.</p>
            <p>After this he ran as faſt as his legs could carry him, till night overtook his ſteps, and he laid down upon the graſs till morning, when he aſked for a cruſt of bread, and a draught of water, at a ſmall cottage, from whence he begged his way up to London, where he has ever ſince been in honeſt employment, and has ſincerely and truly repented of his paſt crimes. When he ſaw Laura handed out of the opera houſe by Eugene, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly remembered them both; and the ſtrong propenſity he had to ſpeak to her got the better of all decorum.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the narrative of Patrick O'Dennis, at which Lord Oakendale expreſſed much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. He handſomely rewarded Patrick for his trouble, and ſtrongly recommended to him to perſevere in his good reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale made ſome comments upon Patrick's narrative, and ſeeming to be in very good humor, Laura took occaſion to mention the circumſtances of the preceding night, not omitting to enlarge upon the firm and polite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:035640_0192_100694E0DE5D2D98"/>
of Eugene, in oppoſition to that of the more boyiſh and inſolent behaviour of Mr. Burlington. Lord Oakendale could not but admit and approve of the former; and Laura gained ſo far upon his good temper, as to obtain leave to diſmiſs that young fop from any love-like pretentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her. This was a great ſtep gained, and Laura promiſed, in her turn, to make ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions equally pleaſing to her uncle.</p>
            <p>Comfort ſeemed once more to dawn upon her, and ſhe had ſometimes (though not often) the happineſs of meeting Eugene. Lord Vincent fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſſed him to make another choice, ſince there was no probability of Lord Oakendale's giving his conſent to an union with Laura, and to ſee Eugene ſettled in marriage, was the firſt wiſh of his father. But although Eugene receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the advances from the miſſes, and all the overtures from their mothers and aunts, which are authorized and encouraged by the preſent race of females, yet was his heart faithful to its firſt attachment; and, however he might deſpair of gaining Laura, he could never allow the idea of another woman as the ſole object of his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Indeed, theſe firm reſolutions were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035640_0193_100694E51703D498"/>
highly neceſſary; for a young widow of the name of Sackville, laid <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch a well-regulated ſiege to the heart of Eugene, and had ſo many, and ſuch faſcinating charms, that it was almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reſiſt her power. She was beſides high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favored, and ſtrongly recommended by Lord Vincent, for his future daughter; and this being the caſe, Eugene was more frequently thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her company than he would otherwiſe have wiſhed; conſequently the world had pronounced them a pair deſtined for each other, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the moſt violent love ſubſiſting between them.</p>
            <p>The report could not fail to reach the ears of Laura. She did not at firſt give the ſmalleſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it, but only conſidered it as the idle ſtory of the day. It was, however, ſo frequently, and ſo ſtrongly repeated, that a ſpark of jealouſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to light up in her mind, and ſeveral little circumſtances kindled the flame to a tormenting ſtate of uneaſineſs and ſuſpenſe.</p>
            <p>She ſeldom ſaw Eugene. He never came to Lord Oakendale's; and the ill ſtate of his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's health confined her very much at home. Whenever ſhe had met Eugene he was in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with Mrs. Sackville. Her heart could not
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:035640_0194_100694E8D2777290"/>
eaſily give credit to his infidelity, yet a thouſand corroding fears rendered her miſerable.</p>
            <p>During this ſtate of uncertainty Lord Oaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale grew every day more debilitated, and his health declined very faſt. Laura was his ſole comfort, and to her he looked for every ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the world could give him. He had obſerved her late uneaſineſs, and, perhaps, gueſſed the cauſe, in which he could not but rejoice, however he might feel hurt at the effect. He redoubled his kindneſs to her; he told her ſhe would be ſole miſtreſs of all his wealth at his deceaſe, and often ſignified how ardently he wiſhed her to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it with ſome worthy man.</p>
            <p>What were wealth and honors to Laura! There was, indeed, an object dearer to her than all the world; and that object was now ſaid to be devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to another. How cruel was her fate! yet a more ſevere one awaited her.</p>
            <p>Her uncle grew every day worſe; his diſorder was ſlow but of ſuch a nature as no remedy could reach. He found he muſt ſoon pay the debt of nature, and a lowneſs of ſpirits ſeized him. Something ſeemed to preſs upon his mind with a particular weight of uneaſineſs. Laura, ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:035640_0195_100694EEDD950750"/>
and willing to mitigate (as far as was in her power) the ſorrow that ſeemed to oppreſs him, uſed every method ſhe could deviſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the melancholy he labored under, at the ſame time that her own mind was cruelly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.</p>
            <p>Lord Oakendale ſeemed ſenſible of her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He would gaze at her for hours together, whilſt he uttered the moſt bitter ſighs; and the pain of his mind ſeemed to increaſe the malady of his body, and haſtened his diſſolution. It was in one of theſe moments that Laura ſaid, "Is there any thing I can do that will make my dear uncle more eaſy and compoſed?"</p>
            <p>"There is," replied Lord Oakendale; "but will my Laura make the ſacrifice? I know it is a weakneſs in me to deſire it; but it is a weakneſs I have tried in vain to conquer, and my peace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon her word."</p>
            <p>"Speak," ſaid Laura, in an agitated voice, though far from ſuſpecting the nat<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, "and be aſſured of all in my power."</p>
            <p>"Can you, then," ſaid Lord Oakendale, "will my Laura promiſe, ſacredly promiſe, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to marry Eugene Vincent?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="unknown:035640_0196_100694F10A3CE538"/>
"Stop," ſaid Laura; "Oh! ſave me from this conflict." Lord Oakendale ſat with eagerneſs, and death depicted on his countenance. He ſeemed impatiently waiting for a reply; yet trembling leſt he had made a requeſt which could not be granted; at the ſame time fearing that his weak frame could not ſupport a refuſal.</p>
            <p>"Alas!" ſaid Laura (turning her head this way and that way, in the moſt diſtracted ſtate of terror and perplexity) have I no friend to adviſe me in this cruel conflict? Oh! my lord, Eugene is dearer to me than—" Here ſhe ſtopped, and a violent burſt of tears, in ſome degree, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her.</p>
            <p>During this time Lord Oakendale trembled, and appeared convulſed. He graſped the hand of Laura, and faintly pronounced, "I am dying!" She was extremely terrified; and, as ſhe ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with one arm, ſhe rang the bell with the other for aſſiſtance. He was conveyed to bed, and proper advice was immediately ſent for.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of Laura was very little better than that of her uncle. She had not as yet given the fatal promiſe that would ſeal her miſery; but the dying ſituation of Lord Oakendale, and the
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:035640_0197_100694F71740E568"/>
wiſh he had ſo devoutly expreſſed, ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. She went to his chamber fully determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make the ſacrifice of her happineſs, if it was neceſſary to his peace of mind.</p>
            <p>As ſhe proceeded to Lord Oakendale's room, ſhe reflected on the conſequences of what ſhe was about to do. What were riches, honors, titles, fame, or any worldly comfort, without the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty of beſtowing them on the only object of her love! yet, might not the promiſe ſhe was about to make be of the utmoſt conſequence to herſelf, as ſeemed ſo neceſſary to calm the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit of Lord Oakendale; that promiſe, which to confirm, tore her heart aſſunder. In what eſtimation might it be held by the perſon for whoſe ſake alone ſhe would withold it. Ah! (but there was madneſs in that thought) it might be a happy releaſe to Eugene, and at once enable him to cancel thoſe vows which had made hers ſo binding. Theſe reflections brought her to the chamber-door; and, upon her entering, the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians informed her Lord Oakendale had but a few minutes to live, and that he had never once ſpoke ſince ſhe left him!</p>
            <p>She approached the bed; ſhe took his hand, and kneeling down, ſhe preſſed it to her lips,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:035640_0198_10068F1B80A3ECD8"/>
while the tears fell in large drops from her eyes. He looked at her with the tendereſt pity. She thought him perfectly ſenſible; and ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pronounce her promiſe, when he fixed his hand (already clammy with the dew of death) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her lips, as if to prevent her ſpeaking. She raiſed up her eyes in thankful expreſſion to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the releaſe; and, although he mourned, perhaps, inwardly, his countenance conveyed content and approbation. For a few ſeconds he ſeemed ſtruggling for ſpeech. He withdrew his hands from Laura's, and, joining them in a ſupplicating form, he articulated "Bleſs my niece!" and expired.</p>
            <p>Laura was extremely ſhocked at the ſudden, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his death, and ſhe grieved for him with the moſt affectionate ſincerity. She was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied that he wiſhed to recal the promiſe he had deſired her to make, and was convinced that the hand of death had awakened him to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a proper ſenſe of the cruelty his more lively feelings would have impoſed.</p>
            <p>Laura found herſelf in poſſeſſion of all his vaſt fortune; and ſhe had the comfort and advice of her dear Madame du Frene in the arrangement of the funeral, and other neceſſary matters. She
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035640_0199_100694FE6E35ECF0"/>
had likewiſe the ſatisfaction of aſking that dear friend concerning Eugene, to whom Madame du Frene had always been extremely partial. Lord Oakendale had on that account not ſhewn her ſo much favor as he would otherwiſe have done; and during his illneſs Laura had been but little out to meet with her.</p>
            <p>When ſhe aſked concerning him, Madame du Frene looked grave, and only replied "he was well."</p>
            <p>Laura did not feel contented with the anſwer; but a certain diſlike to lead to the ſubject, unleſs more encouraged by her friend, prevented her adding more at preſent. She thought it unkind that Eugene never made any inquiries after her; and, as ſhe did not yet go into public, ſhe never chanced to ſee him. Soon, however, ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her viſits, and appeared in public. Her ſable dreſs diminiſhed nothing of her beauty, and the knowledge of her large and independent fortune gave additional charms to her perſon. She once or twice ſaw Eugene, and was ſhocked at the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his addreſs and manners towards her. He always looked uncommonly grave, and avoided any further converſation than the common-place forms of ceremony required. Such behavior was
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035640_0200_1006950210978F00"/>
to her unaccountable, and cruel in the extreme. He could, ſhe thought, but have behaved in this manner had ſhe really made that promiſe to Lord Oakendale, which ſhe had conſidered as ſo fatal to her peace.</p>
            <p>Harraſſed and fretted as ſhe was from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and finding neither riches or admiration af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her the ſmalleſt happineſs in this uncertain ſtate, ſhe determined to come to a more particular explanation with Madame du Frene on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo near her heart.</p>
            <p>She accordingly took the opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing her ſurpriſe and wonder at the coldneſs of Eugene's behavior.</p>
            <p>Madame du Frene remained ſilent for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then ſaid, "My dear Laura, how often, in your days of childhood, have I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to prepare your mind for thoſe diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which come neareſt the heart, and which, if borne with pious reſignation, are the brighteſt ornaments to the chriſtian character. I am truly ſorry to have occaſion now to enforce this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; but Eugene is, I am informed, engaged to marry Mrs. Sackville." Here ſhe ſtopped, and Laura ſat with her arms reſted on a table, and her hands covered her face. She ſighed bitterly.
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035640_0201_10069505EAE4E178"/>
and when ſhe looked up, Madame du Frene had the mortification to obſerve marks of the moſt extreme ſorrow depicted in her countenance.</p>
            <p>Nothing more paſſed at the preſent time. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame du Frene was ſo much hurt at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of woe which Laura's looks expreſſed, that ſhe was reſolved to ſpeak to Eugene upon the ſubject, although ſhe had little or no hopes of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeeing them united.</p>
            <p>It happened ſoon after that Madame was, by her own contrivance, thrown into company with Eugene; when ſhe purpoſely introduced the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Laura, obſerving upon her immenſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and ſtill greater merits; adding her earneſt hopes, that ſhe would beſtow it upon ſome man truly worthy of ſo rich a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Eugene ſighed, and aſked (in a melancholy tone) "If Laura was likely to be married?"</p>
            <p>"Not that I know," replied Madame du Frene. "I ſhould imagine ſhe would be extremely care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful how ſhe formed a ſecond attachment, having been ſo cruelly diſappointed in her firſt."</p>
            <p>Eugene ſeemed much agitated, and, after a pauſe, ſaid, "If ſhe had ſuffered any diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035640_0202_1006950913370D58"/>
it was of her own inflicting; and the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was deeply and forever transfixed in the boſom of another."</p>
            <p>Madame Du Frene replied, "Good God!" what is it you mean? When nature formed the faireſt of its compoſitions, no material was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and Laura is, I am certain of that diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as would rather ſuffer pain herſelf than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it upon others."</p>
            <p>"Why, then," ſaid Eugene, "did ſhe make that raſh—I will ſay that accurſed promiſe?"</p>
            <p>"What promiſe!" replied Madame Du Frene; "ſhe never did make any; Lord Oakendale was taken ſpeechleſs before ſhe had time to pronounce a promiſe, which nothing but the agonies of death would have extorted from her; and even in that moment ſhe wavered, and profeſſed that terrible you was dearer to her than life! Nay," continued Madame du Frene, "ſhe had the ſatisfaction of knowing, and being aſſured, that her uncle appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of her conduct, and bleſſed her with his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath!"</p>
            <p>Thus was this diſtreſſing buſineſs brought to an amicable concluſion; and Madame Du Frene had the inexpreſſible felicity of reconciling two lovers whoſe hearts had never been divided.</p>
            <p>It appeared that Lord Oakendale, extremely
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:035640_0203_1006950AC46BE988"/>
deſirous to break the bonds which ſo cloſely uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Eugene and Laura, had mentioned to ſome particular friends that Laura had given him ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſe never to marry Eugene. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this report Lord Vincent's pride took the alarm, and he repeated it to Eugene with exaggerated proofs.</p>
            <p>Thus had theſe two unhappy men nearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the felicity of thoſe moſt dear to them by their ill-judging zeal, and ſtill more blamable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the truth.</p>
            <p>Eugene, with a mind diſtracted with diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, flew to diſſipation to diſpel his miſery; and, falling in the way of a young and faſcinating widow, he had nearly formed that contract with her, which his honor would have obliged him to fulfil, and nothing but death could have diſſolved.</p>
            <p>The death of Lord Vincent, ſoon after theſe occurrences, gave to his ſon, title, wealth and power. His inclinations had long been fixed, and the merits of Laura were amply rewarded by an union with her loved Eugene. Some of their ſummers were paſſed in Cumberland; and the virtues of Lord Vincent and Laura ſoon diſpelled THE HORRORS OF OAKENDALE ABBEY.</p>
