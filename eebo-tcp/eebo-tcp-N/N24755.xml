            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONY FROM THE MONTHLY MEETING OF PROVIDENCE CONCERNING JOB SCOTT.</head>
            <p>OUR beloved friend Job Scott was born in Providence the 18th of 10th month 1751, new ſtyle, in that part of it now North-Providence. His parents were John and Lydia Scott, who gave him ſuch opportunities as, through his turn for lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary improvement, he acquired both a competent ſhare of common ſchool learning, and made ſome progreſs in ſome other branches of literature.</p>
            <p>In his young years it appears, that by diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reproofs of inſtruction, manifeſted in his own mind, he was drawn into vanity, diſſipation and folly. Repeated and great were his conflicts between his depraved propenſities and the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of truth, but the latter humbling and melting his heart into contrition, he was graciouſly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the evil of his ways, and the deſtruction which awaited him if he did not reject the Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, forſake his wicked companions, and turn to the Lord, in obedience to his holy law written in his heart; until at length he ſo learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered, that he gave up to the operations of the ſpirit of Chriſt upon him, in
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:032810_0003_0FF52976D906AD60"/>
the faith of its divine, reſtraining, preſerving and ſanctifying power, and therein experienced the conſolation of his heavenly Father's love.</p>
            <p>Being thus humbled under the various turnings of the Lord's hand upon him, and clearly convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the power and efficacy of the diſtinguiſhing principle of our holy profeſſion, viz. the light of Chriſt within man, as God's gift for his ſalvation; he requeſted the care, and became a member, of the monthly meeting of Smithfield, then extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Providence; and being of ſtrong and ready abilities, and his mind improved and enlarged by the ſanctifying power of Truth, he <hi>was enabled and zealouſly</hi> and very uſefully diſpoſed for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cauſe of righteouſneſs in which he was engaged.</p>
            <p>Having in the ſchool of Chriſt meaſurably learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the myſtery of the fall and reſtoration of man, and to underſtand the ſcriptures and pertinently to apply them, he was brought under the preparing hand of the Lord for the work of the miniſtry, under which diſpenſation his ſoul was deeply bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and brought under great ſympathy with ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls, who were travailing in birth that Chriſt might be formed in them, to whom he was at times and ſeaſons enabled powerfully to adminiſter encouragement and conſolation. Thus for ſeveral years, as well as by letters and epiſtles, for which he was eminently gifted with inſtructive and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing talents, he laboured for the promotion of the cauſe of truth, now become precious in his ſight; and about the 23d year of his age he appeared in the miniſtry at a publick meeting in Providence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the deſire of his ſoul, that 'Sion might ariſe and ſhake herſelf from the duſt of the earth,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:032810_0004_0FF529845ABB0098"/>
and put on her beautiful garments.' The gravity in which he appeared, the ſympathy which was felt, and the ſolemnity of that ſeaſon, are refreſhingly remembered by ſome to the preſent day.</p>
            <p>At this time he taught a ſchool in Providence, in which employ he continued for ſeveral years, and afterwards in Smithfield, much to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his employers, and the children and youth under his care, whoſe confidence and affections he very generally gained and preſerved, to ſome of whom his memory is yet precious. In his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all our religious meetings, and in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties of private life, as well as in the relations of ſon, huſband, parent and neighbour, he was truly exemplary. His appearance in the miniſtry was not very frequent when at home, and he was frequently led into an example of ſilence when abroad, circumſpect not to miniſter without freſh anointing, and careful in attending cloſely to the turnings of the key of David; well knowing when that ſhuts none can open, and therefore, when he perceived his ſubject to cloſe and the life withdraw, however clear his opening, and free the ſpring of life had been at his beginning, he would ſuddenly ſit down, however in the croſs; for he had a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to bear againſt all ſuperficial and lifeleſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and very exemplarily avoided it.</p>
            <p>His firſt viſit abroad was to the northerly parts of the yearly meeting of New-York, which proved a ſeaſon of cloſe, probation and conflict of mind, yet endeavouring to attend to the pointings of duty from place to place, he was, as appears by his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, favoured to return with the approbation of thoſe he viſited; and by a proſpect which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears he had as he was returning home, not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032810_0005_0FF529A575FA5C00"/>
unlike the apoſtle Paul's, 2 Cor. xii. he was ſtrengthened to perſeverance in a dedication of heart to the Lord; for, in this luminous and extatic proſpect, it appeared to him, that all his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſpots were <hi>made</hi> clean before the Lamb, and he made to partake of the conſolations and joys of the heavenly hoſt; yet like the apoſtle, he had ſoon to experience a thorn in the fleſh, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure, and even the meſſenger of Satan was permitted to buffet him; but he beſought the Lord for his preſervation, and received the conſoling anſwer of 'my grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee; for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.' Thus buffeted, tried and tempted, he had to tread in the ſteps of the great apoſtle and his dear Lord and Maſter, and thereby became more perfected through ſufferings.</p>
            <p>He afterwards viſited New-York, New-Jerſey and Pennſylvania twice, and once the Southern ſtates as far as Georgia, returning certificates of the approbation of thoſe he viſited, among whom we have good reaſon to believe he has left many ſeals of his goſpel miniſtry, and impreſſions of near and dear unity and fellowſhip with him as a brother beloved, as well as in theſe and other parts of our own yearly meeting. He alſo viſited ſome part of the ſtate of Connecticut, and had meetings among thoſe not of our ſociety. Soon after which a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that for ſome years before had opened to his view, of viſiting Great-Britain and Ireland, had ſo opened on his mind, as to induce him to open the ſame to his friends for their concurrence and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate. In the ninth month, 1792, he received one from this monthly meeting, and alſo one in the tenth month from our quarterly meeting for
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032810_0006_0FF529C46A40C9A8"/>
Rhode-Iſland. On the 26th of the 11th month he took a ſolemn leave of his family and friends at home, and ſailed from Boſton the 5th of the 12th month, for Dunkirk in France. On the paſſage the ſhip ſprung a leak, and had a ſevere gale of wind; but it appears this our friend was preſerved, 'reſigned and ſtayed through all,' while the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on board were toſſed with amazement and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; correſponding with a proſpect which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and recorded, in his journal left at home, about twelve months before he ſailed, on a view of which a ſtriking evidence is thereby raiſed that prophecy or communication to the mind of future events has not ceaſed; but that the Lord ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues graciouſly to open his viſions of light to his devoted ſervants by way of pointing to duty, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of events, and guiding the mind through them, in confirmation of divine ſuperintendance, and their faith in his gracious appearance.</p>
            <p>He arrived at Dunkirk the 5th of the 1ſt month, and after tarrying there about ten days, much to his own and friends ſatisfaction, he proceeded to England, taking ſome meetings in Kent, went to London, attended the different meetings in that city, then into Wales, and attended the ſeveral monthly and quarterly meetings and the yearly meeting at Carmathan, thence to Briſtol, and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to London, attended the yearly meeting there, who, in their epiſtle to ours, ſpeak of him in a very ſatisfactory manner. He then went to Liverpool, taking meetings in his way, and ſo paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over to Ireland, and viſited all the meetings of Friends and ſome of other ſocieties there; attended the national half-year's meeting in Dublin; and, while viſiting a few meetings a ſecond time, he
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:032810_0007_0FF52998862C2788"/>
was taken ill of the ſmall-pox, at the houſe of our friend Elizabeth Shackleton, in Ballitore, from whence he dictated a letter on the 14th of the 11th month, to his relations and Friends; out of which, and an account taken by the Friends who attended him, we extract the following: he ſays, <q>I am now twenty-eight Iriſh miles from Dublin, entered five days into the ſmall-pox; I feel eaſieſt to addreſs you principally, that you may know my mind enjoys that which removes beyond all ſorrow.</q> Of his children he ſays, <q>I wiſh them to get a little more learning than ſome of them are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the way of; and although I do not wiſh much of the world's poliſh, yet it is, at this awful moment, my deſire that they may not be brought up with much ruſticity, for this I believe has not very often contributed either to civil or religious uſefulneſs. My deſire for my children's ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial growth in the truth, and ſtrict adherence to all its diſcoveries to the cloſe of their days, is by far my principal wiſh for them. Out of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good degree of this precious inheritance, I know of nothing in this world worth living for. Ye that know it, ſuffer nothing, I moſt cordially beſeech you, ever to divert your minds from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and fervent purſuit after the fulneſs of it; even unto the meaſure and ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</q> At another time he ſaid, <q>My ſpirits are under little or no depreſſion; perhaps I never ſaw a time before, when all things not criminal were ſo nearly alike to me in point of any diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the mind. When I verge a little towards ſleep, I am all afloat, from the ſtate of my nerves, and forced immediately from beginning repoſe; but through all, the ſoul ſeems deeply anchored
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:032810_0008_0FF52A185391E340"/>
in God:</q>—adding, <q>My heart ſeems melted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me in retroſpective view; all the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, however grievous in their time, are lighter now than vanity, except as they are clearly ſeen to have contributed largely to the ſanctification of the ſoul; as they are remembered with awfulneſs and gratitude before Him who has not been wanting to preſerve through them all; and as they ſeem likely to introduce, before long, an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</q> At another time he ſaid, <q>It is the Lord that enables to coincide with his will, and ſay amen to all the trials and conflicts he permits to attend us. My mind is centred in <hi>that</hi> which brings into perfect acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence. There is nothing in this world worth being enjoyed out of the divine will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He gave directions, that if he ſhould go hence, every thing about his interment ſhould be plain and ſimple; expreſſed his entire reſignation to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpoſal; and that he found nothing to ſtand between him and the Fountain of everlaſting love. At another time ſaid, <q>I have no fear, for perfect love caſteth out all fear, and he that feareth is not perfected in love.</q> His ſtomach refuſing all nouriſhment, and a hiccough coming on, he ſaid, <q>Do not force nature, let me paſs quietly away to the eternal inheritance.</q> Soon after ſaid, <q>I am waiting patiently to ſee the ſalvation of God— do you wait patiently with me—I have no deſire, nor the ſhadow of a deſire, to be reſtored—I hope the doctors will ſoon find that they have done their part.</q> To one he ſaid, <q>Thy being here has been an inexpreſſible ſatisfaction to me.</q> Afterwards ſaid, <q>I have known ſomething of that law of love whereby all boaſting is entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:032810_0009_0FF529B417E76280"/>
but I may ſay, through that which has ſupported me under all the trials and conflicts which have attended my paſſage through life, to you my beloved friends, as to dear children, Follow me as I have endeavoured to follow Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord of life and glory, and the Rock of my eternal ſalvation.</q> We omit many other weighty and inſtructive expreſſions of our beloved friend, which he uttered during his illneſs and till near his cloſe, leſt this teſtimony ſhould extend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its proper limits. He quietly departed this life the 22d of the 11th mo. 1793, at the houſe of our aforeſaid friend Elizabeth Shackleton, in Ballitore, in Ireland; and we doubt not finiſhed his courſe with joy, and is entered into the place of his reſt, <hi>where the righteous ſhine forth as the ſun, in the kingdom of their Father.</hi>

and ſervice in his church militant; called and ſent forth by the immediate influences of his ſpirit to publiſh the goſpel; and being preſerved in an eminent degree, carefully attentive to the leadings thereof, the word of the Lord through him was often <q>as a fire and as a hammer to break the rock in pieces.</q> Many were the bitter cups al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted him, in the diſpenſations of unerring wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which though hard to fleſh and blood, yet he appeared not to ſhrink therefrom; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the divine will, and a ſurrender of his own, he was concerned to follow the Captain of his ſalvation, who was made perfect through ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;—and thus by abiding under the power of the croſs, he might well have adopted the language of the apoſtle, <q>by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace which was beſtowed on me was not in vain; but I laboured abundantly, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</q>

            <p>He was a diligent waiter to experience renewed qualification for ſervice before he attempted to move either in the miniſtry or in the tranſactions of the diſcipline; as well knowing that without a freſh anointing, any endeavours to act muſt prove inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, and tend to centre in lifeleſs formality, againſt which he was zealouſly concerned to bear teſtimony.</p>
            <p>His converſation was coupled with fear, as well as ſeaſoned with grace; and being deep in heavenly myſteries, he was cautious of ſquandering the ſame, yet, when at liberty for converſation, his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were agreeable, and remarkably inſtructive.</p>
            <p>He viſited the meetings of Friends in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—alſo had much religious ſervice among thoſe not in profeſſion with us, and was a ſharp threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

inſtrument in the Lord's hand, againſt all who preached for hire and divined for money, being earneſtly concerned to call the people off from dead works, that they might be brought to experience the efficacy of true religion in the newneſs of life.</p>
            <p>In his laſt illneſs, at the houſe of our friend Elizabeth Shackleton, of Ballitore, he was much reſigned, although the diſorder, which proved the ſmall-pox, lay heavy on him. He ſpoke of the things of God, and thoſe that appertain to his kingdom, yet was very modeſt and diffident of his labours to promote them in the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but gave evident marks of his peace of mind, and aſſurance that he had no doubt of a manſion of reſt prepared for him, where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the weary be at reſt, experiencing great ſerenity and compoſure even as a morning without clouds.</p>
            <p>He departed this life the 22d of 11th mo. 1793, aged upwards of forty-two years, and has left an example which ſpeaks loudly to us his ſurvivors, 'follow me, as I have followed Chriſt.'</p>

               <p>FORASMUCH as it hath pleaſed divine wiſdom to lead and conduct my ſoul through many, various and afflictive diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; as well as through ſome very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable enjoyments; giving me to partake largely of afflictions; bearing up my mind through them; bringing me forth again and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:032810_0015_0FF52A1A599B9E48"/>
again rejoicing, after ſcenes of deep diſtreſs; and wonderfully preſerving me through ſome very deep, and perhaps ſomewhat unuſual probations, in my travel towards the land of reſt: I feel, and often have felt, an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind to leave behind me ſome memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums in commemoration of his gracious dealings with me from my youth.</p>
               <p>I was born, according to the beſt account I could obtain, and according to the preſent or new ſtyle, on the 18th day of the 10th month 1751<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the townſhip of Providence, now North-Providence, in the colony (now ſtate) of Rhode-Iſland and Providence Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in New-England. My parents names were John and Lydia Scott; who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted honeſt people, though my father made but little profeſſion of religion. My mother was more zealous, and attended Friends meetings when ſhe conveniently could, taking me divers times with her, and I think a few times another or two of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; though we were all but young, for I being the eldeſt was but ten years old when ſhe died. I can well remember the ſerious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and contemplations which, at that early period of life, and for ſome years before my mother's deceaſe, attended my mind as I ſat in meeting with her, and on the way home. I even had longing deſires to become truly religious, and to ſerve and fear God as Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, did and others that I read or heard of. My mother endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:032810_0016_0FF52AB6D74D6888"/>
much to reſtrain us from being in the company of rude and vicious children, and would ſometimes call us together, and labour to have us ſit in ſilence with her, which we did: and though I then underſtood but little of the intent of it, it has ſince afforded me a degree of ſolid ſatisfaction, in believing the Lord had given her to know and partake of the ſublime enjoyments and ſubſtantial bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of true, inward, chriſtian ſilence, and waiting upon God; and that ſhe was deſirous we her children might, in our tender years, be made acquainted with at leaſt ſome ſecret touches of that divine favour which I doubt not ſhe felt and experienced in ſuch ſeaſons of retirement: and though, as I obſerved, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but little about it then; yet I have ſince had reaſon to believe it was a real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to me; and that it has often been remembered ſince to my benefit.</p>
               <p>I am fully perſuaded of the great advantage and ſpiritual uſefulneſs to children and others, reſulting from frequent ſilent waiting on the Lord. I have ſeen lively and convincing evidence of it, even in children very young in years; and fully believe the impreſſions of divine goodneſs have been ſuch to their minds at ſome ſuch ſeaſons, even when there has not been a word uttered vocally, as have laſtingly remained, and powerfully tended to beget the true fear and love of God in their young and tender hearts. And O! that parents were more generally concerned to do all they could
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032810_0017_0FF529B5B80CF7F0"/>
towards leading their tender offspring into an early acquaintance with, and reliſh of divine things: beſt learned, and moſt livingly, and experimentally ſealed upon the ſoul, in a ſtate of ſilent introverſion, and feeling after God.</p>
               <p>I was told by ſome of my kindred who were preſent at my mother's death (for it being night I was not preſent myſelf) that her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was joyful and glorious; and that very near her laſt breath was ſpent in fervent ſupplication to the Lord her God.</p>
               <p>And now, not at all doubting but her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſpirit is at reſt in Jeſus, I leave her, and proceed to a further relation of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of my own mind, having this teſtimony to bear, that almoſt as early as I can remember any thing, I can well remember the Lord's ſecret workings in my heart, by his grace or holy ſpirit; very ſenſibly bringing me under condemnation for my evil thoughts and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as rudeneſs and bad words, (though not frequent in the uſe of them) diſobedience to parents; inwardly wiſhing, in moments of anger, ſome evil to ſuch as offended me; and ſuch like childiſh and corrupt diſpoſitions and practices, which over and beyond all outward inſtruction I was made ſenſible were evil, and ſprang from a real root of evil in me. And I am in a full belief, that in every quarter of the globe, children, at an early age, have good and evil ſet before them, in the ſhinings of the light of Chriſt in their hearts, with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032810_0018_0FF52B221852A770"/>
and evidence ſufficient to aſcertain to them their duty, if they honeſtly attend to it. And though I am deeply ſenſible of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and utility of much careful guardianſhip, cultivation and inſtruction, in order to guard children againſt the corrupting influence of example, invitation, and perverſe inclination, which abundantly and prevalently ſurround them; yet I fear a great part of the tuition, which too many children receive, tends rather to blunt the true ſenſe and evidence of divine truths upon the mind, and to ſubſtitute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſyſtems inſtead thereof, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage an honeſt attention to the teachings which lead <hi>into all truth.</hi> I am ſatisfied, if the teachings of men were never to thwart the teachings of the holy ſpirit, many things would fix on the minds of children to be evils which they are now inſtructed and perſuaded are innocent and commendable. Indeed it is mournful to obſerve how many of them are bolſtered up in pride, vanity and revenge; taught to plume themſelves upon their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſuperiority of parts and attainments; nurſed up in the ideas of grandeur and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour; yea, inſpired with exalted notions of the merit of valour, heroiſm, and human ſlaughter.—Thus the very image of God, which more or leſs ſhines in the countenance, and in the tender ſenſibilities and compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate commiſerating feelings of an innocent child, is defaced or obſcured.</p>
               <p>Obſerve an innocent child attentively, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032810_0019_0FF529DEB66D8860"/>
though anger, paſſion and revenge, are very obvious features of the firſt nature, and ſhew plainly that there is much to be ſubdued in them; yet it will be found, they feel nearly and tenderly for the diſtreſs of others; their little boſoms beat with compaſſion; and if they ſee cruelty exerciſed, by one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they will often, in the beſt manner they can, manifeſt their abhorrence of the cruelty, and diſlike of the cruel. There is in them that which, as attended to, will reſtrain the violence of nature, and by degrees bind the ſtrong man, and caſt him out, ſpoiling all his goods. It is no ſubſtantial objection to the diſcernment given to children by the holy light which ſhines in all, either that they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently know but very little, for they have to act in but few and very ſmall matters, and their diſcernment is proportionate; or that the ſeeds of evil, and propenſities to evil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are ſome of the firſt things evident in them.</p>
               <p>I am not inſenſible of the volumes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy about neceſſity and free will, fate and choice; but I have no mind now to meddle with any of the common arguments pro or con reſpecting them. Men muffle and blind their own underſtandings by running into abſtruſe and metaphyſical inquiries, wherein they are ſcarce ever the better ſatisfied for their niceſt inveſtigations, or keeneſt diſcuſſions. God has made mankind univerſally ſenſible (in degrees ſufficient for their various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032810_0020_0FF529EE821055E8"/>
and allotments in life) of their duty, and enabled them to perform it, ſo far as they improve the means afforded them.</p>
               <p>Adam was as certainly (ſo it ſtands in my mind) made able to obey or conform to the divine will, ſo far as revealed to him, as God is perfect goodneſs; and ſo I am perſuaded are all his offspring. I have no more belief that God's revealed will required any thing of our firſt parents, beyond ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, than I have that God is cruel or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and as little do I believe that any infant on earth comes into the world under a moral impoſſibility of conformity to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, ſo far as by any means whatever made manifeſt, which I call revealed. Man is here, upon practical principles: nothing is or can be a law to him, further than it is ſome way or other diſcovered; and that which ultimately aſſures and ſeals it to him as God's law, whatever outward manifeſtation may be made, is the Holy Spirit, that bears witneſs with his ſpirit, ſettling and ſatisfying his mind ſufficiently what is good, and what is evil. And I firmly believe, if children would be as ſtrictly and ſteadily conformable as they might be, to the divine will, ſo far as from time to time it is gradually opened and made known, (and there is always power with the opening) they would ſoon acquire a good degree of dominion, in the ſtrength of divine life, over the ſtrength of evil inclinations in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:032810_0021_0FF529F0376C3798"/>Our ſtate in this life is a ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. Such was the ſtate of man original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuch it is now. And in order that man at firſt, or ever after, might be able to conquer, or be juſtly puniſhable for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion or defeat, he was, is, and muſt be, armed with armour invincible againſt all the powers that were or are ſuffered to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail him. This is juſt our ground, our ſtate and ſituation. Subject to vanity, or to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and various temptations; yet being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly armed with the Spirit of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſo far as we ſtand faithful, and fight valiantly in the ſtrength afforded us, we are ſure of victory. Our ſtrength or help is only in God; but then it is near us, it is <hi>in us</hi>—a force ſuperior to all poſſible oppoſition—a force that never was nor can be foiled. We are free to ſtand in this unconquerable ability, and defeat the powers of darkneſs; or to turn from it, and be foiled and overcome. When we ſtand, we know it is God alone upholds us; and when we fall, we feel that our fall or deſtruction is of ourſelves.</p>
               <p>Many there are who put light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light; bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter. They call the divine light, <q>which lighteneth every man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John i. 9.</note> a natural light, an ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus, or by ſome other ignominious epithet; though the ſcripture declares it the very <hi>life</hi> of the holy <hi>word,</hi> that was in the <hi>beginning
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032810_0022_0FF52980C0350A20"/>
with God,</hi> and truly <hi>was God.</hi> There are many of them, who, under a notion of advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the true cauſe and doctrine of Chriſt, ſtrike violently againſt the very life of it; and will not allow that the <q>manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withal,</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xii. 7.</note> though the ſcriptures expreſsly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it, and experience confirms it to thoſe who rightly profit by the meaſure received. Many who have, from tradition and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for a ſeaſon believed the Holy Spirit, graciouſly vouchſafed them, was ſome very inferior thing to the true Spirit of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and moſt holy God, have at length, by yielding to its dictates, and taking it for their leader, grown wiſer than their teachers, and been indubitably inſtructed and aſſured that it was indeed the <hi>eternal Spirit,</hi> that, from their infantile days, ſtrove with them, for their reconciliation with God, the eternal ſource of it; as it did with the old world, for their recovery from their corrupted, alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ſtate.</p>
               <p>We find that when the earth was corrupt before God, and filled with violence; when <q>God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the earth,</q> Gen. vi. 11, 12; when <q>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth, and that every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually,</q> ver. 5; when <q>it repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032810_0023_0FF529FDC251DB58"/>
the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart,</q> 6: at that moſt totally abandoned and depraved period and ſtate of mankind, when God was juſt about extirpating from the face of the earth the whole wretched race of man, a few individuals excepted: at ſuch a ſeaſon as this, <q>the Lord ſaid, <hi>My Spirit</hi> ſhall not <hi>always ſtrive</hi> with man, ver. 3.</q> Surely if his <hi>Spirit</hi> had <hi>ſtriven</hi> with them until that time, until they were ſo deſperately wicked, and wholly corrupted, that not only ſome but every imagination of their hearts was evil, yea, <hi>only evil,</hi> and that <hi>continually;</hi> we may well believe the expreſs ſcripture aſſertion, that a <q>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If God's love is ſuch to men, that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them by the ſtrivings of his own Spirit, and ſpares them, until, by diſobedience they become abandoned and corrupted, what greater evidence can we deſire of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of his love, the long-ſuffering of his patience and impartial vouchſafement of his Holy Spirit, not to a few to the excluſion of the reſt, but to all mankind the world over. And what more than reaſoning confirms it to be ſo, is, the abſolute truth of the fact in the individual experience of all. It is true many deny it. The Jews alſo denied Chriſt to be the Son of God. They did not know who, and what he was; and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting query, 'Whom makeſt thou thy-ſelf?'<note n="*" place="bottom">John viii. 53.</note>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:032810_0024_0FF52991EFCF3E18"/>
was juſt as natural to proceed from them in their dark and carnal ſtate, as is the confidence wherewith thouſands, high in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of godlineſs, now utterly diſallow the Holy Spirit that is given to all, to be the Holy Spirit. But this conſolation have all Wiſdom's children, that 'Wiſdom <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke vii. 35.</note> is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of them <hi>all;'</hi> and that the unbelief of others can never make void their faith: they are taught of God, and great is their peace.</p>
               <p>In regard to my own early acquaintance with the Holy Spirit's operation, though I <hi>then</hi> knew not what it was. I have <hi>now</hi> no more doubt about it than I have about the exiſtence and omnipreſence of God. It is ſealed upon my heart, with as much clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and certainty, that it is the Spirit of the living God, and that it viſits, woos, invites, and ſtrives with all, at leaſt for a ſeaſon, as it is, that God is no reſpecter of perſons. And I as fully believe no man can have any clear knowledge of God, or of his own religious duty, without the Holy Spirit's influence, as I believe the wiſdom of this world is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God, and that the world by wiſdom know him not. Yea, ſo quick and powerful, ſo diſcerning the thoughts and intents of the heart; and ſo juſt and diſtinguiſhing, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and condemning them, according as they are good or bad, is this ſpirit, word, and witneſs in man; that not only <hi>without</hi>

the aid of human injunction or information; but in direct <hi>diſſent from,</hi> and diſapprobation of, the ſentiments, advice, and preſſing invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and perſuaſions of my play-mates, and thoſe much older than myſelf, and who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently and repeatedly declared to me, that ſuch and ſuch things were innocent, and not at all wicked, and that nobody thought them ſo but myſelf; the teſtimony of truth would and did ariſe and live in my heart when very young, through the ſhining of divine light or influence of the Holy Spirit; that thoſe things were evil, were wicked; and I thought, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all thoſe young perſons could ſay to the contrary, that all good people would think as I did—and believe they would be generally ſo accounted, if all men kept ſtrictly to the Holy Spirit's teachings. But violence being done to clear conviction in the mind, <hi>death</hi> takes place, as on Adam in the day he ate forbidden fruit. And in this ſtate of <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> is not ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from <hi>error,</hi> or <hi>good</hi> from <hi>evil,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tranſgreſſion. Evil habits gain ſtrength; darkneſs covers the mind; temptation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and though the Spirit again in ſome degree premoniſheth, and bids beware, the mind, habituated to the ſtifling of conviction, too commonly again ruſhes forward, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more and more hardened and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, until what was at firſt plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as evil, by the unflattering witneſs in the mind, is at length maintained to be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032810_0026_0FF52995384E3328"/>
innocent and ſinleſs. This is the too uſual courſe of poor mankind.</p>
               <p>Before I was ten years old, the workings of truth grew ſo powerful in my mind at times, that I took up ſeveral reſolutions (or at ſeveral times reſolved) to amend my ways, and live a ſerious and religious life, though I was not one of the moſt vicious of my years; yet enough ſo to be made very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord's controverſy with me, on account of the evil of my ways. My mind became exceedingly diſquieted, when I went contrary to divine manifeſtation; though I had not yet a clear ſenſe that it was the very Power and Spirit of God upon me that ſo condemned and diſtreſſed me for ſin, and ſtrove to redeem my ſoul from the bondage of corruption.</p>
               <p>I now began to take notice of what I heard read and converſed of reſpecting religion; and among other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I heard frequent mention in books and converſation of the Spirit of God; and that good people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times had it in them; and by it learned the will of God, and were enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. I perceived it was often ſpoken of in both the Old and New Teſtament, and many other writings. I underſtood that true converts in theſe days alſo have it. But, like many others, I overlooked its lively checks and calls in myſelf; had no idea that I had ever known any thing of it; longed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032810_0027_0FF529B048B6F8E8"/>
to be favoured with it; but ſuppoſed it was ſome extraordinary appearance, different far from any thing I ever yet had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
               <p>Thus the Jews, even while they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting Chriſt's coming, knew him not when he came. They overlooked and deſpiſed his mean and ordinary appearance; thought he was Joſeph's ſon and born among them, and ſo rejected, abuſed and finally put him to death. But they were miſtaken in his pedigree: his deſcent was from heaven; and <hi>God,</hi> not Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, was his father. Juſt ſo are thouſands now miſtaken, as to the dignity and origin of God's Spirit in them; they think it is of <hi>man,</hi> a part of his nature and being; whereas it is of the very life, power and ſubſtance of God. Its deſcent is as truly from heaven, as was that of the Lord Jeſus. He came in that <hi>low, mean</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> appearance as to outward ſhew and accommodations, teaching us thereby <hi>not to deſpiſe the day of ſmall things,</hi> nor overlook the littleneſs of the motions of divine life in our own ſouls. And when he compares the kingdom of Heaven, which he expreſsly ſays is <hi>within,</hi> to outward things, he very inſtructively inculcates to us, that the beginnings of it are <hi>ſmall,</hi> 'a little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'—'a little ſeed'—'a grain of muſtard ſeed'—'the leaſt of all ſeeds.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xiii. 31 32.</note>—This is true in the inward, whatever it be in the outward; for the ſeed of the kingdom is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032810_0028_0FF5298277703AF0"/>
'the leaſt of all the ſeeds' in the field or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the heart. Other ſeeds ſprout, ſpring up, and take the attention, while the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed, the word of God in the heart, is overlooked, trampled under and deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>O! that children and all people would be careful in their very early years, and as they grow up and advance in life, to mind the 'reproofs of inſtruction' in their own breaſts; they are known to be 'the way of life,'<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. vi. 23.</note> divine life to the ſoul. This <hi>ſomething,</hi> though they know not what it is, that checks them in ſecret for evil, both before and after they yield to the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, warning them beforehand not to touch or taſte, and afterwards condemning them if they do ſo; and inwardly inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to a life of religion and virtue— this is the very thing, dear young people, whereby God worketh in you, to will and to do; and by which he will, if you cleave to it, and work with it, enable you to work out your own ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling before him. Deſpiſe it not, do no violence to its motions; love it, cheriſh it, reverence it; hearken to its pleadings with you; give up without delay to its requirings, and obey its teachings. It is God's meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger for good to thy immortal ſoul: its voice in thy ſtreets is truly the voice of the living God: its call is a kind invitation to thee from the throne of grace. Hear it, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032810_0029_0FF529EA9D5E7690"/>
it will lead thee; obey it, and it will ſave thee: it will ſave thee from the power of ſin and Satan: it will finally lead thee to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible in the manſions of reſt, the houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>
               <p>I entreat you, as you love your own ſouls, and prize an everlaſting ſalvation; I warn you by the dreadful fruits of diſobedience, by the pangs, remorſe and ſufferings of my own ſoul for ſin and tranſgreſſion. Had I ſteadily obeyed the truth in my inward parts; had I attended ſingly and faithfully to this divine monitor, my portion had been peace; my cup, a cup of conſolation. I might have rejoiced and ſung, whereas I have had to mourn and weep. For as I grew to fifteen and upwards, in violation to clear inward convictions, in oppoſition to the dictates of the Holy Spirit, I began to run into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, learned to dance and play cards, and took great delight therein. I was often deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, and often ſtrove to ſtifle the witneſs, and perſuade myſelf there was no harm in any of theſe things.</p>
               <p>My father ſometimes reproved me in thoſe days for my conduct; but ſinning againſt divine light and viſitation, hardened me againſt his advice. I grew more and more vain, proud, airy and wanton. I put myſelf in the way of much evil communication; and it mournfully corrupted good manners.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032810_0030_0FF52A246736AE58"/>
My taſte for pleaſure and amuſement grew keen, my ſpirits were low and languid when alone, and I ruſhed into company and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for alleviation.</p>
               <p>Thus I went on frolicking and gaming, and ſpending my precious time in vanity. Often at night, or in the night, and ſometimes near break of day, I have returned home from my merry meetings grievouſly condemned, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed and aſhamed; wiſhing I had not gone into ſuch company, and reſolving to do ſo no more; but ſoon my reſolutions failed me, and away I went again and again, and thus continued making ſtill greater ſtrides in folly than before. The Lord followed me cloſe, in mercy, and often brake in powerfully upon me, turning all my mirth into mourning; yet I ſtill got over the holy witneſs, did deſpite to the ſpirit of grace, and repaired again to my haunts of diverſion and merriment. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when I have ſtood upon the floor to dance, with a partner by the hand, before all were quite ready, God has ariſen in judgment, and ſmitten me to the very heart.—Oh! I ſtill feelingly remember his appearance within me, when none knew the agony of my ſoul. I felt ready to ſink under the weight of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and anguiſh; but reſolutely muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering all the ſtoutneſs I was maſter of, I bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened it out, until the muſick called me to the dance, and then I ſoon drowned the voice of conviction, became merry, and carouſed among my companions in diſſipation, until
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032810_0031_0FF52986AC703880"/>
time urged a diſmiſſion of our jovial aſſembly, and called me to return, often lonely, to my father's houſe, my outward habitation. Oh! me, how fared it with me then? I aſſure thee, reader, I have not forgotten thoſe ſad and mournful walks at the concluſion of my mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night revellings. I have been broken down in deep abaſement and ſelf-abhorrence; have come to a full ſtand, ſtopped and ſat down on a ſtump, ſtone or log, by the way; wrung my hands, ſtrewed my tears before the Lord, in ſorrow and extremity of anguiſh, bordering almoſt on deſperation. I have begged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs; implored aſſiſtance; vowed amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; obtained ſome relief; and returned home in hope of reformation. But alas, alas.! my reſolutions were written as it were in ſand; the power of habit had enſlaved me; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the next invitation of my aſſociates, overcame all my engagements; the eagerneſs of deſires for divertiſements and paſtime, brake through all the ſanctions of vows; and violated the ſolemnity of ſacred promiſes to my God. I ruſhed again into tranſgreſſion, as an horſe ruſhes into the battle; again and again I took my ſwing, and drank my fill; and again and again remorſe and compunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeized upon me. Adored for ever be the name of the Lord, he forſook me not; but followed me ſtill cloſer and cloſer, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the alarm louder and louder in mine ears. There was in me an immortal part, which his love was towards; the recovery of which, from the thraldom of ſin and corruption, his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032810_0032_0FF529A729DCA4F0"/>
goodneſs engaged him to ſeek by mercy and by judgment; frowns and ſmiles; chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and endearments; and all in love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible.</p>
               <p>Thus dealt he with me. When I turned at his reproofs, he ſmiled upon me, and relieved my ſoul's anxiety; but when I again revolted, his rod was lifted up in fatherly correction. The ſtill ſmall voice was uttered in my dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in the cool of the day, when a little retired from noiſe and commotion, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> There was no hiding from him, whoſe penetrating eye no ſecret can eſcape; and whoſe aim in reproving was only to ſave. He ſtill reproved my wanderings, and pointed out the right way, according to ſcripture declaration, <q>thou ſhalt hear a voice behind thee, ſaying, this is the way, walk in it.</q> Indeed the way was ſhewn me; it was often plainly caſt up before me; but I would not walk in it. I knew my Lord's will, but did it not; mine <hi>own,</hi> I ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the indulgence of. O! that others may eſcape my load of guilt, and may I ſay, my bed of hell, or inward tormenting agony, by a timely ſubmiſſion to the reproofs of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I ſpent near all the firſt day of the week, when I ſhould have been at meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in playing cards, idle, if not diſſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and other vain amuſements; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home at night in condemnation, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032810_0033_0FF529CB53552860"/>
ſometimes ſighing and crying, and yet thro' all this the Lord preſerved me from hard drinking, though often in the way of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſolicitation to it. Swearing I alſo moſtly refrained from. Jeſting, joking and vain converſation I went conſiderable lengths in; and ſometimes joined the foremoſt in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and obſcene diſcourſes. Then again great ſhame and ſelf-abhorrence would overwhelm me; again I vowed, promiſed and renewed my covenant; but all in vain; I had not got deep enough; nor were my covenants made or renewed in the right ability; but too much in my own ſtrength and creaturely reſolutions; ſo they were ſoon broken. Sometimes I held out a week or two; other times only a day or two. Thus time paſſed on; and, with an increaſe of years, I found an increaſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to wantonneſs and diſſipation. But bleſſed be the God of my ſalvation, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionately increaſed my ſenſe of guilt and condemnation.</p>
               <p>I had ſeaſons of very ſerious conſideration upon religion. What inſtructions I had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly received, were moſtly in the way of Friends; but when I came near to man's eſtate, falling in company with ſome of the Baptiſt ſociety, I was drawn to attend their meetings in Providence. Friends meetings were oftener held in ſilence than ſuited my itching ear. I loved to hear words, began to grow inquiſitive, and to ſearch pretty deeply into doctrines and tenets of religion; and the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032810_0034_0FF529C9476DCF48"/>
Baptiſt preachers filled my ears with words, and my head with arguments and diſtinctions; but my heart was little or not at all improved by them. I almoſt forſook the meetings of Friends, except yearly meetings, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings appointed by travellers in the ſervice of the goſpel. But when I went to theſe, O! how livingly I ſtill remember the heavenly and heart-tendering impreſſions I ſometimes received under the animating teſtimonies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the life of the goſpel. Here my <hi>heart</hi> was helped, though my <hi>head</hi> was leſs amuſed than among the Baptiſts: however, as I knew not clearly what cauſed the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as Friends meetings remained ſtill often ſilent; and as I ſtill wiſhed the gratification of argumentative, ſyſtematic diſcourſes; I ſtill pretty diligently attended the Baptiſt meeting; and, in my moſt religious ſeaſons, I began to think of being baptized in water. For the head-work ſo far outrun the heart-work, during my attendance of theſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that I became convinced in ſpeculation, that that outward performance was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt; though I have ſince ſeen, that it never was ordained by Jeſus; but was a forerunning, preparatory and decreaſing inſtitution, and has long ſince done its office, and ceaſed in the church in point of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that there is now to the true church but one Lord, one faith, and one baptiſm, that of the Holy Ghoſt, which only can purify and make clean the inſide. Oh! my heart, my very ſoul is fully ſatisfied in this matter;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032810_0035_0FF52A00F8DF0178"/>
having felt the living efficacy of this one ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptiſm, and known its full ſufficiency, without any other.</p>
               <p>What firſt turned my mind to believe the outward a chriſtian ordinance was this one argument of the Baptiſts—<q>Chriſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſciples to baptize: No man can baptize with the Holy Ghoſt; therefore the baptiſm he commanded was not that of the Holy Ghoſt, but that of water.</q> This then appeared to me concluſive, and unanſwerable. But it was my ignorance of that baptizing power which attends all true goſpel miniſtry, that made me aſſent to this falſe poſition, 'no man can baptize with the Holy Ghoſt.' Man himſelf, in his own mere ability, I know can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; but I alſo know, that of himſelf he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preach the goſpel. This aſſertion, no man can preach the goſpel, is juſt as true as that 'no man can baptize with the Holy Ghoſt.' As man merely, he can do nothing at all of either; but it ſtill ſtands true, man can, through divine aſſiſtance, do both. The real goſpel was never yet preached, but 'with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven.'<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 12.</note> Thus the apoſtles preached it, and thus alone it is ſtill preached—and ſo preaching it, it was a baptizing miniſtry. As they ſpake, the Holy Ghoſt fell on them that heard them; that is, where faith wrought in the hearts of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the living eternal word preached, through the power of the Holy Ghoſt, was
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032810_0036_0FF529A1E5D78FA0"/>
mixed with faith in them that heard it; the Holy Ghoſt fell on them, baptizing them into a living ſoul-ſaving ſenſe of the 'power of God to ſalvation,'<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. i. 16.</note> which is the true life of the goſpel. Thus the apoſtles fulfilled the commiſſion. They taught baptizingly. The commiſſion is not 'teach, and then baptize,' as two ſeparate acts. It is 'teach, baptizing,' —and thoſe who livingly witneſs the <hi>goſpel,</hi> the power of God to ſalvation, preached unto them, they feel it, and receive it in, and only in <q>the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven, they are taught baptizingly, in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit and of power.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 4.</note> And no preaching has a whit more of the goſpel in it, than it has of the Holy Ghoſt, the alone true baptizing power. I don't marvel that the letter-learned teachers of our day who run un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who are <hi>always ready,</hi> are ignorant that a true goſpel miniſter is clothed with baptizing authority from on high.—I may not now go much further into the diſcuſſion of the ſubject of baptiſm, though I ſcarce know how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs it, ſo many things occur in evidence that there is and can be but <hi>one</hi> in the goſpel, and that this is and muſt be ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>I had not yet fully given up to the motions of divine life in my own heart. My mind was too much turned outward; and the preaching of thoſe I ſometimes went to hear, who preached in their own time, had a powerful tendency to keep it outward. In this ſtate of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032810_0037_0FF52B23F5CCB098"/>
outward attention and inquiry, I found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could give me power over ſin and corruption; but notwithſtanding all my ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughtfulneſs, and frequent and ardent deſires to become truly religious, I ſtill, once in a while, brake looſe, and launched forth into as great degrees of vanity and wickedneſs as ever: and then again a turn of ſeriouſneſs would come over me. One time under deep exerciſe, after reaſoning and heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating great part of a day, whether I had beſt give up with full purpoſe of heart, to lead a religious life or not; at length I gave up, and entered once more into ſolemn covenant, to ſerve God, and deny myſelf, according to the beſt of my underſtanding. Almoſt as ſoon as I had thus given up, and come to this good concluſion, in ſtepped the grand adverſary, and blundered and diſtreſſed my mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly with the doctrine of predeſtination; powerfully inſinuating that a certain number were infallibly ordained to eternal ſalvation, the reſt to inevitable deſtruction; and that not all the religious exerciſes of my mind could poſſibly make any alteration in my final deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination and allotment. If God had damned me from all eternity, I muſt be damned for ever; if he had choſen me to eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I might ſet my heart at reſt, and live juſt ſuch a life as would moſt gratify my natural inclinations; for what advantage could there be in religion, and ſelf-denial, if an eternal, unalterable decree ſecured my final end. I felt willing to hope I was a choſen veſſel; and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032810_0038_0FF52A0295898108"/>
for a ſhort time theſe ideas ſo crouded into my mind, that I was even ready to conclude a God all goodneſs had doomed the far greater part of mankind to never-ending miſery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any provocation on their part. I now view the doctrine of unconditional election to eternal life, and reprobation to eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, with abhorrence. I almoſt marvel, that under a cloud of darkneſs, my rational faculties could ever be ſo impoſed upon, as to aſſent to ſo erroneous a ſentiment. I know of no doctrine in the world that more ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly reflects on the character of the Deity.</p>
               <p>I did not indeed ſo drink down this falſe doctrine as to relinquiſh my purpoſe of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all at once; I held out a few weeks; when, mournful to relate, the influence of young company, and my vehement deſires for creaturely indulgence, through the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating influence of the aforeſaid inſinuations, brake through all my moſt ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, threw down the walls and fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and expoſed me an eaſy prey to the grand enemy of my ſoul's ſalvation. Again I took my ſwing in vanity, amuſements and diſſipation. This, however, was but a ſhort race. The Lord, in loving kindneſs, followed me with his judgments, inwardly revealed againſt ſin. The prince of darkneſs alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me, with temptation upon temptation to evil; and with various ſubtil inſinuations, and dark notions to rid me of all fear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or tenderneſs of conſcience. At length,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032810_0039_0FF52B366AA991E0"/>
notwithſtanding all I had felt of the power of God upon me, in reproof for ſin, and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to holineſs; yea, though I had had ſome true reliſh of divine good, the holy witneſs became ſo ſtifled, that I began to conclude there was <hi>no God;</hi> that all things came by chance, by nature, by the fortuitous jumble and concourſe of atoms, without any deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe, or intelligent arrangement; that it was idle, chimerical and deluſive, to think of ſerving or fearing a being who had no exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but in imagination.—Here let it be well conſidered what a powerful influence the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of one falſe doctrine, and the violation of divine manifeſtation and conviction, has in paving the way for other falſe doctrines. Not much ſooner had I received and cheriſhed one of the grand falſehoods of the father of lies, the doctrine of irreſiſtible neceſſity, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, than in the miſts of darkneſs which ſpread over my mind, under the bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence thereof, I even dared to deny the eternal deity; and, horrible to the laſt degree to think of, I began to rejoice in the idea of unbounded, unreſtrained licentiouſneſs and carnality; and that I was unaccountable for my conduct, not conſidering that, on my atheiſtical ſcheme, I was unprotected, and had no more to hope than to fear; none to look up to for defence and ſuccour; but muſt be left a prey to violence, and all kinds of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity attendant on this life.</p>

as well as of underſtanding, which I was plunged into!

Many a night I ſcarce durſt enter my chamber, or lay me down in bed.—I have the moſt unſhaken ground to believe it was the immediate power of God upon me, that thus terrified my guilty ſoul; and that in the moſt fatherly goodneſs, condeſcenſion and mercy, in order to prevent my going on to endleſs perdition, to which I ſeemed to be ſwiftly poſting.—Day after day, and night after night, I was diſtreſſed!—the Lord ſetting my ſins in order before me, and pleading with me to return unto him and live. At laſt I fled again to religious engagement for relief, betook myſelf to prayer, and cried to the Lord, in the bitterneſs of my ſpirit. Sometimes I begged and interceded for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and power to make a ſtand and overcome ſin, with ſuch vehemency as if my very heart would break!—Tears guſhed from my eyes! My ſoul was overwhelmed with anguiſh!

Once more a ſenſe of juſt and holy indignation kindled up in my breaſt for tranſgreſſion and grievous revolt. Awfulneſs took hold on me; amazement ſwallowed me up. I knew not which way to turn. The wrath of an offended long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God ſeemed cloſing upon me on every ſide.—I felt myſelf in thraldom, and almoſt without hope. I knew myſelf a priſoner, and yet I hugged my chains.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1770.</note>THUS I continued ſtill in vanity, and folly, with intervals of deep diſtreſs and mourning, a ſhort ſpace longer, that is, until about nineteen years old, when I became more fully and clearly convinced, and that very much by the immediate opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, illuminations, and openings of divine light in my own mind, that this inward ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which had been thus long and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtriving with me, diſturbing my every falſe reſt, confuting every falſe and ſin-flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imagination of fleſh and blood, or of the grand adverſary, and enjoining it upon me to give up all, and walk in the ways of virtue and true ſelf-denial, was the true and living ſpirit and power of the eternal God; the very ſame that ſtrove with the old world, influenced the patriarchs, prophets and apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; and viſits, ſtrives with, and at ſeaſons more or leſs influences, the hearts of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. I now ſaw this the only principle of all true converſion and ſalvation; that ſo long as this was reſiſted and rejected, ſeparation muſt infallibly remain between God and the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032810_0043_0FF52B3EF6072188"/>
ſoul; but that, whenever this is received and in all things thoroughly ſubmitted to, a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough reconciliation takes place.</p>
               <p>Some may think this doctrine robs Chriſt of the honour of our redemption and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; but I apprehend none can think ſo who underſtand the doctrine of ſalvation by Jeſus. It was through the eternal Spirit, this very Spirit that viſits and ſtrives with all, that Chriſt offered up that prepared body. It is through, and only through, the influence of the ſame Holy Spirit, that any ſoul was ever converted to God, or ſavingly benefited by the redemption that is in Jeſus. Whatever way, O ſoul, or by whatever means thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited in a ſpiritual ſenſe, it is by this Holy Spirit, that is the immediate operative power and principle within thee.</p>
               <p>Having thus at length become livingly convinced that it was nothing ſhort of the eternal Power and Spirit of God that ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly wrought in me, in order for my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the power of darkneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, I gave up to the holy requirings of God, as inwardly made known to me—and clearly known were many things thus made. Nothing elſe could ever ſo have opened my mind, and made known my duty to me. The Scriptures, other good books, religious converſation, contemplation upon the works of creation and providence; all theſe are very good means of information; but none
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032810_0044_0FF529D984C64270"/>
of them, nor even all of them, without the Holy Spirit's ſealing operation and evidence upon the mind, can ever make a man ſure of his duty to God in any one thing. He may reaſon, and ſet up many rules, meaſures and ſtandards of duty and morality; but certainly he never will arrive thereat, without the help of that which in itſelf is certain. It may be ſaid the ſcriptures are certain. Very well, but what certifies thee that they are certain, or that thou knoweſt their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Do not the profeſſed maſters in reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing widely differ upon many paſſages in the ſacred writings? they all ſay they have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on their ſide. But believe them not: nor believe that any thing is or can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known to man of the divine authority of the ſcriptures, without the light and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>But to proceed:—I gave up very fully to ſerve the Lord in the way of his leadings; I forſook rude and vicious company, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew into retirement, attended the meetings of Friends, and often ſought the Lord, and waited upon him, in ſolemn, reverential ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence alone, for his counſel, direction and preſervation; and he was graciouſly pleaſed to point out and caſt up the way for me, one thing after another, with ſufficiency of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Firſt, he ſhewed me <hi>negatively,</hi> what I ought not to do, in various particulars, breaking me off from my vicious practices and aſſociations. This was <hi>forſaking evil.</hi> And
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032810_0045_0FF52AC481A87FE0"/>
then he taught and enjoined me the practice of ſeveral things <hi>poſitively,</hi> wherein he engaged me to chooſe and cleave unto that which is good. I ſaw clearly it was his will, and my indiſpenſible duty reverently to aſſemble for divine worſhip, and therein to <hi>wait</hi> upon him, draw inwardly near unto him, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the apoſtle's language, <hi>feel after him,</hi> in order to find and enjoy him. I alſo found it my duty often to wait upon him alone, in awful, ſilent retirement, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him in ſupplication, but when he influenced my heart thereto, with the true ſpirit of prayer and interceſſion. He alſo ſhewed me, that religion was an internal life in the ſoul; that great attention, ſincerity and punctuality was neceſſary to the growth and proſperity of it: that I muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with attending meetings, and ſitting in ſilence, though ever ſo reverently and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; I muſt live continually in an inward watchfulneſs and dedication of heart; watch all my thoughts, words and actions, and know all brought to judgment; and allow nothing to paſs unexamined, nor willingly unapproved: that I muſt obſerve the moſt upright honeſty and ſincerity in my dealings among men as in the preſence of God. He taught me that men generally rely too much on external performances; and thus guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my mind againſt thinking too much of any thing outward. He opened my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to behold my duty, in regard to outward plainneſs; that a plain, decent, and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032810_0046_0FF52B0C96CF5330"/>
not coſtly dreſs and way of living, in all things, was moſt agreeable to true chriſtian gravity and ſelf-denial: that rich, ſhowy or gaudy dreſs, houſe, food or furniture, fed and foſtered pride and oſtentation; robbed the poor, pleaſed the vain, and led into a great deal of unneceſſary care, toil and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, to obtain the means of this way of life and appearance: that it could not afford any true and ſolid ſatisfaction; but muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably divert the mind from inward feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watchfulneſs; retard the work of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and true ſelf-denial; and facilitate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable aſſociation and acquaintance with ſuch as would rather alienate the affections from God, than unite the ſoul to him.</p>
               <p>Thus inſtructed, I bowed in reverence; and as it became from time to time neceſſary to procure new clothing, I endeavoured to conform my outward appearance in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the dictates of truth, in which I found true peace and ſatisfaction. Alſo he inſtructed me to uſe the plain ſcripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, THOU to one, and YOU to more than one. The croſs greatly offended me in regard to theſe things. This of language in particular, looked ſo trifling and fooliſh to the worldly wiſe part in me, and the fear of 'the world's dread laugh,' ſo powerfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, that it was very hard and trying to my natural will to give up to this duty. I thought if my right hand would excuſe my compliance, I would gladly ſacrifice it, or
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032810_0047_0FF52A9BAC809400"/>
yield it up, rather than give up to uſe ſuch a deſpiſed language, and ſubmit to be laughed at, as viewing religion concerned in ſuch things as theſe. This may ſeem incredible to ſome, but it is true, and as freſh with me as almoſt any paſt exerciſe. This exerciſe beſet me day and night for ſome time, during which I had many ſorrowful and bitter tears, plead many excuſes, and greatly wiſhed ſome ſubſtitute might be accepted inſtead of the thing called for; but he who called me into the performance of theſe fooliſh things, (to this world's wiſdom) was graciouſly pleaſed to ſhew me with indubitable clearneſs, that he would chooſe his ſacrifice himſelf; and that neither a right hand nor a right eye, neither thouſands of rams, nor ten thouſands of rivers of oil, would by any means anſwer inſtead of his requirings. If he called for ſo weak or fooliſh a thing as the words <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi> to a ſingle perſon, inſtead of <hi>you,</hi> nothing elſe of my ſubſtituting would do inſtead of it; for <q>the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 25.</note> Let none diſpute the ground with Omnipotence, nor confer with fleſh and blood; leſt therein, <hi>deſpiſing the day of ſmall things,</hi> they <hi>fall by little and little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For be aſſured, O! thou <hi>called</hi> of the Lord, thou canſt never become his <hi>choſen,</hi> unleſs thou obey his <hi>call,</hi> and come out of all he calls thee from. If thou art not <hi>faithful in the little,</hi> thou wilt not be made <hi>ruler over
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032810_0048_0FF52AB1A8C3F190"/>
much.</hi> Perhaps few will believe the fulneſs of heavenly joy which ſprang in my boſom, as a well-ſpring of living waters, after my giving up in faithfulneſs to this requiſition. And yet this flow of divine conſolation laſted not long at this time; for though I gave up to whatever the Lord required of me, yet as I had ſo long and ſo ſtubbornly rebelled againſt him, he ſaw meet, in his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſoon to hide his face from me again, and cloſe me up in almoſt utter darkneſs, which rendered my days truly tedious, and my nights weariſome to my ſoul. I was fully convinced that God was to be known inwardly in power and great glory, by thoſe who obey him, and wait upon him. My heart was inflamed with love towards him. I had ſeen a little of his comelineſs—He had become the beloved of my ſoul, the chiefeſt among ten thouſands; therefore I often retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone and in profound reverential ſilence, ſought after him, and preſſingly ſolicited a nearer acquaintance with him. But he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was beſt for me, graciouſly hid his preſence from me. And though this was a painful ſuſpenſion, yet I could not be eaſy to give over ſeeking him; I ſtill continued my ardent ſilent approaches, or waitings. I wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed, with all the reverence, humility, and ſolicitude that my ſoul was capable of; but all ſeemed in vain. Oh! the mourning and lamentation, the diſtreſs and bitter weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that almoſt continually overwhelmed me for ſeveral months together, for the want
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032810_0049_0FF52A652890EB10"/>
of the ſoul-enlivening preſence of my God. Oh! ſaid I in my heart, will he never ariſe for my help and deliverance? Well, be it as it may, I will ſeek him until my dying day; my ſoul cannot live without him; and it may be, if he hide his face from me until my laſt moments, he may own me at that ſolemn pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and receive me to a manſion of glory. This was often, very often, the language of my heart; and under this reſolution I preſſed forward. I truſt the wormwood and the gall; the ſorrow and the ſighing; the days and nights of anguiſh; will ſcarcely be forgotten. It ſeems to me that certain ſpots of earth, ſome particular fields and groves, will ever, while life and ſenſibility remain, continue to have a moving and affecting influence on my mind, as often as I paſs by and ſee them, or call them to remembrance. I think they muſt remain peculiarly diſtinguiſhed to me by the tears and the groans, the ſighs and ſolicitations, which they have been the ſilent witneſſes of.</p>
               <p>Oh! my God, thou leddeſt me through the deſert, thou weanedſt me from the world, and alluredſt me into the wilderneſs; there thou didſt hide thy face from me for a ſeaſon; until the longings of my ſoul after thee, were intenſely kindled: then liftedſt thou up my head, and ſpake comfortably to me; bleſſed be thy holy name for ever!</p>
               <p>At length the Father of mercies having
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032810_0050_0FF52A9D539DC638"/>
thus tried me, he graciouſly caſt an eye of compaſſion upon me, hearkened to the voice of my diſtreſs, made bare his everlaſting Arm for my deliverance, gradually unvailed his preſence to me, and opened my heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand why he led me through ſo trying a diſpenſation. I now began to diſcern the myſtery of what I read in the hiſtory of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael's forty years travel in the wilderneſs, as alſo the voice of one crying in the wilderneſs: I began to ſee the neceſſity of the Lord's ſending his forerunner, that the way might be prepared, and the paths made ſtraight. I perceived much roughneſs, unevenneſs and crookedneſs had been in the way. I began to know and in degree to love the rod, and him who had appointed it; and as the Maſter manifeſted himſelf more and more, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood more and more of the myſterious ways of his working.</p>
               <p>After ſome time I had many clear open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings reſpecting the many trials, experiences, jeopardies and deliverances of his followers in days paſt; and a hope was kindled in me, that now I ſhould go forward without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch beſetments, and withdrawings of light, as heretofore: for though the Lord ſtill at times withdrew from me; yet as his return was not long after, and as his preſence was much more conſtantly with me, I was ready to conclude it would continue with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing brightneſs, until I ſhould be wholly and continually ſwallowed up in his love:
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032810_0051_0FF52ADF4150C2F0"/>
for, as ſuch a ſtate was ſometimes permitted me, I not clearly underſtanding the counſel of his divine will, was apt to wiſh it for my conſtant condition; not then ſeeing, as I have ſince ſeen, that it was far from being beſt for me to enjoy a conſtancy of ſunſhine and fair weather; even the outward order and econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of divine providence affords inſtruction, which often beautifully applies to our inward experiences. It is not all calm and ſunſhine; the divine wiſdom orders many and great viciſſitudes and changes in the natural world; inſomuch that, perhaps in the moſt pleaſant and flouriſhing ſeaſon in the whole year, after a few days of clear ſhining and tranquillity, there ariſes a moſt terrible ſtorm, with wind, lightening and tremendous thunder; and it may be with hailſtones ſcattered abroad upon the face of the earth. At other times will high and ruſhing winds ſucceed the calmeſt day; or pinching droughts the moſt fruitful ſeaſon. Even the ſettled order and ſucceſſion of ſeaſons is a continual revolution of day and night, ſummer and winter, ſeed-time and harveſt. We have cold as well as heat; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as light; and cutting froſts as well as moſt refreſhing dews; and a variety of other changes. All this is in infinite wiſdom and goodneſs; and diſplays to the diſcerning eye the providential power and glory of the great Superintendent. My ſoul hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been enraptured whilſt I have viewed and contemplated the operations of his hand in theſe things; together with the ſituation
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032810_0052_0FF52AE0E2803EB0"/>
of places; rocks and lofty mountains, ſturdy oaks and tall cedars; rivers, lakes and oceans; meadows, fields and foreſts; deſerts and vaſt howling wilderneſſes; with the various inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of both land and water. And over and above all theſe, the ſun, moon and ſtars in their courſes; and conſtellations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! All theſe things (though far ſhort of being ſufficient food for immortal ſouls, and perhaps not beſt to dwell much upon) have nevertheleſs animatingly affected my mind in the contemplation of them; and raiſed my ſoul in adoration to him who is the former of all things; and who, when he was pleaſed to anſwer out of the whirlwind and awfully to interrogate his ſervant Job, for his inſtruction, was pleaſed to make the wonderful works of his hand, and the excellent order of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the ſubjects of his demands. And who among the ſons of men can read the ſolemn queries then uttered by the Divine Majeſty, and not feel ſome tender emotions of ſoul; as <q>Haſt thou commanded the morning ſince thy days, and cauſed the day-ſpring to know his place?</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Job xxxviii. 12.</note> is one among the many ſolemn and ſublime interrogatives, by the wiſdom of an all-knowing God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of his ſervant; ſufficiently declaring, beyond all heſitation, how infinitely exalted above all human comprehenſion, he is in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power and glory; as well as amply ſetting forth his goodneſs to the ſons of men, in cauſing the regular returns of day and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032810_0053_0FF52AF738DE0778"/>
night, and other wonderful ſucceſſions and revolutions, for the benefit and comfort of his dependant creatures. Bow, O my ſoul, adore and worſhip the God of thy life, who is the length of thy days and thy portion for ever. His works are wonderous, paſt finding out, marvellous, and beyond thy comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Thou ſeeſt in part the multitude and magnitude of his wonderful works; thou beholdeſt a ſmall part of the changes and viciſſitudes attending them: and yet through all, what excellent order, harmony and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity is preſerved. Surely nothing leſs than his Omnipotence and Omniſcience could poſſibly effect or produce all this. Thou ſeeſt he is faithful in performing his ancient gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe. Day and night, ſeed-time and harveſt, &amp;c. fail not. <q>He ſaid not unto the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek ye my face in vain.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xlv. 19.</note> Nay verily; the language of his compaſſionate regard on the contrary, is, Fear not, worm Jacob, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee: when thou goeſt through the water, it ſhall not overwhelm thee; or when through the fire, it ſhall not kindle upon thee. It is as much in wiſdom and goodneſs that he ſometimes as it were withdraws, hides from and leaves his children, and then again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns gloriouſly for their unſpeakable conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is the ſucceſſion of darkneſs and light, cold and warm ſeaſons, in the outward.</p>
               <p>Many and varied afflictions are neceſſary to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032810_0054_0FF52B0960E2B768"/>
our refinement. Hence the place of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement is called, 'the furnace of affliction.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xlviii. 10.</note> Through the purifying operations of theſe fiery trials, the ſoul is gradually redeemed from the pit of pollution. It is a precious work of divine power, to hide pride from man. And he who becomes thoroughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the corruptions of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in its alienation from God, will find, if ever true humiliation and renovation is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, that nothing ſhort of the baptiſm of fire can rightly cleanſe the corrupt, and humble the proud heart of fallen man. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a ſealed truth, that they who are without chaſtiſement are baſtards, and not ſons. All that the Father loveth, he chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and ſcourgeth every one that he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. My ſoul rejoiceth and giveth God thanks, for deep probations and withdrawings of his preſence; as well as for the ſenſible incomes of his love, and ariſings of the light of his countenance upon me. I ſee and own it needful to my growth in the divine life, as well as in order to my complete emancipation from the ſervitude of ſin, that he ſhould deal thus with me: and it has afforded inſtruction to my mind, that he is called in ſcripture by the name of <q>the Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai. viii. 17.</note> Oh! what pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſoul, what anxious ſolicitude for his return, takes place in all the true travellers, when he vails his holy preſence; and how joyful is the lifting up of his countenance,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032810_0055_0FF52AE27B5E22A8"/>
after theſe ſeaſons, upon the drooping mind, thus prepared for the comfortable returns thereof. It is like the returns of clear ſhining after rain. Under the refining hand of God's power, whereby he thus humbled and abaſed my ſoul, I was given clearly to ſee the need I ſhould have of this excellent qualification, <hi>humility,</hi> in my further progreſs in religious life. I ſaw pretty clearly, in the midſt of my deepeſt depreſſion, that if I ſhould be favoured with unremitted tranquillity and divine enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhould be in danger of ſpiritual pride and exaltation. Bleſſed be the name of the Lord for this among his many other favours, that he taught me the neceſſity of humility, and forewarned, and therein forearmed me againſt the wiles of Satan, which I afterwards became more fully acquainted with. Oh! with what ardency of deſire did my prayers aſcend before him, that he would rebuke the proud luciferian ſpirit, and appoint my dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the low valley, where the graſs is green, and where the fragrant flowers give forth a pleaſant ſmell. I ſaw that on the lofty moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains often reigns barrenneſs and deſolation. My mind was almoſt conſtantly impreſſed in thoſe days with the love and deſire of deep humility. I ſaw ſomething of its real beauty; and craved it as one of the greateſt bleſſings. O! ſaid I, that I may put it on as a garment, and wear it for ever: yea even appear in it before my Judge, in the aſſembly of ſaints and angels in a future ſtate. <q>Oh! Lord, my God, (was then my language, and my heart
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032810_0056_0FF52A275154DBF0"/>
now joins it) ſuffer me never to forget my tribulations, nor to ceaſe my ſupplications to thee, for the continuance of this precious bleſſing, let it be the firſt and the laſt in the catalogue of my requeſts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the great Leader of Iſrael led me on from ſtep to ſtep, not by any means through a conſtant and uninterrupted enjoyment of his preſence; but which for me has been far better, by frequent withdrawings, ſtrippings, and deep-felt emptineſs, poverty and want; and that again and again repeated, even after large overflowings of his love in my ſoul, as a river overflowing all its banks. Had he not, after ſuch ſeaſons of rejoicing, vailed his preſence, and clothed my ſoul with mourning, I might, like ancient Iſrael, have <q>ſang his praiſe, and ſoon forgot his works.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. cvi. 12 13.</note> But now through the many tribulations, and wiſe turnings of his holy hand upon me, my ſoul remains bowed, and to this day ſenſible of the tendering impreſſions of his love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſavour of life is ſtill freſh within me. He has led me about and inſtructed me, and (with reverence I ſpeak it) hath kept and preſerved me. May I ſtill be preſerved, and henceforth for ever kept ſafe under his all-powerful protection; walking worthy of the ſame to the end of my days. Amen.</p>
               <p>During a great part of the foregoing exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, I had frequent openings, and lively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects reſpecting the chriſtian warfare, and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032810_0057_0FF52AC8CC045310"/>
the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven. I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten believed, in the openings of divine light, that, if I ſtood faithful, it would be required of me to declare to others what the Lord had done for me, and given me an underſtanding of, and to entreat my fellow-creatures to ſeek an habitation in that kingdom that cannot be ſhaken or fade away.—This concern began now to grow upon me conſiderably, even to that degree, that I felt at times in meetings a living engagement to communicate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the people; but, fearing I ſhould begin in that great work before the right time, I kept back; and even divers times, when I was almoſt ready to ſtand up, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded I would keep ſilence this once more; conſidering within myſelf, that if my ſo doing ſhould be diſpleaſing to the Lord, he would manifeſt his diſpleaſure to me; but if I ſhould preſume to ſpeak a word in his name, and it ſhould prove to be without his holy requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or too ſoon, I ſhould not only diſpleaſe him, but alſo burden his people; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps get into and become entangled in a way of ſpeaking from too ſmall motions or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions felt, or mournfully miſtake the ſparks of my own kindling for divine impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; which might, in conſequence of my giving way thereunto, be ſuffered to increaſe upon me to my great loſs in the ſubſtantial and divine life, if not to my utter ruin. In this guarded frame of mind I paſſed on for ſome time, often ſeeking to the Lord for counſel and direction in this and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns

of importance. And though I believe I might have publickly borne teſtimony in the name, power and approbation of the Lord, rather ſooner than I did; yet as I was not obſtinately, but carefully backward, I ſeldom felt much condemnation for withholding: however, I did a few times find ſome real uneaſineſs on that account.—But he who laid the concern upon me, well knowing the integrity of my heart, and that I was bent faithfully to ſerve him, without going too faſt, or yet tarrying behind my guide, dealt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly with me, paſſed by my little withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, favoured with freſh and increaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his love, and from time to time, caſt up my way with ſtill greater clearneſs; and at length in a manner ſo clear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, as eraſed doubt and heſitation from my mind. In the freſh authority whereof I uttered a few words in our meeting at Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, on the firſt day of the week, and 10th of the 4th month 1774, to my own and I believe my friends ſatisfaction. I felt the returns of peace in my own boſom, as a river of life, for a conſiderable time afterwards, ſweetly comforting my mind, and confirming me in this ſolemn undertaking.</p>
               <p>After ſome time of heavenly rejoicing, I began again to be tried with various exerciſes and conflicts of mind, though ſtill frequently favoured with the flowings of divine love, in a very comfortable and ſoul-ſatisfying man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. At divers times I had lively impreſſions
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032810_0059_0FF52B54D5A415B8"/>
to ſay a few words more, in publick teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but ſtill waited to be well aſſured. The unſpeakable conſolation which I found, on my firſt uttering a few words, and that after a conſiderable time of rather holding back, than haſty procedure, had fully confirmed me that there is greater ſafety in turning the fleece, and well proving it, both wet and dry, than in ruſhing forward in the firſt operations or openings. The beaſts, allowed in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, were to chew the cud and divide the hoof. Chewing the cud is a deliberate act: they chew and ſwallow, and chew and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low again. The diviſion of the hoof being on the <hi>ſtepping</hi> member, ſhews the danger of taking a ſingle ſtep in divine ſervices, without a clear diviſion of things, and the way caſt up in the mind.—As I thus waited for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not being by once ſucceeding encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to run too faſt, I was favoured to know the fire of the Lord rightly kindled upon his altar; and to witneſs an offering of his own preparing. And I am well aſſured that ſuch, and ſuch only are the offerings which will find acceptance with him. He never will reject theſe, any more than accept thoſe of human obtruding.</p>
               <p>My ſecond publick appearance in the miniſtry was at the lower meeting-houſe in Smithfield, the 19th of the 10th month 1774, when I found a living concern to encourage a careful engagement before the Lord, out of meetings; and to preſs it upon Friends to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032810_0060_0FF52A04295BD848"/>
draw nigh unto him from day to day, that ſtrength may be renewed, and the divine ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life retained, leſt we loſe the living ſenſe of what we often graciouſly enjoy in our religious meetings. Life, divine life, attended me in this little teſtimony, as in the former. And after meeting I enjoyed the ſweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of him who is the God of my ſalvation, in a degree that was greatly to my confirmation and encouragement. After this I ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſeeking unto and waiting upon God for counſel and direction; in which frame of mind I was favoured to renew and increaſe a living acquaintance with him; and witneſſed freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to my mind. I appeared but ſeldom in publick teſtimony, and moſtly in a few words at a time, and yet I have ſome few times been made ſenſible of ſaying too much; and for which I have felt more pain of mind than I have often felt, if ever, for withholding. However, through merciful preſervation, I have ſeldom to my knowledge appeared of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener or ſaid more than has tended to my own relief and ſatisfaction, and, for ought I know, to the ſatisfaction of my brethren: bleſſed be the name of the Lord my God. I bow awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before him, for his directing and preſerving preſence, through many deep probations. He hath been with me in the heights and in the depths; has ſtrung my bow and covered my head in the day of battle. May I ſerve him faithfully all the days of my ſtay here, until I go hence and be ſeen of men no more.</p>

               <p>AT this time I kept a ſchool for Friends children in the town of Providence; and having for ſeveral years paſt believed at times, that it might be beſt to preſerve ſome account of my pilgrimage through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of this world, I now began a more regular and conſtant journal of my exerciſes, and the Lord's gracious dealings with me, than I had heretofore preſerved. I had before made a few minutes of ſome remarkable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, which (together with what was freſh in my memory, and ſo recorded there as not likely ſoon if ever to be obliterated) enabled me to write the foregoing account; and thus to bring it forward to this time.</p>
               <p>On the firſt day of the week, the 1ſt of the 1ſt month 1775, I fell and received a ſmall wound which was attended with conſiderable ſoreneſs and pain; and next day having in addition to this a turn of the nervous or ſick head-ach, I was confined to the houſe: and hope theſe light afflictions were not wholly

               <p>1775. About theſe days I went through great diſcouragements and heavy exerciſes; but was moſtly enabled to hope and believe it was all for my good, and would tend, if rightly endured, to my furtherance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement in divine things; and, bleſſed be the name of him who led and ſupported me through them; he did indeed ariſe for my help and conſolation, even with healing in his wings; and that too, when I was almoſt ready to faint, and deſpair of his help; which made me hope I ſhould truſt in him, and rely upon him, for the future; even in and through all trying diſpenſations. Indeed it is eaſy to hope and believe we ſhall truſt in the Lord, when he ſhines upon us, and ſheds abroad his love in our hearts, making us livingly to joy and rejoice in his preſence, which was now graciouſly my happy experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but alas! when we have again and again to paſs through the valley and ſhadow of death, it is not ſo eaſy to ſtand firm, <hi>keep the faith,</hi> and truſt in God.</p>
               <p>My exerciſed ſoul has had large experience
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032810_0063_0FF52B0AF86DEC40"/>
of theſe heights and depths; and knows that nothing but divine power can uphold us in times of deep probation which we muſt paſs through in our travels towards the land of reſt. And O! that none may give out in ſuch ſeaſons, or faint in their minds; it is no new thing; it is the beaten path, and all the Lord's ranſomed muſt become acquainted with it, and travel in it, not taking their flight in the winter; and as they thus ſtand firm, they will joyfully witneſs, in the Lord's time, the winter to be over, the ſummer to advance, the time of the ſinging of birds to be come, and the voice of the turtle to be heard in their land. Oh! the pangs and ſufferings through which ſome have waited again and again for the return of theſe bleſſed enjoyments, theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of refreſhment from the preſence of the Lord; but none have ever rightly waited on the Lord in vain. Therefore truſt in him, O my ſoul for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 25th, I attended our monthly meeting at Smithfield, upper meeting-houſe; found ſome dear friends ſympathized with me in my deep probations: and was particularly comforted by a letter from a dearly beloved friend, written in a manner well ſuited to aſſiſt and encourage my drooping mind— May I ever walk worthy the remembrance, ſympathy and prayers of my friends.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day, 2d of 2d month. In time of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032810_0064_0FF52A42259E3020"/>
ſilence and retirement in family devotion, wherein we were engaged to wait upon the Lord, for the renewal of ſtrength toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my mind was livingly opened into a freſh and humbling ſenſe of the unſpeakable love and goodneſs of God to poor, frail, finite man in ancient days—particularly I was bowed in conſideration of his wonderful deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Noah; and how he was with him in the ark; and how he taught him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it for his own and family's preſervation: how he was with Abraham when he left his father's houſe at his command, and went forth not knowing whither he was to go: alſo how he was with Iſrael in Egypt, through the Red ſea, the wilderneſs, and Jordan; with David, when he fled from Saul, being hunted as a partridge upon the mountains; with Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, in the whale's belly; with Daniel, in the lion's den; and the three children, in the fiery furnace; with his own well beloved ſon, in the great trials and temptations which he was led through in the wilderneſs and among men: alſo how he was with the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and ſupported them when men roſe up againſt them; and through all their perils by ſea and land, and by and among falſe brethren. What ſhall I ſay? he hath ever been a ſanctuary and ſafe hiding place for the righteous in all ages, and remains to be ſo ſtill; and as truly and powerfully ſo now as ever.—And as my mind was thus led and opened, earneſt breathings were begotten in me, that we of the preſent generation, who
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032810_0065_0FF52A43C0C49050"/>
have known his loving kindneſs, may walk worthy of the continuance thereof, and never diſtruſt his care and providence; aſſuredly believing, that he who hath been with us in ſix troubles will not leave us in the ſeventh, if we firmly truſt in, and ſteadfaſtly follow him. But if we ſhould draw back, his ſoul would then have no pleaſure in us.—Oh! therefore, ſaith my ſoul, that we may be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, knowing that our adverſary the devil, like a roaring lion, goes about continually, ſeeking whom he may devour.</p>
               <p>In the ſixth month I attended our yearly meeting on Rhode-Iſland. John Hunt and Nicholas Waln from Philadelphia, and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Jones and Benjamin Sweat from New-Jerſey, attended ſaid meeting—It held a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of days, the ſeveral ſittings thereof being times of divine favour; the ſouls of ſome painful travellers Zion-ward were greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and rejoiced in the Lord. Dear John Hunt was livingly opened in goſpel love and authority divers times among us in theſe meetings.</p>
               <p>On firſt-day the 18th of 6th month, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was ſent from our deputy-governor to the Friends of our meeting, requeſting that ſuch as had ſmall arms would produce them at the court-houſe next day, in order that the guns in the government might be known, and an account thereof ſent to the continental congreſs. After mature conſideration, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032810_0066_0FF52AC666C28BE0"/>
was ſigned by ſuch male members of our ſociety as lived within the town, in anſwer to ſaid requeſt, informing that our religious principles and conſcientious perſuaſion did not admit of a compliance. This was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the deputy governor, who received it kindly, and ſeemed ſatisfied, ſaying he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberty of conſcience was the natural right of all mankind. Thus the Lord made way for us, bleſſed be his holy name for ever.</p>
               <p>Much cloſe exerciſe of mind I had for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length of time, on account of ſome particular ſcruples which from time to time revived with weight, and ſo preſſingly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me, that I could not get rid of them. It being a time of war, and preparations for war between Great-Britain and America, and the rulers of America having made a paper currency profeſſedly for the ſpecial purpoſe of promoting or maintaining ſaid war; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expected that Friends would be tried by requiſitions for taxes, principally for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of war; I was greatly exerciſed in ſpirit, both on the account of taking and paſſing ſaid money, and in regard to the payment of ſuch taxes, neither of which felt eaſy to my mind. I believed a time would come when chriſtians would not ſo far contribute to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport of war and fightings as voluntarily to pay taxes that were mainly, or even in conſiderable proportion, for defraying the expenſes thereof; and it was alſo impreſſed upon my mind, that if I took and paſſed the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032810_0067_0FF52A53D61D7408"/>
money that I knew was made on purpoſe to uphold war, I ſhould not bear a teſtimony againſt war, that, for me as an individual, would be a faithful one. I knew the people's minds were in a rage againſt ſuch as, from any motive whatever, ſaid or acted any thing tending to diſcountenance the war. I was ſenſible that refuſing to pay the taxes, or to take the currency, would immediately be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued as a pointed oppoſition to the preſent war in particular, as even our refuſing to bear arms was, notwithſtanding our long and well known teſtimony againſt it. I had abundant reaſon to expect great cenſure and ſome ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in conſequence of my faithfulneſs, if I ſhould ſtand faithful in theſe things, though I knew that my ſcruples were unconnected with any party conſiderations, and uninflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by any motives but ſuch as reſpect the propriety of a truly chriſtian conduct in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to war at large. I had no deſire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the oppoſition to Great-Britain; neither had I any deſire on the other hand to promote the meaſures or ſucceſs of Great-Britain. I believed it my buſineſs not to meddle with any thing from ſuch views; but to let the potſherds of the earth alone in their ſmiting one againſt another: but I wiſhed to be clear in the ſight of God, and to do all that he might require of me towards the more full introduction and coming of his peaceable kingdom and government on earth. I found many well concerned brethren, who ſeemed to have little or nothing of theſe ſcruples;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032810_0068_0FF52A699CC470E0"/>
and ſome others who were like-minded with me herein. Under all theſe conſiderations the times looked ſomewhat gloomy; and at ſeaſons great diſcouragement ſpread over my mind. But after ſome ſtrugglings, and a length of cloſe exerciſe attended with much inward looking to the Lord for direction and ſupport, I was enabled to caſt my care upon him, and to riſk myſelf and my all in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, come whatever might come, or ſuffer whatever I might ſuffer, in conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I was well aware of many arguments and objections againſt attending to ſuch ſcruples; and ſome ſeemingly very plauſible ones from ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture, eſpecially reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taxes; but I believed I ſaw them all to ariſe from a want of clear underſtanding reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the true meaning of ſaid paſſages; and I knew I had no wordly intereſt, eaſe or honour, to promote by an honeſt attention to what I believed were the reproofs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of divine inſtruction. I well knew, not only by reading, but experimentally, that <q>He that doubteth is damned (condemned) if he eat;</q> and that what is contrary to faith and conviction is ſin; therefore I choſe rather to ſuffer in this world than incur the diſpleaſure of him from whom cometh all my conſolation and bleſſings.</p>
               <p>In the 9th month this year 1776, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with my dear friend Moſes Farnum, I viſited Friends at Richmond, in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire government, a branch of our monthly
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032810_0069_0FF52A574005D818"/>
meeting. We were twice at their meeting, and viſited I believe all their families. It was an exerciſing time to me; and I was almoſt wholly ſilent both in meetings and families; and even much reſtrained from converſation. Yet I had a hope that all was working toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for my good; and I endured my trials with a degree of patience, though I often groaned inwardly for deliverance: however the Lord brought me through all, and gave me to rejoice in his ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Fifth of tenth month. Having for nearly a year declined taking the paper currency, agreeably to the ſecret perſuaſion which I had of my duty therein, as before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I have now the ſatisfaction of compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different rewards of obedience and diſobedience; for though, from the very firſt circulation of ſaid money, I felt uneaſy in taking it; yet fears and reaſonings of one kind or another prevailed on me to take it for a ſeaſon; and then it became harder to refuſe it than it would probably have been at firſt: but growing more uneaſy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed about it, at length I refuſed it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſince which I have felt great peace and ſatisfaction of mind therein; which has in a very confirming manner been increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from time to time, the longer I have refuſed it: and although I get almoſt no money of any kind, little other being in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, yet I had much rather live and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Divine Providence, for a daily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032810_0070_0FF52A6B3563D8C0"/>
than to increaſe in the mammon of this world's goods, by any ways or means incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the holy will of my heavenly Father—and the prayer of my ſoul to him is, that I and all his children may be preſerved faithful to him in all his requirings, and out of that love of things here below which ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enates from the true love of and communion with him.</p>
               <p>In the 11th month this year I viſited, in company with a Friend of our monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the meetings and many of the families of Friends on Rhode-Iſland, and had much ſatisfaction therein; for though I had hard work in ſome families, and paſſed through ſome cloſe exerciſes, yet the Lord was with me and bore me up through all, opening my way in the ſpring of divine life, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuitable matter for communication, to the relief and conſolation of my own mind, and I hope to the benefit and comfort of others. And it was remarkable to me, that in a very ſhort time, indeed not many days after I had thus diſcharged my duty, and paid this legacy of love to my dear friends on this iſland, the king's troops took poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereby the communication was greatly obſtructed for a conſiderable length of time between Friends there and the main, that, had I not given up to perform this ſmall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice juſt as I did, and when the weight of it was livingly upon me, it is probable I might never have done it at all, or not to much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032810_0071_0FF52A58EE4F7BE8"/>
—A ſenſe of the Lord's goodneſs in enabling me to go in the right time, and to find relief and ſatisfaction in the viſit, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my mind and raiſed deſires therein, that I might ever live like one who knows himſelf to be but a pilgrim on the earth, and that God alone can ſuſtain him. Amen.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day, 8th of twelfth month. Divers Friends of our meeting at Providence became exerciſed in regard to a commotion that was prevailing among the inhabitants. It was ſaid, and I ſuppoſe was true, that a Britiſh fleet with troops had been ſeen not far from Rhode-Iſland; and it was ſuppoſed they were aiming to come into New-Port harbour, and probably up the river to this town. This greatly ſurpriſed many of the inhabitants.— Many moved their goods, and ſome their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies out of town, in great haſte and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy. The town ſeemed in an uproar; carts rattling, and teams driving all night; and, among others, a few Friends in this ſudden conſternation were induced to move ſome of their effects alſo, and a ſmall matter was done at moving their families: and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the view of ſome concerned Friends, a weighty, ſerious matter, a conference was held after the afternoon meeting upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſome Friends of other meetings alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, and though nothing cenſorious or uncharitable appeared in any reſpecting the conduct of any, yet it was adviſed that Friends ſhould be very careful to act in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032810_0072_0FF52AB34ED418C8"/>
and not in the hurry, but wait for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for ability to act becoming our holy profeſſion. Next day this advice was further inculcated by the meeting for ſufferings which ſat in town, and which, after ſolid conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adviſed that Friends keep ſtill and quiet, and do no more, unleſs, upon deep and ſolid conſideration, the way ſhould be clearly ſeen for any one to move. It was alſo thought adviſable for Friends in all things to conduct ſo as not to increaſe the commotion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidation which was already too prevalent among the people. This advice was very ſavoury to ſome of our minds, whoſe exerciſe was great on this occaſion; and whoſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail of ſoul was, that Friends might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the ſtability of the unchangeable truth.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day, 12th of 12th month. My mind was impreſſed ſo deeply with a lively ſenſe of the excellency and neceſſity of true chriſtian charity, that I had to ſpeak of it in our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the conſtrainings of the Father's love, labouring to encourage Friends to cultivate this excellent virtue, in their own minds and in each other.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day, 5th of 1ſt month 1777. For the want of cloſe attention to the word of divine life in my own ſoul, I made a blunder in my publick teſtimony, which greatly humbled me, and made me very careful and watchful afterwards. O! it is good to truſt in the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032810_0073_0FF52AF405EBD2C8"/>
Lord with all our hearts, not leaning to our own underſtandings. It was relying too much on my own underſtanding and memory which brought this great anxiety upon me. And I record it for future caution, mean-while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching God Almighty to preſerve me, and all his true goſpel miniſters in the right line of ſafety and divine qualification, which is in and with the opening of the Spirit, and with the underſtanding alſo.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day, 3d of 4th month. After a few words which I became concerned to expreſs in our week-day meeting, my mind was ſo clothed with the ſpirit of prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that I was prevailed upon to kneel down and publickly addreſs the throne of grace. This was the firſt time I ever appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vocal publick ſupplication; and it was truly much in the croſs, as alſo in great fear and reverence. It was indeed to me an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing publickly to call on the name of the Lord, and I have been many times ſorely grieved at the light, eaſy and unfeeling man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which many do it. A few weeks after this, to wit, the 25th of the 4th month, in writing a little piece on a ſpecial occaſion, after particularly and affectionately mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tender feelings and emotions of my heart towards ſeveral particular friends and acquaintances, my ſoul ſeemed overwhelmed with love and almoſt unutterable good-will to the people of the Lord, wherever ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the world over; in the freſh flowings
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032810_0074_0FF52A7828772950"/>
whereof I enlarged nearly as follows: <q>But above all, O Sion, thou city of the living God! what ſhall I ſay to thee! all that is alive within me is moved at thy being now brought into my remembrance! how ſhall I expreſs the overflowings of that love I now feel for thee; or that ardently travailing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which in the rolling of tender bowels engages my ſoul for thy everlaſting welfare! May the Lord of hoſts encamp round about thee, as a wall of fire for thy defence. Mayeſt thou know an abiding in thy tents, O Iſrael! Let not the earth, nor all its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, entice thee from the croſs, O Iſrael! the Lord alone can keep thee, and he only is worthy of thy cloſeſt attention. Keep near, keep near, O choſen genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; keep near thy divine teacher, who is graciouſly vouchſafing to teach thee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! Dwell deep, O ye travailing ſouls, give not back; go on with him that hath called you, although it may be through fire and water; through frowns and reproaches: the everlaſting arm will be underneath to ſupport you, as you make God your refuge, and continue faithful in the glorious work of reformation, which he is fitting ſome of you for. My life in tenderneſs runs out towards you: ye are as bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh. Oh! may the Lord protect and preſerve you—may the bleſſings of the everlaſting hills reſt upon you; and eſpecially upon ſuch of you as have been as it were ſeparated from your brethren, and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032810_0075_0FF52A141899D618"/>
devoted to the great work of the Lord in the earth; and be ye aſſured, if ye hold faſt the beginning of your confidence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement ſteadfaſtly to the end, no weapon formed againſt you ſhall ever proſper; the tongue that riſeth in judgment againſt you ſhall be condemned, and even though Gog and Magog wage war and oppoſe you, the Lamb and his followers ſhall have the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</q>—And as I have good grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this was written in the good-will of 'him who dwelt in the buſh,' I feel eaſy to tranſcribe it here, and give it a place in theſe memoirs.</p>
               <p>Having ſome time before this diſmiſſed my ſchool at Providence, I opened one at Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, on the 12th of the 4th month 1778, under the care, inſpection and direction of a ſolid committee appointed by the monthly meeting for that purpoſe. Soon after this, I took ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral colds one after another, until at length, on the 26th of the 2d month, leaving our month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, being quite unable to ſit through it, I went to my ſiſter's, where I was confined ſeveral weeks, brought very low, and at times ready to doubt my recovery. Indeed many of my friends and relations pretty much gave over expecting it. I was, after a ſeaſon of deep exerciſe and probation, enabled to reſign up life and all into the hands of him who made me, and to ſay in ſincerity, thy will be done in life or death. And as I lay one night in great diſtreſs of body, and deep thoughtfulneſs of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032810_0076_0FF52AF59C5AF110"/>
mind, I was drawn into an awful view of death, eternity and eternal judgment, in a manner that I never had before; but feeling my mind perfectly reſigned to depart this life and launch into an endleſs eternity, if ſo the Lord my God ſhould pleaſe to order it; and finding all pain of body and anxiety of mind removed, I lay ſtill ſome time, thinking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably I might ere long be releaſed from all the pangs and toils of time, into the glorious rejoicings of eternal life. But, after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length of time had paſſed in inward and profound ſtillneſs and adoration, large fields of labour were opened, and I ſaw that I muſt travel from place to place in this and diſtant lands, in the Lord's commiſſion and ſervice. From this time I never entertained a doubt of my recovery, although I had afterwards a return or two of the diſorder more ſevere than before; for theſe openings were in the freſh evidence of divine life, which never deceived me. A flow of divine favour, in the ſheddings abroad of the love of God in my heart, remained freſh and living with me through moſt of the remaining time of my illneſs. After a few days I began to recover, and pretty ſoon got a little about again, and before a great while attained my uſual ſtate of health: may thankſgiving and glory and honour be ever aſcribed by my ſoul to him who has been with me in ſickneſs and in health, ſupporting and preſerving me in both, and enabling me to reſign to his divine diſpoſal. May I ever live anſwerable to ſuch
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032810_0077_0FF52A5A9206B730"/>
regard of the Higheſt to me a poor worm of the duſt. My ſoul has been bowed, ſelf has been abaſed; and through deep proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have been made to joy in the Lord, and rejoice in the ſalvation of my God and Saviour.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of the ſixth month this year, an old acquaintance of mine, being now collector of rates, came and demanded one of me. I aſked him what it was for? He ſaid, to ſink the paper money. I told him, as that money was made expreſsly for the purpoſe of carrying on war, I had refuſed to take it; and for the ſame reaſon could not pay a tax to ſink it, believing it my duty to bear teſtimony againſt war and fighting. I informed him that for divers years paſt, even divers years before the war began, and when I had no expectation of ever being tried in this way, it had been a ſettled belief with me that it was not right to pay ſuch taxes; at leaſt not right for me, nor in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, right in itſelf; though many ſincere brethren may not at preſent ſee its repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the pure and peaceable ſpirit of the goſpel. I let him know I did not wiſh to put him to any trouble, but would be glad to pay it if I could conſiſtently with my perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He appeared moderate, thoughtful and rather tender; and after a time of free and pretty full converſation upon the ſubject, went away in a pleaſant diſpoſition of mind, I being truly glad to ſee him ſo. Divers ſuch
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032810_0078_0FF52A9EEEDB6C20"/>
demands were made of me in thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times for divers years: I ever found it beſt to be very calm and candid; and to open, as I was from time to time enabled, the genuine grounds of my refuſal; and that if poſſible, ſo as to reach the underſtandings of thoſe who made the demand.</p>
               <p>The Lord, who is ever attentive to the good of ſouls and the exaltation of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is on his way, and truth will more fully break forth; righteouſneſs will come into dominion; the mountain of the Lord's houſe will ſurely be eſtabliſhed above all the other mountains; but many of the called, through want of faithful attention to the call, may never become the choſen, and ſo never come forth valiantly in the teſtimony, nor ſtand immovable, nor triumph victoriouſly, in the Lamb's warfare.</p>
               <p>I think I have ſeen in the light, that too many that have come forth in a degree of true heavenly beauty, and through the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, being in ſome degree refined, have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards loved this preſent world, delighted in its friendſhip, rejoiced in earthly accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and let go their hold on heavenly good. Alas, for theſe! if they were but as diligent, watchful and ſolicitous for Sion's welfare, and to lay up treaſures in heaven, as they are to gather ſomething on earth, they would be ſure to grow rich in faith and good works, and become heirs of the heavenly
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032810_0079_0FF52A7AA58CB778"/>
kingdom. Theſe can never, ſo long as their rejoicings are ſo much in earth's enchanting purſuits and acquiſitions, rightly bear truth's holy teſtimony, or lift up its ſtandard to the nations. Nay, nay: this ſtate prepares them at leaſt to bear a ſuperficial lifeleſs teſtimony; but very commonly to reaſon, argue and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and that too, as they think very wiſely, againſt the riſing, ſpreading and increaſe of the teſtimony and government of the prince of peace. If there is not a diligent waiting at wiſdom's gate and in the valley of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in the true faith and patience of the ſaints, the ſenſe of divine things is gradually leſſened and loſt; and inſtead thereof, a kind of reaſoning takes place, wherein the divine life and its bleſſed teſtimony is ſtifled and rejected; and thoſe who ſtand faithful therein are cenſured and condemned. And, O thou exerciſed travailing ſoul, whoever thou art, hold on thy way; hold faſt thine integrity; be not diſcouraged at the lukewarmneſs or want of true judgment and diſcerning in others; but be thou valiant for the cauſe of truth in thy day; and then notwithſtanding all the oppoſition thou mayeſt meet with, within or without, the Lord will be thy ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; the holy One of Iſrael will watch over, protect and defend thee; and as thou leaneſt wholly to the arm of his help, and truſteſt ſteadfaſtly in his divine light for thy leader, he will ſurely uphold and ſuſtain thee through all thy combats and fiery trials in this mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtate; and when thy faithful warfare
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032810_0080_0FF52ACCCDDE6A40"/>
here below is fully accompliſhed, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee into his glorious church triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, there for ever to join the ſhouts and hallelujahs of ſaints and angels in a glorious and unſpeakable participation and fruition of perfect bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>8th month 4th. I have now freedom to commit to writing a little of what I have thought of the cuſtom among many Friends of calling one another <hi>friend,</hi> inſtead of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by their proper given names, which I think deſerves ſerious conſideration, why this way of ſpeaking, to thoſe whoſe names we are acquainted with, is continued in. Is it not to ſhun the croſs? or becauſe calling perſons by their names John, James, Peter, Paul, &amp;c. ſounds too unmodiſh, or as ſome may think, diſreſpectful? Is there nothing of the ſpirit of the world in thus flinching from ſtrict plainneſs and ſimplicity? If I am not miſtaken, we ſhall, whenever we arrive to the bleſſed eſtate the apoſtle mentions, of <q>having every thought brought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt,</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. x. 5.</note> be willing to deny ourſelves and take up the croſs, even in things that appear to be fooliſhneſs itſelf to this world's wiſdom, for it is in ſuch things that God in his wiſdom is often pleaſed to exerciſe and prove the integrity of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in order to confirm and eſtabliſh their humiliation and ſubjection of will to him and his holy law. Here pride has no free ſcope;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032810_0081_0FF52AB5441F8EA8"/>
the ſpirit and friendſhip of the world is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully renounced; and the croſs in all its neceſſary operations ſubmitted to and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. A plain decent dreſs, a plain houſe, furniture and fare in all things, will become the humble followers of a meek and humble Saviour: plainneſs and ſimplicity of language will beſt adorn a real chriſtian.</p>
               <p>In theſe days I often renewed covenant with my God—ſat much alone—kept ſilence —and bore his yoke and rod upon me. Many days I ſpent nearly, if not quite, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and I believe without ſin; though many others were ſo ſpent, as to cauſe more or leſs of anxiety and wo: but I even found the miniſtration of condemnation was truly glorious, becauſe it prepared my mind for and led to the more glorious miniſtration of juſtification. Fervent was the engagement of my mind; and often my peace flowed like a river, and Sion's welfare ſwallowed up almoſt all other conſiderations and concerns. Much travail did I often feel for the preſervation and growth of the Lord's viſited children, I mean thoſe who had become livingly ſenſible of the operations of his divine power upon their ſpirits—and to ſome of theſe I wrote once in a while an encouraging or perſuaſive letter, a conſiderable number of theſe I have by me, but, to avoid ſwelling theſe memoirs, I omit them here, as alſo a great part of the minutes and memorandums which I made of my exerciſes, watchings, ſtrivings and trials
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032810_0082_0FF52B1D2EA15CD8"/>
in thoſe days.—In the time of waiting on the Lord in ſilent retirement alone, which was moſtly my daily practice, it ſometimes pleaſed him to vail his holy preſence from me, in order to prove my patience and ſteadfaſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him; and ſometimes to command a ſolemn awful ſilence in me, wherein he often ſtood revealed in majeſtic all-ſufficiency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, in a manner which I have no words to convey a clear idea of to any who have not experienced the ſame in themſelves. But I am aſſured that all, who rightly wait upon him in their own minds, will find him a God nigh at hand, and graciouſly diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh and ſatisfy the hungry ſoul. I do not believe a man can go aſide, and ſit down alone, to make the experiment, merely to ſee what the conſequence of ſitting in ſilence will be, without a real hunger and heart-felt travail; and therein be favoured with the flowings of the holy oil. But none ever wait rightly and perſeveringly upon God in vain. The incomes of his love afford more true joy, than all earth's richeſt enjoyments. <q>A feaſt of fat things, of wines on the lees well refined,</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xxv. 6.</note> is the comfortable portion of his choſen.</p>
               <p>In theſe awful approaches I beheld at times with clearneſs the kind hand of the Lord in leading me through many deep probations. I viewed his overturning influence among men, in theſe outwardly troubleſome times; and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032810_0083_0FF52A7C3A8BFDC8"/>
now and then my proſpects were livingly extended in great good-will, and rolling of bowels, towards the church in general, and ſome places in particular, with a living evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſealed on my heart, that, if I abode faithful, I muſt devote conſiderable time in the ſervice of the goſpel in my day and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.

               <p>AT our yearly meeting this year 1779, the ſubject of Friends paying taxes for war, came under ſolid conſideration. Friends were unanimous, that the teſtimony of Truth, and of our ſociety, was clearly againſt our paying ſuch taxes as were wholly for war; and many ſolid Friends manifeſted a lively teſtimony againſt the payment of thoſe in the mixture; which teſtimony appeared evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to me to be on ſubſtantial grounds, ariſing and ſpreading in the authority of truth. It was a time of refreſhment to an exerciſed number, whoſe ſpirits I truſt were feelingly relieved, in a joyful ſenſe of the light which then ſprung up among us. On the whole, I am renewedly confirmed, that however the burden-bearers of the preſent generation among us may hold on their way, or fall ſhort and give back, the Lord will raiſe up a band of faithful followers, who, preferring Jeruſalem's welfare to their chiefeſt joys, will preſs through the crowd of reaſonings, and follow the Lamb whitherſoever he leadeth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:032810_0085_0FF52A2972BC4FD0"/>In thoſe days I paſſed through many trials and exerciſes, unknown except to God and my own ſoul: but he knew my heart, and all my tribulations, and how to carry me through them; and bleſſed be his holy name! he ſupported and bore up my drooping mind through every probation and beſetment. At times I clearly ſaw he was refining me in the furnace of affliction; then why ſhould I mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur or repine? Or why doſt thou murmur, Oh! afflicted ſoul, whoever thou art? for unleſs thou endure chaſtiſement of the Lord, thou art a baſtard and not a ſon. By his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſements he brings into the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and filial attachment of ſons—he enables to ſing of mercy and of judgment; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms his children in a ſteadfaſt reliance upon himſelf, through every ſtorm and tempeſt. O! bleſs his holy name for ever—exalt and praiſe him, even for the turning of his hand in probation; for the exerciſe of his rod in chaſtiſement. It is all for good, and will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work good to all who rightly abide the trial. Indeed every trial ought to be received with thankfulneſs, as intended and working for our good. And ſeeing afflictions are oft the moſt ſubſtantial bleſſings to a true chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian traveller, let us in true reſignation of heart, under each painful ſtroke, aſcribe goodneſs to our God, and, in the pathetic language of Young, render him the tribute of thankſgiving, and ſay,</p>
               <p>'For <hi>all</hi> I bleſs thee, moſt for the <hi>ſevere.'</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:032810_0086_0FF52ADBE0D87280"/>In the twelfth month this year, in company with my dear friend Eliſha Thornton, I viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral families of Friends at Dartmouth. It was a time of great trial: I was ſhut up in ſilence, pain and poverty of ſpirit in divers families. I felt like a wanderer through a trackleſs deſert; yet, not being eaſy to quit the ſervice, I went on, but ſtill for ſome time found no relief, more than a conſciouſneſs of integrity to my God; but, magnified be his name for ever, in depth of diſtreſs he heard my cry, and aroſe with healing in his wings; and was graciouſly pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand deliverance. My tongue again was looſed; and, with tenderneſs and contrition, I declared of his dealings; with gratitude, I ſang of his ſalvation. He clothed me with the ſpirit of ſupplication: I drew near him with renewed confidence, and, after ſeveral ſeaſons of relieving communication, returned home, ſaying in my heart, 'it is enough.'</p>
               <p>The 31ſt of the 3d month 1780, I went to ſee my much beloved friend Moſes Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, at Uxbridge, in his laſt ſickneſs. His diſorder was paralitick. He could not ſpeak ſo as to communicate much of his mind by words; but the lively ſenſibility of his mind, and the tenderneſs and brokenneſs of his ſpirit were refreſhing to my ſoul. Divers Friends were preſent, and nearly all were melted into tears and heart-felt tenderneſs. He was juſt able to make us ſenſible of his great peace of mind in his late religious travels;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032810_0087_0FF52A8D4AC20F10"/>
and that the ſeal and evidence of divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation therein was now impreſſed on his mind. Light and life appeared to triumph over all in him. He ſeemed reſigned to every trial; he alſo manifeſted great gladneſs that in health he had ſettled and diſpoſed of his outward affairs to ſatisfaction. On the 11th of the fifth month he was decently buried, having gradually declined until death remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from works to rewards. I truſt he now enjoys a manſion of undiſturbed repoſe in the paradiſe of God. He was in the latter part of his life a pillar in the Lord's houſe: a faithful watchman on the walls of Sion. And his memory is precious.</p>
               <p>On the 1ſt day of the 6th month this year, 1780, at our meeting in Providence, I was married to Eunice Anthony, daughter of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel and Mary Anthony.—The following I wrote her juſt after my firſt addreſſes to her on account of marriage, viz.</p>

firſt, dearly beloved, let me tell thee, that however ſhort I may be of ſtrict adherence to the Light of Life, yet it is my crown, my chiefeſt joy to feel the holy, harmonious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and inſhinings of the love of Jeſus my Saviour upon my ſoul; and I feel that without this I muſt be miſerable indeed. I alſo believe that the true enjoyment of the marriage-union conſiſts eminently in <hi>both</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged to draw near to the Lord, and act in his counſel; which I not only wiſh, but in a good degree expect may be our happy caſe. If it ſhould, though we have as it were a dry morſel to partake of as to the things of this life, yet we may joy in the Lord, and rejoice in the God of our ſalvation.

               <p>While I was from home at our quarterly meeting in the 7th month, I wrote as follows: Lord, when I contemplate on thy wonderful condeſcenſion to me a poor worm of the duſt; when I remember thy early and repeated calls and viſitations; and how thou pluckedſt my feet out of the mire, and led me into the green paſtures of life, filling my heart with joy and gladneſs after condemnation for evil, and chaſtiſement therefor; my ſoul bows in reverence before thee; gratitude affects my heart. But alas! when I take a view of my ſteppings along ſince thoſe times; my want of conſtant ſtayedneſs in covenant with thee; the weakneſs of my reſolutions, and my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold infirmities; mourning and lamentation fills my heart; ſorrow and diſtreſs ſurround me. Lord, what is man, that thou art mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him? and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him? Were it not for thy mercies I muſt often have been rejected; were it not for thy tender compaſſions, I muſt have been ſhut up in darkneſs and perplexity. But, bleſſed be thy holy name, through judgment and correction thou haſt, from time to time,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032810_0090_0FF52B56F5BCAEF0"/>
reduced me to that tenderneſs wherein the flowings of thy love are felt to be precious.</p>
               <p>In the 12th month this year our monthly meeting entered my name as one of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to viſit families. My circumſtances in life, and a proſpect I had of viſiting families on Rhode-Iſland, brought ſome diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over my mind about this new appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but wiſhing well to the ſervice at home, and truſting in the Lord, I gave up to it; and, paſſing on from time to time, I had ſome cloſe exerciſe, and ſome ſeaſons of ſolid ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>In the 1ſt month 1781, I went to Rhode-Iſland, and having ſuitable company, viſited about forty-ſix families, and attended ſeveral meetings among Friends there. In the courſe of this viſit, I paſſed through a time of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtripping for a ſhort ſeaſon, yet it was a time of great openneſs and divine favour through almoſt all the meetings and ſittings. My mind was low, humble and dependant, almoſt conſtantly looking for the way to ſhut up, as had been my experience at ſome other times: but now it pleaſed the ſhepherd of Iſrael to fit and qualify for ſervice. The holy anointing oil flowed livingly among us. Truth's teſtimony was again and again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; the Lord's name and goodneſs mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and praiſed, and the hearts of the true worſhippers rejoiced; and the careleſs ſons and daughters of Sion were admoniſhed and
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:032810_0091_0FF52B58E52F1E88"/>
warned. I returned home with thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to the author of all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this bleſſed ſeaſon of heavenly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement and holy confirmation; I was greatly relieved from the exerciſe that had for a conſiderable time been impreſſed upon my ſpirit, conſtraining me into this little field of ſervice.</p>
               <p>A concern having been growing among Friends for ſome time paſt to diſcourage the frequent and unneceſſary uſe of ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; and alſo to diſſuade all our members from dealing in them; ſome labour was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed with ſuch as dealt in them as an article of trade: they appeared well diſpoſed; and the proſpect was encouraging, that Friends would pretty ſoon clear their hands of that kind of commerce. And the uſe of ſuch liquors is much laid aſide among Friends in New-England. It was once thought very difficult to do ſome kinds of buſineſs without them; but now it is found by experience, that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is better done, and health, ſtrength and harmony, better promoted without them.</p>
               <p>31ſt of 3d month 1781. I have for years felt ſtrong deſires to be wholly redeemed from the improper purſuit of worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and even from all deſires of wealth beyond what my heavenly Father knoweth I have need of; as alſo from all uſe of things, the procuring of which would require more of my time than would be conſiſtent with my
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032810_0092_0FF52A3B71B03318"/>
religious duty; or which would cauſe me, or any under me, to labour beyond the true medium; or beyond the degree which beſt promotes health of body and tranquillity of mind. I have mourned to ſee the true ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſo lamentably departed from in theſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, among all ſocieties of profeſſing chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Multitudes are miſerably toiling and drudging, from day to day, and from year to year, ſcarce allowing themſelves time to aſſemble for divine worſhip, nor ſcarce time to reſt and refreſh their bodies. And many, when they do get to their religious meetings, are too often ſo exhauſted by immoderate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, that they are fitter for ſleep than divine worſhip. I am fully ſatisfied if men would keep to that holy principle which bounds the deſires, and gives content in a moderate way of living, they would enjoy more ſolid peace and happineſs than is often experienced in the apartments of affluence, or in the walks of magnificence. What is all the glitter and ſhew of high life in compariſon of,
<q>
                     <l>'What nothing earthly gives, nor can deſtroy,</l>
                     <l>'The ſoul's calm ſunſhine, and the heart-felt joy.</l>
                     <l>'True virtue's prize.'</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thouſands are anxiouſly aiming to keep up an appearance, which, though far behind many, is yet above their real ability to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port without injury to their circumſtances; indeed a little ſtraining beyond our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may embarraſs us through life, keep us upon the toil, and diſcompoſe our minds,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032810_0093_0FF52AF25C27A440"/>
or at leaſt abſorb our attention, ſo as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter our lives, or prevent that true quiet, wherein we might dwell ſo inward and reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to <hi>acquaint ourſelves with God, and be at peace.</hi> Moreover, it is too commonly the caſe that even religious people, that is, ſuch as have been really ſo for a ſeaſon, when they give way to this dangerous deſire of wealth, or of living too much as they ſee others live, that they gradually loſe ground, until, in their planning and contriving, they get more or leſs in a way of over-reaching, or at leaſt of crowding too hard upon thoſe they deal with, bearing them down in their prices, or in ſome degree extorting too great a price for things ſold them. There are many ways to oppreſs a little, take ſmall advantages, and exerciſe ſome degree of extortion. And when the mind becomes habituated and gradually reconciled to a leſs degree, the way is too often paved to a greater degree, until many things will go down pretty eaſily which would have ſat very uneaſy upon the mind in days of greater tenderneſs and more conſcientious exactneſs and holy fear. I doubt not many have ſeen and deplored theſe things in their early progreſs, thought they would not for all earth's glory be overtaken in them, and yet, letting out their deſires after more than is meet for them, have ſlid gradually into the ſame error. I have ſeen the progreſs of this ſpirit with ſorrow, and mourned over ſome who have been grievouſly entangled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared in it.—Oh! thou traveller Sion-ward,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032810_0094_0FF52B5A80ED7510"/>
flee, flee for thy life, from all theſe allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; take God for thy portion, and his holy ſpirit for thy law and limitation. Be content with what is convenient for thee; there is more true joy therein, than in all the accumulations of avarice. I believe it will be good for me, and all that would live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, often to examine impartially, Do I exerciſe no degrees of extortion? am I redeemed from the love and friendſhip of the world? do I not give way to deſires of living above what truth or my circumſtances allow of? am I not in the uſe of ſome things which are not neceſſary? If thou haſt this belief, ſee to it, and endeavour to deny thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and be ſatisfied with ſuch things, and ſupplies of them, as thy heavenly Father knoweth thou haſt need of.</p>
               <p>At our quarterly meeting in the ſeventh month, a committee was appointed to viſit the ſeveral monthly meetings, and labour, as ability might be given, for a reformation. —Some endeavours were uſed to diſſuade Friends from that uſe of things which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote not the true harmony of mankind, nor do any eſſential good to thoſe who uſe them. This ought to be a ſerious conſideration with all chriſtians, <q>they that are Chriſt's have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</q>

the uſe of them?—All the uſe of this world's goods, is but to provide for our outward comfort through this paſſage or life, and yet how many make themſelves ſlaves, or at leaſt greatly leſſen or prevent their own comfort in life, by giving way to the influence of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper deſires, and imaginary wants.</p>
               <p>11th of 12th month 1781. O! that I may be preſerved preſſing forward with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart towards a ſtate of perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſin. I know well that no one ſin can be mortified and overcome, but through divine aſſiſtance; but as certainly as the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God upon us can, or ever does, enable us to overcome <hi>any one evil;</hi> ſo certainly it is able to aſſiſt us to the complete overcoming of <hi>all;</hi> and we may rely upon it he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity, unleſs the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of our wills prevent.

               <p>Fifth month 23d. I feel breathings of ſoul to be ſet at liberty from the bondage of earthly cares, that they may have no more ſhare of my attention than duty requires. I have ſeen with heart-felt pain the ravages of a worldly ſpirit; I have mourned the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the love of gain has made among many who once in degree renounced it.</p>
               <p>O Lord, God Almighty, I pray thee ariſe for our help; for except thou, O holy Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, help, there is no help for us: the people whom thou haſt called out of Egyptian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will yet periſh in the wilderneſs, and never enter into poſſeſſion of the promiſed land, unleſs thou, O moſt merciful, again make bare thy holy arm for our awakening and furtherance in the way of life.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:032810_0098_0FF52B69CF0F7BE8"/>Our yearly meeting this year was graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owned, and overſhadowed by the wing of ancient goodneſs: the Shepherd watered and fed his flock; he ſheltered his lambs, and prepared a banquet for his choſen, and made them ſweetly reſt as at noon.</p>
               <p>After the meeting was over, the language of my heart, in thankful acknowledgment, was a language of praiſe. I knew the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was from heaven: I knew the rain was not at our command; nor was the table ſpread, and the feaſt prepared, but by the bounteous hand of Iſrael's God. Return, O my ſoul, to the place of thy reſt, for the Lord thy God hath dealt bountifully with thee.</p>
               <p>The continuation of divine favour for ſome little time after this, repeatedly rejoiced my ſpirit. At length, through the all-wiſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings of him who knew how to lead me on in ſafety, I was again reduced to want, and had to feel much inward leanneſs. In this ſtate I ſcarce had any thing to rejoice in but infirmities; but, relying on him whoſe covenant is as ſure with the night as with the day, and who never forſakes thoſe who do not forſake him, I felt, in the midſt of my ſtrippings, and was therein ſtayed, that <q>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in low times is an excellent anchor, and hope bears up the ſoul.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ninth month 23d. In reading the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Abraham's life in Elwood's Sacred
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:032810_0099_0FF52CCB01D05EE8"/>
Hiſtory, my heart was deeply affected.—Oh! his faith how firm! his devotion how lively! See him leave his father's houſe, his native land, and go forth at the call of the Lord, not knowing whither he went. See him erecting his altar to the Moſt High, and <q>calling on the name of the Lord the everlaſting God.</q> See him on Moriah's mount, reſigning his beloved ſon! What heart unmoved can view the tranſactions of ſuch a life, or read with indifference the dealings of the Almighty with this father of the faithful?—He was the friend of God, and God was his friend. O that we, who boaſt the light of goſpel days, were true ſucceſſors in the faith of Abraham: a living faith that wrought with his works, and by his works of righteouſneſs, devotion and true holineſs, was made perfect.</p>
               <p>In the 11th month, in company with other Friends, I viſited upwards of ſeventy families within the verge of our monthly meeting; had great ſatisfaction in ſome places, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered deeply in others. The author of all good was with us, and at times greatly refreſhed our ſpirits. In the courſe of this viſit I had to view with ſadneſs thoſe who were overcome by the god of this world. Others I viewed as riſing above the world, and laying hold on eternal life. Theſe felt near my ſpirit in the inviſible relationſhip, and I rejoiced in their ſucceſs in the Lamb's warfare.</p>

               <p>ON the 5th of the 4th month 1782, I moved with my family to Glouceſter, within the limits of the meeting of Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, a branch of our monthly meeting, having for ſome time before believed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der divers conſiderations, and of different kinds, that it might be beſt for me to ſpend a portion of my time in that neighbourhood, about eighteen miles from my home in North-Providence. I fully expected to return again ſome time or other, but did not know when it might be. I remembered the movements of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, and in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection thereof, a degree of ſolid ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was afforded me. I had ſome outward proſpects in removing; but I not only did not aim at wealth, nor expect an increaſe of outward ſubſtance, but I had other and I truſt higher motives in it than related to my own temporal concerns. And, ſoon after I became ſettled there, I found a field of ſervice opening before me in a religious line, a ſenſe whereof I had for ſome time had upon my
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032810_0101_0FF52CCCD3CB94C8"/>
mind previous to this removal. There were a few precious ſouls here deeply and well engaged in the cauſe of truth, and with whoſe ſpirits I was often livingly united in travail for the welfare of Sion, and building of her walls. We had times of deep proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, through holy help, many ſeaſons of rejoicing together in the Lord. On the whole, I had frequent confirmations that my being here was promotive at leaſt of my own growth in the everlaſting truth. Lord God! of all the holy ancient, be with me I pray thee, and guide me in the way wherein thou wouldeſt have me to go, no matter where or when, ſo that thy never-failing preſence goes with me in all my travels through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world, to a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Amen.</p>
               <p>Very ſoon after my removal, my dear ſiſter Sarah Hazard died at her home in South-Kingſton. She was a religious woman. She improved much in true chriſtian reſignation, and died in a freſh and living ſenſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joy. I attended her burial, enjoying, in the midſt of my mourning, a ſatisfaction in a full belief that her removal from a world of anxieties and cares, was a removal to an inheritance in the manſions of bliſs.</p>
               <p>I have been renewedly confirmed in the great advantage to families, and even to ſmall children, that reſults from ſitting down in ſolemn ſilence, and therein waiting upon
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032810_0102_0FF52CFA41EF4CE0"/>
God. I have ſeen the children much broken and tendered in ſuch ſeaſons, ſo that, even when there has not been a word ſpoken, the tears have rolled down their cheeks, and their looks have been evidently expreſſive of heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt ſenſations. This practice alſo learns them ſilence and ſubjection; it curbs their wills and habituates them to reſtraint, and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient waiting, for their parents permiſſion, to engage in their little diverſions. The habits of ſilence, ſubjection and patient waiting for permiſſion, are very uſeful to children from infancy to mature age, and many ſuffer much for want of it. I have alſo ſeen much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to children, and indeed to whole families, from the practice of a ſolemn pauſe at meals; it learns children ſtillneſs, decency and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and, where it is done in a feeling manner, with minds rightly turned to feel after God and experience his bleſſing, and is not practiſed in a ſlight formal manner, it tends to ſeaſon and ſolemnize the minds of young and old. I have ſeen it done in a very careleſs lifeleſs manner, with ſcarce any reverence; divers of the family converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not far from the table; and ſcarce any ſenſe of the divine preſence prevalent in the minds of thoſe around it; and perhaps the pauſe ſcarce long enough to allow of much ſolid ſenſibility or reverential acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the favours received from the bounty of a gracious God in the ample proviſions of his providential care for our bodies; or his continued extenſion of fatherly regard to our
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032810_0103_0FF52C5FF15A8580"/>
immortal ſouls. I think ſuch an undevout appearance can be very little to the divine acceptance; but where a proper pauſe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and the Lord is therein ſeriouſly ſought to, the mind being feelingly impreſſed with a ſenſe of his aid and aſſiſtance, and all branches of the family are reverently ſilent: it is an oblation well-pleaſing in the ſight of God, and very uſeful to ſuch families. I am morally certain, that I have many a day gone through the cares and concerns of life with much more compoſure, ſtability, ſatisfaction and propriety for the ſtrength and aſſiſtance I have found in drawing near to God in ſolemn ſilence in my family; and I wiſh the practice of reverently adoring him in this way, may increaſe more and more.</p>
               <p>Our yearly meeting this year was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſeaſon: divers weighty matters were tranſacted in love and chriſtian condeſcenſion through the qualifying influence of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our aſſemblies, who graciouſly owned this our annual ſolemnity by the overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his love and life-giving preſence. Some ſuitable advices were ſent down to the inferior meetings upon ſundry important ſubjects.</p>
               <p>After this meeting, in company with divers other Friends, who with myſelf were under the yearly meeting's appointment to viſit the quarterly and monthly meetings, I viſited Acoakſet, Dartmouth, Nantucket, Sandwich
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032810_0104_0FF52D88DD9C9100"/>
and Swanzey monthly meetings, Sandwich quarterly meeting held at Nantucket, and our own at Smithfield. We found a want of charity in ſome few, very ſtrict in outward plainneſs, who, from a miſguided zeal, held others too much at a diſtance on account of their not appearing equally plain with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in dreſs, &amp;c. which was cauſe of grief to me, yet I am a hearty well-wiſher to plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I grieve to ſee the ſorrowful departure from it into pride and ſuperfluity: I never ſaw an inſtance of any very conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of this kind, but what I had reaſon to be convinced that a real loſs was ſuſtained by the individuals, or their beſt advancement prevented. But I have ſuffered much deep diſtreſs of ſoul under a painful and depreſſing ſenſibility, of that contracted, illiberal and harſh ſpirit, which in ſome inſtances has the aſcendancy, leading them into extremes without the life. I know that truth leads into great regularity and circumſpection of life; and I abhor that light chaffy ſpirit that makes ridicule of it, and lightly eſteems the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary appearance and true religious zeal of the faithful. I doubt not many libertine minds may lay hold of ſuch remarks as the above to juſtify their own deviations from the plain path of truth, the narrow way that leads to life; and think thereby to ſcreen themſelves from the juſt judgment of truth through the brethren; but this will not avail them; the way remains, as ever of old, a narrow way, a way of ſelf-denial, and the daily croſs. But Oh
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032810_0105_0FF52CB9F3754F30"/>
unhappy and deluded people whoever they are, that in their zeal for externals, loſe chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They depart from the life and lay hold on formality: for all outward things in religion dwindle unavoidably into formality, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as charity is departed from, and zeal takes place in things pertaining to the outſide of the cup and platter, without a living fenfe of the inward ſpring of life which can never be experienced without living, fervent charity. Therefore let us ever keep ſteadily to our plain way of living, in the life of truth: for I am aſſured, ſo far as it is rightly kept to, truth owns and ſupports it; and its influence on the mind is very beneficial. But O, that we may ever be preſerved from a narrow, raſh, cenſorious ſpirit; and from over-rating any outward regularity, or exact living; leſt, as we grow in the form, we dwindle as to the life. Although theſe remarks may not have a very extenſive influence in rightly guarding others; yet I muſt write what I have to write and leave it, hoping divine providence will yet build up Sion and fortify Jeruſalem, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the courſe of the ſincere-hearted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the extremes, in the ſure and ſafe path of virtue, where a lively active zeal is tempered with liberality of heart and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the flowings of true charity.</p>
               <p>We laboured in the monthly meetings as ability was afforded, and I truſt to ſome ſolid ſatisfaction. I got home to my dear wife and family the 8th of the 7th month,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032810_0106_0FF52C9CF8A0CBB0"/>
and, finding them tolerably well, I left home next day to attend our own quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Here I was rather too active in diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.—I have found it my buſineſs ſometimes of late to be more inward in travail, and leſs active in the exerciſe of the wholeſome rules of ſociety than I once was, and believe, when I have obeyed the call into this inward, ſtill abode, and there felt my loins rightly girded, it has contributed much more to the right exerciſe of the diſcipline, than when, through a deſire for its proper adminiſtration, I have, by over-acting, ſeemed to do a good deal for its execution.</p>
               <p>In the night, the 9th of the 8th month, there was a froſt which killed ſome of the vegetables, even ſome indian corn. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo very early in the year, and coming after a ſeaſon of many refreſhing ſhowers, and at a time of very fair and promiſing proſpect of plentiful crops, my mind was led into a train of ſerious reflections, how the Almighty, who had thus brought forward our fields and proſpects, could cut them all off; and how entirely dependant we are upon his bounty for every bleſſing. Were his compaſſions to fail, his providential aids to be withdrawn, alas! we, poor frail mortals, ſhould ſoon periſh.</p>
               <p>In the 9th month I viſited Friends families at Richmond, New-Hampſhire, a very diſtant branch of our monthly meeting. At ſeveral of
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032810_0107_0FF52D0FAC929948"/>
our meetings at Uxbridge, not long after this, I had livingly to ſound an alarm among Friends; and my ſoul humbly rejoiced in the relief I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in theſe few favoured meetings.</p>
               <p>1784, 2d of 2d month. The exerciſes of my mind have for ſome time paſt rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, inſomuch that, for a conſiderable part of the time, I have felt like being in the furnace, eſpecially in meetings, but much ſo out of them alſo. Indeed it has felt like the power and fire of the Lord laying hold of the remains of pride and evil in me and burning like an oven; that is, <hi>inwardly</hi> and <hi>fervently.</hi> —May all be conſumed that cannot abide the fiery trial.</p>
               <p>And it has been gradually from time to time opened and ſealed on my mind, that a part of the ſcriptures, which many generally underſtand to ſpeak only of outward things, may be underſtood by the truly enlightened to convey inward and ſpiritual inſtruction. God's deſign is to confound the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nought the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prudent. He has hid and will hide divine things from the wiſe and prudent, and reveal them unto babes.</p>
               <p>The natural man not only <hi>does not,</hi> but <hi>cannot</hi> know them, becauſe they are only 'ſpiritually diſcerned.' To this purpoſe Chriſt ſpake in parables, that ſuch as had an eye inward to the divine light, which alone gives
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032810_0108_0FF52D0B2B8DCF90"/>
the true ſpiritual diſcerning, might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, receive and know the myſteries of his kingdom, while all the wiſe and learned could but gueſs, miſtake, ſtumble and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.—So when the diſciples aſked him why he ſpake in parables, he informed them it was becauſe it was given to them to know theſe things, but to others it was not given. It was not given to them, to the excluſion of any in the ſame ſtate of inward ſeeking, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and child-like ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>God's deſign was then, and ever will be, to hide theſe things from all ſuch as are ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know them by their own mere natural powers: they may and do ſtudy the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and reaſon very copiouſly upon them, and think they clearly comprehend their meaning, and yet remain in total darkneſs, as to the ſpiritual import, meaning and myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of many paſſages which they are ſtrongly perſuaded they underſtand rightly.</p>
               <p>Before this wiſdom and creaturely compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion the ſtumbling-block is, by God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and counſel, <hi>laid;</hi> on purpoſe laid, that man ever may ſtumble and fall and be ſnared and taken, ſo long as he goes this way to work to underſtand divine things; not that God determines any certain number of perſons ſhall ſo ſtumble, and be ſnared, &amp;c. but all univerſally on this ground, and in this wiſdom; for through all ages it is true, <q>if any man thinketh that he knoweth any
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032810_0109_0FF52BD625D618A0"/>
thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. viii. 2.</note> Even Paul declares, <q>I know nothing by myſelf.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. iv. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>While Paul thought he knew ſomething divine by or of himſelf, his reaſoning roſe againſt the Meſſiah, and with all his might he ſought againſt the only true way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So, in degree, it will be with all; if they think they know, even <hi>any thing</hi> divine of themſelves, or by the exerciſe of their own creaturely faculties, they have never yet learned any thing as they ought; for as ſoon as they <hi>know any thing</hi> as they <hi>ought,</hi> they ſee and know that they knew nothing by or of themſelves; but are altogether beholden to a ſpiritual diſcerning from the divine light ſhining in their hearts, to give them this knowledge. Hence ſays the apoſtle, <q>God, who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined (take notice where this ſhining is) in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>

               <p>Here, firſt, it is <hi>God</hi> that <hi>hath ſhined;</hi> ſecondly, it is <hi>'in our hearts;'</hi> thirdly, it is to <hi>give us</hi> what we had not before, and could not have without this inſhining, that is, <hi>the light of the knowledge of his own glory;</hi> fourthly, it is <hi>'in the face of Jeſus Chriſt—'</hi> his inward appearance, whereby he cauſeth his <hi>light to ſhine upon us in order that we may

be ſaved;</hi> that we can ever ſee <q>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,</q> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true ſaying, <q>In thy light ſhall we ſee light.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xxxvi. 9.</note> His light ſhining 'in our hearts,' is the only poſſible medium wherein and whereby we can ſee God, or clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his glory: for it is an eternal truth, 'whatſoever doth make manifeſt is light,'<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. v. 13.</note> Natural light manifeſts natural things, and ſpiritual and divine light, ſpiritual and divine things. As water riſes but to the height of the fountain head; and as effects cannot exceed their cauſe; ſo nothing ſhort of divine light can ever fully manifeſt him to the mind of man.</p>
               <p>The ſcriptures will ever remain in great degree a ſealed book to the mere natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of the wiſeſt of men. Volume after volume of commentaries have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon them, which, I have no doubt, have often ſerved, as a certain author has advanced, to entomb, rather than enſhrine them; or to darken, rather than explain their genuine meaning. Thouſands paſs the time of their ſojourning here below, hoodwinked and muffled up in darkneſs, under the bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence of this kind of theological or ſyſtematical knowledge or ſpeculation, falſely called divinity. But in the midſt of all this learned ignorance, and, in degree, acquired blindneſs, which overruns the nations; the God of grace is not wanting in the extenſion of his own immediate rays upon the minds
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032810_0111_0FF51888C4E3FBD0"/>
of men; thoſe who turn from, diſregard and rebel againſt the light, are juſtly left in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for being, as thoſe in Job's days, <q>of them who rebel againſt the light, they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Job xxiv. 13.</note> But thoſe who, while they 'have light, believe in the light,' and walk in it, 'they become the children of it,'<note n="†" place="bottom">John xii. 36.</note> and are led into all <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may now proceed with my own exerciſes and openings. It was clearly given me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold many deep things in the viſions of God; things which the wiſdom of the natural man, though high in profeſſion of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, would probably laugh at and deſpiſe, and me for my weakneſs, were I to unfold them. But though I may not at preſent be permitted to unfold much, I may ſay I have ſeen clearly to my full ſatisfaction, that Moſes, in writing of creation, of the fall of man, and of things in the upright and in the fallen ſtate, wrote in the pure openings of divine light, though very little underſtood by men in the firſt nature and ſtate. It is alſo plain and evident to my mind, in the light, that the prophets ſaw things in the holy light of Jeſus, and ſpake of them in very inſtructive metaphors and expreſſions, though hid from and unperceived by the wiſe and learned.</p>
               <p>Many a ſermon has been preached by thoſe who call themſelves miniſters of Chriſt, upon
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:032810_0112_0FF5188A50C36990"/>
parts of paſſages out of the prophets, and the reſt of the ſcriptures; many heads of doctrine raiſed from them; many diviſions and ſub-diviſions made; much explanation attempted; and much art and oratory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played; and yet the life, marrow and main importance of the paſſage entirely unſeen and untouched by the ſpeaker, and little or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction conveyed to the hearers; and all for want of a ſpiritual diſcerning of the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning of the ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo the doctrines of Chriſt and his apoſtles, as to their moſt lively and ſpiritual ſignification, are to this day hid from the wiſe and prudent, and ſealed up with ſeven ſeals to all who witneſs not their opening By the lion of the tribe of Judah, who alone unſeals them. To theſe they are <hi>gradually</hi> opened, not <hi>all</hi> at once. <q>I have many things,</q> ſays this wonderful counſellor and opener, <q>to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them <hi>now.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John xvi. 12.</note> So he opens progreſſively, as we are able to receive, one ſeal after another. There are <hi>ſeven ſeals,</hi> becauſe none can ever come to the full underſtanding of the whole myſtery, and have <hi>all the book of life laid open,</hi> until they <hi>reſt,</hi> and <hi>ceaſe</hi> wholly from <hi>man,</hi> from <hi>themſelves,</hi> and all their own <hi>workings,</hi> gueſſings and conceivings, which ever will attend them more or leſs through the <hi>ſix working days,</hi> until they come to the complete <hi>ſabbath of reſt</hi> on the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> wherein
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:032810_0113_0FF52D1199DDF6A8"/>
they <q>reſt from their own works as God did from his.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. iv. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Here</hi> God becomes their <hi>all in all,</hi> their whole dependance for opening and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination; and therefore <hi>here</hi> the <hi>ſeventh ſeal</hi> is opened, and the heavenly myſtery diſcloſed.</p>
               <p>And now, in confirmation that this is the meaning of the number <hi>ſeven,</hi> as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all the ſeals that can poſſibly ſeal up divine truth from man,—let us obſerve, that when John calls upon him that has <hi>wiſdom,</hi> (divine wiſdom, for all elſe ever fails) to count the <hi>number of the beaſt,</hi> or the <hi>number of his name,</hi> which he expreſsly ſays 'is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a man,'<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xiii. 18.</note> he plainly ſhews us that the whole, the utmoſt number of a man, and of all his workings, buildings, comprehendings and conceivings, which make up the whole life, power, policy, religion and worſhip of the beaſt, is comprehended in ſixes—and that there is not one <hi>ſeven</hi> in it all. For, ſays he, his number is ſix hundred three-ſcore and ſix, that is, 666. Here we ſee, that although the workings of <hi>a man</hi> may be multiplied to ten times, and even an hundred times of the ſix working days, wherein he reſts not from his own works nor comes to the true ſabbath (wherein no creaturely work is done, not even a fire of his own ſparks or creaturely animation and warmth kindled) it is all but the number of the beaſt or falſe worſhip, and man-made creeds and ſyſtems. On the real Sabbath, wherein the true reſt from every
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032810_0114_0FF52C2E4D5740B0"/>
thing creaturely is witneſſed, and God is <hi>all in all,</hi> the worſhip is <hi>divine;</hi> the ſeals are opened even to the <hi>ſeventh;</hi> the myſtery is ſeen; God ſtands revealed to the ſoul; his works are known; and in the true knowledge of him, the beginning of eternal life is enjoyed even here on earth, for it is the real <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> not the ideal conceivings, that is the <hi>eternal life</hi> of immortal ſpirits. And until this is attained, do as much as we will in the <hi>ſixes,</hi> there is the <hi>one thing needful</hi> wanting, which, while it is <hi>wanting, cannot be numbered;</hi> for indeed we can never number or perceive it clearly, truly and fully, ſo long as the <hi>ſeventh ſeal</hi> remains unopened to us. For until they are all opened, we ſhall ever be liable to be gueſſing, contriving, inventing and hewing out broken ciſterns to ourſelves. Many may and do ſuppoſe the opening of the ſeals is only hereafter; but thoſe to whom they are opening and opened, know they have their opening here in time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſively: but this is only as God is <hi>waited upon.</hi> For unleſs we wait upon him for the opening, we are ever liable to obſcure our own minds and cloud our underſtandings by our own buſy workings and ſpeculations: And therefore at the opening of the ſeals, chap. vi. the call, 'come and ſee,' was divers times repeated; intimating that we muſt come quite away from our own notions and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, keep a ſingle eye to the light of life, waiting upon God in and through the divers openings.—In this attentive, ſingle, waiting
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032810_0115_0FF52BD28CBCE8F8"/>
ſtate, deep myſteries are opened. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of peace to the carnal mind, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings begin with the voice of thunder. For when the lamb opened the firſt ſeal, John 'heard as it were the voice of thunder,' ver. 1. For terrible things in judgment accompany that abaſement of creaturely pride and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion through which the vail is rent, and the ſeals that have ſhut up the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding opened. <q>Sion ſhall be redeemed with judgment.</q>

               </p>
               <p>In this work of redemption, renovation and removal of the ſeals, (for it goes on gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually together) the Lord who is light in himſelf, and ever dwells in the light, that is, in his own eſſence, appears to our minds as breaking through the clouds. The clouds are in us and not in him; and in diſpelling them, that ſo the ſeals may be opened, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ways of terror and amazement to the creature, repreſented by the 'noiſe of thunder.' Thus we read in another place, 'Clouds and darkneſs are round about him,'<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xcvii. 2.</note> and 'with God is <hi>terrible majeſty.'</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Job xxxvii. 22.</note> And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience abundantly confirmeth, that, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of the <hi>clouds,</hi> he often appears in <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible majeſty</hi> indeed; cauſing the thunders, and indeed before the whole myſtery is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, even <hi>ſeven thunders</hi> to <hi>utter their voices.</hi> Hence we find, chap. x. 1. John ſaw a 'mighty angel come down from heaven,' and though <q>a rainbow was upon his head,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:032810_0116_0FF52D29D2A95FD0"/>
and his face was as it were the ſun, and his feet as pillars of fire,</q> yet (Oh! divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) he was 'clothed with a cloud.' This cloud muſt be removed before the whole myſtery could be revealed; and in order to it, <q>he cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth; and when he had cried, ſeven thunders (note their number) uttered their voices.</q> Leſs than ſeven would have been ſhort of the complete reſt, wherein the whole myſtery is completed, <q>But in the days of the voice of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> angel, when he ſhall begin to ſound, the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed,</q> ſaid the holy angel, <q>as he hath declared to his ſervants the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</q> ſee ver. 7. But John was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <q>to ſeal up thoſe things which the ſeven thunders had uttered, and write them not,</q> ver. 4. This I believe is often the caſe for a ſeaſon. Some hints are allowed to be given; but as to the full declaration of divine things, it is often with the ſervants as with the maſter, <q>Mine hour is not yet come.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John ii. 4.</note> For though the time is to come, when that which 'is ſpoken in the ear,' ſhall be 'declared on the houſe-top;'<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xii. 3.</note> yet it is not always and at all times ſo to be—for it can never be with the divinely girded, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and directed ſervants of God, as with the letter-learned ſcribes and phariſees, whoſe 'time is always ready.'<note n="‡" place="bottom">John vii. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>At the opening of the ſecond ſeal, the call
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032810_0117_0FF52C2FE5338F40"/>
'come and ſee,' as at the opening of the firſt, is heard; for the <hi>waiting frame,</hi> the <hi>ſingle eye,</hi> is ſtill neceſſary: and now a 'great ſword' is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to him that ſat on the red horſe; and alſo <q>power was given him to take peace from the earth,</q> ver. 4. Some may ſuppoſe the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this opening by the red horſe confined ſo entirely to outward blood and bloody perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as to have no relation to the ſtate of their minds who experience the opening of the ſeals; but it is obvious to the enlightened mind, that many paſſages in ſcripture have both an outward or literal, and an inward and myſtical meaning; and there really is a ſword known, and peace taken from the earthly man in the rending of the vail and opening of the ſeals: a ſore trial indeed to ſuch as have not yet fully ſubmitted to have their carnal peace in the earthly natural ſtate bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and deſtroyed. But there is this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that however peace is taken from this ſtate, yet at the opening of the third ſeal, a charge is given, ver. 6. not to <q>hurt the oil nor the wine.</q> The precious things are ſafe through every tumult and trial, to all who rightly endure them. But though a little hope and conſolation is received now and then by ſuch manifeſtations of divine care and protection; yet new tribulations ſoon plunge the baptized ſoul into freſh and oft times greater conſternation.</p>
               <p>Thus at the opening of the next ſeal, his name, who rides the pale horſe, is <q>death;
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032810_0118_0FF52BEA21C13C40"/>
and hell followed with him,</q> ver. 8. Oh! this <hi>death,</hi> this dying to the firſt nature and will; to the life of ſelf, and all corrupt and ſelfiſh deſires and gratifications; it muſt be known and endured, that ſo the life, which is hid with Chriſt in God, may be enjoyed, which never was nor can ever be without dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him; and here the very pains and power of hell is felt, and takes hold of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thus, under the operation of this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary death, hell follows with it; ſo that the diſtreſſed creature, like Jonah, cries out of the belly of hell. And though I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or conceive it probable, or even conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the truth of God or of the very myſtery of divine things, that Chriſt, after his crucifixion, deſcended into hell; yet I have no doubt that, in the courſe of his ſufferings and agony, he really did feel, endure, and alſo conquer the force and power and pains of hell; and ſo muſt every ſoul in which the ſufferings of Chriſt that remain behind are thoroughly filled up: and until this is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, there is never a thorough riſing with him in the newneſs of life: but through death and burial with him, his reſurrection is known, and in the opening of this ſeal there is known, and painfully endured a killing, by various means, as <q>the ſword, hunger, death, and even the beaſts of the earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! what is it that does not riſe up to
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032810_0119_0FF52D80ED2E8740"/>
torment the poor ſoul! but all works toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the good of the faithful; no matter by what the neceſſary death is effected, nor by how many kinds of diſtreſs; the Lord it gracious through it all, and wounds to heal, yea, kills to make alive. Under the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe various modes, or meſſengers of death, the language often is, <q>Oh! wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 24.</note> It is painful endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſword to wound and ſlay; with pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hunger, and famiſhing want, and ſore afflictions from the beſtial part, which rages the more it is diſturbed by that which comes to take away its life, until the ſtrength of its wild nature is weakened and broken.</p>
               <p>After theſe ſore trials are in a good degree endured, the fifth ſeal opens, and brings to view the perſevering follower of the Lamb, the <hi>holy altar,</hi> and under it the <q>ſouls of thoſe that were ſlain for the word of God, and the teſtimony which they held,</q> ver. 9. Here the ſtate of ſufferings and perſecutions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by the righteous, is ſeen, and alſo the ſtate of rejoicing and triumph which follows after; for here they are heard, availingly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Almighty God, holy and true, for judgment, and ſeen clothed in white robes, even 'every one of them.'</p>
               <p>What an encouraging proſpect is this when opened in the true light, by the alone opener

               <p>Oh! the myſtery of godlineſs; it is great indeed, and never rightly underſtood by the carnal mind. To theſe the book is ever ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and none but he who has the key can open the ſeals. Carnal minded men may read of holy ſouls under the altar, and of their white robes, &amp;c. but to underſtand it, the inward eye muſt be opened, and the book unſealed—then the right underſtanding is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and therein divine encouragement is felt, to ſtand firm in the teſtimony of Jeſus, even though they ſhould be joined to the number of thoſe <q>fellow-ſervants and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that ſhould be killed,</q> ver. 11. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the poor pilgrim journeys on, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and revived; and is thus enabled to endure the remaining tribulations which are neceſſary for a full refinement, and in order to the removal of all that can be ſhaken, that that alone which cannot be ſhaken, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.—In order whereunto, he who knows how to carry on the work, diſpenſing the ſeveral parts and portions of probationary exerciſe in infinite wiſdom, and as they can be borne, ſoon brings on the fiery ordeal or purifying trial, to complete the emancipation of his tribulated ſeed, and bring out the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner with ſhouts of joy. For now the ſixth ſeal is opened, which leads through renewed

works of wonder and amazement, terror and abaſement, even to the ſtripping off of almoſt all that ever was attained: for now the earth is made to <hi>quake,</hi> the ſun itſelf is darkened, the moon becomes as blood, the ſtars fall from heaven, yea, the heaven departs as a ſcroll, and every mountain and iſland is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved—there ſeems nothing to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not ſo much as an iſland in the midſt of the boiſterous ocean, to ſet the ſole of the foot upon.—The drooping ſoul, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its late animating proſpects, now almoſt ſinks into deſpair; nor ſun nor moon nor ſtars ſhine in their uſual luſtre.</p>
               <p>This ſtate is like that of the bridegroom of ſouls, when he cried out, <q>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. xxvii. 46.</note> and the very ſame in degree that he then endured, when total darkneſs covered all the land from the ſixth hour unto the ninth, muſt all the ſeed endure.—The eternal light of heaven, the emanations of the divinity, are now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by fogs and clouds that intervene, and blackneſs or darkneſs overwhelms the mind. The fainter light of reaſon, the moon, affords no aid, nor ſcarcely ſhines, or ſhines dimly, as we ſee the outward moon through fogs and vapours, red almoſt as blood: for the weighed down mind is ſo diſtreſſed, toſſed up and down, that diſtraction or a ceſſation of intellectual arrangement ſeems almoſt ready to overſpread the whole man. And

moreover the example of the ſaints, the ſtars of paſt and preſent times, which in ſerener moments, greatly ſtayed the mind, and ſpread reviving light around, (for ſays Chriſt, ye are the light or lights of the world) yet now this is all hid, that there is ſcarce any thing that looks like light from any quarter. —This is truly in a ſenſe, the great day of God's wrath upon all in man that is not to dwell with him for ever.</p>
               <p>Now the very kings, the great, the rich, the mighty; the bond and the free, are ready to hide in dens, or wiſh to be covered by the mountains, from the face of the all-ſearching God. A time of trial, a ſeaſon of anxiety indeed, well known in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Lord's ſanctified ſervants.</p>
               <p>The more extenſive and general ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meaning of theſe myſterious meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, I am not at preſent to enter upon here; nor indeed is it very much our buſineſs as individuals to inquire. Suffice it to know pride hid from us, the haughtineſs of man laid low, and every exalted imagination brought thoroughly down. O! bleſſed, though for the preſent painful reduction! Rejoice, O! chriſtian traveller, when thou art ſo happy as to know the ſtronger bind the ſtrong and mighty in thee; yea, rejoice in the very pangs and probations through which all his goods and riches in thee are ſpoiled,—and be caſt out, with all his pomp, magnificence and

merchandize for ever.—For nothing ſhall be able to ſtand or abide his coming, but what cannot be ſhaken. The pure gold endures the fire, and is not hurt or leſſened in its brightneſs, worth or weight.—The redeemed ſoul that has endured the ſaving, cleanſing baptiſm of Jeſus, is by him made free; and theſe, and only theſe, <hi>are free indeed;</hi> and having endured the great day of wrath and judgment for ſin in themſelves, their works are gone beforehand to judgment; and they are not afraid of the day or wrath to the wicked; for perfect love caſts out all ſuch fear; they are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt; they have part in the firſt reſurrection, and the ſecond death hath no power over them. And now, having paſſed through the very hour and power of darkneſs; endured the fiery trial; drank the cup the crucified Saviour drank of, and being baptized with his baptiſm, they come to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he did after his temptations, the miniſtration of holy angels. Indeed he has promiſed all thoſe who continue with him in his temptations, a place in his kingdom; and as the angels miniſtered to him in the days of his fleſh, immediately after his ſore tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and trials, ſo is it in his brethren's expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; for after their deep abaſement and fiery baptiſm in the afflictive diſpenſation of the ſixth ſeal, their proſpects open into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the powers or miniſtring ſpirits that ſtand on and over all that is earthly; as John ſaw the four angels ſtanding on the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

of the earth. Now the <hi>four corners</hi> ſeem to comprehend the whole earth; and indeed it muſt all be ſhaken in us, if ever we know the new heavens and new earth, wherein dwells righteouſneſs: to theſe four angels it was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to <hi>hurt the earth and the ſea;</hi> not only all that is of earth or earthly, but alſo all that is of an unſtable nature, is liable to the ſtroke and muſt be chaſtiſed and ſubdued.

For ſing, O ye heavens! ye ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed of the Lord on earth, rejoice and praiſe the Lord, for this is the angel that has the ſeal of the living God. And now, after your many deep probations and ſeaſons of diſcouragements and diſtreſs, you are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered in the very moment of renewed trial, and of total deſtruction to all that can be ſhaken and removed; yea, the ſealing angel is now, at the very juncture of diſmay, ſent forth, commiſſioned from on high, to ſtay the hurting of the earth and ſea, until he ſealeth you in your foreheads—even with a loud voice he crieth <q>to the four angels, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hurt not the earth, neither the ſea nor the trees, until we have ſealed the ſervants of our God in their foreheads.</q>

and underſtand the remaining wonders—the ſoundings of the angels—the meaſure of the temple—the leaving out of the outward court—the woman clothed with the ſun— the dragon's tail, and many other deep myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which are never clearly underſtood, but as he that has the key of David opens them. But as far as needful he fails not to open them to all who follow him in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, whereſoever he leadeth them; who are redeemed from the earth, and from among men. Theſe ſhall ſtand with him on Mount Sion, and having their Father's name written in their foreheads, ſhall ſing the new ſong, receive the bleſſing of thoſe who obey his commands, have a right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the City. —They ſhall reſt from their labours, and their works ſhall follow them.</p>
               <p>Great part of the Revelations, as well as other myſterious ſcriptures, is livingly known in the work and progreſs of regeneration, and therein found very pertinent and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in regard to the many exerciſes, pangs, probations and deliverances, which attend the ſoul in its ſeaſons of refinement, and gradual renovation.—And all this hinders not, but well conſiſts, with the more outward meaning and fulfilment of ſuch parts of ſacred record, ſo far as they really reſpect things outward: but I am firm in the faith, that many are muſing and gazing after outward fulfilments, to the very great and ſometimes injurious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion

of their minds from the only work, and fulfilment of many paſſages, which they may ever properly expect to experience. The ſcripture is a ſealed book; it is abundantly wrapped up in parable, metaphor and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—yea many, very many things in it, which men whoſe minds are outward will read and underſtand of outward things, are mainly meant of internal operations, diſcoveries and overturnings, which God in his dealings with the ſoul, leads it along through.—He that hath an ear, let him hear,—is a very proper intimation, and is therefore often repeated, that the mind may be directed to an inward hearkening, in order to a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for many have eyes, but ſee not; and ears, but hear not. The eye and ear that ſees and hears divine things rightly, muſt be divinely opened. Many are blind becauſe they think they ſee; and deaf, by reaſon of their confidence that they hear. Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was and is, that thoſe who ſee and hear may be made blind and deaf; and that the blind and deaf may ſee and hear; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are theſe who are made blind and deaf by him; for it is as needful to true ſeeing and hearing, to be firſt made blind and deaf, as wounding is neceſſary to healing, and killing to being made alive. He that will be wiſe, muſt firſt become a fool that he may be wiſe, and he that will ſee and hear, muſt firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come blind and deaf.</p>
               <p>O, it is a great thing to know that eye and

                  <note place="margin">6th mo. 12. 1784.</note>I Have divers times lately very clearly ſeen the great folly of thinking ourſelves of much importance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in religious ſociety, or in the world. O may my ſoul dwell ever in true abaſement; for bleſſed and happy is he that knows a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought down, yea, down low, and there abiding; for until all ſelf-exaltation is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted out of our minds, we are not what God would have us to be; and his turning and overturning in us, is in order, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, thus to make us; and until we do, from the centre of our ſoul, give him <hi>all</hi> the glory, there remains in us a ſource of unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, diſorder and confuſion.—O man! how great is the work of thy ſalvation; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deaths thou haſt to die, before that comes to reign in thee which lives for ever;—for know thou, that thou canſt never fully enjoy that life which is hid with Chriſt in God, until thou dieſt to thy own ſelfiſh life.

Lord! when it ſhall pleaſe thee, awake them, arouſe and alarm them, that they may ariſe from their lethargy, and be enabled to look and behold Jeruſalem a quiet habitation, and be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, pure and perfect, into the communion and fellowſhip of her ranſomed ſons—where thou, O moſt holy, ruleſt God over all, and ſelf-exaltation finds no admittance.</p>
               <p>Having for ſome time paſt, felt drawings in my mind to pay a religious viſit to Friends of Oblong and Nine-Partners quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and perceiving a like concern in my friend Daniel Aldrich, of our monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Uxbridge, we laid our proſpects before our brethren at home, and obtaining their certificates of concurrence from our monthly and quarterly meetings, I left my dear wife
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032810_0133_0FF52D554F7AE018"/>
and family in much heart-felt tenderneſs and affection, the 19th of the 7th month 1784, and rode that night to my ſaid friend Daniel's houſe about nine miles; and next morning, taking our ſolid leave of his family, we got on our way between forty and fifty miles to Coventry, in Connecticut. 21ſt, we got to Litchfield, near fifty miles, and next day the 22d got to Friends fifth-day meeting at New-Milford, upwards of twenty miles, though we knew not that there was a meeting there of courſe that day, but the probability made us preſs on a little, ſo that we reached it ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; it was very ſmall and ſilent. I ſuppoſe it not far from one hundred and thirty miles from my home to this meeting, and near all the way among Preſbyterians, who uſed us civilly; and I have reaſon to believe there is much more openneſs and charity in many of their minds towards Friends than formerly.</p>
               <p>Next day, 23d, had a meeting at Oblong. This meeting was open and favoured—I felt engaged to encourage ſome who I believe had felt ſomething of the operation of the fiery furnace, to keep in it, and not give back, until it had purified and refined them.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of 7th month 1784, we were at the valley meeting. I ſuffered the meeting through, under a cloſe exerciſe, but could not find a way ſufficiently open to attempt to clear my mind by publick teſtimony; thence we rode to my dear uncle Thomas Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock's,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032810_0134_0FF52BEF524D70A8"/>
and next day being firſt-day the 25th, were at Peachpond meeting. After meeting we dined at a Friend's houſe, and had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured opportunity in the family among a number of young and a few elderly perſons.</p>
               <p>Second-day 26th, Rode to Andrew Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt's, where Friends hold a meeting for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Here we had an open meeting, wherein they were tenderly entreated to more ardency of engagement in the things that belong to their peace, and warned of the danger of loving any thing more than Chriſt; and we parted with them in great good will, they having been moſtly reached and tendered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſenſe of the ownings of the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and Biſhop of ſouls. We then attended the meeting at Shappaqua, which was a memorable time—may we never forget the loving kindneſs of him without whom we can do nothing.—He it is that opens the ſealed book, and gives ability to dip into the ſtates of meetings, and drop a word ſuitably thereto.—O, that our dependance may ever be upon him, for, as it is, we ſhall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the inſufficiency of human greatneſs, worldly wiſdom, ſelf-importance or creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrivance, and I have reaſon to believe that, as it was our engagement this day, thus to bow before him, wait upon him, and move in his movings, we were made inſtrumental to reach the pure witneſs in many hearts; and to leave impreſſions on them that will not ſoon be forgotten.—After meeting we had a

family ſitting nearly in ſilence. I felt great caution not to move in words, unleſs a freſh opening induced me, fearing I might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried too far in the fulneſs of this day's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as I believe I have ſeen ſome who have kept running on in the ſtrength of what was at firſt a true opening, until they have bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their own minds, and brought ſorrow and confuſion upon themſelves. Oh! how ſtrict a watch is neceſſary leſt we take our flight upon the ſabbath-day.—Lord preſerve us in a conſtant dependance upon thee, and the openings of thy holy Spirit!</p>
               <p>7th month 28th and 29th. We attended the ſelect quarterly meeting at the Purchaſe, and their quarterly meeting for worſhip and diſcipline; in which my tongue, as it were, clave to the roof of my mouth; yet was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to keep in a good degree in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.—After which we attended meetings at Mamaroneck, Weſt-Cheſter, Purchaſe, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mawalk, New-Cornwall, New-Marlborough, Crum-Elbow, Nine-Partners, at the Creek and Little Nine-Partners, ſome of which were painful exerciſing ſeaſons; but in others we experienced a good degree of the dominion of truth over all, particularly at the laſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where the love of truth was felt ſweetly to flow towards a pretty large gathering, moſtly not of our ſociety, and the doctrines thereof were opened among them in a good degree of life and demonſtration.</p>
               <p>

We went to the ſelect preparative meeting at Nine-Partners, compoſed of the miniſters and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the two monthly meetings of Creek and Nine-Partners. The affairs of this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were conducted in a degree of the ſavour of truth.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 11th, attended the ſelect quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting to pretty good ſatisfaction. I felt truth's dominion over all in my mind, and rejoiced in the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</p>
               <p>5th-day 12th, attended the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for worſhip and diſcipline at the ſame place where the two foregoing ſelect meetings were held. The 13th, a meeting was appointed for us at Oſwego, which was a pretty full meeting, in which the current of goſpel love, power and utterance, flowed freely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhingly; it was indeed a precious oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and ought to be remembered with thankfulneſs to the great Opener and Leader, who out of weakneſs makes ſtrong—Bleſſed be the Lord. The next day were at a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Appoughquague, and 15th, being firſt-day, we were again at meeting at Peachpond, on ſecond-day at the valley, and third-day at one called the upper meeting held at Iſaiah Hoag's, which was a very exerciſing meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, after deep travail, we were aſſiſted and enabled to ſound an alarm among them in a degree of goſpel authority; and though

I believe we felt truth and the ſeed of life under oppreſſion; yet as we lay low with it, and were made willing to ſuffer with it, we were enabled to witneſs it to reign in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 18th. Were at the monthly meeting at Nine-Partners; ſome cloſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe attended the fore part of this meeting in ſilent ſuffering with the ſuffering ſeed, but Truth roſe into dominion to the joy of our ſouls, wherein we had to call the people to an inward, awful ſtillneſs and attention, leſt they be diſappointed as to meeting with the maſter of our aſſemblies, and alſo as to being benefited with or by the true goſpel miniſtry; for thoſe who can only run when the Lord ſends them, are often cloſed up in profound ſilence by the outward expectations of the people, not having liberty, as they keep to the openings and ſhuttings of him who has the key of David, to gratify thoſe itching ears. —This and conſiderable more they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded of. In the meeting for diſcipline, both men's and women's, (for we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to go into theirs) they were adviſed to keep to their own gifts, and not depend upon one another, to the neglect of occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own talents, leſt they as individuals, and the meeting at large, ſuffer loſs thereby, and ſome forward ſpirits be puſhed forward into too great activity in a formal manner by the backwardneſs and withholding of others. Friends were adviſed to be no longer graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:032810_0138_0FF52C0A0F4443A0"/>
after things unneceſſary; for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of them leads us into much care, cumber and expenſe of time, thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon the time we ought to ſpend at meetings, viſiting the ſick, &amp;c. and cuts us off from ſufficient time for inward retirement in our families, as well as taking care of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the church. Now all theſe ſervices, when rightly engaged in, greatly tend to our growth and refinement, and real comfort and happineſs in this life and hereafter; as alſo to the promotion of the cauſe of truth in the earth. Oh! how mortals grovel here in earth and earth's perplexing cares, to their great loſs of more ſubſtantial enjoyments; whereas, if willing to be bounded by the girdle of truth, we might have plenty of time for all our religious duties, and have ſufficient to ſpare to educate our children. We were alſo concerned to caution againſt keeping ſuperfluities and gay things to ſell to others.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day 19th. Attended the adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſaid meeting to pretty good ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—20th, attended the Creek monthly meeting, after which we attended meetings at Cloverick, Coeman's Patent, New-Britain, Eaſt-Hooſack, White Creek, Saratoga, and at a Place called Pitts-Town, where there is no ſettled meeting, which ended to good ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>On firſt-day the 5th of 9th month, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended meeting at Danby, where I thought
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:032810_0139_0FF52DA25058C0E0"/>
truth triumphed and had the dominion; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minds were reached and tendered.—2d-day 6th, we appointed a meeting at a place called Durham, about twelve miles north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Danby, of which notice was given, and we attended it accordingly, and had ſatisfactory ſervice therein, though among a people not much acquainted with Friends, and exceedingly outward in their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and unacquainted with the advantages of inward waiting in ſolemn ſilence upon God.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day 9th. Attended the preparative meeting at Danby, at the cloſe of which we ſat a few minutes, the men and women to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; this was a little, comfortable ſeaſon, divers minds being refreſhed in this our part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opportunity. 6th-day, 10th of 9th month, we took our affectionate leave of our dear friends, and ſet forward for home, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by our beloved friend E. S. My mind was much affected at and after parting with Friends, with great tenderneſs and tears of joy, which, for a conſiderable ſpace of time, flowed copiouſly from mine eyes. My mind was carried back to view the places where we had viſited, and my ſoul was melted into ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mental ſupplication for the preſervation of Friends in general, and many individuals in particular; attended with ſuch endeared affection and brokenneſs of ſpirit, as has rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been my lot to witneſs for ſo long a time together. Oh! with what heart-felt fervency
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:032810_0140_0FF52D2668B04A50"/>
did I intercede for the help and preſervation of the little flock and family up and down in the world! the earneſt requeſts that I was enabled to put up for the inſtruction and divine aſſiſtance of the many meſſengers of the Lord which are running to and fro in the earth among the people, that their labours may prove ſucceſsful, and benefit the ſouls of mankind: indeed the language of ſolemn ſupplication ran powerfully through my mind with a melting ſenſibility for all; that the dead might be raiſed, quickened and made alive, in that life which is hid with Chriſt in God. Many individuals of my acquaintance, both in places where I had viſited abroad, and alſo at home in our own and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monthly meetings, came freſh into my remembrance with ſuch ardency of deſire, and breathings of ſoul, for their growth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and improvement, as will not readily be conceived by ſuch as have not felt the ſame. Yea, my deſires for them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in intelligent language in the ſecret of my ſoul, in a number of little, ſhort, though ſweet and melting requeſts for one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Father of Spirits brought them to my remembrance. O! how often did it flow through me as a ſtream of life on this wiſe: <q>O moſt mighty and omnipotent Lord God, commiſſionate thine holy angels to attend and guard thy exerciſed pilgrims through this vale of tears: let cherubims and ſeraphims encamp about and ſurround the little hoſt of militants, thy wreſtling
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:032810_0141_0FF52CCE9434D618"/>
ſeed while here on earth and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</q> O! how did my boſom heave with ſwelling tides of joy and divine delight! yea, all that was in me moved!—my head, my heart, yea, my whole man ſeemed encircled round with ſpiritual attendants! whoſe melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and extatic ſongs of praiſe enraptured my ſoul, and lifted me above all earth's tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous cares and all its fading joys! and in the midſt of this triumphant adoration, my eyes were opened to ſee and view the depths of ſufferings and abaſement which my ſoul had paſſed through in my viſit; then did I ſee that the true wreſtling ſeed of Jacob can never rejoice, but through ſufferings; abound, but through abaſement; nor live and reign with the Lamb that was dead and is alive, but through death. I then was given to behold as it were around me, as I rode on the way, an innumerable multitude of glorified ſpirits; and it was ſaid in the centre of my ſoul, <q>theſe are they which came out of great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, have waſhed their robes, and made them white, in the blood of the Lamb,</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. vii. 14.</note> their ever-living Redeemer. I ſaw that I muſt yet longer endure the cup of ſufferings in this houſe of clay, if I would join the ſongs of thoſe ranſomed ſouls in never-ending an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems of praiſe; to which I bowed my head and heart, ſaying, Lord, let not thine eye pity, nor thy hand ſpare, until thou haſt done away all that offends in me, and brought forth judgment unto victory in my ſoul: and
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:032810_0142_0FF52DA3E7300350"/>
when I had thus ſubmitted and offered up body, ſoul and ſpirit, into his holy hands, a willing ſacrifice, it was ſhewed me how good it had been for me that I had ſo deeply ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; and that, had it been otherwiſe, I ſhould have miſſed of this feaſt of fat things. Next it was ſhewed me, that though I had not altogether done the beſt that I might have done while on this viſit, yet that I had been preſerved in the meekneſs, littleneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; and, to my inexpreſſible ſatisfaction, I was alſo ſhewed, and made to ſee, feel and know, that nothing was laid to my charge as an offence to ſtand againſt me; but feeling there was now no condemnation to my ſoul, I was made to join the heavenly harmony; and, in that angelic ſpring of adoration which I felt, my ſoul within me leapt for joy, and, at the end of this tranſporting chorus, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt language was—<q>ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes, Amen, Amen, hallelujah!</q> At which it ſeemed as if the whole expanſe of heaven rang with acclamations of joy, thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and praiſe! After which I again had freedom to enter into innocent and pleaſant converſation with my two friends, which I had not done for miles before as we rode on the way; but I kept the viſion pretty much to myſelf, ſave what of its effects they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in my countenance, and the tears I had ſhed, which I had not power to reſtrain.— Lord, never ſuffer me to forget thy favours and divine communications—but as thou haſt begun to clothe my mind with humility, be
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032810_0143_0FF52DA7EFDC3668"/>
pleaſed more and more to centre me deep into it; that I may wear it as a garment for ever.</p>
               <p>We rode over the green mountain this day, in the ſtate of Vermont, through which it runs, takes its name from it, importing a green mount; it is called about thirty miles over.—Lodged in Townſend.—7th-day 11th, we rode near forty miles to Richmond.—1ſt-day 12th, we attended Friends meeting at Richmond.—2d-day 13th, we rode forty-five miles, and on 3d-day 14th of 9th month, home. Was thankfully rejoiced to find my dear wife and family well, having been from home eight weeks yeſterday, rode about eight hundred miles, and attended religious meetings forty days.</p>

               <p>AFTER my return from the foregoing viſit to Friends of Oblong and Nine-Partners quarterly meetings, I had to paſs through much probationary leanneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward want, and at times through deep and various exerciſes; but I had not been long at home, before a concern began to revive and ſpread in my mind, which I had had ſome view of for ſeveral years, to wit, to make a viſit to Friends of Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey; and at times it was freſh with me, but without a clear proſpect of the time when. Thus time paſſed on; and in ſome of our meetings for worſhip, the weight of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice would reſt on me as ſomething almoſt too great for my weak ſtate: but I was moſtly favoured to ſee that ability for ſuch ſervices was not in the creature, but in God; and then I could caſt my care on him alone, and give up; and thus ſubmitting, I felt or ſaw but little about it for ſome length of time; but about the 4th, 5th and 6th months 1785, it was much with me; but yet I could not ſee clearly about the time when to proceed. And at our yearly meeting at Newport, in the 6th month, as I ſat in a meeting for worſhip one
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:032810_0145_0FF52C89C8A4AD50"/>
day, it revived with the moſt clearneſs that I had ever ſeen it, inſomuch that I had a query in my mind, whether it would not be ripe to proceed to the yearly meeting at Philadelphia in the ninth month following, but this paſſing off, I thought I would not yet open it to any perſon. But after this meeting my dear friend Joſeph Mitchell aſked me if I had not ſome thoughts of going to Pennſylvania, &amp;c. on a religious viſit. I anſwered him, <q>I have had ſuch thoughts, but believe nobody would yet have known any thing of it, had not the queſtion been put to me.</q> He told me he felt ſuch an engagement to aſk me, that he believed it was right for him ſo to do, and then he opened his proſpect of ſuch a viſit, which agreed with mine; and told me it had been with him in the meeting we had juſt ſat in more feelingly than at almoſt any other time. So we concluded to keep our proſpects very much in our own boſoms; and after a few days we had a few words more together, when I found he had felt but little of it ſince we converſed about it; but before our yearly meeting ended, I had ſome freſh revivals of it again.</p>
               <p>About this time I had ſome trying exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in the courſe of my practice of phyſick; but I found patience was good in theſe caſes, and that divine wiſdom was profitable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect therein. I think I may alſo mention, that, after all my paſt experience of heavenly good and divine favour, I had to encounter
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:032810_0146_0FF52CDB38950BE0"/>
ſome of the moſt trying and potently preſſing temptations of my ſoul's enemy that ever I endured; even ſo that I often for months al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſpaired of overcoming. Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth. be not high-minded; but fear. Let none think themſelves ſafe off the watch, becauſe of any degree of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and favour. The watch-tower remains to be our place of ſafety; neither let any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt mind be too much diſheartened at the aſſaults of Satan.—There is a power above him, and he that cleaves cloſe to it ſhall know a victory over all the powers of darkneſs, and therein witneſs that there is no enchantment againſt the rightly wreſtling Jacob, nor divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation againſt God's faithful dependant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering Iſrael.—This I think my ſoul has a right to ſet its ſeal to, as I have ever come off victorious, when I have not turned my back upon the light, our divine Leader. Sing, O ye heavens! and O ye pilgrims on the earth rejoice and triumph! for ſtrong and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the God of our ſalvation; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient for our help is the grace af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us!—let all but keep to it, and then ſafe are their ſteppings, and ſure their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation—for, however ſevere their trials, the Lord will be near them; and indeed in the midſt of temptation he will often lift up a ſtandard that will vanquiſh all the influence of every evil ſpirit, and ſet the ſoul on the everlaſting foundations that cannot be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.—O, how often did the unſlumbering Shepherd of Iſrael, the great Biſhop of ſouls,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032810_0147_0FF52D283A026338"/>
ariſe for my deliverance, when I ſeemed to myſelf juſt ready to fall a victim to the grand adverſary! how did he not only give power of reſiſtance; but fill my ſoul with the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of his love beyond all expreſſion! worthy for ever to be waited for, worſhipped and obeyed, is the Lord, the God of Iſrael; the mighty Friend of the faithful!</p>
               <p>My proſpects of a viſit to Pennſylvania, &amp;c. continuing, and the time to proceed therein appearing to me to be ſome time preceding the yearly meeting at Philadelphia 1786, I endeavoured to be given up to it; but the thoughts of parting with my dear wife, and tender little children, wrought ſo upon me that I ſeemed to hold back again, after giving up ſeveral times, until in the winter preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid yearly meeting, I was viſited with ſevere ſickneſs for a month, inſomuch that many thought I ſhould not recover. In the time of this illneſs I intelligibly heard in the ſecret of my ſoul, in ſilence and ſtillneſs, this awful language, <q>ſet thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and not live.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Kings xx. 1.</note> This, though plain and alarming, did not at all ſtrike my mind with a belief that I was ſoon to leave the body; but two things ſeemed ſpecially to be ſet before me: 1ſt, Though I had a written will by me, very nearly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my mind, yet as it was not quite ſo, one ſenſe of the word, <q>ſet thine houſe in order,</q> was to me as much as <q>make thy
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:032810_0148_0FF52BD474912F10"/>
will;</q> whereupon I ſent for a Friend, who by my deſire, and according to my direction, wrote another for me, which was ſoon ſigned and witneſſed to my ſatisfaction. 2d. I was fully ſatisfied that it was the Lord's will that I ſhould be given up to the viſit mentioned above, and that I ſhould <hi>ſet my houſe in ſuch order</hi> as to leave my family and <hi>affairs.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this I gave up fully to the heavenly viſion, and never afterwards turned my back upon it, nor dared to depart from my covenant, <q>that if he would be my God, be with me, and preſerve me and mine, I would be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and follow him whitherſoever he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lead me.</q> However, though I durſt not refuſe to go on his errand, I often had low times, wherein I almoſt loſt ſight of the once clear proſpect; yet it would again and again revive in ſuch a manner as convinced me that my peace was in it, and even that my livelihood, ſpiritually, as much conſiſted in faithfully labouring for daily bread, and that in the way of truth's requirings, as my outward living or ſupport depended on an honeſt induſtry. For if we will not improve our ſtrength and abilities to this purpoſe, then <q>the ſluggard that will not plow, ſhall beg in harveſt, and have nothing;</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xx. 4.</note> and on the other hand, though we labour ever ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, if the Lord withholds his bleſſing, how fruitleſs are all our labours!—ſo in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals—<q>the man is not without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032810_0149_0FF52CB6A2B53548"/>
Lord;</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Cor. xi. 11.</note> i. e. Chriſt is not without the church, nor the church without him in the work of religion; nor indeed is any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual ſoul without him, nor he without that individual, in the work of ſalvation; but he worketh in the ſoul, and through him the ſoul worketh out its own ſalvation. Here is a bleſſed co-operation; and the very reaſon why the creature can and does, in a ſenſe, <hi>work out his own ſalvation,</hi> is becauſe <hi>God worketh in him,</hi> begetting the will, and giving ability to <hi>do</hi> the <hi>deed;</hi> but if after all <hi>he will not,</hi> it will fare with him as with Jeruſalem, who might often have been gathered, but they <hi>would not;</hi> wherefore their houſe was left unto them deſolate, and the things that belonged to their peace hid from their eyes.</p>
               <p>Now, after paſſing through various exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and finally witneſſing a full ſubmiſſion to the divine will, in regard to giving up all to follow him in this religious viſit, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the approbation of our monthly and quarterly meetings. I took leave of my dear wife and tender little children, in the fear of the Lord, and in fulneſs of endeared na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection, on the 21ſt of the 7th month 1786, and rode to Providence, thence next day to South-Kingſton, next day, being firſt of the week, I met my beloved friend Joſeph Mitchell, and, after meeting, we rode on to Stoningtown in the ſtate of Connecticut, and next day to New-London,—and thence by
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032810_0150_0FF52C1701D5C1D0"/>
water to Southold on Long-Iſland, next day rode about fifty miles, and towards noon the day following, got to Bethpage, and on the morrow, attended a meeting appointed for us there. Joſeph had good ſervice—I was ſhut up as to words, but had clear openings. It is ſometimes wiſely ordered, that precious and divine openings are treaſured up in the Lord's treaſury; but how dangerous would it be to ſquander them away, and laviſh them out among people, only becauſe we are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the openings, however clear and even inſtructive, without the word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the divine neceſſity, to deliver them to the people.</p>
               <p>Next day we got to Weſtbury quarterly meeting; on 6th-day Joſeph ſaid a little to good purpoſe among them in the meeting for diſcipline, and a few words at the adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſelect meeting; but I was ſilent through all the meetings.—7th-day we had a meeting at Oyſter-Bay, and another at Mati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicock in the afternoon—the firſt was heavy, but Matinicock was more favourable, and I believe we both had ſome favourable ſervice there, to the lukewarm and careleſs, and in the way of encouragement to a few ſincere-hearted worſhippers.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day we were at Weſtbury, to good ſatisfaction; called many to a deeper exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and feelingly invited the youth to a life of religion.—2nd-day we had a meeting at
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032810_0151_0FF52C8B7433EC10"/>
Cow-Neck, a pretty favoured time, though we both had to ſearch Jeruſalem, as it were with candles, and to drop things very cloſe and urgent; yet we alſo had the comfortable language of invitation and encouragement to the dear youth, ſome of whom ſeemed ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly affected. Before this meeting we had a family opportunity in the morning at a Friend's houſe, and had to labour againſt a ſpirit of grandeur, and high-mindedneſs, and felt great peace in the faithful diſcharge of our duty, and eſpecially in a ſpring of living encouragement to a ſteady perſeverance in true humility and meekneſs, which flowed freſh and lively to a few preſent, who we felt to be already in a good degree enamoured with a proſpect thereof. Third-day we had a meeting at the widow Mott's, an elderly Friend. Fifth-day, being the 3d of the 8th month, we attended Fluſhing monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a mournful time it was to me, though Joſeph had to ſound a little alarm among them. We went the next day to Newtown, where a meeting was appointed for us. Few Friends live here.—I thought, as I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to clear openings, the matter was too deep for moſt preſent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as if I, poor weak worm, could ſteer my own courſe better than the great Pilot, or better ſuit my ſubject to the ſtates of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I ſtepped aſide from the opening, and with a view to condeſcend to the people's conditions, ſtruck upon more familiar and more common matters, in illuſtrating truth's
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:032810_0152_0FF52CDEA4C32DB8"/>
gradual teachings; but alas! I found <note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. x. 23.</note> it is truly <hi>not in man that walketh to direct his own ſteps</hi> in this great work, for inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the people in it, I ſoon dried up the ſpring of life I felt before; and I ſat down in a degree of ſhame and confuſion, being taught thereby to <hi>truſt in the Lord with all my heart, and lean not</hi> to my own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>After this went to New-York, it being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day, and Friends holding two meetings there of courſe on firſt-day, ſtaid until then, at both which Joſeph had pretty good ſervice, but I was entirely ſhut up in ſilence. Third-day 8th, had a meeting at Rahway—my dear companion was favoured in a cloſe ſearching teſtimony to ſome, and comfortable encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to others. A wide field of doctrine was opened before me, wherein, for ſome time, I expected it would be my lot to labour; but as I waited, not willing to proceed in the opening, however clear, without the word of command, it cloſed again; ſo I was ſilent, ſave that I juſt informed the meeting how it had been with me. 4th-day 9th, we attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friends preparative meeting at Plainfield; my mouth was opened in an alarming teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony among them in the meeting for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip—and Joſeph's in ſolemn ſupplication, that the <hi>laſt days</hi> of ſuch as had long been gathering ruſt, might, by the fire and the hammer, be their beſt days. 6th-day 11th,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032810_0153_0FF52C9A4E994248"/>
had an exerciſing meeting at Shrewſbury. Seventh-day 12th, we had a meeting at Squancum.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 13th. We were at Squan meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it was a very ſtripping time to me.— 3d-day 15th, had a very laborious meeting at Barnagat, though a few exerciſed Friends belong there. 4th-day 16th, another ſuch at Little Egg-Harbour—here we ſaw our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient worthy friend Ann Guant, who had twice viſited New-England in the work of the miniſtry—ſhe ſeemed lively in old age, and her company was pleaſant. Fifth-day 17th, we attended their mid-week meeting at Great Egg-Harbour, where Joſeph had good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Sixth-day 18th, had a meeting at the other meeting-houſe in Great Egg-Harbour —here it was my lot to have a good open time both in teſtimony and ſupplication. 7th-day 19th, had another open meeting at Cape-May in the morning to pretty good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Hence we rode to Mark Reeve's in Cohanſey. We found him recovering from great bodily illneſs, and in a ſweet diſpoſition of mind. He was one of the firſt travellers whoſe miniſtry was powerfully reaching to my mind, when he was in our parts many years paſt on a religious viſit with Stephen Comfort. It was very comfortable to be a little in company and ſweet converſation with the only one of the two now living.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 20th.. We attended their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:032810_0154_0FF52C8820C57B08"/>
held at Greenwich.—2d day 21ſt, we had a meeting at Alloways-Creek. The ſtate of ſuch as thought themſelves rich <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed</hi> in goods, &amp;c. and yet had too much neglected to buy 'gold tried in the fire,' that they might be rich, and 'white raiment,' that they might be clothed, ſprang freſh in my mind; yet I believe there is a remnant among them, who are in a good degree alive in the truth—may theſe be ſtrengthened, and their number increaſed. This meeting, though very painful and dull in the fore part, was comfortably refreſhing in the concluſion. —3d-day 22d, we had a bleſſed, heavenly meeting at Salem, though my dear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion was quite ſhut up; but my mind was much opened and enlarged; and much I had to do among them in the flowings of divine favour—Bleſſed be the great helper. 4th-day 23d, we had another favoured meeting at Piles-Grove,—at leaſt my own way ſeemed very open, and my mind favoured in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable degree, after ſome time of exerciſe in ſilence: but Joſeph was ſtill ſhut up—5th day 24th, had a good open meeting at Upper-Greenwich where truth favoured with matter and utterance, to pretty good ſatisfaction.— 6th-day 25th, we had another pretty good meeting at Woodbury, though I did not feel quite ſo well ſatisfied with my own teſtimony as at ſome other times; yet I had a degree of peace—7th-day 26th, we attended the ſelect quarterly meeting at Burlington.—Firſt-day 27th, attended the ſore and afternoon meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032810_0155_0FF52C691E61E4A0"/>
for worſhip, ſuffering great inward want and diſtreſs: but through a degree of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience was enabled to endure it. Joſeph ſeemed comfortable, had a little to do in the meeting, and could converſe pleaſantly with his friends after it; while I was ſo ſhut up that, though ſome of them felt near to me, I could ſcarce uſe any freedom with any of them; indeed I feared they would think my reſerve was affected: but truly it was not; I tried divers times to uſe a little pleaſant freedom; but the more I tried, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ſhut up I felt, and even ſeemed to myſelf to act like a fool when I attempted to uſe freedom; therefore I gave up to be as I could be, and to endure this ſhutting up with all the patience I poſſibly could, as from the hand of God, for what purpoſe I knew not.</p>
               <p>Second-day 28th. Attended the quarterly meeting, going into it under great weakneſs and want; but ſoon after ſitting down, the power of the word of life aroſe, in freſhneſs and dominion, with an opening clear and living; wherein I felt a neceſſity to ſtand up and proclaim the word of the Lord among them. But it being a very large meeting, and ſeveral great and eminent miniſters of the goſpel preſent, it was no ſmall croſs to me to appear among them; however I was pretty ſoon made willing to yield to the preſſing motions of truth, and therein ſtanding up, was favoured to ſpeak cloſely to the ſtates of ſuch as had not been faithful to divine mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032810_0156_0FF52D6E69D073D8"/>
and even ſome who had known their heads to be crowned as it were with crowns of gold, and yet had ſo fallen ſhort that, if they did not ariſe and trim their lamps, I believed the kingdom would be rent from them, their crowns taken from their heads, and given to others that were better than they; but I had alſo a comfortable proſpect of many truly tender religious minds preſent, and hopeful young people a valuable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and it opened in me to ſay, I believed the children were already born who would live to ſee a better day, and enjoy the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading canopy of divine love in a more eminent degree, through faithfulneſs, than what many now do. It was a precious and heavenly opportunity, and divers living teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were borne by brethren preſent, to the rejoicing of many hearts.</p>
               <p>Third-day 29th. We attended the youths meeting at this place—a large, comfortable, inſtructive meeting it was. We were both ſilent; but truths teſtimony was livingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by two or three goſpel miniſters of this land, or of Pennſylvania: after which we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the adjournment of the ſelect meeting to a good degree of ſatisfaction—4th-day 30th, were at the ſelect quarterly meeting at the Falls, for Bucks County in Pennſylvania, where we had ſome cloſe hints to drop; but hope there is a living remnant among them.— 5th-day 31ſt, attended their quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where my mind was favoured in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:032810_0157_0FF52C9EDE6EBDB0"/>
to the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, as effectually witneſſed in and by many in our and our fore-fathers days; and which, as I believe, will yet more abundantly be witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the nations; for I do believe the Lord is ariſing to ſhake terribly the earth, and that multitudes will be brought to the inward knowledge of this glorious truth, <q>Chriſt in you, the hope of glory.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Coloſ. i. 27.</note> Joſeph was ſilent in the meeting for public worſhip; but our dear friend John Lloyd bore a living teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony among us, and a good time it was.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day, 9th month 1ſt. Attended the youths meeting here—a pretty favoured time on the whole. Joſeph had good ſervice in lively teſtimony among them. I was quite calm and eaſy, without a word in that way. After this we attended the adjournment of the ſelect meeting to pretty good ſatisfaction. —7th day, 2d of the month, we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Makefield, where, after deep exerciſe, truth roſe at length into great dominion, and divers living teſtimonies were borne to the great tendering of many minds, eſpecially among the youth,—many of whom were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and preſſingly and powerfully perſuaded to chooſe the Lord for their portion. Indeed it was a precious time to them, and a large number of them were very much reached and broken—may they live under a ſenſe of it. Backſliders were alſo preſſingly warned, and truth was over all—bleſſed be the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032810_0158_0FF52C76EFF81EF0"/>
helper of the truly dependant, for he is their only hope, and their rock of defence in all their exerciſes; and they learn and know, from multiplied experience, that without him they can do nothing in a religious line, that will either pleaſe him or profit the people or their own ſouls. But O, the wonderful and inexpreſſible light, life, power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, wherein he ariſes at times for the help, comfort and encouragement of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants! Words fall ſhort in expreſſion thereof, and language cannot reach it! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bow, O my ſoul, in ſilent, humble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and reverential gratitude and awe before him the Lord God omnipotent that reigneth; bleſs him, praiſe him, and adore him for ever; for he is worthy to be ſought unto, truſted in, worſhipped and obeyed, and that by the whole houſe of Iſrael, can my ſoul, in feeling thankfulneſs and awful ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, at this time teſtify and declare! Amen.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 3d. At a meeting at Plumſtead we ſuffered long; but at length we felt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the unfaithful were admoniſhed, the youth invited, and the heavy-hearted encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged: it was a heavenly time; light and life was felt triumphing over death and darkneſs! —what ſhall we render unto the Lord for all his benefits? Let us lie low before him, feel our dependancy upon him, and never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to move in his great work without his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:032810_0159_0FF52CF7168526E8"/>Second-day 4th, I went with my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the monthly meeting at Buckingham, but he being much unwell with a fever, which had been preceded with an aguiſh paroxyſm, left the meeting ſoon after our ſitting down: my mind was ſhut up, and that too, under great exerciſe; but after long waiting, I had ſome pretty bright openings, wherein I found ſtrength to ſtand up, and was richly favoured with Truth's help, and I hope to ſome real uſefulneſs to the Friends and people preſent. In the meeting for buſineſs I found much to do among them; though I was very ſenſible of a living concerned remnant there.</p>
               <p>Third-day 5th of 9th mo. I left my dear companion at our friend Thomas Smith's, unable to ride much, and went to the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting at Wrights-town, where Truth, after a time of humble waiting, roſe into good authority, wherein I rejoiced to feel the great Maſter ſtill owning us to be his people, and favouring us with his heart-cheering pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I was conſiderably drawn out in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ardent ſupplication among them at this meeting; and in the meeting for church diſcipline, had to labour a little to promote plainneſs, and good order in ſome other reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and had peace in my labours.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 6th. Without my companion, he being ſtill unwell, I attended the Falls monthly meeting, to pretty good ſatisfaction, though I had cloſe ſearching labour with
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032810_0160_0FF52D8748984588"/>
them, and in the meeting for buſineſs alſo.— 5th-day 7th, I attended Middletown monthly meeting to pretty good ſatisfaction.—6th-day 8th, went back to ſee my dear companion, found him better, and was rejoiced to ſee him—7th-day 9th, I had a meeting at Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, was ſhut up in ſilence, except juſt to tell them of their want of inward gathering.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 10th, I went, accompanied by my dear friends James Moon and James Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to Trenton, in Weſt Jerſey, where a pretty large number of people, not of our ſociety, attended the meeting; they ſat very attentive and quiet, and I was largely opened among them in the doctrines of truth. The people ſeemed ſomewhat reached: I truſt it was a good meeting to many; however, I did not feel truth to reign in dominion over all, as at ſome other times; therefore, finding the truth of the ſcripture aſſertion, <q>ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. x. 36.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2d-day 11th, I had a pretty good meeting at a place called Stony-brook; and though it was long ſilent, yet at length, through deep exerciſe, truth aroſe and brought comfort to ſome of our minds.</p>
               <p>Third-day 12th, Had a little meeting at Upper-Freehold, called Robins's meeting.
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:032810_0161_0FF52CE144081EA8"/>
Our labour was hard in ſilence, but in the concluſion a little life ſpread over us, and a number were pretty much reached, and broken into tenderneſs and contrition.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 13th. Had a very heavenly meeting at a ſchool-houſe, Upper-Freehold, which was a great comfort to my mind, and I truſt to many more; for truth was over all, praiſed be the name of the Lord! In the afternoon we had another meeting at a place called Arney's-town, in which we ſat long in ſilence; but near the cloſe I ſtood up and expreſſed a few words, pointing the people to Chriſt in ſpirit, after which my friend James Simpſon had conſiderable to ſay, and I truſt the meeting ended well.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day 14th. We had a meeting at Cheſterfield, called alſo Croſſwicks. I ſat long in ſilence—many preſentations attended my mind, but as I waited for the word of life, I ſaw there were many ſubjects on which a man might either muſe or ſpeak,—divers fields of doctrine,—a large ſcope for choice—but alas! we cannot chooſe aright for ourſelves, any more than we know what to pray for without aſſiſtance. So I was made willing to reject all theſe falſe openings however beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; and ſinking down into the ſilence of all fleſh, it was freſhly brought to mind, ever remember, when thou approacheſt before thy God in order to worſhip him, that of thyſelf thou canſt do nothing; that thy buſineſs is
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032810_0162_0FF52B6BE7934190"/>
to wait in true ſilence, breathing to him for help and inſtruction, not preſuming to ſtir him up, or awake him before he pleaſe, nor to form unto thyſelf a graven image, or warm thyſelf by the ſparks of thy own kindling, leſt thou lie down in ſorrow. If thou feeleſt thy mind ever ſo empty and barren, keep in true reſignation, keep the word of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and he will keep thee in the hour of temptation. Watch and pray continually, and truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own underſtanding. After ſitting ſome time under the freſh revival of theſe things in the meeting this day, I ſtood up and declared how it had been with me in this meeting.—This afternoon we had a very painful meeting at Bordentown, in which we laboured and had peace.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day 15th, Had a meeting at Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-Neck. Here the ſeed was under ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; too many preſent ſat idle, and lived too careleſs and unconcerned lives; and, after a ſeaſon of ſuffering in ſilence, truth triumphed over all, and God gave us the dominion, the victory and rejoicing;—a heavenly time it was indeed; the faithful were comforted and encouraged; the lukewarm warned, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to awake and ariſe from their beds of eaſe, that Chriſt might give them light; and the dear youth movingly perſuaded to forſake all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and come and follow Jeſus; come taſte and ſee that the Lord is good. Many minds were much reached, tendered and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032810_0163_0FF52CB85E783B60"/>
—O, my ſoul, remember and adore him for all his favours, and for every ſuch water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dew-deſcending ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Seventh-day 16th. An exerciſing meeting at Mansfield.—1ſt-day 17th, I attended the meeting at Upper-Springfield, which, though through ſome exerciſe in the beginning, was a good comfortable meeting, truth reigning over all. In the afternoon I had a ſilent meeting at a place called the Mount, it was pretty large and ſcarce any exerciſe appeared to reſt on the minds of the people.—2d-day 18th, I had a painful, yet, in the end, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable meeting at Old-Springfield, where met me my dear friend John Simpſon, to join me a little in the weighty ſervice before me, in the abſence of my much beloved compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who, he informed me, was very ill; and James, the brother of John, having left me, it was truly acceptable to be joined by ſo united a brother. In the afternoon we had a meeting at Burlington. I was ſhut up in ſilence, which is the third ſilent meeting I have attended with Friends of that place, but dear John had good ſervice, of which I was glad.</p>
               <p>Third-day 19th. We were favoured with a bleſſed, yea, an exceeding heavenly and watering opportunity at the houſe and in the family of my dear friend John Hoſkins, among his children. Advice and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flowed freely and powerfully to our
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:032810_0164_0FF52D420EFA32B0"/>
great conſolation together. After this we went to Mount-Holly, and attended a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that had been appointed there for me: it was indeed a moſt melting favoured time; exhortation and prayer were both eminently attended with life and divine authority. A more evident fulneſs of divine ſufficiency in ſolemn ſupplication perhaps I never knew; for which my heart was and is awfully bowed to the God and Father of all our mercies, to whom I bend the knee reverently, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him as my only helper, and all ſufficient ſupport—however, I had to ſee that things were much out of order at this place; and was divinely enabled to point out and ſpeak to ſeveral conditions, believing ſpiritual blindneſs had at leaſt in part overtaken ſome who had once ſeen clearer—ſome were lame, ſome were halting, ſome I thought were greatly withered, and ſome I thought reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>dry bones,</hi> concerning which it was queried, 'can theſe dry bones live.'—To all theſe ſtates I had to ſpeak a word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, of lamentation—and alſo of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yet to hope; to wait for and ſeek after ſtrength, and therein to ariſe and preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for even the <hi>dry bones</hi> did <hi>live:</hi> but above all, the animating word of perſuaſion and encouragement flowed powerfully to the tender youth, like a river of living water through my ſoul to them!—bleſſed be the Lord for every favour.</p>
               <p>After meeting we made a comfortable viſit
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:032810_0165_0FF52D5206652D30"/>
to our dear ancient friend, the widow of that worthy, ſelf-denying valiant of the Lord, John Woolman, and to their daughter, with her huſband and children. The widow was in a meek, humble, loving frame of mind: I think the Lord is with her, and believe he will be with her.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 20th. We had a meeting at Vincent-Town, and after long ſilence, I had to <hi>weep a little as between the porch and the altar,</hi> and called thoſe met with us to do the like—for I feared the heritage would be given to reproach, the heathen rule over them, and ſay among the people, where is their God. John joined me in ſounding an alarm; and they were called to mourning, and to teach their children lamentation! After meeting I rode back to Mount-Holly, then to Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſo croſſed the Delaware to Briſtol, and home with my dear ancient friend James Moon, who had been ſo kind as thus far to accompany me.</p>
               <p>Next day the 21ſt, the good old man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied me to ſee my companion, whoſe life we had lately been informed was quite deſpaired of; we found him very ill indeed, but yet I had a degree of hope.—6th-day 22d. Dear Joſeph is yet very dangerouſly ſick, though we hope a little alteration for the better.—7th-day 23d, I left him, and rode to Philadelphia to the ſelect yearly meeting, which was very large.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:032810_0166_0FF52D406FDDBD08"/>Firſt-day 24th, I attended the three meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: The firſt at Pine-Street meeting-houſe, where the Lord, being graciouſly with me, opened my mouth in teſtimony and ſolemn ſupplication; many hearts were tendered, and my ſoul rejoiced—the Lord have all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Our friend James Thornton was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently favoured in a powerful teſtimony, as alſo in the afternoon at the Bank meeting; and our dear friend Samuel Emlen had a lively time in a ſhort teſtimony after James. In the evening attended Market-Street meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where our worthy friend John Storer, from Old-England, appeared with inſtructive clearneſs and ſenſibility, both in prayer and teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Second-day 25th, and 3d-day 26th. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſeveral ſittings of the yearly meeting for buſineſs, and one ſitting of the ſelect meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to pretty good ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 27th. Word came of my dear companion, by two phyſicians who had been up to viſit him by mine and my friend's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that he departed this life about an hour paſt midnight this morning. This cauſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a cloſe exerciſe, and brought me to an examination whether I had done right in leaving him; but on mature conſideration, I found peace in having ſo done: and divers valuable Friends accompanying me, who felt engaged to leave the yearly meeting on the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:032810_0167_0FF52CF57B03FC88"/>
occaſion, I went up to Buckingham in order to attend the funeral.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day 28th. We attended accordingly, and had, after the interment of the body, a large, heavenly meeting, divers living teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies being borne to the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of truth, and ſomething by one or two of his acquaintance reſpecting the gravity, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and uſefulneſs of our dear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friend in his day and generation. I truſt it was a time that will not be ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by divers preſent, whoſe hearts were melted and tendered together. After the meeting we returned to Philadelphia in order to attend the remaining ſittings of the yearly meeting.</p>
               <p>29th and 30th. Attended ſeveral ſittings of the yearly meeting for buſineſs, had ſome little ſervices therein to a good degree of ſatisfaction; the meetings being owned and crowned by the preſence of the Lord of life and glory.</p>
               <p>10th month 1ſt, and firſt day of the week. Attended a ſitting of the ſelect yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the three meetings for worſhip— Pine-Street in the morning—Market-Street afternoon—Bank in the evening—in all which truth was in good dominion, under the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence whereof my way was open in goſpel labours at each place, I hope to the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:032810_0168_0FF52BB5929EB940"/>
rouſing of ſome, and ſtrengthening of the hearts of others.</p>
               <p>2d day of the week, and 2d of 10th month. The laſt ſitting of the ſelect meeting was this day divinely owned, as were divers of the preceding, with the Lord's glory filling the inward temple of the ſpiritual houſe in ſuch a manner as to induce a living remnant to cry in the ſecret of their ſouls, <q>bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hoſanna in the higheſt.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxi. 9.</note> In the courſe of this year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting my mind was often bowed in a ſenſe of the Lord's condeſcending kindneſs, not only in favouring me with ſtrength and ability, but alſo in opening the hearts of many deeply experienced miniſters and elders to receive and ſympathize with me in my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours—for which the holy Name be praiſed, and let all ever bow before him.</p>
               <p>Third-day 3d. I began to deſire my way might open to leave Philadelphia; but I found no way out—ſo went to the Bank week-day meeting, and was there ſilent.— 4th-day, attended the week-day meeting at Pine-Street; had a good open time in ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an alarm to the lukewarm, and felt ſweet inward peace. 5th-day, was at Market-Street preparative meeting and was ſilent, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers teſtimonies were borne in Truth's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. 6th-day. I attended their monthly meeting, and was livingly and very unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032810_0169_0FF52B6F85617CB8"/>
opened in Truth's teſtimony againſt the love, ſpirit and friendſhip of the world, and to call Friends into a labour in their families, and among their dear offspring. This was extenſively an alarming day, and I hope ſome of them will probably take the alarm.—My ſoul had great peace—bleſſed be the holy helper. 7th-day, viſited ſome families. 1ſt-day 8th, rode to Frankfort meeting, and there ſuffered deeply in ſpirit, but got ſome relief by a cloſe ſearching teſtimony among them; yet remained uneaſy, and returned ſo to Philadelphia. 2d-day 9th, attended the ſelect meeting to ſome good degree of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. 3d-day 10th, I had a meeting at Frankfort; was ſilent until near the cloſe, when I told them I felt ſomething preſent which exceedingly obſtructed the ariſing of life in the meeting. In the afternoon we had a meeting at Fair Hill—I was ſilent there. 4th-day 11th, had a meeting at Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantown, in which my lot was in ſilence. Fifth-day 12th, attended the youth's general meeting at Biberry, and ſuffered ſtill in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, feeling myſelf as a ſtranger, a pilgrim on the earth: and, in the depth of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, I ſaid in my heart, Lord, why haſt thou thus forſaken me? thou knoweſt I have given up all that is near and dear to me in this world to follow thee and thy call into this land; my dear wife and tender offspring I have left behind me, and come forth thus far into a land I knew not; and I can appeal to thee, O my God, that it is only in obedience
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:032810_0170_0FF52B99B45E0D38"/>
to thy will and requirings—Why then am I thus left? why feel I myſelf ſo deſtitute and forſaken of all good? why ſee I no way caſt up to walk in? Thus, or to this purpoſe, I bemoaned my deſolate condition, and ſpread my caſe before the Lord my God with tears, but all in a good degree of reſignation; and after a little ſpace, being fully ſatisfied all would work for good, I was made willing to be as poor, empty and blind, as the Lord would have me to be, and all centred in this, 'Not my will, but thine be done.'</p>
               <p>Sixth-day 13th. Was at a meeting ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by two Friends from New-York go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at Abington, my own way being entirely ſhut up, ſo that I durſt not preſume to appoint a meeting, nor yet to return home, though I often looked towards home, but it looked dark. So I ſhould have quite ſtopped, had there not been a meeting for thoſe two Friends, which I thought I might ſafely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; but ſtill ſilence and ſuffering was my lot; and yet the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed to preſerve my ſoul in a good degree of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under all.</p>
               <p>Seventh-day 14th. I went to a meeting appointed for the aforeſaid Friends at Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and returned with my friend Joſhua Morris to his houſe at Abington.—Firſt-day 15th, was at Abington meeting again, and ſilent in both, feeling great emptineſs. It is the Lord's hand, let him do as he pleaſeth,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:032810_0171_0FF52B9BB93E4430"/>
he will not do any thing for my harm. 2d-day 16th, ſtopt travelling, and waited on the Lord for direction—towards night a little light aroſe, and I thought I might go on in the morning, if the way ſhould continue ſtill to be open. 3d-day 17th I attended their meeting at Gynnedd, my tongue as it were cleaving to the roof of my mouth. 4th-day 18th, I had a ſilent meeting at Plymouth. Fifth-day 19th, was at the monthly meeting at Richland—ſtill ſhut up in ſilence. Sixth-day 20th, attended a meeting at the ſame place for two marriages, ſtill in ſilence; but I am learning contentment, and to endure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, drought and hunger, patiently. Lord ſpare not until thy will be accompliſhed in me, and all that is in me bows to thy ſceptre, and yields fully and quietly to thy diſpoſal!</p>
               <p>Seventh-day 21ſt, Had a meeting at Potts-Grove, wherein Truth roſe into dominion, and my faith and aſſurance of the all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Truth's openings and leadings were greatly increaſed; for I had ſit through ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meetings in ſilence one after another, except a very few words juſt at the cloſe of the firſt of them. Now in all theſe ſilent meetings, I could never once, except thoſe few words, find ability or openneſs to ſay a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle word, and believe my ſilence was wholly ordered of God, though contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of many, and even part of the time very unpleaſant to my own mind; but it pleaſed my great Maſter to keep me to it, until I was
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:032810_0172_0FF52BB738D4DBD0"/>
made to yield and be content with whatever he pleaſed to allot unto me in my pilgrimage, however it might induce the ignorant to gaze upon me as a fool; and after I had thus ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered up all, he was pleaſed to open my mouth in a very comfortable manner to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and I believe to ſome others. In this meeting I felt the power of the word of life almoſt as ſoon as I ſat down in the houſe, but the opening was on a very unexpected ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a diſpoſition ſtriving to comprehend the unfathomable myſteries of the inſcrutable God. This was the ſubject that opened in the light and in the life, and as I kept to the opening I had much to ſay on this and ſeveral other ſubjects with conſiderable in a way of comfort and encouragement to a tried, afflicted ſtate; and being favoured with the ſpirit of ſupplication, the meeting ended to good ſatisfaction. After meeting I was informed that ſuch an inquiſitive, diving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition after hidden myſteries was preſent in that meeting, and alſo the other ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and probation—bleſſed be the Lord for all his fatherly diſpenſations, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to my own inclinations.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 22d. I attended (dear John For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being with me, as he had been for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days paſt) the meeting of Friends at Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or the Foreſt, a bleſſed time it was.—2d-day 23d, we had a meeting at Reading, and next day at Maiden Creek, both I hope profitable good meetings.—4th-day 25th, we were at
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:032810_0173_0FF52C46F532CE10"/>
the monthly meeting at Exeter; Truth roſe into bleſſed dominion, and reigned over all in the meeting for public worſhip, to the reaching and tendering of many hearts. 5th-day 26th, we had a meeting at Nantmil, to which dear Abel Thomas accompanied us; my friend John Forman had good ſervice; I was long ſhut up, but at length, in the freſh openings of life, I ſtood up, and expreſſed a few words, after which dear John Forman appeared again in a ſhort, lively teſtimony; and my ſpirit being drawn forth in ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord, the meeting ended under a feeling ſenſe of the ſavour of life.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day 27th. We had a good, open meeting this day at Pikeland—The Lord's preſence was our crown. 7th-day 28th, a ſilent meeting as to myſelf at Providence; but dear John Forman had pretty good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice there. Firſt-day 29th, we were at the Valley meeting, and both had conſiderable to ſay, yet found ſcarce any relief. 2d-day 30th, I attended Abington monthly meeting, and was favoured in the meeting for publick worſhip with a clear opening, wherein I had a ſhort teſtimony to the reaching the witneſs in many minds, and much to my own relief, after an exerciſing time the day before—the whole revives the caſe of thoſe who toiled all night and caught nothing; and yet, by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attending to the Maſter's directions, they ſoon after caught a multitude of fiſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="unknown:032810_0174_0FF52B9D89DC1BE0"/>Third-day 31ſt. Attended Gynnedd or North Wales monthly meeting, where, after ſitting a while in darkneſs, light ſprang up and brought forth a ſhort, awakening teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in cloſe, ſearching language, very much to the relief of my own mind. I alſo had more to do in the meeting for diſcipline than uſual for me when abroad, as I found my mind engaged and the way opened; for it is my ſpecial care in all theſe meetings not to move or undertake in any ſervice but what I find a real engagement to in the openings of life; and on the other hand, not to omit any thing which is thus clearly pointed out, and my mind thus engaged in.</p>
               <p>11th month 1ſt, and 4th of the week. I went to the monthly meeting at Horſham, and, after viewing the camp a while in ſilence, had to lift up my voice like a trumpet and ſound an alarm among them, wiſhing them to feel for themſelves, leſt ere they were aware, and while ſitting careleſsly at eaſe, the enemy ſhould ſurround them and lead them captive away.</p>
               <p>After this I ſat in a low, ſuffering ſtate through the whole tranſactions of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but juſt at the cloſe my trumpet was again prepared to ſound; and feeling ſtrength to ariſe out of great weakneſs, and light out of obſcurity, I ſo renewed the alarm among them, as to feel quite eaſy and comfortable in my mind—bleſſed be the Lord who helped
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032810_0175_0FF52B80062322F0"/>
me; for I ſenſibly felt, that, had not his power aroſe for my deliverance I muſt have ſunk down under a load of diſtreſs, and gone away burthened in ſpirit, having no might nor ability to throw my heavy load off myſelf. Indeed I grow weaker and weaker, blinder and blinder, in myſelf: but herein I truly rejoice, for it brings into the clearneſs, into deep dependance upon God alone, whereby his grace is felt to be all-ſufficient, and an unſhaken evidence, that with the divine Arm there is no lack.</p>
               <p>Many deep leſſons of inſtruction are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this dependant ſtate, which had utterly eſcaped the penetration of the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Therefore, O Lord! ever keep me low enough before thee. I have ſo clearly ſeen this to be the only way for divine enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and true conſolation, that I deſire it, I crave it of thee more earneſtly than corn, wine, or oil.</p>
               <p>Oh, what numbers miſs of the beſt inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the pureſt joy, by continuing, even after great mortification, alive in themſelves in their religious performances. Theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully ſay, <q>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. ii. 20.</note> Theſe have in them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the beaſt which received the wound by the ſword of the ſpirit, and yet did live—the deadly wound being healed; all theſe are in imminent danger: and if they
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032810_0176_0FF52BCFA3B403C0"/>
are not aware, they will retard the work of the Lord in themſelves and in others, through their buſy attempts to promote it: and yet perhaps they may be pretending to wait for, and giving out that they feel much divine influence.</p>
               <p>Oh, the ſubtilty of the ſerpent, eſpecially in his reſemblance of an angel of light! many hath he caught, beguiled and ruined; the pure openings of life are very different, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from all his falſe viſions and likeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the deep, humble, careful traveller finds it ſo to his unſpeakable ſatisfaction; and yet how many are taking the latter for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for want of depth and patience enough in waiting!—hereby the innocent, precious life in them becomes wounded, and the true ſimplicity betrayed—for, <q>the adultereſs will hunt,</q> even 'for the precious life,'<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. vi. 26.</note> as the wiſe man teſtifies; and I believe the truly wiſe in heart, not in earthly wiſdom, but heavenly, do really find it ſo; for the <hi>life</hi> is the very thing the adverſary ſtrikes at, and if he can keep us from the ſenſible feelings and openings thereof in our religious engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he cares not how active we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, nor how much we pretend to it; for the more of all this, the ſecurer he hath us, and the more we promote his kingdom and intereſt. Oh, where will many appear at laſt, after all the cry of Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032810_0177_0FF52C488F144E48"/>
out devils, and done many wonderful or mighty works?</p>
               <p>This is a ſubject that greatly engages my attention, in earneſt wiſhes that thou who readeſt theſe hints may be preſerved out of, and wiſely ſhun the dreadful ſnare, and yet have a care of diſobedience. But when things open in the light, give up to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly viſion, and confer not with fleſh and blood. The path, though narrow, may yet be travelled in. It is a way wherein all the true wayfaring men, though fools, may walk and not err; but then they muſt carefully attend to the light for the <hi>way-marks,</hi> as the <hi>light,</hi> and that <hi>only,</hi> makes them manifeſt, keeping a <hi>ſingle eye</hi> thereto, never once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to think of taking leſs heed to it, or that now, after much experience, they can do pretty well with leſs clearneſs and leſs bright ſhining thereof than heretofore. For alas, this is a miſtake and dangerous deluſion, and he that continues to give way to it will ſoon walk in darkneſs, not knowing whither he goeth: his feet will ſtumble in the dark until he falls into the bottomleſs pit with the beaſt and falſe prophet. But thou, whoſe eye is kept carefully ſingle and attentive to the <hi>light,</hi> ſhalt witneſs thy whole body to be full of light, and ſhalt journey forward ſafely, until thou arriveſt at that city that needs not the light of the ſun nor the moon, for the Lord God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:032810_0178_0FF52B819DC2F138"/>Fifth-day 2d. After a comfortable family viſit where one lay ſick, I rode to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, in order to attend the approaching quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting—viſited a few families to a good degree of comfort.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day 3d. I went to ſee two or three families, but have felt very different from that openneſs, freedom, cheerfulneſs and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I felt in a good degree when here before. I thought far leſs of having ſufficient time now than when I firſt came; but alas! there is ſcarce any compariſon; wherever I go my load goes with me, and I cannot yet throw it off. But all tends to confirm and aſſure me that it is not of man, nor by man, nor yet by outward obſervation. So I wait in patience.</p>
               <p>7th-day 4th. I am going preſently to the ſelect quarterly meeting. O Lord my God, be with me; keep me low; keep me hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; keep me alſo faithful and attentive to thy divine movings, whether in ſilence or utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for I know that without thee I can do nothing rightly—I attended the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſelect meeting, and felt great weight and exerciſe attend me; but, ſinking down to the pure gift, I was after a little time raiſed up in Truth's dominion to eaſe my mind among my brethren and ſiſters of this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after which I was drawn forth in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and the meeting ended to ſolid ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="unknown:032810_0179_0FF52D6A36DB78E8"/>Firſt-day 5th. In the forenoon I attended Market-Street meeting, and ſoon feeling a very weighty concern reſting on my ſpirit, I ſtood up in the freſh openings of life, and began to expreſs what I had in commiſſion; but keeping carefully to the divine guide, I ſoon felt all to be ſhut up again, whereupon I immediately ſat down, rejoicing that I was preſerved from proclaiming <hi>without life,</hi> what juſt before was opened <hi>in the life:</hi> ſo I ſat quite eaſy, being delivered from the great weight and exerciſe which I had felt, until towards the end of the meeting, and after another Friend had well declared the truth among us, when I again ſtood up and very fully cleared my mind. I left this meeting in true joy of heart, and rejoiced in the Lord my gracious Preſerver, who is learning me to depend on and attend to his <hi>ſhuttings</hi> as well as his <hi>openings:</hi> and this is the only way of ſafety. In the afternoon I went to the Bank meeting, and had good open ſervice, and though in a ſhort, I hope comfortable teſtimony to a living remnant preſent. I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the evening at Market-Street meeting. It is a very large houſe, and was now greatly crowded:—I was quite ſilent.</p>
               <p>Second-day 6th. Attended the quarterly meeting for worſhip and diſcipline. In the firſt I had a ſhort open teſtimony, after which our friend John Storer had a good open time, to our edification and comfort. In the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for church diſcipline, I was ſhut up in
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032810_0180_0FF52C19C6BA0FA8"/>
ſilence and mourning. There was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended down from the yearly meeting, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed care and exertion for the preſervation and recovery of the young and riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are many of them greatly departed from primitive plainneſs and ſimplicity. My ſpirit was bowed in ſympathy and union with a few tribulated ſouls who mourn the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sion, and uſe their honeſt endeavours for her reſtoration. One remark of dear John Storer's I cannot well omit to inſert nere: He ſaid, in the meeting for buſineſs, that he never knew any one to grow and proſper in religion, who was negligent as to the attendance of religious meetings. Now I wiſh this ſolid remark, founded on impartial obſervation, may have its proper effect, to the quickening of all who heard or who may here read it, to the diligent diſcharge of that great and important duty.</p>
               <p>Third-day 7th. I had good open ſervice at the youths meeting at Market-Street houſe. It was a large ſolid meeting, and I laid things cloſe home to negligent parents; but to the honeſt, faithful labourers, as well as to the tender youth among them, the language of conſolation and encouragement flowed ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely. I hope to the refreſhment of ſome of their ſouls. In the afternoon there was a meeting for the negroes; it was not to me a very lively meeting, yet was in degree owned and favoured, and ſeveral teſtimonies were borne, among which I was not wholly
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032810_0181_0FF52C4A2811E770"/>
excuſed; and I believe my exerciſe might be of ſome little uſe to the poor blacks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I felt very weak, and Truth roſe not into much dominion; but my mind was quiet in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 8th. I went to the ſelect quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting at Abington, and ſat through the ſame under great exerciſe, but near the cloſe my way opened, and I was enabled to diſcharge myſelf.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day 9th. This day came on the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting for worſhip and diſcipline, which was large and livingly favoured with the flowings of life in the miniſtry, and the labours of ſome concerned brethren for the good of Sion, in the meeting for diſcipline. I had good open ſervice on divers important ſubjects, particularly the guarded education, overſight, and nurture of our youth.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day 10th. Attended the youths meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it was large and favoured with the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of life, and with divers living teſtimonies —I was ſilent and well ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Seventh-day 11th. I got to the ſelect quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting at Concord, where, as at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington, I was quite ſhut up, until near the end of this day's ſitting of ſaid meeting; but life then ariſing, I ſtood up in the opening thereof, had great ſatisfaction in my labours among them, moſtly in a way of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:032810_0182_0FF52C5A3270C7E0"/>
but not without ſome cautions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions as things opened.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 12th, I rode to the meeting at Birmingham, through which I ſat ſilent and reſigned. 2d-day 13th, went back to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to the quarterly meeting, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhut up from words through the meetings for worſhip and church diſcipline; as alſo the next day at the youth's meeting and adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſelect meeting; but our friend John Storer had excellent ſervice both days.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 15th. I was at Wilmington monthly meeting, and quite ſilent through the whole thereof—it being a low time with me, though divers Friends ſeemed to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured. Fifth-day 16th, quite ſilent again at Kennet monthly meeting until towards the end of their buſineſs, when I was concerned to point them to the life in the tranſactions of church affairs. Sixth-day 17th, I went to Bradford monthly meeting held at Caln, and ſat ſilent, except towards the end of the laſt meeting, I ſpake a few words of the danger of a forward miniſtry. 7th-day 18th, I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſelect quarterly meeting at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Grove for the weſtern quarter.—Here, through laborious travail in the deeps, life ſo far aroſe as to enable me to eaſe my mind in degree.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 19th, I was at New-Garden meeting, in which I was ſilent. After meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032810_0183_0FF52B833103F940"/>
went home with my dear friend William Jackſon, who had, a few years paſt, been very acceptably in our country on a religious viſit. 2d-day 20th, I attended the quarterly meeting at London-Grove, being ſtill ſhut up in ſilence. 3d-day 21ſt, attended the youths meeting, the adjournment of the quarterly and the ſelect meetings, in all which I had not a word to ſay. Oh! I was now, and moſtly for a week paſt, abaſed as in the duſt—I could ſee no way to go forward; nor yet could I go homeward—and though this diſtreſſing diſpenſation is upon me while I write theſe lines, yet through the experience I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had, my faith fails not; but I have an unſhaken confidence that all does and will work for good, and for my enlargement, in the Lord's time; but I find patience exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly neceſſary: for thus to be ſhut up a week or two weeks at a time, and feel in great degree deſtitute of divine enjoyment, is very trying; and to feel it altogether out of our own power to help ourſelves out of this trying ſtate, brings the creature very low and humble; but, bleſſed be the Lord, he never has failed to ariſe in his own time, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my ſoul from all trouble; and I firmly believe he will, if I keep in the patience, give the new ſong of praiſe to his eternal name.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 22d. Attended their mid-week meeting at London-Grove, where my tongue as it were ſtill clave to the roof of my mouth, while Mary Huſbands was much favoured
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:032810_0184_0FF52B97DB191688"/>
and enabled to lift up her voice like the ſong of an angel. Fifth-day 23d, I went to New-Garden meeting, and was ſtill cloſed up in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. 6th-day 24th, I went to Nottingham in Maryland with ſome Friends who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the quarterly meeting. 7th-day 25th, we attended their monthly meeting, where it was my place to be ſilent.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 26th. I was ſtill ſhut up in their meeting for worſhip. I believe the Lord has ſome wiſe purpoſe in it.—I cannot find that I have offended him, or diſobeyed him: I know not that I have run too faſt or lag'd behind my guide: I have ardently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do his will, and to endure his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations patiently. O that I may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in patience, and yet live to ſee his purpoſe in all theſe things.</p>
               <p>Second-day 27th.—My way is hedged up— I ſee no way to go forward: Who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend my deſolate ſtate? or underſtand my mournful condition? Theſe reflections are excited in me. I am a man of ſorrow, and acquainted with grief! the light of God's countenance, which I have often eminently felt, and which I then prized and now deſire above all other joys, ſeems to be quite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden from me, and nothing elſe in heaven nor in all the earth can ſatisfy my longing ſoul. Lord, ſtrengthen my patience that I murmur not after all that I have known of thy goodneſs: for I find daily bread is very
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032810_0185_0FF52C5CBAC44020"/>
deſirable: faſting and hunger is painful to nature; but ſhall I follow thee for the ſake of the loaves? or will it do to leave thee in times of emptineſs and abaſement?</p>
               <p>I now remember the long faſting of thy beloved Son, and that at length he hungered. Oh! then came the tempter, but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; for he <hi>found nothing in</hi> that holy Lamb, the Son of thy boſom, that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any of his baits. O my ſoul, may he find nothing in thee! Thou haſt often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to others that the way to heaven is through tribulation and ſufferings; and now when they are come upon thee, ſee to it, that thou keep the word of God's patience; let patience have its perfect work, leſt <hi>the end of the Lord's thus</hi> proving thee be fruſtrated; for if all Satan's aſſaults be rightly reſiſted, and nothing of his offered food eaten, thou mayeſt find relief and conſolation. And though it is now very diſtreſſing to drink thy Saviour's cup, and be baptized with his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm into ſuffering, yet it muſt be endured or thou canſt never ſit with him in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—he has ſet thee an example that thou ſhouldeſt follow his ſteps. And as it pleaſed God, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings, <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 10.</note> ſo will his true followers be made perfect in like manner. Therefore, O my drooping ſoul! truſt in the Lord, for unto whom elſe canſt thou go? He only has
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:032810_0186_0FF52C1B5E173F40"/>
the words of eternal life: and thou muſt not give back; neither heights nor depths, things preſent or trials yet to come, muſt not ſeparate thee from the love of God, nor from cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, or thou wilt yet be undone for ever.</p>
               <p>This day I rode back to my friend Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Jackſon's, no way opening to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. 3d-day 28th, no way opens yet; my ſoul is brought to tenderneſs and my eyes to weeping and tears before the Lord. Nature is ready to flinch, but I am given to believe it is the Lord's will that his ſervants, after multiplied experience of his helping and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering hand, ſhould be ſo eſtabliſhed on the immovable rock as to be able to endure hardneſs as good ſoldiers, to live by faith, and not by ſight for a ſeaſon, and that as long as he pleaſeth—and to ſay without diſſimulation and without reſerve, under every trial meted out to them by his holy hand, It is the Lord: let him do as ſeemeth him good. Perhaps many trials, many deep baptiſms yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by me, may be neceſſary for me to paſs through, before I can come up to and abide ſteadfaſtly in this bleſſed renunciation of my own will; but this is the mark, the goal at which I aim. And it is the deſire of my ſoul that the Lord's hand may not ſpare, nor his eye have pity, until he brings forth judgment unto perfect victory; until all that is in me bows to his ſceptre; until I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly renovated, and can render up all, body,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:032810_0187_0FF52C1CF851E860"/>
ſoul and ſpirit, as a living and unreſerved ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto the Lord; and until I can, even when he hides from me, (and to my ſenſation forſakes me) with perſeverance and unabated confidence cry, 'Abba Father, thy will and not mine be done.' Even ſo, O Lord, work in me and for me, to the thorough comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thine own will.</p>
               <p>4th-day 29th. Attended London-Grove preparative meeting, and was ſtill quite cloſed up from any ſenſible ſpring of the goſpel.— 5th-day 30th, I attended New-Garden pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative meeting—this and London-Grove make one monthly meeting. Here the power of the word of life was renewed in me, in ſuch a manner, that I ſeemed to myſelf in ſome ſort as if I had riſen from the dead! O how clearly, and beyond all doubt, am I ſatisfied in my own mind, that it is nothing elſe than the power of an endleſs life that again quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and raiſed me up in a living teſtimony among my brethren in this meeting.—For twenty days paſt, I have not dared to open my mouth in one of the publick meetings for worſhip that I have attended—I have been at fifteen: doubtleſs, if I would have been ſo preſumptuous, I could have ſtood up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered words in plenty at any of them. I felt ſenſibly that I of myſelf could no more open any thing divine, than a corrupt fountain can ſend forth ſweet and wholeſome waters. I found I could not move forward in word and teſtimony, to any kind of profit to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:032810_0188_0FF52C45453E7FB0"/>
or to my own peace, while the cloud reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the tabernacle; my buſineſs was to keep ſilence before the Lord in abaſement, and as much as poſſible in patience;—<hi>before,</hi> all was ſhut up that none could open; but now all ſeems to be ſo open as that no man can ſhut:—glory, honour and praiſe, to him who leadeth me in the path of this bleſſed experience; I can now bleſs his holy hand, both in his ſhutting and in his opening, and rejoice with joy unſpeakable, that I have learned this experience and this dependance on him alone.</p>
               <p>Twelfth mo. 1ſt, 6th-day. I reſted at a Friend's houſe and wrote to my dear wife, for I had been ſo ſhut up that I ſcarce knew how to write before; but now I wrote with ſatisfaction and comfort.</p>
               <p>Seventh-day 2d. I attended New-Garden monthly meeting; here my way was opened in an eminent manner—it was indeed a day to be remembered by many, bleſſed for ever be the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 3d. I was at meeting at Kennet; 2d-day 4th, at Birmingham; 3d-day 5th, at Bradford; 4th-day 6th, at Eaſt-Caln; in all which I was ſilent. 5th-day 7th, I was at Weſt-Caln meeting. 6th-day 8th, no way opens to go forward, we turned back and rode about twenty-five miles towards Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, and lodged at Iſaac Thomas's. 1ſt-day
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:032810_0189_0FF52CDD0DC77358"/>
10th, we were at the meeting at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town ſchool-houſe. 2d-day 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town; at both I was ſtill cloſed up in ſilence. Third-day 12th, we were at Haverford, with a little meeting of Friends, where, bleſſed be the name of the Lord, he opened the priſon door and ſat my ſoul at liberty—counſel and doctrine flowed freely—their hearts were greatly tendered, and my ſoul ſang praiſes to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 13th. Laſt evening we reached Philadelphia, and went this day to Pine-ſtreet meeting, it being a good open time, to the rejoicing of our ſouls. 5th-day 14th, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Market-Street meeting in the city, a favoured open time, to he remembered with gratitude. 6th-day 15th, I had a meeting at Germantown, where I had been ſhut up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my mind having often been drawn that way ſince my being there. This was, bleſſed be the God of Iſrael, a meeting wherein the goſpel was extenſively preached. Great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the power and dominion of truth this day, wherein a cloſe ſearch was made.— Several other brethren having living powerful ſervice, and in concluſion my ſoul was poured forth in ardent ſupplication; and light and life triumphed over death and darkneſs.— After this we had a good opportunity in a Friend's family, and then returned to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia with gladdened hearts.</p>
               <p>Seventh-day 16th. We attended the burial
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:032810_0190_0FF52CA0C6E85368"/>
of an ancient Friend at Derby, where the Lord gave ability to preach the goſpel in the evidence and demonſtration of the ſpirit and with power, to the comfort of many minds, and I hope to the awakening of ſome others; after which we had another opportunity in a Friend's family, in which our ſouls were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced together in the cementing love of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 17th. The way having thus open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me to go to Germantown, and then to Derby, as above-mentioned, it now ſeemed clearly to open to go forward to Cheſter; where, through deep wading and a living tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail of ſoul, life roſe into good dominion; though I had to labour ſome time, even after I ſtood up, under much depreſſion of mind, looking carefully to ſee the way and find the ſtepping ſtones; but the meeting ended well and truth reigned, and being deſirous of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meeting in this place, accordingly one was appointed to be held next day.</p>
               <p>Second-day 18th. The meeting was large and highly favoured—and truth was triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. 3d-day 19th, we had a meeting at Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, where Truth gave us the victory.— There was a little remnant of ſeeking ſouls, to whom encouragement flowed ſweetly this day. 4th-day 20th, were at meeting at Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the fore part was painfully exerciſing, but after a time of ardent breathing to the Lord, I felt a ſmall ariſing of life, in which I ſtood up, and as I advanced forward, at
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:032810_0191_0FF52C7886A29008"/>
length Truth aroſe into powerful dominion: it was a baptizing time.—We were at Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington, where I had been and ſuffered in ſilence ſome time paſt. Notice being now given of our intentions of being here, it was a large crowded meeting, and the doctrines of Truth were opened in my mind in great clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and utterance being graciouſly afforded, it was indeed a highly favoured day. I could write much of this heavenly meeting, but all centers in the mercy, favour and loving kindneſs of the Lord, without whom we are altogether helpleſs and cannot move to profit. We had three comfortable opportunities in Friends families in this place, one of which was with our ancient friend and elder in the church John Perry, and his daughter, they living together. He had been in New-England, where I ſaw him, on a religious viſit, (in company with our ſince deceaſed friend David Ferris) but now was very ill, and I thought unlikely to continue long. Truth was in good dominion while we were together, wherein doctrine and ſupplication were livingly owned by the inſhinings of the divine preſence.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day 22d. William Jackſon went home, intending to meet me again in a few days. Hugh Judge and ſeveral others from Wilmington attending, we had a precious meeting at White-Clay Creek; my ſoul was deep in ſuffering for a ſhort time; but the power of him who is the Reſurrection and
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032810_0192_0FF52C85F1DA7380"/>
the Life eminently ariſing, the goſpel was livingly preached in demonſtration and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the youth perſuaded; the faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; and the lukewarm warned—many minds were reached and much tendered; and my own ſoul comforted and rejoiced. But here I may note a trial that attended my utterance, very different from that kind of exerciſe wherein it ſeems difficult to find the ſtepping ſtones; for <hi>here</hi> my heart was ſo full, and my cup ſo overflowed, that I could ſcarce keep ſo deliberate as to expreſs myſelf to my own relief and ſatisfaction, until, after ſtanding a ſhort time, I ſat down and waited to get more command of myſelf; when, ſtanding up again, through a careful ſtepping along, I had great peace and conſolation in this day's ſervice—praiſed be the Lord!</p>
               <p>Seventh-day 23d. We had a truly bleſſed opportunity in a meeting at Okeſin, where Truth eminently favoured us, and opened divers important doctrines and ſtates, which ſtates were livingly ſpoken to in Truth's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to the tendering many minds; may it be to their laſting benefit and inſtruction. Theſe four laſt meetings were in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſtate of Delaware, and in the county of New-Caſtle. After this laſt meeting we went to ſee our ancient friend Thomas Carleton, in his eighty-eighth year, who had been in New-England in the ſervice of the goſpel, having been eſteemed a living mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt. He was, though confined at
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:032810_0193_0FF52C024EF24370"/>
home, in a tolerably comfortable ſtate of health; cheerful in mind; and ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a good ſavour of Truth,—being glad to ſee us and we him.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 24th. We were at meeting at Concord, in Cheſter county, Pennſylvania, at which place I had before attended a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting, unable then to open my mouth in a religious meeting; but now the Lord ſet before me an open door, which indeed has wonderfully been the caſe for divers meetings paſt, even the moſt ſo I think ſince my late long ſpiritual impriſonment, that ever I wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, the enlargement of my mind, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the openings and ſtrength of utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, being far beyond my own expectation, and greatly to the humiliation as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of my poor exerciſed ſoul.—In this meeting at Concord, I had ſome clear open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and was enabled to ſpeak to ſeveral ſtates, among the reſt, to a ſtate of great unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even though great had been the divine favour from time to time extended to them. I had to ſound an alarm indeed to theſe, and to mention the danger of their houſe being left unto them deſolate, and the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their peace being hid from their eyes for ever; and of that awful declaration being ſealed againſt them, unleſs they ſpeedily repent and turn to the Lord, viz. <q>he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xxii. 11.</note> After which a Friend ſtanding up in the meeting, in
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:032810_0194_0FF52D855F1AF788"/>
a feeling manner called upon them to ſuffer the word of exhortation, teſtifying that ſuch was the ſtate of ſome preſent, and that they had repeatedly been warned, and called upon in a very preſſing, awful manner before now by ſuch as were outwardly utter ſtrangers to their ſituation.</p>
               <p>Second-day 25th. We were at Cheſter monthly meeting held at Providence, where, in the meeting for worſhip, I had very ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervice, yet dropping a word of comfort and encouragement to an exerciſed ſeed among them. It was on the whole a good meeting. 3d-day 26th, we had a good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Springfield. 4th-day 27th, another at Middleton—precious alſo, eſpecially the laſt, wherein Truth roſe into dominion, and its doctrines were livingly and largely opened; a ſifting time ſpoken of—better days or more reformed to ſucceed—and a more general ſpreading of the truth among the nations.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day 28th. We had a bleſſed meeting at Birmingham, where I had been twice in this journey before, and quite cloſed up at both times, but was now highly favoured. Here dear Hugh Judge and James Robinſon, who had been with me ſeveral days, left me and returned home, my beloved friend Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Jackſon having met me again at this meeting, in order to join me for ſome time longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="unknown:032810_0195_0FF52D3E581A6CE8"/>Sixth-day 29th. We had another very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meeting at Kennet; here I had alſo been twice before under deep ſuffering, my tongue as it were cleaving to the roof of my mouth; but it was now eminently looſed and Truth reigned triumphant over all, bleſſed be the Lord. 7th-day 30th, we had a good meeting at London-Grove, 1ſt-day 31ſt, we had two meetings, the firſt a ſweet and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious one at Bradford, where I had been once before, and now doctrine and advice flowed freely forth, to the great reaching and tendering of the people. In the afternoon we had a very laborious time in ſilence at Eaſt-Caln where I had before been twice; but bleſſed be the Lord who gave us the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Truth at length did ariſe, and teſtimony and ſupplication were evidently felt to be in that which lives for ever.</p>
               <p>1787, 1ſt mo. 1ſt, and 2d of the week.— We had an highly favoured meeting at Uwchlan, wherein Truth prevailed over all, as in ſeveral others of our late eminently bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing ſeaſons. 3d-day, 1ſt mo. 2d, we had another favoured meeting at Goſhen. The doctrines of Truth diſtilled as the dew, and dropped as the gentle rain, to the refreſhing of many a tender plant, and I truſt to the opening of many underſtandings. After the meeting at Goſhen, we parted with our dear friend Edith Sharpleſs, a living goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wife of Joſhua Sharpleſs, ſhe having been with us at divers of the laſt meetings;
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:032810_0196_0FF52BB30D3AB418"/>
but my friend William Jackſon ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with me.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 3d. We had a good meeting at Newtown, where I had been before in ſilence. Fifth-day 4th, we had a meeting at Radnor, and 6th-day 5th, another at Merion —both heavy laborious ſeaſons for ſome time; but Truth roſe into ſome dominion, eſpecially in the laſt, which, on the whole, proved a good and refreſhing ſeaſon, and ended in the ſavour of life: the other alſo ended well. 7th-day 6th, we rode to Philadelphia, and viſited divers families, rather in a way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſociability, to take our leave of them, expecting ſoon to return homeward—1ſt-day 7th, we attended the meeting at Pine-Street, Bank and Market-Street—the firſt, after a time of cloſe exerciſe, was a good favoured meeting—the ſecond very dull and painful; though a little life at length aroſe, yet I did not get full relief among them—the third a very large crowded evening meeting—and my mind was ſoon dipt into a cloſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their eternal welfare, with an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtand up, and I believe I got through to the good ſatisfaction of my friends, and ſomewhat to the relief of my own mind, as a parting opportunity with many beloved Friends. Too many in this large city appear in want of true magnanimity in the cauſe of Truth. My ſpirit mourns over them, with ardent wiſhes that they may lift up their heads above the world and all its frowns, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:032810_0197_0FF52D6CCF31EC50"/>
and entanglements; and riſe into the liberty of the ſons of God. May the young and riſing generation ſhun that rock, the ſpirit of the world, on which ſo many have been ſhipwrecked. I am clear in it, that there is a precious ſeed among them, who, if faithful, will ſhine forth in greater luſtre and purity, than many of thoſe who have gone before them. O Lord, I pray thee, hold them in thy holy hand.</p>
               <p>Second-day 8th. We attended the ſelect meeting, where I had ſome ſmall ſervice: and after viſiting about twenty families to take leave of them, I felt clear of the city. 9th day of 1ſt mo. we left Philadelphia, and croſſing the Delaware into Weſt-Jerſey, had a meeting at Newtown: it was a painful and very low time for a ſeaſon, but ended to a good degree of conſolation. Now having left Philadelphia, I felt ſuch a flow of love and affection towards many there, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps words are inadequate to the full expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, with living cries to the Lord to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, and bring them on the way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, in the footſteps of the flock of the faithful companions of Chriſt Jeſus. 4th-day 10th, we had a good meeting at Haddonfield, but cloſe and ſearching were we led in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as Truth opened and enabled. Here divers beloved Friends from Philadelphia came over and met us at this meeting.—I was truly glad to ſee them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:032810_0198_0FF52C5E5C9E04F0"/>Fifth-day 11th. We had a meeting at Moores-town, which I am abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced would have been more eminently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, had not my imprudence prevented; for I felt the ariſings of life, and ſome freſh openings, but felt with all, that the ſpirits of the prophets were ſubject to the prophets, and that I could not get forward in my open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings until ſome exerciſed mind or minds were relieved of their burthen; and being too haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and fearing a backwardneſs would be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en way to in ſome one or other to the hurt of the meeting, I ſtood up and expreſſed how it was with me, as if, becauſe I clearly felt the danger, I muſt ſpeak of it! thus I hurt the meeting myſelf!—Oh! take heed when the ark joſtles, leſt, putting forth thy hand in thine own time, like Uzza, thou bring death over thy own ſoul! Great was my diſtreſs and humiliation; but the Lord at length in mercy opened the way again, which had quite cloſed up on my unguarded motion. Oh! his mercy endureth for ever! how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful was his goodneſs to Iſrael, that even when Moſes provoked him at the rock, yet for their ſakes he cauſed the waters to guſh forth from the flinty rock at the ſmiting thereof. This meeting ended to good ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, though marred by my own activity and folly. Lord, correct me in mercy; bring down all in me that can move without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thee; and when thou haſt fully reduced me, then in judgment remember mercy, that my ſoul may praiſe thee for ever.
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:032810_0199_0FF52ECC224014E8"/>
Here I parted, in endeared affection, with Friends from Philadelphia, who now went homeward; the reſt we parted with yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day 12th.—We had a meeting at Upper-Eveſham; after ſome time of waiting, a little light ſprang up, Truth reigned, and we had a baptizing ſeaſon together. 7th-day 13th, we had another at Lower-Eveſham, to pretty good ſatisfaction. 1ſt-day 14th, we attended fore and afternoon meeting at Burlington, where, in the firſt, after a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ability was given me to ſound a very preſſing alarm to ſome among them, who I found were very much unaccuſtomed to the yoke of Chriſt; which, together with a very open time wherein I largely cleared my mind in the afternoon, made me quite eaſy to leave the place, feeling clear of a burthen I had long had to feel at times reſpecting Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.—Lord, rouſe ſome there from their beds of eaſe, and comfort the honeſt mourners among them.</p>
               <p>Second-day 15th.—We attended a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Ancocas, appointed for our friend Thomas Colly, from Old-England. He and my companion W. Jackſon had good ſervice, Truth being in comfortable dominion after a time of cloſe inward travail; but I ſat eaſy in ſilence. After meeting we returned to Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, and on 3d-day the 16th, we rode to Stony-brook; thence on 4th-day the 17th, to
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032810_0200_0FF52F0D7AB7D858"/>
William Smith's near Rahway; and 5th-day 18th, were at Rahway monthly meeting; and being under great weight of exerciſe in the meeting for worſhip, and way not opening to relieve my mind, I requeſted another meeting, which was concluded to be held next day. 6th-day 19th, we attended the above-mentioned appointed meeting at the ſame place; were ſhut up until time in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for meeting to end, and feeling ſome ſmall openneſs, I dropped ſome pretty cloſe hints.</p>
               <p>Seventh-day 20th.—I mourned and left them with a heavy heart, intending for New-York, but often looked back at Rahway, and could not ſee my way ſo clear to go to New-York as I wiſhed; but it being homeward, I rode forward to Elizabeth-Town Point, and there took boat for New-York; but provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence prevented us; for ſoon after we put off, the large cakes of ice, floating with the tide, ſhut us in for four hours, that the boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were very apprehenſive the boat would be cruſhed to pieces, and we periſh; but my mind was inward and ſtaid on God, in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of whoſe eternal hand and power I felt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſafe and eaſy: faith and confidence in him and in his never-failing providence were ſtrong and quite unſhaken. I had not the leaſt doubt but the winds, waves and all the elements, were entirely at his command; and though the poor men kept crying out, the boat would be cut to pieces, and appeared in
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:032810_0201_0FF52F0F36EA1B00"/>
much anxiety, I felt a perfect ſerenity, and had no doubt at all but way would be opened through the ice, either forward or backward, as the Lord pleaſed; and I was quite reſigned to its being either way—but at length, after long looking and ſeeing no way, a way was opened, and we landed on the ſame ſhore, and rode contentedly back to Rahway.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 21ſt.—We attended their fore and afternoon meetings. I had ſome open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the firſt, but feeling no command to ſpeak, the opening cloſed up, and I ſuffered among them in ſilence.</p>
               <p>Second-day 22d.—We had a meeting on Staten-Iſland, (where only one man Friend and his family live) among other ſocieties: this meeting was on my companion W. Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's concern, and he had pretty good ſervice among them. I had only a few words. There is an ear in ſome there to hear the truth, and I hope, in ſome degree, hearts to obey it. 3d-day 23d, we got to New-York, and 4th-day 24th, were at their mid-week meeting: ſilent. 5th-day 25th, we went to the ſelect quarterly meeting at Weſtbury, where I was ſhut up, though William had good ſervice. 6th-day 26th, came on the quarterly meeting for worſhip and diſcipline, and adjournment of the ſelect meeting, in all which I felt no ſtrength to open my mouth. Dear William was in ſome degree favoured in ſupplication and teſtimony in the meeting
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:032810_0202_0FF52F3476CC7528"/>
for worſhip. 7th-day 27th, I being clear of the parts, and about to return immediately home, we had a precious parting opportunity at Fry Willis's, wherein I had a few words in much tenderneſs to expreſs, and dear Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam was much favoured in fervent ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord for our preſervation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering integrity to him, who firſt gathered our ſouls to an acquaintance with himſelf. The preſence of the Moſt High was livingly felt, and reigned over all, to our <hi>unſpeakable</hi> joy and conſolation, for words are inadequate to the full expreſſion of it!—magnified and adored for ever be the Lord our God.</p>
               <p>Here I parted with my dear companion William Jackſon. I have had to mourn in this journey over the declenſion from primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive zeal, as alſo the great departure from that commendable plainneſs, &amp;c. which mine eyes have ſorrowfully beheld in ſome places, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Philadelphia, and from thence too much ſpread in parts around them; yet the Lord hath a choſen remnant there—may they ever love and live near him, and the others be brought home to the fold of reſt, and weaned from all their vanities. I rode this day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Jacob Willets, towards the eaſt end of Long-Iſland, and next day, being 1ſt-day 28th, we rode to Sterling,—and 2d-day 29th, took boat, and landed in the afternoon at Grotton in Connecticut, from hence, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Jacob, I rode to Abiel Gardiner's in Stonington. 3d-day 30th, I reached Eaſt-Greenwich,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032810_0203_0FF52F3AB1BAAAC8"/>
and 1ſt mo. 31ſt, 1787, and 4th of the week, got well home; and to my joy and great thankfulneſs of heart to the Lord, found my dear wife and family in pretty good health, and much rejoiced to ſee and receive me again; and I thought we were renewedly each others joy in the Lord.</p>
               <p>I was out in this journey about ſix months and ten days, and travelled by computation about two thouſand miles.</p>

               <p>AFTER I got home from Pennſylvania, I travelled through many heights and depths in my own mind, for about two years, and ſeemed to be the neareſt loſing all faith and hope in God, that I ever remembered to have experienced. Oh! none knows, but the Lord alone, the fulneſs of that bitterneſs of ſoul which I had to endure! it was beyond all trials I ever had known, and through which I did not always abide ſufficiently on the watch-tower, in ſtrict patience, reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confidence in him who never yet has failed me, when I have rightly truſted in him; but when I have thrown aſide my ſhield, and loſt ſight of my armour; Oh, my ſoul, thou only art fully ſenſible of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſolation into which thou haſt been plunged!—but magnified over all, for ever, be the great name of the Lord! he did not leave me, nor forſake me; but after pouring out into my cup, large draughts of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood mingled with gall, was graciouſly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (having thus reduced my ſoul, for the preſent at leaſt, to perfect reſignation) to lift up the light of his countenance upon me, in a marvellous and heart-conſolating manner.

Oh, thou traveller Sion-ward, whenever thou art tried with a deep and inward ſenſe of God's preſence being withdrawn from thee, have a care, yea, a reverential care on thy ſpirit, that thou caſt not away thy ſhield. It is indeed a great thing to keep the faith at ſuch ſeaſons.—Paul kept it, and had to rejoice in it, near his final, ſolemn cloſe—<q>I have fought a good fight—I have kept the faith;</q>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Tim. iv. 7.</note> but had he not kept the faith, he could not have fought the good fight, for it is only <hi>in</hi> the faith, that any of our exerciſes can pleaſe God, or benefit our own ſouls, or others— all the willings, runnings and actings out of the true and living faith, do but run us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from that ſtate wherein alone our true happineſs and advancement conſiſts; that ſtate wherein 'God is all in all,'—and this ſtate we muſt come to, ſooner or later, or we can never know the fulneſs of the true chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian life.—Have a conſtant watchful care, O exerciſed pilgrim, that thou ſeek not for eaſe before the Lord's time—endure the turnings of his hand upon thee; and if the enemy of thy ſoul preſent any outward delight, or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of whatever kind; ſee that thou embrace not his temptations, however pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or artfully preſented and inſinuated—the very <hi>ſting of death</hi> is in it, if thou yield unto it; and although thou mayeſt, for thy trial and proving, be left almoſt deſtitute of all ſenſe of good, and have ſcarce a grain of faith remaining; yet though in this extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

depreſſed ſituation, thou mayeſt be ready to believe it will be of little or no advantage to ſtrive any longer againſt ſin; ready to ſay it is all in vain, and perhaps ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in a dark moment, it will be no evil for thee to give way to take a <hi>degree</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in forbidden things; yet I warn thee, in the fear and dread of the living God, touch not with the temptations of the ſeducer of ſouls. Flee, flee for thy life! flee from ſin as from a ſerpent: if thou tampereſt with it, though thou meaneſt not to yield, thou art in imminent danger; and if thou liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thou mayeſt, contrary to thy intentions, go near to the borders of deſtruction; and if thou ſhouldſt unhappily yield and ſurrender, thy peace with God would be broken, and every evil thing that thus gets in by conſent, muſt (if ever thou knoweſt thy peace again reſtored) be caſt out, by thy ſuffering inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly more than all the delight or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſuch a falſe gratification can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bring with it—O, therefore, ſtand firm, keep on the watch-tower, reſiſt unto blood, ſtriving againſt ſin, and that <hi>in</hi> the faith, true and living faith, for it is that which gives the victory; and though it ſeems almoſt gone, or appears as ſmall as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, yet if thou caſt not away thy confidence, but art rightly engaged to keep the faith, it will enable thee to 'fight the good fight,' and to ſay to theſe mountains of oppoſition, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and beſetment, be <q>removed and caſt

And after this dreadful conflict was over, the holy angels miniſtered unto him. So it is, has been, and will be, with all his, as they ſtand firm in the faith and patience of the ſaints; <hi>eating nothing,</hi> taking in nothing of the enemy's alluring preſentations. God's grace ever was, and ever will be, ſufficient for all theſe under every trial, temptation and beſetment. Let Satan rage, let his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the thorn in the fleſh, (however operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—in what way or thing ſoever inſinuating) do its worſt; if the ſoul keeps on its armour and dwells in the patient watch and warfare, the victory is certain, the holy promiſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail. <q>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of temptation, that ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth</q>—this is thy hour of trial—the very <hi>hour and power</hi> of darkneſs—but <q>ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord:</q>

The angel of his holy preſence will indeed miniſter unto thee—thou ſhalt be greatly ſtrengthened; and verily thou ſhalt be fed, and that with food convenient for thee.

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John x. 29.</note> O the unſpeakable conſolation, and fulneſs of divine confirmation, which my poor ſoul has received after ſeaſons of almoſt inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible conflict and beſetment, when I have abode in the true patience, kept the faith, and ſo fought the good fight!—Eye hath not ſeen indeed, nor ear heard, nor the heart conceived, while in a natural ſtate, the joy and conſolation which God pours into the ſouls which love him, and, through all tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, keep the word of his patience. O, there is abundant encouragement to ſtand firm through all; yea even to preſs through every crowd of temptation to touch that which has the healing, ſaving and preſerving virtue in it.—Trials thou wilt have, this hour of temptation will indeed <hi>come upon all the world;</hi> none ever were exempt from a ſeaſon or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of probation and conflict—and it is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 'to try them that dwell upon the earth.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:032810_0209_0FF52DB9AD5AEA88"/>O my God, thou haſt done much for my ſoul—thou haſt redeemed me through judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brought me forth to ſee the light rejoicing—be pleaſed, if it be thy holy will, ſtill to carry on thy work in me, until all that is offenſive to the purity of thy holineſs be conſumed—until my will becomes wholly conformable to thy will, even ſo amen!</p>
               <p>1788. Having thus paſſed through ſome very trying ſeaſons, the Lord was pleaſed to lay it upon me to make a viſit to Friends and others in the ſouthern ſtates, to ſympathize with the ſuffering ſeed, and endeavour, as abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might be given, to ſtir up the pure mind in my fellow men, by perſuading them to ſeek an increaſing acquaintance with God, the only ſource of all ſure conſolation. This brought me under cloſe trial, and at times I had many reaſonings and diſcouraging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, with fears about a ſubſiſtence for my family; for although I could ever ſay in that reſpect, as well as in ſpiritual things, 'hitherto the Lord hath helped us,'<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam. vii. 12.</note> yet it often looked almoſt impoſſible to me that they ſhould be in any comfortable degree provided for if I gave up to be ſo much from home and out of buſineſs; but the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction was ſo often, ſo clearly repeated, that I dare not refuſe obedience to it. So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many and various conflicts, my ſoul bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him in a view of his omnipotence, omniſcience and unbounded goodneſs, I was
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:032810_0210_0FF52EE40B760D30"/>
enabled to give up, and caſting my care upon him, in regard both to temporals and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, I ſaid in my heart, 'here am I, ſend me;'<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. vi. 8.</note> ſend me, O holy Father, wherever thou pleaſeſt, I refuſe not to follow thee into any corner of the earth—only do thou but go with me and ſupport me. My life, my ſtrength, and the length of my days, I devote to thy ſervice—my family I reſign to thy holy care and keeping—to thee I dedicate them. O, may thou watch over and preſerve them!</p>
               <p>At this ſurrender of all things, I felt the light of heaven to fill my ſoul; it ſhined in me and round about me, above the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſun indeed, and opened my proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects into diſtant nations, with ſome belief that the Lord was opening a large field of labour for me in foreign countries, to be entered into in his own due ſeaſon. I ſaid, 'good is thy will, O Lord!—diſpoſe of me, thy unworthy ſervant, as thou pleaſeſt.'</p>
               <p>So at a ſuitable ſeaſon I opened my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern reſpecting a viſit to the ſouthward, in a ſelect meeting of miniſters and elders, who expreſſed a good degree of unity and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. After this, believing it beſt to remove my family to my old home at North-Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and having done it accordingly, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the preparative meeting at Providence in order that my concern might get regularly forward to the monthly meeting for a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032810_0211_0FF52E4670FA5868"/>
And having obtained a certificate of the concurrence of the monthly meeting, it was carried to the quarterly meeting in the firſt month 1789; and there the Lord was pleaſed to fill my ſoul with ſtrength, and gave utterance to my weight of exerciſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to the greatly tendering of my own heart, and the hearts of my brethren and ſiſters. I opened it both in the men's and women's meeting—and received a certificate of their concurrence with my concern: their near ſympathy with me under the exerciſe attending it, and their prayers for my preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through every baptiſm and trial that I might meet with. Being thus furniſhed, and having early had a proſpect of being at Philadelphia at the time of the general ſpring meeting of miniſters and elders to be held there in the third month 1789, and ſtill feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound to endeavour to be at that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I got ready, and my friend Daniel Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drich having found a concern upon his mind to accompany me, and obtained a certificate of concurrence of his friends, we ſet forward on the journey the ninth of the third month 1789, having taken an affectionate and heart-tendering farewell of my dear wife and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, recommending them to the Lord for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, conſolation and ſupport, in full confidence that he would not fail them if their truſt continued firmly in him. We rode ſeveral days, paſſing through the ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut without meeting with any of our brethren, except a few in one place, after
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032810_0212_0FF52EE65613A068"/>
parting with my dear father-in-law, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved brother-in-law Joſeph Anthony, and our kind young friend Obadiah Brown, who rode part of the firſt day with us. We met with very kind treatment among the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians in Connecticut; and I had to believe, from the ſtate of mind which many of them appeared to be in, and from the impreſſion which I had among them, that a time would yet come when the bleſſed Truth would have a much freer entrance, operation and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment among that people than has yet been evident—may the Lord haſten his great work in the earth, and when and ſo far as he pleaſeth, <q>take unto him his great power and reign</q> throughout the kingdoms of men. We got to New-York on 7th-day, the 14th of the month, and ſtaid their fore and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon meetings on firſt-day, but were quite ſhut up therein. Next day went to Rahway in New-Jerſey, and ſo on to Philadelphia, where we arrived on 6th-day the 20th, at evening, having attended a little meeting by the way at Bordentown in Jerſey, and alſo the quarterly meeting at Haddonfield. Here the Lord favoured us with his preſence, and opened our way to conſiderable ſervice.</p>
               <p>7th-day 21ſt—Began the general ſpring meeting of miniſters and elders at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. Truth mercifully owned our ſolemnity, and wonderfully favoured in the ſeveral ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the ſelect meeting—the ſeveral meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for publick worſhip—as alſo in the three
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:032810_0213_0FF52E18E406BF70"/>
monthly meetings in the city, which came on in courſe after the general meeting concluded.</p>
               <p>We left Philadelphia on 6th-day the 27th, and were next day at a ſelect meeting at Wilmington, and on 1ſt and 2d days, at their general meeting for worſhip there, where Truth gave us the victory, and afforded abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to exalt the precious teſtimony thereof, though through deep ſufferings in ſpirit. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this we had meetings at Chriſtiana-Bridge, and the Head of Elk, among people moſtly not of our ſociety. But though I felt a ſtrong oppoſition in ſome at the laſt place, yet Truth gave the victory at both theſe meetings, the laſt being eminently owned by the overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of divine life, in the power and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration whereof the everlaſting goſpel was preached among them—may it faſten as a nail in a ſure place.</p>
               <p>Fourth mo. 2d, being 5th day of the week, we tried to get to the monthly meeting at Deer Creek, but could not get over the river Suſquehanna until too late to reach meeting ſeaſonably; but we found we had a ſervice among ſeveral young Friends near the river. After we had cleared our minds to them, the way ſoon opened for us to croſs the river: ſo we had a meeting next day at Deer Creek, in which I was quite cloſed up.</p>
               <p>7th, 1ſt and 2d days—We had meetings at
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:032810_0214_0FF52DFB71483DD0"/>
the Fawn, Buſh River, and Little Falls. 3d, 4th and 5th, we were at Gunpowder, Patapſco Foreſt, and Baltimore: moſtly ſhut up. We ſtaid at Baltimore until after their two meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on firſt-day; were ſhut up, yet favoured with faith and patience. On 3d-day the 14th, we had a meeting at Elk Ridge; were ſhut up, except the expreſſion of a few words. 4th-day we were at their preparative meeting at Sandy-Spring, a bleſſed and highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured time—very open; divers attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meeting for worſhip who were not Friends. Truth's doctrines flowed freely and largely among them, I truſt in a good degree of the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day, we attended a preparative meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Indian-Spring, and a ſelect meeting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, each exerciſing, though we got a little relief through attention to that which enabled to labour honeſtly as ability was afforded.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day 17th. Were at their monthly meeting there, before which, in the morning, we were at the adjournment of their ſelect meeting: it was indeed a day not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I truſt by us, nor by many of them who were preſent. In the ſelect meeting truth very unexpectedly opened ſome important and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive (though to the natural man myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) doctrines clearly to the underſtanding of my mind; and the power of the word of life accompanying, I opened them, ſo far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:032810_0215_0FF52E5D1FDCC4D0"/>
to the meeting, to the great relief of my own mind. The meeting for publick worſhip was eminently owned by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowings of divine love, under which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, utterance was largely given, and the doctrines of the goſpel were opened and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated this day, to the reaching and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering many minds, if not moſt preſent—the doctrine of God's free and univerſal grace, and its entire ſufficiency for the ſalvation of all, being eſpecially illuſtrated, and at the ſame time that the work of ſalvation goes no further forward in us than we yield to, join in, and co-operate with this bleſſed principle.</p>
               <p>In the meeting for church diſcipline, we had large opportunity in the freſh extendings of goſpel love, to clear our minds to both brethren and ſiſters, both parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, on divers important branches of our religious teſtimony. Our ſouls were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and the living among them rejoiced with us. Things are low in this land; but yet we were witneſſes that a remnant are on the right foundation, and engaged to promote the right thing, and we had a hope that the number would increaſe, and that a revival might take place in theſe parts.</p>
               <p>Seventh-day, we rode to a place called the Clifts. This night, as I lay awake in bed, I was almoſt overcome with the freſh extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the love and goodneſs of God to my ſoul, and ſeemed ſwallowed up in the inſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:032810_0216_0FF52EE80412ADC8"/>
of his luminous and glorious preſence. In this almoſt extatic enjoyment, my ſoul bowed in awfulneſs and reverence before him, and the whole man was renewedly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up to his ſervice, to be diſpoſed of as he pleaſed: and after thus continuing for ſome time, ſubjectly given up to his holy will, witneſſing his glory to reſt upon me as a royal diadem, and receiving ſome ſweet manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or confirmations of his fatherly care having been day and night extended to and over me from my youth, for my preſervation and advancement in the way of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it pleaſed his infinite majeſty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend once more (as at ſome few gracious, ſolemn and peculiar ſeaſons in the courſe of my pilgrimage before) as it were to ſet open the windows of heaven, and ſpread before the view of my mind the excellency and glory thereof; and (which above all rejoiced my ſoul) he alſo ſet open the arms of his mercy; ſhewing me and giving me feelingly to know that although, at many times in the courſe of my life, I had not ſo kept under a ſenſe of his preſerving influence as to ſhun the ſnares of the enemy, but had ſometimes been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in them, yet there was nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt me, but that all was freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and waſhed away in the blood of the Lamb; and that if I henceforth ſtood firm in obedience to him, and in the promotion of his cauſe, as ability was given, I ſhould reign with him in glory, world without end. I found myſelf clothed inwardly as it were with
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:032810_0217_0FF52EE243E2D7B0"/>
white linen! I ſaw that my garments had in days paſt been much defiled, but were now waſhed and made clean. I ſaw that I had indeed come thus far 'through great tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,' and that, had I not ſubmitted thereto, I muſt have remained 'filthy ſtill.' My very ſoul bowed in deepeſt proſtration before the throne of God—my cry aſcended for future preſervation—and I vowed continued obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence through his help to the end of my ſtay here in this vale of tears. My heart was lifted up in ſongs of praiſe for the wonders of his love to me-ward; and I had to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate and adore the unmerited kindneſs and goodneſs of his gracious dealings with me— I could ſay he had plucked my feet out of the mire and clay, and ſet them upon a rock, in good degree eſtabliſhed my goings, and put a <hi>'new</hi> ſong in my mouth, even praiſes to <hi>my God.'</hi> O Lord, hold me faſt for ever—keep my ſoul alive to the end—make of me, and do with me what and as thou pleaſeſt—I am thine; this is my rejoicing: I wiſh ever to remain thine; and if ever my own will, my own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inclinations, preſume to rend me from thee, O, my gracious Father, be thou pleaſed to interpoſe, and to lift a ſtandard againſt all that may riſe up againſt me for evil.—I dare not depend on my own ſtrength or reſolutions, but muſt look unto thee to ſtrengthen me in weakneſs, and to make effectual my ſtrivings, wreſtlings and reſolutions againſt ſin. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit myſelf wholly to thy care and keeping—
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:032810_0218_0FF52E481170EB88"/>
be thou my light and my leader, and hold me in thy holy hand for ever. Amen.</p>
               <p>Next day we had a glorious meeting at this place, at Friends meeting-houſe, but moſtly among ſuch as were not Friends, many of them called Methodiſts, a people that abound in this land, and ſome of their hearts have been touched with a live coal from the holy altar; but they ſeem very unſettled, many having hurried forward into much religious activity, being very noiſy, talkative, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, if not quite ranting; yet I hope ſome of them will come to a ſettlement in the truth; but expect many will run quite out, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhake off their religious exerciſe, this being the natural conſequence of making haſte into religious performances without the pure lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of truth therein. My heart and mouth were largely opened among them in this and divers other meetings—and this day, in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, the ſtreams of life flowed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and ſweetly, to my great ſatisfaction and comfort, and to the refreſhment of many minds—glory to God, who hath hitherto helped us! we can do nothing without his help, but can do all things required of us through his ſtrengthening influence in and upon us.</p>
               <p>2d and 3d of the week. We had precious meetings at Herring-Creek and Buſh-River, moſtly among other people, as Methodiſts, &amp;c. though at Friends meeting-houſes; for
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:032810_0219_0FF52E1C4818FF80"/>
Friends at theſe places are few in number; there uſed to be many valuable Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to theſe meetings. We were very clear in our judgment, that Friends, having kept ſuch numbers of ſlaves, did much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the ruin of their poſterity: for the poor negroes were put to do nearly all the work, while the children of Friends were brought up in <q>pride, fulneſs of bread, and abundance of idleneſs,</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezekiel xvi. 49.</note> riding about for pleaſure, living at eaſe and in fulneſs: this was productive of many evils, and opened a wide door for unprofitable and pernicious intimacy with hurtful company, until, alas, the youth in ſome particular places are almoſt all departed from the way of truth, and an almoſt total deſolation reigns in ſome places in this land. Oh the miſchiefs of idleneſs and oppreſſion!—may it be the ſpecial care of all religious people ſtrictly to bring up their children to ſome honeſt, induſtrious and uſeful employment: I believe Truth requires it; that a bleſſing attends it; and that much evil is prevented by it. My ſpirit deeply mourns over the ſorrowful and dangerous ſituation of ſuch who have, as they ſay, <q>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do</q>—believing they will almoſt certainly 'ſoon learn to do evil.'</p>
               <p>Next day, my companion being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, we kept houſe; and the day following rode near half the day towards Alexandria, where we ſtaid until firſt-day the 26th, and
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:032810_0220_0FF52E2A8217CFF8"/>
were at the fore and afternoon meeting; to both which came many of the towns people, Methodiſts, Baptiſts, Preſbyterians, &amp;c. and the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed to give us a good time in both meetings, eſpecially the laſt, wherein Truth reigned over all—bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be the name of the Lord. This was the firſt place we were at meeting in Virginia. Next day we rode forty-five miles to Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and had a very dull meeting there the day following; it was ſilent, except a few words at the cloſe, which I felt eaſy to drop with my hat on, informing that the life was ſo low, and the ſprings ſo ſhut up, that I had not dared to attempt any thing under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of preaching the goſpel; but that I felt a particular freedom to mention ſomething that had turned in my mind to thoſe not of our ſociety: I told them, a miniſter of the goſpel had nothing of <hi>his own</hi> to offer to the people; his whole dependance is on Chriſt; he muſt ſpeak as the oracle of God, and only in the ability that God giveth; therefore is under an abſolute neceſſity to keep ſilence, unleſs immediately commiſſioned and abilitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God—that, for their ſakes, through the flowings of the love which I felt to them, I had rather deſired as a creature, that the way might be opened for communication; but that I found a ſlow of love and good-will was not a ſufficient qualification to preach the goſpel—mentioning that Saul's <hi>forcing himſelf</hi> and <hi>offering,</hi> through a fear that the people would be ſcattered abroad, diſpleaſed
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:032810_0221_0FF52E5ECA6E5960"/>
the Lord, and Samuel his prophet—that, therefore I had not dared to attempt to preach the goſpel among them, knowing who it was that ſaid, ſuch as kindle a fire and warm themſelves by the ſparks of their own kindling, ſhall <hi>lie down in ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My beloved companion having been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well more or leſs moſt of the time for ſeveral weeks, now grew worſe, ſo that we were under the neceſſity to tarry here at the houſe of our friend Robert Painter ſeveral days; during which time my ſaid companion came to a concluſion to leave me and return home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as he and I both very much doubted his being able to go through the journey. This was indeed a trial to me in my deeply exerciſed ſtate of mind, and gladly could I have turned with him, but could find no peace of mind in looking that way. So on 6th-day the 1ſt of the 5th month, he being a little mended, and feeling eaſy in his mind to go homeward, and I not daring to urge him forward, we parted in much brotherly near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affection, having travelled together in true goſpel love and harmony—he with a pilot or rather a guide, going for Alexandria, and I with another, rode to a place in Culpepper called Southland meeting, croſſing the river Rapahannock in our way. This was indeed a day of deep anguiſh to my ſoul; I felt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſually diſconſolate, and could not refrain from almoſt exceſſive weeping: my heart ſeemed ready to break, for I was not only
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032810_0222_0FF52E2C4E3E2DE0"/>
left in a ſtrange land almoſt without a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing friend, but was inwardly very much ſtripped; yet I was favoured to be in a good degree reſigned under all, and my cry was fervently to the God of all conſolation, that he would keep me ſteadfaſtly given up to do and ſuffer whatever he in wiſdom ſaw beſt for me.</p>
               <p>Next day had a ſilent meeting here, except a few words of information after meeting broke up, or as we parted. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being the firſt of the week and 3d of the 5th month, I was at Caroline meeting, ſilent here alſo, and more painful and diſtreſſing than any I had been at in this journey before. I remembered the account of Chriſt's agony, his ſweating as it were drops of blood, and crying out to his heavenly Father, <q>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxvii. 46.</note> I ſaw the propriety of his paſſing through this trying ſcene: and I believed it neceſſary for me to go through that portion of ſufferings aſſigned me: and though he paſſed through his for our ſakes, he being experimentally touched with a feeling of our infirmities and ſufferings—not but that his Omniſcience as God could ſee and behold it all without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in a body of fleſh; but as the brethren were partakers of fleſh and blood, he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took part of the ſame, and in ail the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings incident to the brethren in this life, and therein to ſet us an example of faith, patience
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032810_0223_0FF52DD7DCD685C8"/>
and perſeverance through all; and that he might both feel and manifeſt this reſignation in the moſt conſpicuous manner poſſible, he was ſo far ſtripped as to feel as if he was forſaken; yet even in this extremity, though as man, he was ready to wiſh the cup to paſs from him, yet he centred in—<q>not my will, but thine be done.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xxii. 42.</note> I ſaw that there was no way for me to get rightly along, but through the like ſubmiſſion; and this afternoon every painful impreſſion was removed, and the light of life ſhined into my ſoul with unclouded clearneſs; I was ſet at liberty, and judgment was indeed brought forth unto victory.</p>
               <p>Second-day 4th. Had a meeting at Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar Creek—not painful, nor yet had I much enjoyment; but was quite ſhut up as to words in the miniſtry; yet had an engagement to inform the people, at the concluſion of the meeting, of the ſorrow I often had felt, on account of the groſs darkneſs which yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in regard to what is called preaching the goſpel, many engaging therein without divine authority and influence, who conſequently <hi>cannot profit</hi> the people.</p>
               <p>Third-day 5th. Had a meeting at Genito, and one next day at Richmond, among peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſtly not of our ſociety; theſe were both bleſſed meetings; Truth's doctrines were largely opened to my relief, and I truſt to the refreſhment of divers others. 5th-day
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:032810_0224_0FF52E74FAEAF648"/>
7th, had a meeting at the Swamp, and one next day at Black-Creek, another the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing at Curles—all dull and almoſt lifeleſs; yet I laboured a little in the miniſtry in all of them in a low depreſſed manner, and in the laſt, though dull in the fore part, yet through an honeſt attention, in lowlineſs and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to a ſmall motion, I found much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Bleſſed be the Lord who kept me hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and careful in utterance. For I am well ſatisfied, that if I had preſumed with ſo ſmall a motion to have riſen into much ſtrength of utterance haſtily, I ſhould have dried up that little ſpring of life which I felt, and ſo run into a flow of words, to my own ſorrow in the end, and to the preventing that benefit which I hope ſome received. And here I have ſeen that many, who have a real gift in the miniſtry, do ſometimes greatly hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their ſervices and the people, for not lying low enough, nor taking care enough, to find the ſafe ſtepping ſtones, from ſtep to ſtep, they run out of the little, though lively gift, into an haſty elevation of words; not indeed without very conſiderable degree of warmth and animation.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day 10th. I was at Wayne-Oak meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was dull; yet I did near the cloſe ſay ſomething by way of miniſtry, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me a little relief. I was hereby renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly aſſured that the goſpel cannot be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but when the Lord opens the real ſpring of life in the preacher, I rode after this
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:032810_0225_0FF52E8832B110E8"/>
meeting ten miles towards another meeting-place, expecting to go on thither next day in order for a meeting; but my way ſeemed ſo ſhut up next morning, that I durſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and withal was almoſt too much unwell to continue riding; yet had the way been open, I believe I ſhould have gone forward; but believing it unſafe, both for myſelf and Friends, to appoint meetings without a ſenſe of Truth's direction and aſſiſtance, I returned to my friend John Crew's at Wayne-Oak.</p>
               <p>On ſecond-day I was reduced to a very deſtitute condition, wherein all my former experience ſeemed to afford little or no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. This ſeaſon of ſtripping had been coming upon me for ſeveral days, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time after. But I have not the leaſt expectation of being able, by words or writing, ever to convey a clear and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate idea of the darkneſs, deſolation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs attending this diſpenſation, to any who have not in degree experienced it: thoſe who have may, if they ſhould read theſe lines when I am in another ſtate of exiſtence, feel a lively ſenſibility hereof—feel as one a little before them has felt, deeply abaſed, exerciſed and heavy laden; like to what their poor ſouls may have yet for a ſeaſon at times to groan under—and if it pleaſe God to bleſs this preſent relation to the benefit of any of his drooping children, I grudge not my hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed through the ſore conflict, nor my
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032810_0226_0FF52E60A2F5A178"/>
pains in preſerving theſe memoirs of my exerciſed life.</p>
               <p>Third-day 12th—I attended the week-day meeting of Friends here at Wayne-Oak, as it came in courſe—it was very ſmall—I was much ſtripped, nor had I ability to ſay any thing in the meeting until near the cloſe of it, feeling to myſelf one of the moſt unworthy creatures; yet after all this I was made to rejoice, and for this very abaſement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of mind; and this rejoicing increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until I had to expreſs a little of it in the meeting, much to the tendering a few bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted friends preſent, though I could not riſe into more life than juſt in weakneſs to utter a few expreſſions; yet therewith felt eaſy; but concluded, as I had the day before, that if way did not open with more clearneſs for the continuance of my journey after the yearly meeting then ſoon coming on at this place, I might return home: fully believing that he who called me forth into his ſervice in this land, would open the way with clearneſs to proceed ſo far as his will was for me to go; and that as he would not withhold the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary openings, I might ſafely, after waiting a proper time without obtaining any manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the contrary, return to my family; yet remained given up to go forward if he ſhould open the way for it.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day 14th, In ſilence and inward po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty I attended the ſelect quarterly meeting
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:032810_0227_0FF5188BDE742868"/>
of miniſters and elders at White-oak Swamp, and next day the publick quarterly meeting here; out of weakneſs I was made ſtrong, and many with my own ſoul rejoiced in the Lord. 7th-day 16th, began the ſelect yearly meeting, and this day was held the meeting for ſufferings alſo. Next day two large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for worſhip, and one the day following; then the church diſcipline in the afternoon, and by adjournments until 4th-day the 20th. The meetings for worſhip were livingly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured times; thoſe for diſcipline, for want of deep dwelling in the life; and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement for good order, were not ſo lively, yet Truth owned the faithful labours of a remnant, and life ſprang up at times to their refreſhment. The meeting for ſufferings was alſo favoured: it appeared that the members thereof had been, and with ſome ſucceſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſupport of the rights of the injured Africans, at which my ſoul rejoiced; for many of them groan in cruel bondage in this land. But I believe the Lord will more and more ariſe for their deliverance, and work their emancipation; and that through judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments poured out upon their oppreſſors, if the hard hearts of thoſe who make them groan are not ſoftened by milder means. I uſed among Friends here a plain honeſt goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel freedom, which gave me great relief, and tendered many of their hearts. So after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and thankſgiving to God, this year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting concluded under a freſh ſenſe of his divine goodneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:032810_0228_0FF52E49B85A3948"/>Fifth-day 21ſt—Had a meeting here with the negroes, and though ſilent myſelf, yet my dear friend John Lloyd, from Pennſylvania, had good ſervice therein. Next day we had a meeting at Tyrees, wherein I was cloſed up, but my friend had a pretty open time.— 7th-day 23d, was at Skemins; and firſt-day 24th, we had a ſmall meeting at Williamſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, a town where no Friends live. I had little to ſay in theſe meetings. It is to the poor the goſpel is preached—even Jeſus did not many mighty works in ſome places becauſe of their unbelief. It remains true to this day, that unbelief and hardneſs of heart ſhuts out the goſpel, or prevents a free entrance thereof among ſuch as have not a ſenſe of their own neceſſities, but think themſelves rich, full, and to have need of nothing—for the word preached cannot profit unleſs it be mixed with faith in them that hear it. No wonder therefore that thoſe who run when the Lord hath not ſent them, and continue preaching to the people without feeling, or evidently finding a door of entrance into their hearts, do not <hi>profit them</hi> by all their long, laborious and creaturely exerciſes among them—for nothing gathers to God but what proceeds from him.</p>
               <p>On ſecond-day the 25th. we had a meeting among the Methodiſts at New-Kent. J. L. had a little teſtimony among them; I was quite ſhut up; yet after meeting broke up I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to impreſs them with a ſenſe of the
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:032810_0229_0FF52EF82709BE70"/>
utter uſeleſſneſs of all preaching, however much it may warm and move upon the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, except that which is from a real ſpring of divine life in the ſpeaker.—3d-day 26th, went to Wayne-Oak, and 5th-day 28th, I attended Curles meeting; it ſeemed almoſt without light or life until the latter part, when a gleam of true light appeared; by keeping to which, though in great weakneſs, victory was obtained, and the meeting ended to comfort and rejoicing—though we found it for a long time almoſt impoſſible to ſing a ſong of Sion in a land where the harp was hung on the willow! for it was truly mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſee <q>the city ſit ſolitary that was full of people.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Lam. i. 1.</note> Truth had once proſpered here, but now the poſterity of faithful Friends were nearly all carried away captive—but a little gleam of hope aroſe in my mind that there would be a revival in this place.</p>
               <p>My way opening with more clearneſs, I got along with much ſatisfaction and fulneſs of divine joy, having divers large and bleſſed meetings—one at a Friend's houſe a few miles from Peterſburgh over James River, one at Gravelly-Run, one at Burleigh, and another at Seacock.—After that at Burleigh, we had a good watering time in the evening, at a Friend's houſe, among black people and ſome others, beſides a few Friends. Truth reigned over all in this bleſſed meeting—the poor negroes bleſſing God in accents beſpeaking
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:032810_0230_0FF52DFF46BCE638"/>
heart-felt reverence, and deep thankfulneſs of ſoul, for this favoured ſeaſon; one of them in particular, ſaying, 'O may I ever bleſs and praiſe my great God, for the great good he has this evening done my ſoul! for the ſweet precious love that I have felt—I never felt ſuch heavenly love before—bleſſed for ever be the great God!'—my heart was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the feeling ſenſibility which this, and ſeveral more of the poor blacks diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their way, of returning thanks to God, both in the evening, and again next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for they ſeemed full of ſongs of praiſe, even in the morning, for the evening's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favour—may the Lord Almighty hold them in his hand for ever, and may my ſoul never forget the deſcendings of heavenly rain upon and among us at that comfortable ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—for which his holy name be praiſed for ever. Amen! And I am renewedly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there is a real work of divine power among many in this land, both white and black; though yet much unſettled—may they be brought to witneſs a greater degree of clearneſs and eſtabliſhment in the everlaſting truth!</p>
               <p>After theſe we had meetings at Black-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Stanton's, Vick's, Black-Creek, John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's and Summerton—In the two firſt of theſe I was ſilent; but believe they were all times of renewing of ſtrength to ſome who attended them. The doctrines of the goſpel were livingly proclaimed in the authority of
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:032810_0231_0FF52DDB67BA9BC8"/>
truth, dear John Lloyd's way being opened. —Next we had a glorious meeting at the weſtern branch the 9th of the ſixth month, wherein there ſeemed to be no lack of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, power and utterance; many were deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, bowed and tendered—bleſſed be the Lord for ever! 10th, we had two dull meetings at Bennet's Creek, J. L. in the firſt, and I in the laſt, got ſome relief, through a little honeſt labour in great weakneſs among them, 5th-day 11th, we had a ſtrengthening and refreſhing meeting at the widow Bufkin's, where a meeting is held once a month. I had a good open time—the doctrines of the goſpel were largely opened, with ſtrength and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the tendering of many minds.</p>
               <p>6th, 7th and 1ſt days, we had meetings at Norfolk, Portſmouth and Suffolk, places where no Friends live, except one ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and a young man in Suffolk—the firſt and laſt of theſe meetings were held at the court-houſes; that at Portſmouth in an upper room in the market-houſe. The people at Norfolk behaved undevoutly at meeting, kept running out, talking whiſpering, laughing, gazing about, &amp;c. I reproved them for their incivility, telling them, that the moſt mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſideration of my mind reſpecting their behaviour, was the great inexperience of the realities of religion, and the great unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the nature and importance of divine worſhip, which their conduct had ſorrowfully manifeſted: and ſo enlarging a
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:032810_0232_0FF52E2DE73AC920"/>
little upon the ſubject of worſhip; and that God, even a <hi>preſent God,</hi> is the object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and not any man—that God, to be worſhipped aright, muſt be <hi>felt after, known</hi> and reverenced; with a little more on ſome other ſubjects. We left them with heavy hearts, finding very little open door of utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe there was ſcarce any door of entrance into their hearts, except in a few; and yet I had a ſecret hope, and ſome belief, that that day's work would not be altogether in vain.</p>
               <p>The meetings at Portſmouth and Suffolk were heavenly watering ſeaſons, wherein Truth reigned over all. Many minds were much reached and tendered, and a general ſolemnity was very prevalent. The Lord has a viſited ſeed in this land up and down in many places. O that they may come to know a greater ſtability and ſettlement. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the meeting at Suffolk on firſt-day, we had a parting opportunity with many Friends, who attended from different parts of the country around. This was a moſt melting and reviving ſeaſon. The everlaſting Arm was marvellouſly magnified and made bare! the holy name was livingly exalted and praiſed; the ſouls of the mourners were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently comforted; and the lukewarm power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully warned—bleſſed be the name of the Lord for ever and ever, for his goodneſs to my poor ſoul at this precious ſeaſon—may I never forget that fulneſs of divine light and
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032810_0233_0FF52E1AAE7ED8E8"/>
life, that overflowing cup of ſweetneſs and conſolation, wherewith he enriched my mind in that ever memorable day.</p>
               <p>After this heavenly banquet, I parted with my dear friend John Lloyd, who had for ſeveral weeks been agreeably my companion, and with the reſt of my friends of Virginia now preſent, and ſet out for North-Carolina, accompanied by Robert Jordan and wife, where I arrived next day at the houſe of our kind friend Thomas Newbey. In the courſe of the ſix following days, I had or was at eight meetings at Perquimons and Paſcotank counties, at Friends meeting-houſes, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, viz. 3d-day, 16th of the month, at that called Wellſes meeting-houſe. 4th-day, Old Neck—and in the afternoon at Sutton's Creek. 5th-day, at Little River. 6th-day, at New-begun Creek—and in the afternoon at the Narrows of Paſcotank. Seventh-day, monthly meeting at Simmons's Creek—and 1ſt-day, at the Piney-Woods.—Theſe were all favoured open ſeaſons, except that at Sutton's Creek, and that at the Narrows; in both which I was quite ſhut up, ſave in that at the Narrows I did expreſs a few words at the breaking up of the meeting, reſpecting the nature of goſpel miniſtry; as that it never was in man's power, merely as man, to preach the goſpel, &amp;c. Oh! how I then mourned, and often have mourned, to ſee the eager expectations of the people ſo widely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed on the creature inſtead of the Creator:
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:032810_0234_0FF52EAFFB48F0E0"/>
and this is undeniably the caſe with all who expect man to preach to them without divine aſſiſtance; for man is but the creature, and unleſs immediately filled and qualified with divine light, life and power, is as deſtitute of any ability livingly and profitably to preach that goſpel which is the real power of God unto ſalvation, as he is of power to cauſe the outward rain to deſcend from heaven.</p>
               <p>In ſeveral of the foregoing meetings Truth eminently favoured us together—the goſpel was preached in the life and authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of—many minds were ſtrengthened and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and the great name was magnified and praiſed. After this I went to Rich-ſquare, and on 4th-day the 24th, was at their meeting there, where Truth opened the way with ſtrength and clearneſs to edification and rejoicing. Next day went to Jack-Swamp, and being joined by my dear friend James Ladd, from Wayne-Oak in Virginia, who came with a certificate to accompany me a while in this journey, we had a meeting on 6th-day at this place: it was an open, good time, Truth was freely declared, and many minds reached and tendered. 7th-day 27th, we had a bleſſed meeting at Hallifax, a ſmall town where there are none of our ſociety. The goſpel power was eminently felt, and, in the evidence and demonſtration thereof, the free grace of God to all men, the neceſſity of working out our own ſalvation through the aſſiſtance thereof, and ſeveral other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032810_0235_0FF52F706D0FB0B8"/>
goſpel truths were livingly and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened. Next day we had a meeting at Stony-Creek, or Tar-River, as it is ſometimes called. From thence we rode to Contentney, and, firſt of 7th mo. attended the preparative meeting of Friends there—a dull time it was, and but little openneſs for goſpel communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. After meeting, and the two next days, we rode to a place called Core-ſound; and, on 7th-day attended a monthly meeting there; it was a low time, yet way opened for Truth's teſtimony to be in ſome degree exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Next day we were at their ſelect and publick meeting—the publick meeting was eminently overſhadowed with divine favour, and made to be a time of bleſſed viſitation to many ſouls; praiſed be the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Second-day 6th. We had an exerciſing meeting at Clubfoot-Creek; there was ſome openneſs, ſo that conſiderable labour was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, but not to much relief or ſatisfaction of our minds—which was pretty much the caſe next day alſo, at a meeting we had at Newborn. In this town there are no Friends, and the people's minds very light and unſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was painful to behold the airineſs and irreverence which prevailed in too many. They got a gentle reproof, and we left them in ſorrow as to our minds, though but little or no true ſorrow appeared in them.</p>
               <p>Fourth-day 8th. We had a very heavenly meeting at Friends meeting-place on Trent;
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:032810_0236_0FF52EB49F64B670"/>
and another next day about twenty miles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the river Trent, at a place where a meeting was lately ſettled. Friends appeared pretty well engaged at theſe two places, and I hope an increaſe will be witneſſed among them. 7th-day 11th, we attended the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting at Contentney—a trying time it was to my mind; but way opened, after long ſuffering in ſilence, to clear my mind in ſome good degree. Next day we were at the firſt-day meeting at the ſame place—ſilent. 3d, 4th and 5th days, we were at meetings at Nues, Bear-Creek and Turner's Swamp—all trying times. In the firſt, the weight I felt ſeemed almoſt inſupportable, but at length way opened, and an extraordinary time we had; divers ſtates were remarkably opened and ſpoken to in Truth's ſearching authority, and yet with that ſympathetic, perſuaſive energy, that it made way into almoſt every heart. It was a tendering time, but, alas! the next day was a time of difficulty, as well as diſtreſs, and no way opened to get much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief by communication, though I could not well avoid dropping ſome cloſe expreſſions or alarming hints, but I ſaw little or no proſpect of much advantage from them to thoſe to whom they belonged: they ſeemed like thoſe who had ears to hear, but heard not, or as if they had ſhut their ears, and hardened their hearts. I felt for them with a heart full of ſorrow. The laſt meeting was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, though I was quite ſhut up. My dear friend James Ladd bore a lively well-adapted
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:032810_0237_0FF52DB561D452F8"/>
teſtimony, in which I rejoiced, and found relief of mind.</p>
               <p>Sixth-day, I reſted at my friend Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Arnold's, being unwell. He and his wife were very kind, both being well-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged Friends: the fruits of whoſe godly parental care and authority very plainly and agreeably appeared in the behaviour and appearance of their well-ordered off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. Oh, much lies at parents doors! much may they do, through divine aid, for their children's good, by proper, conſtant care, watchfulneſs, advice, reproof, reſtraint, correction and commands; all in Truth's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as occaſion requires; and that not generally ſo much in the auſterity and rigour of compulſory diſcipline, as in the meekneſs and authority of the Lamb, which ſeldom fails of reaching the witneſs in their minds, and more or leſs to bring them under the government of Truth. O that many, very many parents now too much at eaſe, may be arouſed to a due conſideration of the truſt repoſed in them, and ſee to the diſcharge of their duty to the precious ſouls under their care. Oh, ſee to it, parents, I beſeech you, for your own and their precious ſouls ſakes! ſee to it in ſeaſon, and unremittingly; great is the care that is neceſſary, conſtant the watch that ought to be maintained. Theſe remarks aroſe not wholly from the agreeable proſpects I had in and of this family, but have been on my mind for ſome time, under
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:032810_0238_0FF52F86AD1DDDA0"/>
a deep and painful ſenſe of deficiency of care among parents very generally. However, I rejoice in believing, that notwithſtanding the ſo general neglect, there are many deeply exerciſed parents who endeavour honeſtly to diſcharge their duty in the ſight of God, and I have no doubt but they will have a rich reward, and many of the dear youth will be greatly benefited thereby—that theſe may be encouraged, and their number greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, is the fervent wiſh and prayer of my ſoul.</p>
               <p>7th-day 18th. We were at the ſelect quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting at Contentney—next day at the publick meeting there—and were ſhut up in ſilence in both, except a few words in great depreſſion in the ſelect meeting.—On 2d-day came on the buſineſs of the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we were ſtill ſhut up in ſilence, until near the cloſe of the buſineſs, when my way unexpectedly opened in a great degree to clear my mind among them—though I had an opening in the beginning of this ſitting, and ſtood up in the opening, expecting to have had utterance therein; but as I careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended to the ſpring and word of life, I found the brightneſs of the opening gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faded, until all was gone—ſo I ſat down without uttering a word, after having ſtood as a gazing ſtock among them perhaps ſeveral minutes. I truſt ſome real benefit reſulted therefrom, to ſome who were too near always ready, as well as to my own ſoul, in keeping
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:032810_0239_0FF52EB635B3F878"/>
me ſubjectly given up to follow faithfully, however greatly in the croſs, the motions, openings and ſhuttings of life.—After this we ſet out for Eno, it being two days ride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what we rode this afternoon.</p>
               <p>Fifth-day 23d. We had a good open meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and another on 7th-day at Spring meeting—this was painfully exerciſing, under a ſenſe of backſliding in too many; but Truth at laſt reigned over all, to the melting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearts!—Next day at Cane-Creek—here again we were filled with mourning and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, under a ſenſe of unfaithfulneſs, and conſequent dwarfiſhneſs; but after long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, divine wiſdom opened the way! juſt as I was thinking it near time to conclude the meeting; and in a cloſe, ſhort, lively manner, we were enabled to place the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of our exerciſe where it belonged, and ſo came away rejoicing in God. On the four following days we had four bleſſed meetings at Rocky-River, Nathan Dixon's, Piney-Grove and Holly-Spring. Truth triumphed in theſe meetings—its doctrines flowed like oil! the univerſality and entire ſufficiency of God's grace for the ſalvation of all, if attended to, was opened and declared with divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and many minds impreſſed therewith. —Oh my God! thou haſt given me to ſee the wonders of thy ways, in degree, and the ſtrength of thine Arm! thou haſt led me through the deeps! haſt bowed my ſoul in the deepeſt proſtration! ſtripped me and emptied
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:032810_0240_0FF52F11AC670508"/>
me of all things, and then marvellouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, both thy wiſdom, thy goodneſs and thy power! In lifting me up again from the duſt, thou haſt given me indeed, <q>beauty for aſhes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praiſe, for the ſpirit of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. lxi. 3.</note>—Thou art my God, and through thy aid I will ſerve thee for ever—be thou with me—go before me and I will follow thee—for in thy preſence there is life—at thy right hand a river of pleaſure—therefore to whom could I wiſh to go, ſeeing I know, to my inexpreſſible conſolation, that thou haſt the words of eternal life?—Thou haſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly redeemed my ſoul, and delivered me as it were from the den of lions—to thee, and to thy ſervice, I therefore once more dedicate the remainder of my days. Draw me and I will run after thee—command me and I will obey.—I fear to offend thee, for thou haſt ſhewn me thy purity—I adore thee, for thou haſt wrought wonders for my ſoul.—I love thee, for thou art my life.—Hold me faſt, O Lord for ever—keep my heart clean, by the word of thy power, and never, O never, I pray thee, ſuffer my foot to ſlide!—continue to fill me with the joy of thy ſalvation, ſince thou haſt ſo continually ſhewn it unto me— Take not thy holy ſpirit from me—guide me by the right hand of thy power—continue to my ſoul, the quickening efficacy of the live coal from thine altar; then will I, at thy bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, teach tranſgreſſors thy way, and ſinners,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:032810_0241_0FF52F88B0E01D90"/>
through the operation of thy baptizing ſpirit, ſhall be converted to thee—Even ſo, O Lord, haſten thou thy great work in the earth— draw thouſands by the cords of thy love, and tens of thouſands by a clear diſcovery of, and a living deſire after, a full eſtabliſhment in the beauty of holineſs—till the nations come to ſerve thee, and the kingdoms of the earth to bow before thy throne—till righteouſneſs cover the earth as waters do the ſea—and light and life reign triumphant over death and darkneſs, for ever.</p>
               <p>Seventh-day, 1ſt of 8th mo. we attended the monthly meeting at Cane-Creek, and next day the publick firſt-day meeting there, and their ſelect meeting—all theſe were times of favour and divine openneſs. The five fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing days we had meetings at Sandy-Creek, Providence, Center, Back-Creek, and Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough—the firſt was a dull meeting until near the cloſe, when life broke through all oppoſition, ſo that the meeting ended to ſolid ſatisfaction—The next meeting was alſo dull, —the three laſt were open favoured times of refreſhment to many. After theſe meetings we attended, on 7th-day, the 8th of the 8th month, the ſelect quarterly meeting at Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and an open inſtructive ſeaſon it was, as was the large publick meeting on firſt-day; Truth's doctrines flowed like oil, and things were opened in divine authority in both meetings, I truſt ſuitably to the ſtate of each. Next day the publick meeting was very large,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:032810_0242_0FF52F8A4AFE54C0"/>
ſtill and ſolemn, and Truth favoured our ſouls with a baptizing and refreſhing time together. On 3d-day 11th, we had a good meeting, open, and powerfully tendering to the minds of the people in general, at the widow Hoover's, a member of our ſociety— Truth reigned powerfully over all—bleſſed be the holy name of the Lord for ever.</p>
               <p>On fifth-day 13th, we had a meeting at Chatham court-houſe; but it being court-time, we could not get the court-houſe until between three and four o'clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, by which time too many of the people appeared to be ſo affected with ſtrong drink, as to leave little room in their minds to be ſeriouſly affected with any thing of a religious nature; ſo that we had a painful dull time among them—however, ſome were attentive and ſtrove to quiet the reſt: and way did open, after a cloſe exerciſe, for a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, to ſome ſolid ſatisfaction; but our cauſe for mourning over them ſeemed much greater than our cauſe for joy. 1ſt-day 16th, we had a dull diſtreſſing meeting at a Friend's houſe between Chatham and Peedee; we were ſhut up in ſilence. Next day the 2d of the week and 17th of the month, we had a heavenly, open meeting at Peedee— bleſſed be the Lord who helped us! On 5th-day 20th, we had a very ſmall, yet precious meeting at Camden, South-Carolina, where no member of our ſociety liveth, except one very ancient woman; though once there was
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:032810_0243_0FF52F9DB23CB3D8"/>
a ſettled meeting of Friends there—this was a watering time to a few ſincere-hearted, whom my ſoul loved; and an awakening, and in ſome degree convincing time, to ſome who were too much hardened in ſin, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with that light and power which is the authority of our meetings and miniſtry: this they now felt, ſo that divers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to acknowledge, and bear teſtimony thereto, in their converſation with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—And I am on this occaſion renewedly confirmed in a ſentiment I have long been ſettled in, that is, that there never was, and never will be but one true religion in the world, to wit, 'the work of the ſpirit of God in the ſouls of mankind;' that ſome of all denominations have ſomething of this true religion, even though ſome of theſe, through the prejudice of education, may diſallow it in profeſſion; and that no man has any real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but what he comes to the knowledge and experience of through the alone influence of this holy ſpirit of God. This it is that begins and carries on the work—this it is, that, by its own divine influence operating in the minds of mankind, reveals Chriſt in them, the hope of glory; or ſo operates from time to time, on reading the ſcriptures or other good books; on hearing the goſpel preached; on meditating on the works of creation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; on God's judgments in the earth; or his dealings with themſelves as individuals; or whatever other occaſion, circumſtance or thing, is ever made a mean of conviction or
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:032810_0244_0FF52FA32DC05F30"/>
converſion; the holy ſpirit ſo operates, I ſay in all theſe caſes, as to produce the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect—and without the inward operation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all theſe other opportunities and things would be utterly in vain, as to ſalvation, and never able to produce the leaſt degree of true religion, or ſanctification in the ſoul. So that, though there are many opinions, many creeds, profeſſions and denominations, and ſome tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious perſons in them all; yet there is and can be but one <hi>true religion;</hi> all true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is of one kind—all ſprings from one ſource.—And bleſſed and adored for ever be the Lord, in order that all men may, if they will, be benefited experimentally by this one true religion, 'the manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withal'<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xii. 7.</note>—he that rightly profits thereby, and continues ſo to do, will live in the exerciſe of the one true faith; will witneſs the one true chriſtian bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; will know and obey the one living Lord; will, by the Holy Ghoſt, in word and deed, acknowledge and call him Lord; and ſo will be ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation. And on the other hand, ſeeing a meaſure of the holy ſpirit is given to every man; ſeeing the grace of God that brings ſalvation hath appeared unto all men; ſeeing the light and life of the holy word, which in the beginning was with God, and was God, hath enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every man that cometh into the world; and ſeeing, moreover, Chriſt Jeſus has taſted death for every man; how ſhall we eſcape if
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:032810_0245_0FF52FB820165330"/>
we neglect and reject ſo great ſalvation? how great muſt be the condemnation of every ſoul, thus highly favoured, which yet ſtands out and rejects the ſtrivings of the ſpirit, the teachings of grace, the ſhinings and convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this divine light! Now this light, grace and ſpirit of God, is all one thing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different appellations—it is called ſpirit, becauſe it is quick, lively and operative, and quickens the ſoul to a ſenſibility of its ſtate and condition—it is called grace, becauſe it is the free unmerited gift of God—and is called light, becauſe it makes manifeſt—as, 'what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth make manifeſt is light,'<note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. v. 13.</note> ſaith the ſcriptures. And as this grace or light is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, it will bring the ſoul into a ſtate of grace and favour with God.—Well, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, might the apoſtle, with holy reverence, break forth in theſe expreſſions, 'thanks be unto God for his unſpeakable gift.'<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. ix. 15.</note> And all who obey the light will be brought out of darkneſs into God's marvellous light; for though the hearts of fallen men are groſsly darkened; yet the light ſhineth in their dark hearts, and though the darkneſs comprehend it not, if it is taken heed to, will <hi>ſhine more and more to the perfect day;</hi> even until the whole body be full of light; but <hi>thoſe who rebel againſt the light,</hi> will grow darker and darker, until <hi>they know not the way thereof, nor underſtand the paths thereof!</hi> and become vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh hearts become wholly darkened! having lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:032810_0246_0FF52F1ED3E82160"/>
darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil.</p>
               <p>After the meeting broke up at Camden, before we went away, we felt ſuch an evident ſtop in our minds as to purſuing our journey, and ſuch deſires to have another meeting at Camden, that we found peace in ſubmitting to it; and in order to procure the company of the buſy inhabitants of the place, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſtay until firſt-day, and gave notice accordingly. Then riding to our friend the widow Engliſh's, we reſted there the next day; and the day following, that is, 7th-day, had an open precious meeting at a Baptiſt meeting-houſe at Swift-Creek, among Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts and Methodiſts, the Lord opening their hearts to receive our teſtimony. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Truth were livingly declared, moſt preſent were reached and tendered, and our ſouls relieved—bleſſed be the name of our God, who was eminently preſent!</p>
               <p>Next day we attended the meeting we had appointed at Camden, a pretty many of the inhabitants were preſent, and though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that there are not many religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the town, yet it was a day of precious viſitation to many of their ſouls—a day to be remembered: Truth's doctrines were largely and with demonſtration opened and declared, making much impreſſion on many minds. O, the preciouſneſs of Truth! the ſufficiency of its aid, and never-failing victory when
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:032810_0247_0FF52FBB5C715388"/>
abode in! Lie low, O my ſoul, for ever; truſt in the Lord; rely wholly on him; be nothing without him—all things in him; be faithful to him, and thou ſhalt never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. He is a ſtrong rock—an impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortreſs! a ſword! a ſhield! yea, all things neceſſary to thoſe who faithfully truſt in him —who abide in the faith and patience of the ſaints.—He has loved me freely, wrought wonders for my ſoul, made bare his Arm for my deliverance, forgiven mine offences, and carried me through manifold trials, conflicts and afflictions; and is now leading me about, inſtructing me, reducing me again and again to the loſs of all things, and filling my ſoul with the fat things, the rich dainties of his own houſe! and putting into my heart and mouth the ſongs of praiſe and hallelujahs! Lord, the deſire of my ſoul is unto thee, Oh, be thou pleaſed to exerciſe thy rod and thy ſtaff, yea, all thy good pleaſure in me, until all within me bows to thy righteous ſceptre, and every motion of my mind and of my body is in conformity to thy holy will manifeſted in me. Therefore go on, O my moſt merciful God, if it be thy holy will, not letting thine eye pity, nor thy hand ſpare, until thou haſt thoroughly cleanſed the floor of my heart— until the precious ſeed be gathered into thy garner—until the chaff be burnt up by the baptiſmal influence of the Holy Ghoſt and fire—and finally, until my ſoul becomes a fit temple for thy holy preſence, unrivalled and uninterrupted, to dwell in. Make me a
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:032810_0248_0FF52FCE42446220"/>
pillar in thy holy temple, that ſhall go no more out for ever; but, abiding therein, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the depth of humility and profound reverence to return all the praiſe to thee, who, with thy Son the Lamb, through the eternal Spirit, art worthy of all honour, adoration and glory, world without end. Amen.</p>
               <p>We lodged again after this meeting, at our ſaid friend the widow Engliſh's; and next day, the 24th, took our journey for Charleſton, where we arrived the 26th of 8th month, it being one hundred and twenty miles; and on 6th-day the 28th, we had a good little meeting at Friends meeting-houſe with the few Friends in the city, and a few others that came in, and were tender. Next day we had a large meeting at the Methodiſts meeting-houſe; many Methodiſts, ſome Baptiſts, and others attending; but it was rather a dull time, and, not feeling our minds clear, we concluded to have another meeting there on firſt-day afternoon.—In the forenoon on firſt-day, we had a bleſſed open time at Friends meeting-houſe; and in the afternoon another large crowded meeting at the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt meeting-houſe, conſiſting of a mixed and very unſettled multitude. We found a preſſing engagement to declare the truth among them, but found them ſo outward in their minds, and ſo unſtayed, that we got very little entrance in their minds in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or relief to our own, though I believe the Methodiſts were moſtly quiet, and ſome of
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:032810_0249_0FF52F23B3145AE0"/>
them, with a few others, were reached and tendered.</p>
               <p>Second-day 31ſt, We left the city with heavy hearts, after a ſolid opportunity with Friends. This day and next we rode towards Georgia, about fifty-eight miles; and finding a little meeting of Friends, though not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet ſuch as were convinced of Truth's way and principles; we ſtaid their meeting on fourth-day—it was dull at firſt, but open and much favoured towards and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Several Methodiſts and Baptiſts were preſent, and Truth reached and tendered moſt of their minds. Theſe friendly people had, at leaſt part of them, belonged to the Methodiſts and Baptiſts; but their eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came gradually opened to ſee beyond lifeleſs form and creaturely performances, as prayers in man's own time and will, &amp;c. and had now gathered into a ſilent waiting upon the Lord. May they live near him, love him, and ſerve him in the beauty of holineſs: then they will not only enjoy great peace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but be a bleſſing to their neighbours.</p>
               <p>After meeting we went on for Georgia, and reached Friends monthly meeting at Wrightſborough in that ſtate, on 7th-day, 5th of 9th mo. It was a painful time; extreme poverty and inward want bore down our ſouls. We found a few words to drop among them, but ſcarce found any relief.—On firſt-day the 6th, we had two favoured meetings: one at
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:032810_0250_0FF52FB9B4966AE8"/>
Wrightſborough, and the other at Friends new meeting-houſe, four or five miles from the firſt; and next day were again at Wrightſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, not being clear before; it was a precious time indeed, Truth's teſtimony flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power, many were greatly reached, and ſome who had much oppoſed our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, acknowledged to the truth with tears, and deſired us to remember them before the throne of grace—may they be preſerved.</p>
               <p>Third-day 8th, we had a large meeting at Marmaduke Mendenhall's, among a religious people, Methodiſts, Baptiſts, &amp;c. Truth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently overſhadowed us. In our firſt ſitting down together, I had very bright openings, and fulneſs of light and life; but the meeting was hurt by the right time not being attended to in ſtanding up, by me or my companion, or both—my ſoul was grieved, for the people were prevented, in degree, enjoying what ſeemed to be intended for them; yet many minds were affected, and I truſt ſome good was done. Fourth-day 9th, we had a large meeting at a Friend's houſe, among Method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, Baptiſts and Friends. There was ſtrength and utterance given, and great indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be the entrance into the people's minds. After this meeting, next day, we left Georgia, and ſet out for South-Carolina. We got to a meeting among Friends at a place called Henderſon's Settlement, on fifth-day the 11th, and ſo on to Mudlick, Buſh River, Rocky-ſpring, Paget's Creek and Cane Creek,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:032810_0251_0FF52FCFDF68C968"/>
having a meeting at each of theſe places, and at Buſh River <hi>two,</hi> moſtly to a degree of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, yet it appeared to be a low time among Friends in theſe parts; but dwelling low with the ſuffering ſeed, we were made to reign a little with it at times. The four fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing days we rode to Deep Creek in North-Carolina, about one hundred and forty-three miles. At this place we had a meeting with Friends and others, on 3d-day the 22d, and ſo on, having another at Cheſnut Creek over the mountain in the edge of Virginia—thence back to — Freeman's, (not a Friend) in North-Carolina, having a meeting at his houſe on 7th-day the 27th, and were next day at a Friends meeting at Weſtfield, called alſo Tonis Creek—all theſe meetings were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Friends, Baptiſts and Methodiſts, and ſome of them by ſome others. And through patient waiting for the ariſings of life and openings of light, they were all ſolid profitable meetings; Truth's doctrines were largely opened, many minds reached, and the Lord's name exalted over all. Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, creaturely performances, lifeleſs prayers at ſet times, &amp;c. were much diſcouraged: for the Lord laid it upon me to expoſe the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of theſe things from place to place, and to ſhew that they never fail of drying up the ſprings of life in ſuch, who once having had the freſh openings thereof in their own ſouls, will yet go on in religious performances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting for light and life therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="unknown:032810_0252_0FF52FD1C246C768"/>After one of theſe meetings, a Baptiſt man, ſomewhat in years, told me he had tried to keep up family prayers in his houſe, but found he could have no ſatisfaction in it, unleſs when he felt a divine influence inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him thereto, and that he had now omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, except when he found himſelf thus qualified. Divers others have confeſſed, that they had often, in their attempts to pray at their ſet times, without waiting for divine help, evidently felt that their words fell to the ground, were of no avail, and anſwered no good purpoſe.—O that all may learn the neceſſity of waiting upon God in the ſilence of all fleſh, and creaturely motions or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, that they may witneſs that renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of divine ſtrength, wherein prayer is made with life and acceptance with the Lord.</p>
               <p>I had much ſervice in theſe South Lands among other ſocieties, particularly Methodiſts and Baptiſts, there being a living birth among many of them; and this living birth, being in its very infancy in many of both theſe ſocieties, was near to my life, and I often breathed to the Lord to preſerve it alive; for I ſaw it to be in imminent danger of being ſtifled by a multiplicity of lifeleſs perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. But though I was led into ſervice much among other people, as before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet I generally, in the meetings of Friends, had ſome clear openings into the ſtate of things among the brethren: for I was kept very low in my mind, and durſt not
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:032810_0253_0FF52FD8CA5E82B0"/>
meddle with things not opened in the light of life. I was afraid to <hi>judge after the ſight of the eye, or reprove after the hearing of the ear;</hi> my dependance was on the Lord alone; and in that dependant ſtate, I often felt as empty of any thing divine, any ſight, ſenſe or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, as if I had been totally blind and inſenſible—and indeed who is ſo <hi>blind as the Lord's ſervant, and ſo deaf as the meſſenger whom he ſends?</hi> And it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, in order that his meſſage to the people through them may be wholly in the <hi>freſh open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of divine life,</hi> without any mixture of man's fallen wiſdom. This is a great myſtery to the world and all its boaſted wiſdom, and will remain ſo for ever, though clearly opened unto babes and ſucklings in Chriſt. And as my mind abode in this <hi>low ſtate,</hi> in the <hi>loſs of all things,</hi> in the ſubjection of my own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely will, wiſdom and workings; I received many freſh openings, and therein was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to <hi>bring forth things new and old,</hi> to the inſtruction, and, I hope, laſting benefit of the brethren and many others from place to place. All glory and praiſe be aſcribed to him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom my poor ſoul is nothing, knows nothing, and can do nothing, in things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. O that all fleſh may be abaſed, and lie low before him for ever, that his own eternal power may be exalted over all in them.</p>
               <p>After this meeting at Weſtfield, we found a preſſure in ſpirit to have one next day among ſome religious Baptiſts, about ſix miles off at
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:032810_0254_0FF52F22020F5FD0"/>
a Baptiſt man's houſe; it was a precious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meeting, wherein Truth opened many things in the life and demonſtration. And ſome confeſſed, they had never known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but that John's diſpenſation of water-baptiſm was part of the goſpel diſpenſation, and to ſtand to the end of time; but they ſeemed now to be much ſhaken; for it was opened that John's elementary diſpenſation was only a forerunning one, to prepare the way of the Lord. After this meeting we ſtill found a preſſing engagement to have another meeting at Friends meeting-houſe at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, which was held accordingly the next day, to great ſatisfaction: many Baptiſts and others, as well as many Friends, attended— Truth reigned over all, and the doctrines thereof <hi>dropped as the rain,</hi> to the tendering and refreſhing many ſeeking ſouls—bleſſed be the Lord for all his favours. We next had meetings at Blues-Creek, and Muddy-Creek, and on firſt and ſecond days the 4th and 5th of the 10th month, were at Deep-River, their large monthly meeting being held there on ſecond-day—all theſe were bleſſed watering ſeaſons; the monthly meeting abundantly ſo, to the bowing my ſoul in awfulneſs and praiſe. On 3d-day we had an open, refreſhing meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Nicholites, ſo called. I had a lively evidence that ſome among them were humbly endeavouring to ſerve the Lord; but at the ſame time I ſaw clearly that many of them reſted too much in their outſide plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and valuing themſelves upon that, had
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:032810_0255_0FF52FE1C6E3A818"/>
ſtopped ſhort of a more living acquaintance with the well-ſpring of eternal life; and this is a ſnare wherein I fear ſome of our ſociety are taken, and detained from greater experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the real life of religion, without which all outward things are unavailing, as to the ſalvation of the ſoul. I laboured among this people, in the openings of life, and hope ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their condition—may it tend to their ſettlement on the right foundation!— Then, proceeding on our journey, we had meetings at Friends meeting-houſes at Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Bulrun, New-Garden, Lower Reedy-Fork, and Upper Reedy-Fork, all favoured meetings, ſome of them highly ſo.</p>
               <p>On 4th-day the 14th, we had a meeting at the houſe of our friend Samuel Tomlinſon, where very few Friends live near, among Baptiſts, Methodiſts, ſome Friends, &amp;c. We evidently felt that ſome of them had pitched in battle array againſt us in their minds; and for a time the Lord ſuffered them to ſhut up the kingdom of heaven, not entering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſuffering thoſe that gladly would have entered. At length a ſmall degree of life aroſe, and I told them the battle was the Lord's, and if he ſuffered them to ſhut up the kingdom, the loſs would be their own; but that it was likely thoſe formerly, whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief prevented our Saviour's doing many mighty works in certain places, might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to vaunt over him, and to think he could not make his way among them; and yet I
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:032810_0256_0FF52F5C2492B390"/>
thought their victory, if ſuch they eſteemed it, was in no wiſe glorious; but greatly to their own loſs, or the prevention of much good that they might otherwiſe have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I then acknowledged to them freely, that we had nothing at our own command to offer for their good; nor any weapons of our own to oppoſe their warlike preparations with— told them I had little thought, when in the pure conſtrainings of goſpel love and good will, I gave up to have a meeting with them, that they would have come together prepared for war; but that I was aſſured it was ſo, for I could feel the inward ſtate and oppoſition of ſome of their minds, as plain as I could ſee their bodies with my outward eyes.— Moreover I informed them, that if the Lord engaged me in it, I was not afraid or aſhamed to fight, even upon a retreat, if he did not make way for an advance—that I was not at all afraid of my life, how many Goliaths ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver might defy the armies of the living God; for my life I had given up to his diſpoſal, to be laid down in his cauſe, if he pleaſed, in any part of the globe.—I came not from my own land, and all my near and dear connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in life, to do my own will, but his who ſent me; and while I ſtand faithful in his holy will and counſel, in the openings and leadings of his divine light and life, I fear no evil, danger or difficulty; nor all the art and malice of men or devils; though I fully know that of myſelf I can do nothing. However I told them, for their own ſakes, in order that
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:032810_0257_0FF52F5DC8BB88E0"/>
they might have the full benefit of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I deſired them to lay aſide their warlike weapons, that inward oppoſition wherein they ſtood againſt the inward life of all true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the doctrines of the everlaſting goſpel; and as they knew themſelves guilty of an inward oppoſition to us and our meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, it began to work conviction in them: they wondered how I knew it; but ſeeing I did know it, and was enabled ſo plainly to tell them the inward ſtate, and thoughts of their own hearts, it won upon them, drew their attention, removed their prejudices, and ſoftened their hearts towards us and our teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony—and when I found they had given up, and dropt their warlike weapons and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I improved the opportunity, as Truth opened the way, and told them, I perceived they began to incline towards a capitulation, and willingneſs to ſign articles of peace—this they alſo knew was true of the inward alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their minds; and ſo it greatly tended ſtill further to gain their love and attention, until at length (though the work, or rather warfare, was very hard for ſome time) we had an heavenly baptizing time together—Truth reigned over all, and therein our ſouls tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over all oppoſition, in the ſtrength and power of an endleſs life! wherein divers doctrines of the goſpel were livingly opened and enlarged upon, in demonſtration of the ſpirit and divine authority! yea, that was felt and acknowledged to be ſo, by many whoſe hearts were greatly tendered and refreſhed,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:032810_0258_0FF52FE35AB53C08"/>
after all the oppoſition they had at firſt felt againſt us. Thus the Lord wrought for us, and taught <hi>our</hi> hands to war, and our fingers to fight—Glory be to his great name for ever! for hitherto he hath marvellouſly helped us; and we know that without him we muſt have turned our backs in this and many other days of battle.</p>
               <p>Next day we had a heavenly open meeting at a Baptiſt meeting-houſe on Abbit's Creek, about ten miles from the laſt meeting—divers of their members, and one of their teachers urgingly deſiring us to have a meeting with them there, they being much reached at the other meeting. We had had thoughts of having a meeting there before this invitation, and, the way now looking very open, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it, and had one accordingly. And as ſoon as I ſat down in the meeting, I felt as evidently as I ever felt any thing with my outward fingers, that they were now come without their weapons, in a ſtate of mind di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reverſe to what they or ſome of them felt in the fore part of the meeting yeſterday; their hearts were open, and our way was alſo ſoon opened into a living enlargement in the doctrines of Truth, I truſt to our and their mutual ſatisfaction and conſolation of ſoul, though their outward performances and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs devotions were largely and livingly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt.—Our next meeting was on the day following at Randolph Court-houſe, among people of various profeſſions; and,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:032810_0259_0FF52DD9D16304F0"/>
magnified for ever be the name of the Lord, our leader and director, he was graciouſly pleaſed to break in upon us in a wonderful manner; light ſhined ſuperior to the ſhining of the ſun in the outward firmament, that divine light, the fame that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world: but in the wicked it often ſhines as in a dark place, and the darkneſs comprehends it not—many whoſe hearts have become darkened, reject, deſpiſe and trample it under foot; but in thoſe who obey it, love it, walk in it, and bring their deeds to it, it will ſhine more and more to the perfect day, as the wiſe man ſays the path of the juſt man does, declaring this path of the juſt to be a ſhining light: indeed it is ſo, for Chriſt within, the juſt man's light and hope of glory, is alſo his path, his only true and living way, as ſaid Chriſt himſelf, <q>I am the way, and the truth, and the life;</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John xiv. 6.</note> and ſurely the juſt man's <hi>way</hi> is his <hi>path:</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt then, the inward divine light of men, is the juſt man's <hi>path</hi> or <hi>way,</hi> well may it be declared to be a ſhining light: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has abundantly confirmed it to the ſouls of all that have truly loved and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully walked in this light, that it really does ſhine brighter and brighter: and in all that continue ſo walking, it will more and more, even to the perfect day—they will not only witneſs the day to dawn, and the day ſtar to ariſe in their hearts, but the increaſing clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and brightneſs of the light will be, as
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:032810_0260_0FF52DB7E5045950"/>
Iſaiah expreſſes it, <q>the light of the moon ſhall be as the light of the ſun, and the light of the ſun ſhall be ſeven fold, as the light of ſeven days.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. xxx. 26.</note> Well, in the clear ſhinings of this holy light, for truly it was as a morning without clouds, the ſtate of the people were ſo opened to us in this meeting, and through us to them, the light within their own ſouls confirming our outward teſtimony, that ſcarce an individual appeared inſenſible of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly viſitation we were favoured with: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt were deeply affected, greatly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and much refreſhed as with a ſhower of celeſtial rain—it ſeemed to me in a degree like the day of Pentecoſt, the effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt was ſo eminently glorious among us!—and I believe near or quite all preſent, ſaid in their hearts, and divers with their mouths in ſubſtance after this meeting, <q>this is the everlaſting goſpel of Chriſt;</q> and I ſaid in my own ſoul, and ſtill ſay, it was of the Lord's doing, and marvellous in mine eyes! holy and reverend is his name, and that for evermore—may my ſoul ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his wonders and the riches of his love, lying low in humiliation before him.</p>
               <p>On 7th and 1ſt days, the 17th and 18th, we were favoured with the Maſter's helping hand at the monthly and firſt-day meetings at Center; in both which light and life tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over death and darkneſs.—On 3d-day we had a painful, trying meeting near a
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:032810_0261_0FF52EF3948AF110"/>
water called Heworry, at a Dutch Friend's houſe, (Michael Fout) among many Dutch people, and others. We laboured in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ability afforded, to ſome degree of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The two next days, we attended Friends meetings as they were held in courſe, at Springfield and Bulrun. Next day we had a diſcouraging meeting among many other profeſſors, near the Upper Reedy-Fork. I ſaw and felt clearly, that ſome of them came prepared to bid defiance; however we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured a little, though under great depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—for though they were many of them high in profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, too many of them appeared to be unbelievers, and in the ſtate of the Scribes and Phariſees, in the inward ground of things—and ſuch, in all ages, are the greateſt oppoſers and even hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of good, of any people whatever; yet I believe divers preſent were humble hearted chriſtians, who thought little of themſelves, and were hungering after better food than their teachers are feeding them with: ſome of theſe I hope got at leaſt a little crumb of heavenly bread at this meeting—may the Lord refreſh their ſouls with the waters of life, and ſuſtain them.</p>
               <p>Next day, being 7th of the week, and 24th of 10th month, began the ſelect yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Center, in North-Carolina, for Friends of that ſtate, South-Carolina and Georgia— it was a trying ſeaſon, and Friends ſeemed ſenſible it was a very low time. I was quite
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:032810_0262_0FF51899400B2390"/>
ſealed up in ſilence, as were both my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and myſelf next day, at the publick meeting for worſhip. On ſecond-day the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of ſociety came on; it continued by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment four days, and though the fore part was heavy and trying, yet the latter part was a time of eminent overſhadowing of the holy preſence; many weighty ſubjects were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in this yearly meeting; and finally reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much unanimity, love and ſolemnity. I was much bowed down, until the laſt day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſenſe of the want of due dependance on the Lord in many preſent; but near and at the cloſe of the meeting, the helper of Iſrael open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a way, and helped me to be thoroughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and the ſong that is <hi>ever new,</hi> was put into my heart and mouth, in a very conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating manner. Large numbers, I believe, will at times, while they live, bleſs the name of the Lord for that day's favour. The ſhout of a King was heard in Sion, to the rejoicing of the tabernacles of Jacob. Bleſs thy God, O Iſrael, for ever, and ſerve him with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and reverence, O daughter of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, for who indeed is like him? He bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down as into the very duſt, and he raiſeth up to the heights of ſalvation—He maketh the dumb to declare of his goodneſs; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the rock to ſing of his power! glory be to his name for ever—my ſoul will praiſe him in the heights of Sion!</p>
               <p>On 7th-day 31ſt, we attended New-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den monthly meeting, and had therein a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:032810_0263_0FF52EB7CFEC4370"/>
of ſatisfaction. Next day we attended their firſt-day meeting there, being the 1ſt of the 11th month, in ſolid ſilence, as to us; and, feeling clear of Carolina, on the day following we rode to Virginia; and on 4th-day the 4th at night, we got among Friends at Gooſe-Creek; where next day we had a meeting, and the day following had another at the upper meeting-houſe on Gooſe-Creek, which was ſilent. We next had meetings at Hills-Creek, Seneca-Creek, and South-Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; in all which we were helped through to our comfort, and hope to ſome profit.— On 4th-day the 11th, we had a bleſſed conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating meeting at Henry Chriſtian's, a Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt, and a few others, in Amhurſt county, Virginia—light and life prevailed, to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and watering many ſouls. On 6th-day, we had a little meeting at Francis Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall's, a man that for ſome years appeared to have been convinced of our principles, as alſo his wife: this was in Buckingham coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. On firſt-day the 15th, we had a meeting at Amelia, to a degree of ſatisfaction, and that afternoon my dear companion James Ladd and I parted, in much goſpel ſympathy, and endearment, he going home. On 4th-day, I had a diſcouraging meeting at Camp-Creek, and another next day at Douglaſs meeting, (ſo called) in the firſt I got but little relief; and in the laſt could not open my mouth in the miniſtry.</p>
               <p>On the firſt-day following, the 22d of 11th
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:032810_0264_0FF52E9E9BF0A620"/>
mo. I was at meeting at Smith's Creek, in ſuffering ſilence. About this time Satan ſeemed almoſt let looſe upon me, to buffet me with doubts, even in things wherein I had been well eſtabliſhed and aſſured. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded I am, I have no words adequate to the full and clear deſcription of the buffetings, horror and diſtreſs, that ſeized and bore down my drooping ſoul; but I have ſince clearly ſeen, that the Lord's determination was, that if I would ſtill be his, I ſhould lay down my own life, that of my own will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and in all things, and take him and his will for my only good, in and through all. And as my own will was once more crucified and ſlain, my life laid down upon the croſs— all within me bowed—On this wiſe then my ſoul addreſſed my God: 'Lord, I know thou art all goodneſs; I have drank of the rivers of pleaſure at thy right hand, which is all of thy mere bounty and grace; I ſurrender my all once more to thee without reſerve. Here I am—do with me whatever thou pleaſeſt— bleſſed and adored be thy name for ever—I yield to thy will—not mine, but thine be done. Amen.'</p>
               <p>After this full ſurrender of my will and my all, light ſprang in my ſoul; darkneſs fled before it; Satan's head was bruiſed; God did truly bruiſe Satan under me; I ſaw his power was limited; and that the Lord God Omnipotent ſtill reigned over all. Life and immortality was again, as it were, brought
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:032810_0265_0FF52EF603F0BE48"/>
to light out of the depth of obſcurity, and eſtabliſhed over all in meridian brightneſs and aſſurance in my ſoul. Great enlargement followed this ſore conflict, and my conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was full, and unſpeakably glorious— bleſſed for ever be the Lord my God, and wonderful leader! in the heights my ſoul will praiſe him, and for the depths of proſtration will I magnify his name, who makes all things work together for good to thoſe who truly love him—Love him, O my ſoul, for ever, and ſubmit thy all to his holy care and keeping, through every trying time.</p>
               <p>After this moſt trying conflict, I found my way opened again, and had meetings at Crooked-Run, Center, Mount-Pleaſant, Bear-Garden, Back-Creek, Hopewell, Middle-Creek, Tuſkarorah and Bull-ſkin, all open good meetings, and moſt of them eminently ſo, even to my own admiration! Truth's doctrines were largely opened with divine life and authority; many who were much unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with true religion were much reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſuch as were hungering and thirſting after ſomething more ſubſtantial than they had yet feelingly known, were greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed. My ſoul bowed in awfulneſs before that God, who, through the deepeſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diſcouragements, ſafely brought me on in the right way; landed me on firm ground; and even made my moſt fiery trials and extreme conflicts promotive of almoſt inexpreſſible enlargement and conſolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="unknown:032810_0266_0FF52E980F906FA0"/>Oh! he well knows what he is about, in ſuffering his choſen followers to be thus cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tried—indeed this is the very way they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>choſen;</hi> for he ever <hi>chooſeth them in the furnace of affliction:</hi> here he refines them as <hi>gold ſeven times tried in the fire:</hi> thus they bear his holy law: thus they are made able to <hi>dwell with</hi> that which, to every thing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is as a <hi>devouring fire and everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and not be hurt; the fire ſhall not kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle on them to devour; the ſmell of it ſhall not be on their garments; but every thing in them that is chaffy ſhall be burnt up, in, and by this unquenchable fire; ſo the weighty ſubſtantial wheat comes to be gathered into the garner. Oh! thou traveller Sion-ward, whenever the Lord leads thee in this line, think not that none have walked the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee; but remember it is the high-way to glory; the only trodden path to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—remember others, before thou waſt brought forth, have deeply experienced it, have taſted the wormwood and the gall; and been ready to think it impoſſible for them ever to come forth into the light again, or to rejoice in God, the rock and horn of their ſalvation. But be thou patient, be thou faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to death; yea, in and through this inward death, and thou ſhalt receive a crown of life: for it is an eternal truth, that though many are the afflictions of the righteous, yet, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the Lord delivers them out of them all.</p>
               <p>Next I had a meeting the 4th of the 12th
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:032810_0267_0FF52ED0493D5B40"/>
month, in the Preſbyterian meeting-houſe at Wincheſter: a glorious good meeting it was —I was ready to think near as much ſo, as our low ſtate, while clothed with clay, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. Several important doctrines of the goſpel were largely opened, having ſtrength and utterance given—every mind ſeemed huſhed into a degree of awfulneſs and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence! all glory and praiſe be aſcribed to him who is our only ſufficiency; for with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and proſtration of ſoul before him, it may be truly ſaid, 'hitherto hath the Lord helped us!'<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. vii. 12.</note>—On 7th-day I was helped to my own and others joy, at Friends monthly meeting at Crooked-Run: and alſo next day at the meeting at Culpepper. Indeed the arm of the Lord was marvellouſly made bare in our favour, from place to place, throughout the foregoing favoured meetings: and thence on to Southland, South-Fork, Gooſe-Creek and Leeſburg. At Southland I parted with my dear friend Catlet Jones, who had been very acceptably with me moſt of the time ſince I parted with my beloved friend James Ladd; but now he returned to his family. I was at this place laſt ſpring, as I went ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and though I was ſhut up there, then, yet I felt ſuch an engagement for the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that little meeting and neighbourhood, that I felt moſt eaſy, now on my return, to viſit them again; having been drawn in ſpirit to look towards them, at times, ever ſince I was there before. We had now a heavenly
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:032810_0268_0FF52EF9BA44A428"/>
watering time together, praiſed be the Lord, whoſe power was eminently over all. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I have never known a more conſtant fulneſs of God's love, life, and qualifying preſence; nor a more continued cheerfulneſs in and out of meetings, for ſo long a time, than (bleſſed be the Lord) I have now been favoured with, ſince my extreme tribulation and diſtreſs at Smith's Creek, and about that time. Oh, the heights and depths; may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other ever ſeparate my ſoul from the love of God!—I well know the propriety and need of our Saviour's caution, <q>pray ye that your flight be not in the winter; neither on the ſabbath-day.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxiv. 20.</note> Great care is neceſſary, in both theſe ſtates—perhaps our Lord mentioned the winter firſt, as it is the trials and diſtreſs of that painful diſpenſation, which prepares for, and if patiently endured, terminates in the comfortable rejoicings of the ſabbath-day. To abound, we muſt be abaſed: if we will reign with Chriſt, we muſt ſuffer with him: but, Oh the danger of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in diſcouragements in the winter ſeaſon, when all ſeems cold and uncomfortable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; even ſometimes benumbing, and almoſt deadly froſt. Here thou exerciſed traveller Sion-ward, if thou art not very watchful and careful to abide in the faith and patience of the ſaints, thou wilt be very likely to take thy flight, from walking in the light, and firm abiding on the everlaſting rock and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by letting in and giving way to doubts,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:032810_0269_0FF52E2F81741200"/>
diſputings, diſtruſt, murmurings and deſpair; and ſo repine at the diſpenſations of Divine Providence, who is proving thee for thy good. Here many have took their flight in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and let go their hold of what they had received, and ſo have loſt their crown! for the terms are, 'be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. ii. 10.</note> If thou abideſt ſteadfaſt through the wintry diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lord will bring thee to the opening ſpring, to the ſummer, and the ſabbath-day; here thou wilt praiſe him on the banks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; here thou wilt be made to ſhout and ſing! <q>for, lo, the winter is paſt; the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the ſinging of birds is come; and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Cant. ii. 11, 12.</note> But now, in the midſt of thy rejoicing, have a care; ſtand faſt; ſee thou takeſt not thy flight on the ſabbath-day. Danger awaits thee on every ſide; thou art a frail mortal, and thy deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it cometh upon thee, will be of thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but thy help can be only in and of the Lord; therefore look unto him, for 'he that truſteth in his own heart, is a fool.'<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. xxviii. 26.</note> Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, even though his ſoul is filled with good, and overflows with ſongs of joy, take heed leſt he fall—even now this care is eminently neceſſary—this is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein the watch is peculiarly needful —hence the precious caution in regard to theſe two ſeaſons of moſt preſſing danger—
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:032810_0270_0FF52E8A5B589858"/>
hence, alſo, he preached the <hi>watch,</hi> and that repeatedly, to his diſciples, yea to <hi>all;</hi> 'what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto <hi>all, watch.'</hi>

My ſoul well knows the myſtery of theſe things by repeated experience; but I have found, that, in proportion as all pride of every kind is done away, or hid from man (which is God's work) and the creature fully humbled and reduced to the loſs of all things, the Lord is pleaſed more abundantly to fill us with divine good; and to continue its bleſſed repleniſhings unto us! for through this abaſement we are enabled to bear this fulneſs without being puffed up, or thinking great things of ourſelves.

ſcarce any thing tends more powerfully to ſhut up the ſprings of life.—4th-day 16th, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mid-week meeting at the ſame place; and next day had a good meeting at the Gap; and on 6th and 7th days, ſeeing no way to go forward, I reſted, wrote, and waited fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directions.</p>
               <p>On 1ſt-day the 20th, I attended the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again at Fairfax; our friend Peter Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall alſo attended it, on a religious viſit. I ſat long in ſuffering ſilence; but at length, ſtanding up, got forward with much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſuch mountains of obſtruction lying in my way, ariſing from the ſtates of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as I believed, that I ſeemed not enabled to get along far before I found it beſt to ſit down, rather abruptly; and ſitting quiet and ſtill in mind, although I doubt not but many preſent thought me a fool, yet I felt reſigned to endure their ridicule.—But after ſitting a good while, and finding I could not leave the place eaſy, and the meeting having continued already to an unuſual length, I ſtood up again, intending to deſire another meeting next day; but as I was not haſty to utter any thing, but waited to feel and ſee my way in every word, I went on from one ſentence to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for ſome time, ſtill expecting to requeſt another meeting, but I could not find liberty ſo to do; inſtead thereof finding my mind gradually and unexpectedly opened and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, until Truth reigned over all!

               <p>On 4th-day the 25th, I had an open good meeting at Buſh-Creek in Maryland, having croſſed the great river Patowmack on 2d-day, being, as I hope, clear of Virginia. On 5th-day 26th, had a very good open meeting at Pipe-Creek in Maryland; and on ſeventh-day at Monallen in Pennſylvania, and ſo on to Huntingdon, Warrington, Newbury and York, having meetings at each of theſe places to good ſatisfaction. At York I had three, the two laſt laborious; but I felt in good degree clear of the town. And on 6th-day the 1ſt of 1ſt month 1790, I went to a place called Wright's Ferry, on the river Suſquehanna, where I had a pretty good meeting at the widow Wright's houſe—and the three next days, three bleſſed meetings at Lancaſter, Lampeter and Sadſbury; then on 3d-day the 5th, another ſuch at Eaſt Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham in Maryland,—Next day another ſuch at Weſt Nottingham in Maryland—and the day following another at Little-Britain in Pennſylvania; and on 6th-day the 8th, a bleſſed and very open one at Deer-Creek, over Suſquehanna in Maryland.—On firſt-day the 10th, through deep ſuffering, I was conſiderably opened and enlarged in the ſore
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:032810_0274_0FF52E7352D66B10"/>
and afternoon meetings at Baltimore. I ſtaid a few days in this place, and then rode to Little Falls, attending meeting there on 5th-day the 14th; and ſo on to Saſſafras, (on the eaſtern ſhore of Maryland) Head of Cheſter, George-Town, Cecil, Cheſter meeting and Cheſter-Town; then to Churchill, Queen-Ann's and Tuckahoe; having open good meetings at all theſe places, to the humiliation of my mind, and bowing me into thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and proſtration before the Lord, who alone giveth ability for every religious ſervice. —Next day, being 3d of the week, and 26th of the month, I attended the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miniſters and elders at Third-Haven; the two next days was held the quarterly meeting for church diſcipline; on the day following the monthly meeting there.—The two firſt of theſe four days were painfully exerciſing; but through <hi>patience in tribulation,</hi> and not preſuming to put forth a hand, or go forward, until the Shepherd of Iſrael went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, leading me on in the openings of light and life, I at length obtained deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, triumphed over all oppoſition, and coming forth from under that weight of death and darkneſs I had felt, found renewed ability the two laſt days thoroughly to relieve my mind among them; which was not only to the reproof of the lukewarm and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but abundantly to the watering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of thoſe who were truly hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs. I was made ſenſible that there was preſent a little remnant
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:032810_0275_0FF52E99DD1FD368"/>
who truly loved the Lord, and whoſe meat and drink it was to do his will; and bleſſed be his holy name for ever, they, with my own ſoul were eminently <hi>filled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next day I had a meeting at the Bay-ſide; it was ſilent and dull for a long time; after which my mouth was opened in the pure goſpel ſpring, and the meeting continued ſome conſiderable length of time longer, in a very open and relieving manner; the nature of goſpel worſhip and of all real goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, being largely opened to the people—may it faſten as a nail in a ſure place. Oh! how I have mourned before the Lord, under a ſenſe of the death and formality which reigns in Chriſtendom! for want of waiting for divine help, and through puſhing forward in man's time and ability, which brings forth but a form of godlineſs and devotion, without the life and power of it.</p>
               <p>On 1ſt-day the 31ſt, I had a very large and highly favoured meeting at Third-Haven, among the inhabitants of the town, many of whom had not been at any of the preceding meetings there. Goſpel light ſhined emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently among us, and I hope and believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was ſealed on ſome minds preſent, in a manner not eaſily to be eraſed.—The two next days we had meetings at Choptank and Marſhy-Creek, both precious ſeaſons after long waiting.—The two days following theſe, we were at meeting with the Nicholites (ſo
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:032810_0276_0FF52E86972FCA80"/>
called) at two of their meeting-houſes; and, after long and painful waiting, I laboured among them, I hope to the benefit of ſome of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>After this we went into Delaware ſtate, and had meetings at our friend Baptis Lay's at Cold Spring, Lewis-Town, Three-Runs, Mother-kill, Frederico and Mother-kill again. We were helped through to profit and relief in them all; though moſtly in a way much to the ſubjection of our own creaturely wills. Oh! what need there is to lie low, and riſe only as the pure life ariſes, leſt we be found offering ſtrange fire, or lifting up a tool on the Lord's altar.—Contentment in a lowly ſtate, and moving on gently in the real neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, is highly acceptable to him, without whom we can do nothing. Here we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his might, his right to command even faithfulneſs in the little, which fails not, if we rightly obey, to make us, in his own time, rulers over much; and ſometimes to our own great admiration.—Indeed it was ſo in ſeveral of theſe meetings—that at Lewis-Town and that at Frederico being times of high favour: the people were moſtly not of our ſociety, no meeting of Friends being uſually held at either place. Alſo the meetings at Mother-kill were, in the end, ſeaſons of enlargement, though through difficulty, hard labour, and cloſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward attention; eſpecially the laſt, wherein the Lord eminently evinced to us, beyond all room for doubt, that when he opens, none
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:032810_0277_0FF52E0312A6A498"/>
can ſhut—for he did remarkably both ſhut and open,'<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. iii. 7.</note> and even before he opened the way in full clearneſs, he brought us under a neceſſity of labouring in the little, wherein dear Mary Berry, a ſkilful labourer, was made victorious; but we both found, that, move ever ſo carefully and gently, as in the real neceſſity, it was not for a long ſeaſon the Lord's time or will to open fully or give us to reign: the ſeed was under ſuffering, and we muſt ſuffer with it, and did very deeply and painfully, and laboured in great bowed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and abaſement.—But bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, in his own time ever beſt, he marvellouſly aroſe—opened the way with clearneſs: then all that was oppoſed proved unable to ſhut it.</p>
               <p>We then had meetings at Dover and Little Creek, both highly favoured; at the cloſe of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> Little Creek, I had to part with my ſaid friend Mary Berry, Richard Bartlett, his wife a worthy friend, and John Dickenſon; a tender parting it was, not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be forgotten—may the Lord hold them, and my own ſoul, in his holy hand for ever! —On 2d-day the 14th, we were at Duck-Creek; 3d-day at Appoquinamink; 4th, at White-Clay Creek; 5th at Wilmington—all good open meetings—the two firſt very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving —in the two laſt relief was obtained through cloſe attention and creaturely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. I then went to Philadelphia.—On
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:032810_0278_0FF52DDD021DE690"/>
firſt-day the 20th, I attended in the forenoon the meeting at Pine-Street; afternoon at the Bank, and in the evening at Market-Street. On ſecond-day the ſelect morning meeting; 3d-day monthly meeting at the Bank; 4th-day the monthly meeting at Pine-Street; 5th-day preparative meeting at Market-Street, where alſo was a marriage; and on 6th-day the monthly meeting of Friends belonging to Market-Street meeting. My mind was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized into ſympathy with the ſuffering ſeed in all theſe meetings—but as I was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and enabled to keep in the life, and attentive to the openings thereof, I got relief from day to day, in a line of cloſe plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was to me very laborious; to ſome preſent very alarming; and to others greatly conſolating and encouraging.</p>
               <p>And now, finding my mind greatly reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a heavy weight of exerciſe, I had to behold the great danger of taking my flight on a day of reſt and pleaſantneſs.—Oh, how careful ought we to be in all our words and actions, leſt feeling eaſe and liberty in our minds, we tranſgreſs the holy limits and boundaries of Truth; offend ſome of the little ones; and wound our own ſouls! Oh, thou only preſerver of men, preſerve me, I pray thee, in a humble watchful ſtate, with mine eye ſingle to thy holy light, both in heights and depths, henceforth for ever. Amen.</p>

                  <pb n="266" facs="unknown:032810_0279_0FF52F4C415A0DD8"/>On 7th-day the 27th, I left the city, and rode to Bibury, to the houſe of that deeply experienced miniſter of the goſpel James Thornton, whom I much loved and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—his health was ill, but I felt him to be alive in the everlaſting truth; I felt near and dear unity with him in the inward covenant of divine life, where I ſaw and felt him hid with Chriſt in God; grown up to the ſtature of a man in Chriſt, and into the heavenly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and eſtabliſhment, as a pillar in the temple of God, that ſhall go no more out.— I was much edified by his converſation, and judicious unaffected remarks.—Oh! <hi>that my latter end may be like his!</hi> Next day I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the meeting at ſaid Bibury, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing livingly opened into the ſtate of things among them, and helped to diſcharge my mind in Truth's holy authority, I felt great relief and ſatisfaction—And the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having ſpent a little more time with my dear friend James Thornton, and viſited his ſon Joſeph, a choice young man, but very low, and likely before long to finiſh his courſe here, I parted with them in fulneſs of goſpel endearment, and rode to Wrightſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, where next day I had an open precious time at their monthly meeting. Then went home with my dear friend John Simpſon, who, having been on a religious viſit in New-England ſince I left home, had kindly viſited my dear wife and family, to his own, and I doubt not to their ſatisfaction and comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="unknown:032810_0280_0FF52F0B96D36628"/>Next day the 4th of the week and 3d of the month, I went to ſee my kind friend Thomas Smith and his family, of Buckingham, where, and at whoſe houſe, my dear former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion Joſeph Mitchel was ſick and died. We were glad to ſee each other; and Thomas kindly rode with me to Kingwood, in Weſt- New-Jerſey, over the river Delaware, where, on fifth-day I had a good refreſhing meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—and another on ſixth-day at our friend Joſeph Moore's, to a degree of ſatisfaction. Then I returned to Kingwood, parting with Thomas at Joſeph Moore's. I ſtaid at King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood (not being clear) until after the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on firſt-day the 7th of the month; an open, large and enlarged meeting it was, to my great relief, and I truſt, to the laſting benefit of divers others. I then had meetings on third-day at Hardwick, and fifth-day at Mendham—in both Truth wrought relief and enlargement. And feeling clear of theſe parts, I went to New-York, where, on firſt-day the 14th, my mind and mouth were liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly opened, which had never been the caſe in that city before, ſilence having always been my lot when there before: but now my tongue was looſed, though in a cloſe and ſomewhat alarming manner, yet greatly to my own peace, both fore and afternoon— after which was held, by appointment, an evening meeting; it was large, and dear Iſaac Everett, of Pennſylvania, now on his return from a religious viſit into New-England, was livingly opened and favoured in this evening
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:032810_0281_0FF52E16055C9EA0"/>
meeting.—I alſo had a few words in this meeting, and then felt clear of the city. But dear Iſaac appointed another meeting next day—I ſtaid and attended it—he was helped to declare deep truths in Truth's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority—and the deſire of my heart was and is, that they may be duly regarded.</p>
               <p>On 3d-day I left the city, and was next day at monthly meeting at Weſtbury on Long-Iſland; 5th-day at monthly meeting at Jericho; 6th-day at meeting at Martinacock; 7th-day at Cow-Neck; firſt-day at Weſtbury again; and on 2d-day at Bethphage—on the whole being greatly relieved in ſpirit after theſe meetings, wherein I had known much ſubjection of the creaturely will, I found my mind quite clear and eaſy; and ſo, taking an hearty farewell of my dear friends on the Iſland, I ſat out for New-England, and got home to my dear wife and family on 7th-day the 27th of ſaid third month.—And being thankful in heart in finding them in uſual health, and having to believe that I had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſervice required of me at this time, and had been directed and enabled to return as I went forth, in the Lord's own time and will, I bowed low in inward awfulneſs and proſtration before him, once more giving up and dedicating my life and my all to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in full faith and aſſurance, that, if I rely wholly on him, and remain to be given up to be juſt where and what he pleaſes, go at his command, and come at his command, and at

his command ſtand ſtill, he will not fail or forſake me; but will bear up, ſupport and preſerve, through all toſſings, tempeſts and dangers, both inward and outward; and that <q>though the fig-tree ſhould not bloſſom, nor fruit be in the vine; though the labour of the olive ſhould fail, the flocks be cut off from the fold, and no herd be in the ſtall;</q> though <hi>all</hi> earthly conſolation ſhould fail; yet ſtill I may, and if ſteadfaſtly patient and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, certainly ſhall, amidſt all conflicts, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and toils, at times and ſeaſons, <q>rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</q>

               <p>My dear wife and children, as alſo my friends, appeared glad of my ſafe return to them again; and on my own part, I was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glad once more to be favoured with their endeared company and converſation—may we all ſo abide in the holy root of life, and ſo under the influence and direction of the inward light, as that we may be mutual helps and encouragements to each other, in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous path and pilgrimage of a truly chriſtian life, through the remaining courſe of time allotted us in this vale of tears, this ſcene of viciſſitudes, tribulations and joys.</p>
               <p>I was out on this exerciſing journey a year and about fifteen days, and travelled, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:032810_0283_0FF52E9CAD036C18"/>
about five thouſand three hundred miles. And though my trials and inward exerciſes have often been more deeply prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than I have words to convey to any who have not travelled a path of like painful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; yet I have ever found, that as faith and patience have been abode in, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings quietly ſubmitted to, the reſult has been, a coming forth with ſongs of praiſe and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs, into the victory and dominion of Truth, and the glorious liberty of the ſons of God.—And I think I may ſay, that through divine help, without which I know I can do nothing, I have been preſerved through ſome of the deepeſt probations, and tribulations of my life, in more conſtant reſignation to the divine will, than ever was for a like ſpace of time and under equal extremity of trial, and varied anxiety, my attainment and experience before!—Bleſſed for ever, over all, be the great name of the Lord, and to him be all the praiſe.</p>

               <p>HAVING thus performed the ſervice required of me in the ſouthern ſtates, I paſſed near three years at and about home; and had, as uſual, many cloſe trials and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetments to paſs through from time to time, until in the 7th month 1791, it pleaſed the Moſt High to prove me in a very near and heart-exerciſing manner, in the removal by death of my dearly beloved wife. This trial came at a time when I was otherways deeply plunged into many probations, both inwardly and outwardly.—My ſtate indeed to me bore a lively reſemblance to that of Job of old— wave on wave, and ſorrow upon ſorrow, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt ready to ſwallow me up. But the Lord had an <hi>end</hi> in all my ſorrows.—And had he not been with me in the deeps, and borne up my head above the waves. I had been ſwallowed up ſuddenly, and drowned in the mighty waters of affliction!</p>
               <p>I thought before my wife's ſickneſs, it was very doubtful whether I ſhould ever get ſafely through my many beſetments: but alas! in the midſt of theſe trials, it pleaſed the Lord to take from me the dear partner of joys,
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:032810_0285_0FF52F5F6A389FD0"/>
and ſympathizer in my ſorrows.—She was confined to her bed-chamber two weeks, during great part of which time ſhe was in exquiſite bodily pain, which ſhe bore with becoming patience. One day ſhe lay ſtill and quiet, as if ſhe was in a ſlumber; but on hearing it remarked at night, that it had been a favourable day to her as to pain, ſhe ſaid, it had been a day of much pain to her, though ſhe had not complained, for ſhe felt no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to complain; but found it her place to bear all that was laid upon her patiently. I kept an account of divers lively expreſſions which dropped from her in her ſickneſs, and which abundantly evinced her reſignation of mind and acquieſcence with the divine will in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to her approaching diſſolution, which ſhe ſeemed clearly ſenſible of, and divers times ſpake of; but what I wrote got miſlaid, and I have not ſince found it; I much regret the loſs of it, and eſpecially becauſe her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to our dear children might have been very uſeful.—She alſo gave very ſuitable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to her brothers and ſiſters, and expreſſed her thankfulneſs to her parents for their watchful and even reſtraining care exerciſed towards her in her younger years, when ſhe uſed to think a little more liberty would have been no harm; but now ſhe ſaw ſhe was then too ignorant of the dangerous tendency of thoſe liberties, and rejoiced that they did not give way to her inclinations.—She preſſed it upon her brothers and ſiſters to remember their parents in their old age—told them,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:032810_0286_0FF52E4152DDBA28"/>
they had done much for them when they were unable to help themſelves—that now they were growing old and feeble, and to be kind to them and not forget them.—She alſo deſired them not to forget their brother, (meaning myſelf) ſaying, <q>he will have many afflictions to paſs through, with much care. —And likewiſe forget not theſe little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they will miſs their mother, and need the care of their uncles and aunts.</q> And ſpeaking to one of her ſiſters, ſaid, <q>thou haſt done a great deal for them, and muſt not think of doing leſs when their mother is gone.</q>
               </p>
               <p>She charged it upon our children to be obedient to their father, loving to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and good to their aged grandfather.— Two Friends coming in, who had both been widowers, after ſeveral other weighty expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſhe deſired them not to forget the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted</hi>—told them they knew ſomething of ſuch trials as her dear huſband would be ſurrounded with, and that ſhe hoped they would not be unmindful of him.—I can ſcarcely write this account without mourning the loſs of that I wrote from day to day in her ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>One day, after expreſſing her entire wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to be taken hence at this time, ſhe ſaid to me, <q>but I have ſeveral times thought I ſhould have been willing to have taken the care of theſe dear children a little

longer if it had been the divine will—and I have thought, if it might have been ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I could have given up every thing that might have been called for, even if it had been to give thee up to travel in truth's ſervice, let the time be longer or ſhorter: I have always given thee up with a good degree of cheerfulneſs, and have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in thy abſence beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet I have often thought, ſince thy return from thy laſt journey, that I did not know that I could ever give thee up again, or bear up in thy abſence: but in this ſickneſs I have felt as though I could give up all, if I might be ſpared a little longer to help along in the care of the children—it has ſeemed to me that I ſhould give thee up my dear huſband, to go wherever the Lord might lead thee—it has ſeemed ſo, but may be it would not be ſo with me if I ſhould be tried with it; and perhaps I ſhall be taken away that thou mayeſt be ſet more fully at liberty to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Lord's requirings in whatever part of the world he may ſee meet to employ thee.</q> Then ſhe expreſſed her deep ſenſe of my kindneſs to her in her ſickneſs, and her heart-felt ſympathy with me in my trials, paſt, preſent and to come, and her living de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for my ſupport and preſervation through all, to the end of my race, in ſuch a moving manner, that the freſh ſenſe thereof melts my heart when I recollect the time and ſubſtance of the converſation—and I truſt I ſhall not
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:032810_0288_0FF52DBBB0988570"/>
ſoon, if ever, forget the endearment and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity attending it.</p>
               <p>On my going into the room very ſhortly before the ſcene was cloſed with her here, ſhe expreſſed great gladneſs at ſeeing me, and that ſhe had been deſiring me to come— I believe ſhe was ſenſible her end was juſt approaching.—She expreſſed great thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her dear young friend A. A. for the great care ſhe had taken of her through the night. All that was alive in me was moved at this time, for I ſaw ſhe was juſt going. Oh! how expreſſively ſhe looked upon me! how endearing her expreſſions! but ſhe was ſoon paſt converſation, and reſigned her ſoul up to him who gave it, on the morning of the 5th of the 7th month 1791, dying of a putrid diſorder, and was buried the 6th in Friends burying ground in Providence.</p>
               <p>Through divine help my mind was pretty well ſtayed, though deeply affected and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly moved through her ſickneſs, death and burial. And through all, and after all, I have this conſolation, that her ſoul was centered in divine love, and ſweetened with a fore-taſte of heavenly enjoyment. And though painful to me the ſeparation, and trying in many of my lonely moments; yet in God I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and hope of conſolation, and I dare not do any other than bleſs his holy name in every trial; and if he but preſerves my ſoul
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:032810_0289_0FF52F6ED8FA0EE8"/>
alive in him, and faithful in his covenant; all elſe I yield to his all-wiſe diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>Many a mournful day and anxious night did I paſs through, in this my loneſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and in a deep-felt ſenſe of the buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Satan within, and certain outward probations, in wiſdom ſuffered to beſet me. I ſaw clearly I muſt be redeemed from many things wherein ſome are taking ſatisfaction, if I would live wholly unto God. I ſaw alſo that he ſuffered me to be many ways afflicted, in order that I might be ſo redeemed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſeemed as if I could ſcarce live thro' my inward baptiſms and outward beſetments; yet ſtill preſſed forward, until, in a time of deep diſtreſs, I found relief and conſolation, in remembering that ſome of the moſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing mornings of my life have been followed by ſome of the moſt happy and joyful even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and ſome of the moſt melancholy even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by mornings of moſt ſubſtantial glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—therefore drew the following conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: I will ſtrive to moderate my joy in the moment of proſperity—and in the hour of adverſity I will endeavour to hope; for tho' ſorrow may remain for the night, yet joy cometh in the morning.</p>

and ſome faithful labours for the good of the brethren in a more private way. 28th, ſat under my own vine and fig-tree, where none could make afraid. 29th, I find yet need of dying daily—have in good degree ſubmitted to it this day. Lord, let not thine hand ſpare, nor thine eye pity, until thou bringeſt forth judgment unto victory in me. Fifth of 8th month, I feel that my God has greatly weaned, and is weaning me; but I want to be able to ſay, through and with my Saviour, 'I have overcome the world.'<note n="*" place="bottom">John xvi. 33.</note> I greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire fully and unreſervedly to die to every thing that is not of the Father, whether it be of the world, the fleſh or the devil—in ſhort, to know an overcoming of all evil, and all evil motions and deſires, ſo as that they may die at the root.

               <p>6th. Bleſſed be the name of the Lord!— the work goes on—righteouſneſs is laid to the line, and judgment to the plumb-line, in my ſoul. Lord, ſpare not, nor ſtay thy hand— cleanſe thoroughly the floor of my heart, and burn up all the chaff in me with thy baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unquenchable fire. 19th, I feel much reconciled to the divine will, and therein to all my ſufferings and afflictions, inward and outward; and do not wiſh them removed until they have done all, for which the Lord leads me into them. And further, it is my deſire, that I may never ſeek or take ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any thing this world affords, otherwiſe than according to God's moſt holy will; but that I may receive every bleſſing, every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, comfort and conſolation, as alſo every trial, affliction, croſs and diſappointment, as coming from his hand—and ſo learn truly to <q>rejoice evermore, and in every thing give thanks.</q>

               <p>21ſt. Highly favoured and greatly reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was my exerciſed mind, in the meeting at Uxbridge. Truth's teſtimony flowed like oil, and important doctrines were therein opened to the people. 28th. This morning, I truſt, my mind is in ſubjection to the divine will, though heavily laden with inward exerciſe.— Oh, gracious God, deliver me from all evil, and make me wholly thine!—In our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon meeting my ſoul praiſed God in ſilent adoration, on the banks of heart-felt deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Dear Mary Ridgeway and Jane Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from Ireland, attended, and were livingly opened in the word of the Lord, and ſpake with life and preciſion to ſeveral ſtates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. I think words never dropt from human lips that ever ſank deeper into my heart, than a few that dear Mary uttered towards the cloſe of her teſtimony-ſpeaking to the Lord's tried ſervants, mentioned, that where Chriſt is, there they muſt be; and that ſhe had felt her mind very nearly united in deep ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with ſome very cloſely tried ſouls preſent; ſhe added, <q>And it is with me juſt to revive in the remembrance of theſe, what Chriſt ſaid to his dear diſciples, <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations, and I appoint unto you a kingdom.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luke xxii. 28 29.</note> Oh, there is deep meaning in it; my ſoul felt it in the everlaſting covenant of divine light and life,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:032810_0295_0FF52F376EB85B90"/>
and well underſtood the meaning of it.— Verily, unleſs we not only know what it is to be with him in his temptations now and then a little while, but to continue with him to the end without forſaking him, we cannot reign with him in his kingdom. But ah! ſaith my ſoul, the ſore and almoſt inexpreſſible tribulations and conflicts that are endured by ſuch for a ſeaſon as do truly and faithfully <hi>continue with him in his temptations!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Formaliſts may dream, conceive, and talk about them; but none know the depth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but ſuch as do, through all pain, peril and probation, <hi>continue with him.</hi> Bow low, Oh my ſoul, and bleſs his name for ever, that he has thus far enabled thee to <hi>be with him,</hi> not only in his reign, but again and again in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, ſufferings and death. Thou knoweſt, thou deeply, painfully, and joyfully knoweſt, that this leads to, and muſt precede thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him in glory. But ſing, O ye heavens, and ſhout for joy, ye redeemed ſouls on earth; as the pilgrimage, though painful, is rightly continued, and he is <hi>continued with through all;</hi> the conſolation that follows, when the angels miniſter to him and us, as fellow-heirs of God, yea, joint-heirs of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; every ſigh and every ſorrow, is far more than compenſated to us: therefore, Oh thou tribulated follower of Chriſt, in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hold on thy way, faint not, hold faſt that thou haſt received; let no man take thy

crown; be thou faithful unto death, and he will give thee a crown of life.</p>
               <p>Afternoon, my ſoul bowed low before the Lord in reverent, thankful adoration, and bleſſed his holy name.—And may his name be bleſſed and praiſed for ever by me, and all the living.—Oh, the <hi>living,</hi> the <hi>living</hi>— they alone can praiſe him—the <hi>dead</hi> may ſing in the <hi>dead</hi> letter; but cannot praiſe nor cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the name of the Lord Almighty. This has been a day of divine favour, after a ſcene of almoſt unutterable anxiety and bitterneſs of ſoul for much of many days and weeks paſt: the exerciſes attending me thro' which, the Lord my God alone is fully acquainted with. But enough it is, that he knows them thoroughly, and that with him in ſecret every ſigh is numbered, and every tear bottled up in remembrance; and will certainly, as his will is ſteadily abode in, be changed into wine, new, in his heavenly kingdom. Amen, Amen—thy will, O God, be done for ever!</p>
               <p>9th month 1ſt. The Lord, the God of my life, was graciouſly pleaſed to fill my ſoul with the overflowing of divine love, and inſhinings of divine light, which continued with me until late in the night, and wherein I have been much inſtructed.—And, O Lord, my God, I humbly crave of thee to enable me, rightly, to ſettle, or to have and know, thro' thy help, rightly ſettled in my mind, every neceſſary rule, limit and regulation of life;
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:032810_0297_0FF52FA66AEEC4B8"/>
and that thou wouldeſt ſteadily hold my hand and guide my feet, in ways that will pleaſe thee, until every ſuch rule and limitation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſanction in my heart of a divine law, that is not to be broken again for ever; yea, until a confirmed and habitual obſervance of them ſhall have conformed my whole life thereunto; and therein to thy divine will, and heavenly image. Amen!</p>
               <p>10th month 4th. Jeſus Chriſt is my only hope of glory—my only conſolation in every wo. O, I long to be wholly his at all times —I long to be able to ſay continually and truly, 'my ſoul is even as a weaned child.'<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. cxxxi. 2.</note> It is delightful to me to feel myſelf like a child—that is, weaned from what I moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in—yea, from much if any remaining delight in any thing but the love of God ſhed abroad in my ſoul. 10th month 6th.—Still thankful for preſervation, and begging to be preſerved; much broken off from all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely dependance, and all human, all earthly conſolation; caring very little where I am, or may be; what I am, or may be about; or what does, or may happen to me; ſo that in and through all I may be preſerved from all ſin. I ſcarce have any wiſh about my life, whether I may live long, or be ſoon releaſed; whether I may have little or much of this world; little or much toil of body or mind; little or much of the favours and friendſhip, or the frowns and reproaches of man—ſo that

               <p>10th month 7th. O, thou ever watchful and unſlumbering Shepherd of Iſrael, I beg and beſeech thee, on the bended knees of my proſtrated ſoul, that thou wouldſt ariſe and ſave; and ſuffer me not to crave thy aid <hi>in vain.</hi> O make, I pray thee, my feelings, on the approach of every temptation, quick and lively, in watchfulneſs and reſiſtance againſt all ſin; and raiſe, in the inmoſt of my ſoul, an unabated and unremitting abhorrence of all evil; and even of all that tends to lead the mind into it, or weaken its fortitude, or abate its perſeverance in holy wreſtling war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and watchfulneſs againſt it—For, Oh my God and my all; I cannot be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin; I cannot conſent to let thee go, or ceaſe my wreſtling with thee, until thou bleſs me, and preſerveſt my ſoul from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and defilement.

               <p>10th month 8th. I renewed covenant with God, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, through his help, to be given up, and wholly devoted to his will and diſpoſal: therefore, in awful proſtration, humility, abaſement and total renunciation of my own ability without thee, I caſt my care wholly upon thee; and look up to thee and thy holy habitation for

O holy Father, <hi>thou knoweſt that I love thee</hi>—that I love thee above all things, and that I would rather lay down my life, than live to ſin againſt thee. O keep my ſoul alive and ſuffer it not to have cauſe again to deplore a renewed deviation from the way of life and ſalvation; but as ſoon as Satan attempts to enſnare, give me, I pray thee, to behold him—to riſe up in thine invincible life and power againſt him, and therein to tread him under my feet.</p>
               <p>10th month 18th. This day I am forty years old. I have gone through many deep probations—have made many conſiderable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for the ſake of peace of mind—and have alſo at times come ſhort of that ſtrictneſs of life, watch and devotion, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Truth required of me. O Lord my God and Saviour; thy holy aid, I ſtill do crave. I know I have not <hi>yet</hi> fully and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly attained thereto.

               <p>10th month 20th. I opened my concern in our preparative meeting to make a religious viſit to ſome of the people in the ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, and 26th, laid the ſame before our monthly meeting.</p>
               <p>28th of 11th mo. Riding on the road, my mind was livingly opened; and I beheld, in the viſions of God, large fields of labour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted me in his ſervice. A language ran livingly through my ſoul, and the whole man ſeemed almoſt ſwallowed up in the flowings of life which accompanied the glorious proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect! The language was on this wiſe:— Thou art called and appointed, and through many and deep tribulations I have ſeparated thee a prophet to the nations. Thou haſt very little more ever to do in the buſineſs and affairs of this life. Gather thy mind from all cumbering things, and ſtand ſingly and wholly devoted to my work, ſervice and appointment. Regard not the world; thou muſt be about thy heavenly Father's buſineſs; thou muſt attend to my directions, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit therein to thy proper allotment. My will and purpoſe requires and loudly calls, and has called, for greater dedication of heart and ſingleneſs of devotion to my work and ſervice in the glorious goſpel. Take no thought for the morrow: do to day what thou findeſt to do, in my light, and in the liberty and allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of my holy ſpirit. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will aſſuredly give thee a crown of life; I will hold thee in my holy hand for ever; I will provide for and take care of thy motherleſs and as it were fatherleſs children in thy abſence.—But if thou decline my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and appointment, I can, and aſſuredly will, blaſt all thy undertakings. Thou mayeſt think to do ſomething for thy children; but thou ſhalt find, to thy humiliation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, thy labours ſhall be vain and fruitleſs; thou ſhalt but toil in the night and attain nothing; blaſting and mildew ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thee; thy children ſhall not be availingly aſſiſted by all thy ſuch like endeavours. Thy comfort in them ſhall be little or nothing, and above all this, thy ſoul ſhall ſuffer loſs; temptation ſhall prevail againſt thee; Satan ſhall be let looſe to buffet thee, and ſhall be permitted to prevail; thy life ſhall be a life of bitterneſs and deſolation; neither the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nor the earth ſhall afford thee enjoyment —thou ſhalt drag out a miſerable life in anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and wiſh thou hadſt never been. But if in full and unreſerved reliance on my all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, thou giveſt up thy life and thy all to my diſpoſal, I will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee; no lack of any good thing ſhalt thou ever have cauſe to complain of. I am Alpha and Omega—I am all in all—take <hi>me</hi> as ſuch for thy only portion, and ſeek no other inheritance. In bleſſing I will for ever bleſs thee—and evermore in all things will I ſuſtain thee, and that through all time and

However ſuch is my confidence in that evidence of life accompanying the opening, that I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured here to record it, this 28th day of 11th month 1791. 12th month 28th, Much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in our monthly meeting, tho' Friends gave me a good certificate to travel into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, to viſit the ſeed there.</p>
               <p>1ſt month 12th 1792. Opened in the ſpring of life, in our quarterly meeting for worſhip —proceeded a little, but was ſuddenly and unexpectedly ſhut up, and ſat down immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, after which my ſoul rejoiced that my will was in ſubjection, and that I was ſenſible I could do nothing of myſelf. 13th, The quarterly meeting for buſineſs gave me, and my dear friend David Buffum, concurring certificates, in order to our religious viſit to the people of Connecticut. 15th, Low in heart. Oh, my God, thou leadeſt me in the valley—I accept it as thy will, and as in thy wiſdom, for my good. 17th, My ſtate is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Satan roars like a lion. Lord, my heart is melted in me into tenderneſs: mine eyes are affected while I write, under a ſenſe of my utter inſufficiency to ſtand in my <hi>own</hi> ſtrength. How long. O thou moſt Holy will it be ere thou conform my whole man to thine own image or likeneſs? thou knoweſt I <hi>groan within myſelf, waiting for the full adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi>

O that all within me were like thee, holy as thou art holy, and at all times joined to thee in the heavenly oneneſs. Go on, I pray thee, conquering all that oppoſes thy reign in me, until every thought be brought into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt. Amen.</p>

               <p>31ſt of 1ſt mo. I took a ſolemn leave of the family (that is, my father-in-law Daniel Anthony's) living in my houſe, and in whoſe family I left my own father, and my two youngeſt children: and being joined by my friend David Buffum, (Amos Collins and Benedict Arnold having given up to bear us company) we were on 5th day of the 2d mo. at the new meeting-houſe in Glouceſter, on our way towards Connecticut, and had meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as follows, viz.—7th, at Killingley, had a ſmall meeting at — Dean's; 9th, at Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Brayton's in Pomfret; 12th, attended Friends meeting at Hopkinton; 14th, had one by appointment at Amos Collins's, my way having been hitherto much cloſed up as to goſpel miniſtry, my companion D. B. having a little to offer at times, I truſt, to good accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; 16th, we had a good open meeting at Stonington Point, and another in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 17th, went to New-London, and 18th, had a ſmall meeting there in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional meeting-houſe; 19th, had a meeting among the Baptiſts at New-London Great-Neck, found but little relief in theſe laſt meetings, though hope they were of ſome uſe; 20th, had an evening meeting at Lime, in a ſchool-houſe—The people were unſettled, and appeared much unacquainted with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:032810_0306_0FF5308A0D9186A8"/>
worſhip—we laboured a little among them; and, 21ſt, croſſed Connecticut river, by boat, and not without ſome danger in the ice, and went to Saybrook; 22d, had a meeting here in the meeting-houſe—the prieſt attended, and a conſiderable number of his hearers, and neither he nor his hearers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be much acquainted with our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waiting upon God in a ſilent travail of ſoul, and feeling after him. We laboured among them according to the ability received. After meeting he inclined to have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and we, being willing, converſed with him on divers religious ſubjects. He was civil; and we parted friendly and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectfully.</p>
               <p>23d. We rode through Killingſworth to Guilford, where, 24th, we had a ſoul-ſolacing meeting; among thoſe who attended, were divers religiouſly exerciſed ſouls, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances declared they had been with Jeſus. 25th, had another good meeting in a ſchool-houſe at Wallingford. After meeting divers of the people came to our lodgings, and we had conſiderable converſation with them. A phyſician contended earneſtly for the final ſalvation of all men. We told him none could be diſciples of Chriſt, but ſuch as took up their daily croſs and followed him, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of ſelf; that he wept over ſome, who, though he <hi>would</hi> have gathered them, they <hi>would not;</hi> that, though many ſhould come from the eaſt, weſt, north and ſouth, and ſit

down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of God; yet many who were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the children of the kingdom would be <hi>caſt out;</hi> that thoſe who <hi>die in their ſins,</hi> where Chriſt is gone, they can <hi>never come;</hi> that ſome were never to have forgiveneſs in this world, nor in that which is to come: that ſome would be puniſhed with <hi>everlaſting</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; that theſe muſt go away into <hi>everlaſting puniſhment;</hi> but the righteous into life eternal. And finally, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very friendly, he ſaid he loved us, and wiſhed us well; and the company ſeemed very friendly; ſo, taking a hearty farewell of each other, we proceeded on our way.</p>
               <p>26th. Rode to Waterbury. 27th, had a meeting there; the people were much unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and too many of them were light; a teſtimony to the principle of light and life was borne among them by my companion; and I reproved them for their uncivil beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and teſtified the impoſſibility of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel in man's time. 28th, we rode to our friend Elijah Steel's, in Cornwall.— 29th, attended Friends meeting at Goſhen, at the houſe of our friend Charles Richards. Firſt of 3d month, had an appointed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Goſhen, at our friend Charles Richards aforeſaid; it was a precious open meeting; after which we rode to Canaan, and, 2d, to Hudſon, in New-York ſtate. 4th, attended Friends meeting there. 7th-day, the Creek
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:032810_0308_0FF530BB0A65E938"/>
preparative meeting—it was exerciſing in the fore part; but Truth reigned over all in the end. 8th, attended Nine-Partners preparative meeting.—The ſearching power of Truth ſet things in cloſe order before them. 9th, took leave of ſeveral Friends, and rode towards home; where, on the 14th day, I reached, and found all pretty well. In this journey I rode, by the account I kept, 488 miles—a painful exerciſing journey it has been; but a good degree of patience was afforded us.— 28th, contented in a low ſtate, in our month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting. I am yet weak,—Lord help, help my ſoul, and give it ſtability.</p>
               <p>31ſt, I opened in our ſelect meeting a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that had been about 14 years ripening in my mind, to pay a religious viſit to Friends in Europe. My heart had of late been preſſingly full of it, as a veſſel wanting vent. Friends left me at liberty to move the matter in our monthly meeting, when I might feel the way open for it. They were feelingly dipt into a ſenſe of the travail of my exerciſed ſoul, and Truth was prevalent. 4th month 11th, I laid before the meeting for ſufferings a treatiſe I had written on baptiſm. 25th, opened my concern to make a viſit to Europe in our monthly meeting. 6th month 6th, attended the firſt ſitting of our yearly meeting, which continued until the 12th. It was a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable yearly meeting: much unity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and love prevailed throughout. 6th mo. 27th, in our monthly meeting, I aſked for,
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:032810_0309_0FF5313217B9B718"/>
and obtained a certificate to pay a ſmall debt, by a viſit within Salem quarterly meeting, and, 30th, ſet out on ſaid viſit into that quarter, and rode as far as Boſton, and, firſt day of the week, and 1ſt of 7th month, attended meeting there—ſilent—the meeting ſmall; yet I hoped Truth's teſtimony was not quite loſt among them. May a revival take place, and Truth yet proſper there. Rode to Lynn, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2d of the month, had a meeting there: the way not very open; but I laboured in weakneſs. There is a number of panting ſouls in that place. 3d, had a laborious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Salem; found ſome relief. 4th, had a pretty open meeting at Newbury. 5th and 6th. was at Almſbury and Seabrook; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerciſed in both. 7th, 8th and 10th, was at Dover, Berwick and Wyndham; had a good meeting at the laſt place, and returned to Falmouth. 11th. attended the meeting there; it was a cloſe, ſearching, laborious time. 12th, had a good open rejoicing meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Durham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rode from thence to Bath. 13th, had a very trying meeting there; my mind was deeply ſenſible, though an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſtranger, that there was either a wolf or wolves among us, in ſheep's clothing; the which gave me much and long painful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward labour, and alſo lengthy vocal exerciſe. The teſtimony of the word of life I felt as a flame againſt antichriſt in the temple of God, againſt likeneſſes in religion; forms without ſubſtance; words without life and power: at length my ſpirit was clear and eaſy, and after
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:032810_0310_0FF52FFFAA8A6568"/>
meeting I was informed a man was there, who was a preacher among a people at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Bath, and that he was not a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, or even a moral man. Thanks be unto God, who gave us the victory this day.</p>
               <p>15th, was at Vaſſelborough: and 16th at Fairfield, where I had a good open relieving time, having much to declare of the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſalvation <hi>in ſin;</hi> and I apprehend there was a ſtate preſent to whom it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable.—17th, rode to Green, and 18th to Falmouth.—19th, had a meeting at Portland in Falmouth, a place that uſed to be called Caſco-Bay, in a congregational meeting-houſe, a good open meeting, and in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon at Friends meeting-place.—20th, rode to Berwick; and, 21ſt, attended monthly meeting there; and, 22d, their firſt-day meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—23d, returned to Falmouth, and, 25th, attended monthly meeting there, was favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in opening divine truths.—26th, rode to Durham; 27th, favoured in the monthly meeting there.—29th, opened in Truth's doctrines at Falmouth, being their firſt-day meeting.</p>
               <p>1ſt of 8th month, had a good meeting at Rocheſter, among Friends and others—bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the name of the Lord.—2d, had a meeting at Lee, where, among Friends and others, my mind was much relieved in a cloſe ſearching teſtimony.—3d, was at Epping, and 4th, at Newtown; had laborious ſervice in
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:032810_0311_0FF5303412FF4030"/>
each, but relief in the concluſion.—5th, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt of the week, I attended the fore and afternoon meetings at Salem; and after a cloſe ſearching teſtimony, left the town relieved in mind, and rode to Lynn—and 6th of the month rode home—having been out about five weeks and an half in this journey, and rode about ſeven hundred and fifty miles; paſſed through many deep, trying and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing ſeaſons; and bleſſed the name of the Lord for his holy help, who, in the day of battle, gave me the victory.—9th day of the 8th month, attended our quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it was a favoured time. Dear John and Benjamin Reeve, from Jerſey, attended this meeting.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed the time ſince my return from the Eaſtern Quarter at and about home, in the attendance of meetings and reviſion of my journal, ſome other writings, and prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my European journey, having now obtained certificates from our monthly and quarterly meetings for that purpoſe, placed my children to ſatisfaction, and ſettled my outward affairs, am this 26th day of the 11th month, about ready and expect this day to leave home.—Lord, thou haſt held my hand, and covered my head in many battles—be with me, I pray thee, through all; and keep me from evil. Be with my dear motherleſs children; viſit them, I pray thee, by thy holy ſpirit; lead them in the way of refinement and ſelf-denial; and, finally, bring them unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Account of his voyage to Europe.</head>
               <p>ON the 26th day of the 11th month, 1792, I took a ſolemn leave of my dear father, father and mother-in-law, my two youngeſt children, whom I left in their care, and of my brothers and ſiſters-in-law, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by my kind friends Thomas Arnold and Smith Brown, went to Boſton. 27th, the ſhip not ready to ſail, I made ſome prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the voyage. 29th, my two ſaid friends returning home, I attended the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Boſton which was ſmall; I had howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a few words of invitation for them. 30th, I went to Lynn, and 1ſt of the 12th month, viſited divers families there; and 2d, attended their large meeting in ſilence; 3d, returned to Boſton; 4th, wrote letters home; and 5th, went on board the ſhip Mercury of 240 tons, bound for Dunkirk, Benjamin Glover, of Nantucket, maſter. We ſailed about noon: ſome time in the afternoon we loſt ſight of Boſton. In the night all hands were called up, and the ſhip put about in order to return to the harbour, ſhe leaking, and the leak ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly increaſing, that is, from the rate of one hundred ſtrokes of the pump an hour to ſix hundred. The captain, mates and crew, were alarmed; but ſhe ſoon leaked leſs on this tack, and they put about again.—6th, the ſhip ſtill leaking, the captain and ſeveral men ſearched
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:032810_0314_0FF530BF4AFACA80"/>
on the outſide for the leak, but ſound none; after which, the leak moderating, cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs returned in the faces of the company.</p>
               <p>7th, the leak greatly increaſed, to near one thouſand ſtrokes an hour. Sadneſs again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed its empire over the crew. The captain knew not what to do; at length he put about again, and ſailed homeward a while. The weather was pretty rugged during the time of this increaſing leak. The leak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, the captain ordered a hole to be cut through the ſecond deck to go in and ſearch for it, which was done, and the leak ſoon found, to wit, an open auger-hole of about an inch and an half, at the ſhip's ſtem, ſo high up as not to leak conſtantly, which being ſtopped, the number of ſtrokes were ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to twenty-five an hour. Oh! what a change this wrought in the countenances of the poor ſailors. They ſoon ſeemed as if they had forgot all their ſorrows. They put ſhip about, and now ſeemed as if they were going to ſea in earneſt. The captain's looks proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the relief of his heart, though he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate through all. My truſt was only in God my hope, refuge and defence. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to him who knew all hearts, that he knew my motives in this voyage were none other than that I might be found obedient to his holy call, and faithful in his ſervice; and if it was now his will to ſuffer my body to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into a watery grave, 'thy will be done.' was the honeſt language of my heart. I could
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:032810_0315_0FF530EA3A2F08E8"/>
not wiſh myſelf on ſhore, nor on board an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other veſſel; for I had felt quite eaſy in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage in this, and remained ſo. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the winds and waves obeyed him, and that his providential care is over all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I felt ſafe in his hand, and repoſed myſelf as in the hollow of it—bleſſed be his name for ever.</p>
               <p>8th, all cheerful on board. The motion of the ſhip has kept me a little ſea-ſick.—9th, cloudy and rainy.—I ſat a while in ſolemn ſilence, waiting upon the Lord my God; but though my mind was ſomewhat ſtayed, it was inwardly as outwardly, a cloudy time, indeed a time of deep proving to me.—10th, At even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wind aroſe, and roared tremendouſly; it held all night: the men tied up the ſails, laſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the helm, and let the ſhip drift in the wind and waves.—11th, the gale ſtill continued all the laſt night, and all this day and night with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. The captain ſaid this morning he had not, for eight years paſt, known ſo terrible a time, for ſo long continuance, though that was but about the middle of it: and indeed it was conſiderably more violent the night following than at all before. It ſtormed through the whole; but this night the ſtorm and tempeſt of wind was dreadful. The ſhip was bound on a whaling voyage from Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk, and for that purpoſe had boats on board. One of theſe was conſiderably daſhed to pieces this night: three or four yards or ſpars were loſt: ſeveral fowls died, and the
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:032810_0316_0FF530EBD92C7158"/>
only live ſheep we had on board came near dying, even under deck. I felt reſigned through all; and, though poor in ſpirit, I never wiſhed myſelf elſewhere, or in any wiſe repented my voyage. I ſaw God's wonders in the deep, and it would almoſt ſeem at times as if the briny waves might prevail againſt us—though I cannot ſay there was a moment wherein I really loſt my confidence.</p>
               <p>I had ſteadily, for many months, firmly expected and believed I ſhould ſee wonders on the mighty waters. My God had ſealed it on my ſoul, that the loud roar of winds and the dread rolling of the waves ſhould awfully attend my paſſage, and prove my hold on heaven. And, therefore, when the time of trial came, I ſaid in my heart, it is the Lord, let him fulfil his purpoſes: let him do what he will with me: nought beſides his holy will can be good for me; and why ſhould I wiſh even the moſt diſagreeable parts of it averted, mitigated or even ſhortened? I believed I had had his holy promiſe who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, that I ſhould live through theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful toſſings on the boſom of the ocean, and once more ſet my foot on firm ground; yea, bleſs his holy name, in wonders yet to come on ſhore. <note n="*" place="bottom">See his proſpect.</note> I cannot ſay I was not nearly proved in regard to his divine ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, nor that I did not almoſt doubt the certainty of his inſpoken word of promiſe to my ſoul, though I well remembered the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:032810_0317_0FF53038C5F6A838"/>
of the proſpect, and the holy warmth and energy that did livingly attend the ſame, months before. And though the evidence of divine things was very low in my mind, yet I could not caſt away my confidence, being ſtill perſuaded, that, if I had ever known the holy word at all, I had had it in the preſent inſtance. Here my foot fixed, and my all I ſtill ſurrendered up to his diſpoſal, who is God over all for ever.</p>
               <p>12th. About noon the wind and ſtorm was ſo far abated that the captain had the ſhip under ſail again, though ſtill the roar of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remained. 13th, It is ſtill cloudy and rainy. The ſun has been ſeen but little ſince we left Boſton; and I think it has rained or ſnowed, more or leſs, every day and night but one. 14th, Very little ſunſhine—ſome rain. 15th, Rainy all day, at night it cleared up, and gave us to hope for ſettled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable weather; but 16th, it ſtormed again, and ſnowed plentifully; but at night it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off. 17th, Stormy again. We had ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the grand banks of Newfoundland at forty fathoms; but little wind for two or three days. Afternoon cleared up ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, that great hopes were entertained of having good weather. 18th, Forenoon ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with but little wind, the ſtorm continued until near night; then the wind ſpringing up freſh and fair, it cleared away. The captain ſaid he had not been able to get but one good obſervation during our being at ſea, ſo little
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:032810_0318_0FF52FE4F28AD3D8"/>
ſunſhine have we had for this almoſt two weeks. But my ſoul is ſatisfied in the divine diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>19th. Fair weather and a good freſh breeze. We now ſeem to look forward with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 20th and 21ſt, a very good breeze continued moſt of theſe days. 22d, this day a good freſh breeze at S. W. the weather cloudy; but the cloud over my mind is in degree diſpelled; bleſſed be the name of the Lord.—Lord, hold me in thy holy hand, and make me ever truly watchful, thankful, and ſteadfaſtly believing. Amen. 23d, we are ſtill favoured with a good lively breeze, and make good way a-head. 24th, the ſame as yeſterday; during the laſt night I got very little ſleep; (though this is uſual with me on this voyage) yet in moſt fervent interceſſions I beſought the Lord to be with me through all. 25th, 26th and 27th, ſtill good winds. O the wonders of the rolling foaming deep! If the Lord's hand was not underneath, we ſhould ſurely ſink beneath the raging waves! Who can be an atheiſt? or what can be an atheiſt's hope? 28th, a very good lively wind, cloudy and ſmall rains. Laſt night, a night of anguiſh to my proved ſoul. All for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experience cannot prevent renewals of unſpeakable anxiety, when the Lord is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove his own as 'at Maſſah,' and to 'ſtrive with them (in his own way) as at the waters of Meribah.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xvii. 7.</note> 29th, an excellent wind,

cloudy and wet.—The mariners caſt the lead, found ſoundings at about 90 fathoms. 30th, fair wind and weather. It was agreed on board, that this morning, when the ſun was about two hours and an half high, that we had not had ſo much fair weather at a time, ſince we left Boſton, as this morning. 31ſt, in the morning found ſixty fathom water; we were now abreaſt Scilly iſlands according to our calculations. This afternoon we ſaw the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. Freſh wind and cloudy. Thus ends the year 1792.</p>
               <p>1ſt of the 1ſt month 1793. The wind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed from a good freſh breeze, to a ſtrong gale—ſaw land divers times this day, and a number of ſhips going up and down the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh channel. 2d, almoſt calm. Thus, after a ſtorm, comes a calm. May my ſoul take courage to weather out the yet remaining ſtorms of life, in conſideration that, now and then, it will be calm; and in full hope of a ſafe entrance ere long, and eternal calm abode in the haven of immortal bliſs; as we are now, I truſt, about entering in a few days our outward port. 3d, in the morning we were off Calais cliffs, almoſt becalmed, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ground all day. 4th. after beating to and fro all night, juſt in by the land near Calais, we took a pilot on board from there this morning, and tried to work up the ſtraits, but made little advance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reaſon of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry winds and tides. We lay at anchor this night between Calais and Dunkirk.</p>

                  <pb n="307" facs="unknown:032810_0320_0FF531355E828FE8"/>5th, Got within about four miles of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk harbour; could get no further, ſo caſt anchor again. But being deſirous to be with the few Friends at Dunkirk next day at meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I went on board the pilot boat, among coarſe uncouth Flemmings, and a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or two, all ſtrangers, and got ſafe aſhore, and ſoon to the houſe of my dear friend Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rotch and family, of Nantucket, now reſident here at Dunkirk in French Flanders, where I met a very cordial reception. My ſoul bowed in thankfulneſs to Iſrael's God, whoſe unfailing Arm had thus far borne up, and whoſe goodneſs ſo far had fulfilled his holy word, as to bring me ſafe through all to ſhore. 6th, I ſat with the few Friends of this place, in their meeting, and rejoiced in the divine preſence, of which my enjoyment was greater than at any time during my whole paſſage from America. My way opening in a ſmall teſtimony, my ſoul was relieved and praiſed God, on the banks of deliverance, both outward and inward.</p>
               <p>7th. Wrote letters home to my friends. 8th and 9th, viſited ſome families. Dear Robert Grubb, of Ireland, came here from Paris the laſt evening. 13th, I found a good degree of relief in the publick meeting; but became much more thoroughly relieved in an evening meeting which we found a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to hold, at the ſixth hour. The meeting-place being filled by Friends and others; it was a good time; and at the cloſe we had a
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:032810_0321_0FF53136F38A1B68"/>
ſolid opportunity with the members only, and adviſed and encouraged, as way opened in the life; and divers young Friends being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly impreſſed with a living ſenſe of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of preſſing forward in the line of duty, my ſoul rejoiced among them, after ſeveral days of cloſe inward exerciſe. 14th, I left Dunkirk, accompanied by my dear friends William Rotch and Robert Grubb, and rode to Calais; and feeling quite clear of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk, it was to me a pleaſant ride, though the ways were very broken and difficult. 15th, the wind being very high, we were detained in Calais, from croſſing to England; and though the detention was not deſirable, yet being reſigned, we fell into a field of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive and cementing converſation, which I truſt will not ſoon if ever be eraſed. 16th and 17th, ſtill detained at Calais. 18th, croſſed to Dover, and was glad to find myſelf at laſt in the company of my dear friends in England.</p>
               <p>20th. At the fore and afternoon meetings, and an evening ſitting at the houſe of my dear friend Richard Baker, with a pretty large number of Friends, I had full opportunity to become relieved in mind in regard to the deep travail of ſpirit which I felt for Friends of this place: May they live looſe to the world, and ſeparate from its beguiling friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and influence. 21ſt and 22d, much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well with a cold, and a deep heavy cough, ſo
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:032810_0322_0FF52FE9EFC09430"/>
that I kept houſe. 23d. rode, accompanied by my dear friend William Rotch, by poſt-chaiſe to Rocheſter, lodged at our friend Dr. William Cooper's. 24th, attended the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Rocheſter; long ſilent, but at length I was a little helped in teſtimony—my travail was and is that Friends there may live and move in the life of true religion. 25th, we went to London, and attended the meeting for ſufferings there. 26th, we attended two ſittings of ſaid meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my concern was, that Friends might dwell deep, and act in the current of life in their religious movements: I laboured a little to that purpoſe and ſound ſatisfaction. 27th, attended in the forenoon Grace-Church-Street meeting—afternoon that at Devonſhire-Houſe—in the evening we again attended the meeting for ſufferings, where my concern and labour ſtill was, that Friends ſhould dwell and act in the divine life. 28th, we attended the ſelect morning meeting, where my ſervice was in ſilent travail among them. 29th, attended Horſeleydown meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſilent, as alſo next day at the Peel meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 31ſt, livingly opened in Ratcliff meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to a degree of unſpeakable rejoicing; but at the Park meeting, in the evening, I ſtood up in a feeling ſenſe of ſome good, and much good-will; but could not get forward, the way quite cloſed up, and I ſat down.</p>
               <p>1ſt of 2d mo. I attended the meeting for ſufferings. 3d. In the forenoon I attended Weſtminſter meeting, and afternoon the Peel;
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:032810_0323_0FF5306F6C84F518"/>
in both I had divine relief in bearing goſpel teſtimony. 4th, Attended the ſelect morning meeting. 5th, We attended Devonſhire-Houſe monthly meeting, my way was much cloſed up. 6th, My ſoul was made glad in goſpel teſtimony, at Grace-Church-Street monthly meeting. 7th, We rode out about ſeven miles to the monthly meeting at Totten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, where the Lord livingly helped us. It was a good time, and we returned in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 8th, attended the meeting for ſufferings. 9th, We viſited divers Friends families. 10th, We attended in the forenoon the Park meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the afternoon that at Horſeley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down; in both the Lord dealt bountifully with us, Truth riſing over all, and we may thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſay, 'hitherto the Lord hath helped us.' 11th, Found relief in clearing my mind in a good degree in the ſelect meeting. 12th, We attended the monthly meeting at Horſeley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down. 13th, I rejoiced in Truth's victory over death, in a meeting at the ſchool-houſe for Friends at Peel meeting. Alſo on 14th, at the monthly meeting at Weſtminſter. 15th, Had a hard cold and cough; kept houſe. 16th and 17th, Still unwell. 18th, I got out though weak to the ſelect morning meeting. 19th, We went out to Barking monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held at Plaſto, about four or five miles from London. 20th, attended Peel monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where I was much cloſed up except in diſcipline. 21ſt, that at Ratcliff, much in the ſame way. 22d, attended the ſchool meeting at Iſlington, and the meeting for ſufferings:
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:032810_0324_0FF530D8874A4988"/>
ſtill I was quite ſhut up in ſilence. 23d, I wrote letters to my friends. 24th, attended Devonſhire-Houſe and Grace-Church-Street meetings, and ſelect meeting in the evening at Devonſhire-Houſe, beſides a family viſit; in all which Truth triumphed over all, the Lord himſelf gave the word, and in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life and authority it was publiſhed. 25th, we attended the ſelect meeting to a good degree of ſatisfaction. 26th, at Horſeley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, and 27th at Deptford—the teſtimony and word of life were rejoicingly witneſſed in eminent exaltation, divers perſons attended not of our ſociety—the ſpring of the goſpel and its glorious doctrines were livingly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 28th, Truth opened goſpel doctrines, and brought forth neceſſary admonitions and warnings in its own pure life at Weſtminſter, where we ſat up our Ebenezer, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledged, as on many former oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, 'hitherto the Lord hath helped us.' 1ſt of 3d mo. I was at the meeting for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhut up in ſilence. 2d. I wrote, viſited a ſick friend, and rode to Plaſto, to attend meeting there next day.</p>
               <p>I may here mention, my mind has been deeply affected under ſome ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſtate of things in the world, and particularly in this nation. What a number of men are there who aſſume the ſtation of goſpel miniſters; and, under that pretence, drain and even violently force away from the proper owners large ſums of money, which
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:032810_0325_0FF5305693B5FD70"/>
they do very little to earn!—Even if it were right to preach for hire, and if Chriſt's true miniſters could freely and righteouſly receive money for their miniſtry, (which they by no means can) yet to ſee a ſet of almoſt idle drones living on the honeſt labours of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, as great numbers of the upper cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy do, whilſt they not only thus oppreſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor laymen, as they chooſe to call them, but alſo preſs down to a very low price and poor living, even many of the lower clergy who do the work for them, as if a miniſter of Jeſus could have his work done and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry performed faithfully in the ſight of God, by hiring another to preach for him, and with money extorted from thoſe it properly and honeſtly belongs to, while themſelves live in luxury and at eaſe, in their ceiled houſes, and but ſeldom viſit their flock; the proſpect of theſe things is deeply affecting.</p>
               <p>Oh! moſt aſſuredly the land mourns, and God is angry becauſe of theſe things, and in ſome way or other he will ariſe and ſhake the earth, and alſo this falſe heaven—this vain and oppreſſive miniſtry, and rend the power from the idle, lordly clergy. But whatever be the means, ſo that it is in the pure coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, my very ſoul breathes to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that he may, in the way of his own good pleaſure, haſten the downfall even of proteſtant Babylon; rend the power of the idle, uſeleſs clergy, and thus emancipate the people from the bondage and oppreſſion they
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:032810_0326_0FF53071E01E55F8"/>
groan under, that the earth may enjoy her ſabbaths again. But how theſe deeply to be pitied, theſe too worthleſs, too worldly, and too cruel pretenders to the miniſtry of the goſpel of Chriſt; or how thoſe civil rulers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, to anſwer the purpoſes of aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and power, ſupport them; will be able to ſettle their accounts in the great day of the Lord, the ſolemn ſettlement of all things, is a conſideration truly awful!</p>
               <p>If theſe hints are ever publiſhed, let not delicacy prevail to affect any unneceſſary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of the cloſe expreſſions in which they are couched. It is time theſe deceivers of men, theſe dark bodies, who form an eclipſe between God and the ſouls of men, ſhould hear and ſeriouſly hearken to the voice of plain, honeſt and undiſguiſed truth. And whether they will hearken and hear, yea or nay, let them be aſſured God is ariſing, and will ſhake and remove them out of the way; and their domination ſhall be remembered with abhorrence!</p>
               <p>3d of 3d mo. We had a good open meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Plaſto. 4th, I had ſolid relief in the ſelect morning meeting there, through deep dwelling and plain dealing: may the Lord faſten it as a nail in a ſure place. 5th, we attended the monthly meeting at Devonſhire-Houſe. 6th, that at Grace-Church-Street. 7th, that at Tottenham; in all which I had ſolid ſatisfaction; as alſo at an evening meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:032810_0327_0FF53149EFBCEAB0"/>
which I was concerned to appoint on the 8th, at ſaid Tottenham: general notice was given, and it was a large crowded meeting, many not of our ſociety attending. It was long ſilent; but after that, Truth's doctrines were largely opened and declared to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who behaved very commendably, and were remarkably ſtill and quiet, through the long ſilence, and to the cloſe of the meeting.</p>
               <p>9th, I viſited divers families, and therein had peace. 10th, attended meeting fore and afternoon at Tottenham. 11th, the ſelect morning meeting at Grace-Church-Street; and 12th, the meeting at Devonſhire-Houſe; all to ſolid ſatisfaction in the Lord. 13th, we attended the monthly meeting at Stains, ſeventeen miles from London; and next day their particular meeting at the ſame place; in both which Truth reigned over all: thanks be unto God who gave the victory. Many not of our ſociety, being notified, attended the laſt meeting: and I believe ſome of them were, through the openings of divine life, ſolidly inſtructed and ſolemnized in ſpirit. 15th, we had a good open meeting at Long-ford, and, on 16th, another at Uxbrigde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17th. one at Brentford, and in the evening one at Hammerſmith—all favoured meetings; though many of the people's views and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations being too much outward cauſed the ſpring to be long ſhut up in ſeveral of them.—This may be ſtrange doctrine to ſome; but ſome others know that the ſpring
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:032810_0328_0FF53001C449B3B8"/>
muſt be opened in the hearer, or elſe there can be but little profitably done by the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And he that ſpeaks only in the ability that God immediately gives, muſt feel a door of entrance in the people's minds, or it is very difficult to get ſafely and relievingly forward. But when the ſpring is livingly opened in him that ſpeaketh, and in thoſe that hear, then it is that <q>deep calleth unto deep, at the ſound of the waterſpouts</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xlii. 7.</note> of life, and here inſtruction is ſealed.</p>
               <p>After theſe meetings we rode to London, and were affectionately received by our dear friend John Elliot, his wife and children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18th, we again attended the ſelect morning meeting in the city, to a degree of ſatisfaction. 19th, we were at monthly meeting at Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 20th, at a meeting appointed at Plaſto; and, on 21ſt, at their meeting at Barking; all affording ſome conſolation. 22d, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the meeting for ſufferings at London. 23d, I wrote letters home, and went out to Wandſworth. 24th, the word of the Lord was powerful through me, a poor inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the people at Wandſworth; and I can truly ſay with Paul, <q>according to his working, which worketh in me mightily,</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Coloſ. i. 29.</note> in many of theſe meetings: may it have its full effect on the minds of the people. 25th, we attended the ſelect quarterly meeting in London, at Grace-Church-Street, where I was ſilent. 26th, and the quarterly meeting
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:032810_0329_0FF530ED83C5C648"/>
for worſhip and diſcipline was large and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured. 27th, we attended its adjournment, and in the evening, the youth's quarterly meeting for worſhip. 28th, were at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Kingſtown upon Thames, where ſome hardened hearts were felt to oppoſe in ſpirit the ariſing of Truth's teſtimony, they being in a dark and unbelieving ſtate. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had a meeting at Eſher, to ſolid ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. 29th, attended the burial of a Friend at Alton: dark ſpirits here alſo, I apprehended, inwardly oppoſed the truth: however, the teſtimony aroſe through deep wading over all, bleſſed be the name of the Lord!</p>
               <p>30th, we had an evening meeting at Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalming, to ſome ſolid inſtruction. 31ſt, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the fore and afternoon meetings at Guildford, in which Truth reigned, though things are low there. In the evening we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſelect quarterly meeting, and, 1ſt of 4th mo. Truth livingly qualified to labour, both in the quarterly meeting for worſhip, and in the men's and women's meetings for church affairs. 2d, we rode to Reading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 3d. had a meeting there, and in the evening at Kerby. 4th, one at Shillingford, and at evening at Wallingford, and, 5th, one at Abingdon; in all which divers beſides Friends attended, but ſeemed in general to have very little ſenſe of any thing more in religion than the cuſtomary formal performances—which, according to my obſervation, is too generally
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:032810_0330_0FF5304FF6F44490"/>
the caſe with the profeſſors of religion in England. Tell them any thing about divine life in religion, and they ſeem to think one an enthuſiaſt, and perhaps ſome of them would give a ſmile of ridicule: yet, to do them juſtice, they are pretty generally civil; but appear very inſenſible and unbelieving as to divine influence. There is indeed ſo little entrance into their hearts in many places, that it almoſt prevents a door of utterance; and when ſomething opens, it requires great humility and watchfulneſs to keep on the right foundation. I had ſome ſatisfaction in theſe laſt meetings, though Truth did not reign triumphant over all, as at ſome other times.</p>
               <p>7th, We had a large meeting at Oxford, ſilent for a conſiderable time; but Truth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually aroſe, and light ſhined through and over great obſcurity and inſenſibility. Oh! the deadneſs of profeſſors! Oh! the flat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality that too generally reigns! The Engliſh Epiſcopal hierarchy muſt and will be ſhaken! <q>Yet once more I ſhake not the earth only, but alſo heaven.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 26.</note> One ſtone muſt not be left upon another, of mere creaturely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, where God is known to be <q>all in all,</q> and ſo he is known, where Chriſt has reigned in the heart, until he has <q>put down all rule and all authority,</q>

And, O my God, if it be thy will, I pray thee, haſten the more general coming and knowledge of that day among the nations. Amen. After meeting we rode to Witney, and 9th, attended the quarterly meeting there—I was helped a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but got very low in mind.</p>
               <p>10th. I could not ſee my way to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo ſtaid the meeting for worſhip, in which I felt and obſerved a total ſilence, I believe ordered in divine wiſdom as a leſſon of inſtruction to others. 11th, we had a meeting at Farringdon. 12th, rode to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenceſter, and had an evening meeting there. 13th, went to Hampton, and, 14th, were at meeting at Nailſworth; and in the evening at Painſwick. 15th, we had two meetings at Glouceſter, and, 16th, one at Roſs. In all theſe the one univerſal and only principle of all true religion and godlineſs was our help, and, through its own living and helping influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was declared and teſtified of to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though ſometimes with but little evidence of entrance; yet at others it ſeemed evidently to prevail over all. 17th, we had a painful evening meeting at Monmouth in South-Wales
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:032810_0332_0FF530582B81A648"/>
—divers of the people were whiſpering, talking, and ſome laughing, near all the time, for which they were pretty cloſely reproved. We concluded the meeting without any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to preach the goſpel among them, for no way ſeemed to open for it. 18th, we had a pretty large evening meeting at Pontypool, to a degree of ſatisfaction; from thence we went to Llandilo, and, 21ſt, were at meeting there, and though I was ſenſible there was great place in the people's minds, with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and tenderneſs, I could not expreſs a word of what I felt flowing in my heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; but for ſome cauſe, was made an example of ſilence among them. O Lord, I pray thee preſerve my ſpirit alive in thee, and keep me ſubjectly given up, whether to ſpeak or keep ſilence. After this meeting we rode to Caermarthen, and, 22d, had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and, 23d, came on the ſelect meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miniſters and elders there, for North and South Wales, wherein I experienced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable exerciſe among them. Afterwards came on a meeting for worſhip, of Friends only; and then the buſineſs of the quarterly meeting tranſacted at this ſeaſon of the year, by what is called the yearly meeting.</p>
               <p>24th, Were held two large publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, one in the ſore and the other in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; ſilence was my lot. 25th, the ſelect meeting and meeting for diſcipline met again, after which Friends held another meeting for worſhip among themſelves in the evening, my
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:032810_0333_0FF530EF1C0297E0"/>
pain and affliction continued through all, tho' I dropt ſome cloſe hints in the ſelect meeting reſpecting miniſtry, and made a few remarks in the evening meeting, which afforded ſome relief to my mind. After all theſe meetings, I felt not clear of the people of Caermarthen: ſo when Friends were moſtly gone from the place, dear Deborah Darby, Rebecca Young and myſelf, ſtaid one more meeting, viz. on 26th, in which I received much relief; and 27th, rode with a very peaceful mind to Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea; 28th, had great enlargement and relief in the meeting there. The four following days we had meetings at Neath, Cowbridge, Cardiff and Newport. Theſe were almoſt wholly of people not of our profeſſion, among whom goſpel doctrines were opened (though under ſome depreſſion at times) in Truth's life and authority. An increaſe of true religion in England and Wales is much wanting; yet, bleſſed be Jehovah's holy name, a few are found from place to place, who know it in a good degree of dominion.</p>
               <p>3d. We left Wales and went to Briſtol, where I met with my dear friend Samuel Emlen from Philadelphia, in America, on a religious viſit to this country, who had been in this city ſome time: Our joy was mutual, and mingled with tears of affection, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of paſt ſeaſons of divine refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together in our native country. 5th, We attended three large publick meetings at the Fryar'a meeting (ſo called) in the city of
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:032810_0334_0FF5301FE1F52550"/>
Briſtol. 6th, one more ſelect, though large; and, 7th, two more large publick meetings; theſe concluded the yearly meeting at Briſtol. I was ſilent through all theſe meetings, as was alſo dear Samuel Emlen; and on firſt-day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon the meeting was ſilent likewiſe. I was led to deplore the low ſtate of the miniſtry, with renewed deſires, that our preaching might be ſuch, through him who is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the life, that the dead may be raiſed: for the <hi>letter</hi> will <hi>kill,</hi> does kill, and has killed its tens of thouſands.</p>
               <p>8th. I attended meeting at Lawrence-Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where, in the power of the goſpel, I laboured among them. 9th, I ſat the meeting in ſilence again at Briſtol; and, though I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, from the exerciſe of my mind, my bonds would burſt in ſunder, it proved not ſo: the time was not come. We went to Melkſham, and viſited divers families, in true goſpel openneſs; and 12th. attended the fore and afternoon meetings there, in both which Truth prevailed. 13th, we attended the monthly meeting at Broomham; at ſix in the afternoon we had a meeting at Devizes, and one next day at Marlborough, after which I again thankfully acknowledged, 'hitherto hath the Lord helped us.'<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. vii. 12.</note> 15th and 16th, We had relieving and edifying meetings at Newbury and Maidenhead; our dear friend Samuel Emlen being with us at theſe, to our rejoicing. 17th, we attended the meeting at

Uxbridge, after which, conducted by my kind friend John Hull, who had been with me ſeveral weeks, I went to London, where I attended the yearly meeting, which began for miniſters and elders the 18th of 5th mo. 19th, I attended the Peel meeting; ſilent.</p>
               <p>20th, Began the yearly meeting for church diſcipline, for inſpecting into the ſtate of the ſociety, and regulations thereof; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by adjournments until the 28th, as did the ſelect meeting until the 29th, the latter not meeting every day like the former: and though I was ſilent in ſeveral of theſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet I had ſome ſervice in ſome of them, both publick and in a more ſelect capacity; and, on the whole, I had a good degree of ſolid ſatisfaction in this yearly meeting: the great Helper of Iſrael was graciouſly pleaſed to ſhine upon our hearts, and qualify for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in his church. And many deeply exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed ſouls being gathered together, they were a ſtrength to each other. Friends generally appeared condeſcending to what aroſe as Truth's judgment, whomſoever it was thro' and however contrary to what they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or expreſſed. The Lord is raiſing up a living army in this nation, who are, and if they ſtand faithful will yet become more and more uſeful in the militant church. Oh, the need there is of wiſdom and forbearance in the church! may the God of Iſrael guide, guard and preſerve the honeſt-hearted, and
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:032810_0336_0FF5310019673C20"/>
may they, in the becoming meekneſs of true wiſdom, keep ſingly to his divine directions.</p>
               <p>30th, I attended Weſtminſter meeting, to the relief of my mind. 31ſt, the ſchool meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for children at Clerkenwell, in which I found little exerciſe in the miniſtry. In this meeting dear Mary, the wife of our friend George Stacy, and daughter of our beloved friend Rachel Wilſon, for the firſt time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in publick teſtimony—may the Lord preſerve her; ſhe appeared to be a deeply ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed woman, and to have given up greatly in the croſs, thus to be expoſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt of 6th month. I wrote letters and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the ſick and afflicted. 2d, I attended Peel and Weſtminſter meetings, to the ſolid peace of my mind. 3d, the morning meeting of miniſters and elders; 4th, then monthly meeting at Devonſhire-Houſe—an open and triumphant ſeaſon. 5th, the monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Grace-Church-Street. 6th, that at Tottenham, ſilent as to publick teſtimony. 7th and 8th, Joſeph Nicholſon going with me for Ireland, we rode to Birmingham, a large town; and 9th, were at their two meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and preparative meeting; and 10th, had a meeting at Tamworth—In all which Truth reigned, and life was in dominion, though things are but low at thoſe places. 11th, we had a meeting at Uttoxeter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, though I had much to ſay, I found very little ſatisfaction; but had great need of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:032810_0337_0FF5315071E56830"/>
after it was ended in order to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting the promiſes. 12th and 13th, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the quarterly meeting at Leek, to ſolid ſatisfaction. Then went to Macclesfield, Stockport and Morley; the laſt a very large but exerciſing meeting. I found much to ſay, but got little ſolid relief. 17th, we reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at our dear friends Richard and Martha Routh's. 18th, attended monthly meeting there. 19th, we had a good meeting at Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and 20th, another at Crawſhay booth, alſo attended monthly meeting there. 21ſt, we had a bleſſed large meeting at Marſden, and one the ſame day at Sawley. Thence we went to Newton, and, 23d, were at meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; had much labour and little relief. 25th, we had a meeting at Preſton, to ſome ſatisfaction, a few ſerious people attending among others. We went on to Liverpool; where, 26th, at dear Robert Benſon's, I wrote letters to my friends both in New and Old-England, and next day attended meeting there; the ſpring was low, but roſe gradually, ſome of us ſinging joyfully unto it.</p>
               <p>28th and 29th, I was unwell, and the wind was againſt our paſſage to Ireland, and after ſeveral days detention by contrary winds, and attending their meetings on firſt-day, on the 4th of the 7th month, we ſailed for Ireland, in the Viceroy Packet, of Liverpool. The wind was moſtly contrary during the paſſage, which was therefore a long and trying one of near ſix days. 9th, we landed at Dublin,
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:032810_0338_0FF531634D222EC0"/>
where I received comfortable letters from home; and after writing letters and viſiting a few families, on the 12th attended meeting at Sycamore-Alley in Dublin, in the life and power of the goſpel. 14th, I attended the meeting at Meath-ſtreet and Sycamore-Alley, to my own great relief of mind; 16th, the monthly meeting at Meath-Street, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the goſpel; and, through ſome cloſe ſearching labours, got great relief. Meath-Street and Sycamore-Alley meetings are both for the ſame Friends, but held al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately to accommodate, both parts of the town. 17th, accompanied by my kind young friend Thomas Bewley, junior, ſon of dear Thomas Bewley, at whoſe houſe I lodged at Dublin, I went to Baltebois, and had there an open meeting among a few Friends and others, and we rode to Ballitore, where I was ſick all the next day, being taken the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 19th, had a pretty good meeting here, and next day another at Caſtle-Dermot; the day following at Carlow, where, near the cloſe of the afternoon meeting, I had to bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to a good degree of peace and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 22d, long ſilence of prevailed in a meeting I had at Kilconner; but truth gave us the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory at laſt: bleſſed be the name of the Lord for ever. Then we had meetings at Roſs, Foreſt, Enneſcortha, Cooladine, Ballantore, Ballanclay, Ballicone and Wicklow, taking two in a day—all pretty open ſatisfactory meetings except the laſt, which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what painfully exerciſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="unknown:032810_0339_0FF5316605686640"/>29th, we returned to Dublin, and next day attended the meeting for worſhip, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment of the monthly meeting at Meath-Street; and the day following, wrote to my family and ſome other friends in America. Thence accompanied ſtill by dear Thomas Bewley, jun. we went to Rathfriland, and 3d of 8th month, had a good meeting there. 4th, attended the meeting there, both fore and afternoon, I was conſiderably enlarged in teſtimony, but in ſo low and feeble a manner, that after meeting I ſunk into great diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to think that though I ſtood up and proceeded in the evidence and feeling of duty, yet very little life or relief of mind was experienced. The meeting was large. 5th, exerciſe of mind and pain of body cauſed the laſt to be unto me a night of much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs; but endeavouring this morning to 'poſſeſs myſelf in patience.' I became at length compoſed. 6th, I remained unwell, but rode to Lurgan, and was at meeting there next day. I felt no freedom that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick notice ſhould be given, which was very unuſual; and near the cloſe of the meeting, (having ſat in ſilence) I ſtood up, though not expecting to ſay any thing in the uſual line of the miniſtry, and told them, thoſe who go to their religious meetings with expectations and deſires of outward help, and are thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from looking inward and feeling after divine help, go to their meetings in a devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind from a true goſpel ſtate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance—and all who are looking to inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:032810_0340_0FF530D484A4DBA8"/>
for help in their meetings, otherwiſe than helped of God through them, and in his own time and according to his own will, are not true worſhippers in ſpirit and in truth. But I have cauſe to believe, that even ſome of our ſociety, at times, who attend meetings and ſit very ſtill and orderly, know little or nothing of true ſilence, and feel very little of that exerciſe of ſoul by which they may experience true chriſtian watch and prayer, when aſſembled together before God, and in his awful preſence.—The meeting then broke up, and I felt ſolid peace, in a living ſenſe, that I had not kindled a fire of my own; but had been limited to Truth's pure motion, which is ever ſafe.</p>
               <p>8th. I was at the meeting at Liſburn: pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick notice was given, but the meeting was ſilent. 9th, I had a meeting at Killſborough, wherein I laboured in a low way, I hope to ſome edification. Truth roſe not very high, and I rejoiced that the animation of nature roſe not above it. 11th, I was at meeting at Ballenderry in the forenoon, and in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon was again at Liſburn, both good open meetings. 13th, I had a large painful meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Preſbyterians, at Newtown-Aras near Mile-Croſs. They were too wiſe, rich and full, for inſtrumental help much to reach or benefit them. I left them with a heavy heart, and returned with my kind friend John Hancock to his houſe near Liſburn, and 15th, attended monthly meeting there, to a
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:032810_0341_0FF53168226217F0"/>
good degree of ſatisfaction, and next day had a good meeting at Antrim; and the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing another at Grange; and then went to Ballimany, where, on the 18th, I had a very large one. An ear was open in a few to hear the true goſpel preached; but the crowd and concourſe was ſo great, and large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſo light and unſettled, and ſome ſo noiſy, that we were under a neceſſity of concluding the meeting much ſooner than otherwiſe we might have done; after which divers of the ſober people with tears deſired we would have another meeting, and propoſed our having a large meeting-houſe in the town for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. They appeared greatly grieved at the behaviour of ſome of their neighbours, and much diſappointed at hearing ſo little of Truth's living teſtimony declared. My bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els yearned towards them, but we could not ſee a way open in the light to appoint another meeting. Indeed what little was uttered among them was ſo much in the life that they greatly hungered for more; and I thought it much better to leave them hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to fill them until they might even loathe the honey-comb. So in much love we left them, and rode to Ballynacree.</p>
               <p>19th, we had good open meetings at Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynacree and Colerain. My openneſs and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was as uſual moſtly towards people not of our ſociety; and next day at Toberhead, which appeared to be a feeble one; and the day following I had good ſatisfaction in the
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:032810_0342_0FF530D682DFA438"/>
monthly meeting at Grange, near Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, both in the publick and in the more ſelect part. There is a little living remnant of valuable Friends belonging to that month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting. 22d, we had a good meeting among Friends and others, at Ballahagan; next day a relieving one at Moy; and, 25th, the fore and afternoon meetings at Grange were large and highly favoured, as was that held next day at the Preſbyterian meeting-houſe in Dungannon. The doctrines of the everlaſting goſpel, in moſt of theſe meetings in the north, flowed like oil upon the ſpirits of the people. But this laſt meeting was hurt by an unſkilful and unſeaſonable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, after the people were riſen to go out.</p>
               <p>27th, we had a meeting at a place called Carborough, among a few Friends and a pretty many Preſbyterians. In this meeting goſpel truths flowed ſomewhat largely in a gentle current of life to the people; but there was too little of a door of entrance into their hearts to admit of any great dominion of the life divine among them. Even Jeſus wrought not many mighty works in ſome places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the people's unbelief; they ſhut up the kingdom of heaven againſt themſelves, which is often the caſe in our day. Next day I attended at Grange; and from the 31ſt of the 8th month to the 3d of the 9th, was held the quarterly meeting there, in the courſe of which Truth reigned over all, both in publick teſtimony, and at times in ſolemn ſilence,
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:032810_0343_0FF53169C25D6860"/>
though ſome ſpirits ſeemed oppoſed thereto. 4th, attended again the meeting at Grange, and next day rode to Lurgan, and had a painful meeting there. Notice was given to the town's people, and many attended; but it ſeemed as though they knew ſcarce any thing about the life of religion. I got little relief among them. Friends there, as well as others, are in a low ſtate.</p>
               <p>After this I was at two meetings at Moy-Allen, one ſilent, and the other nearly ſo. One at Ballahagan, long ſilent and ſuffering, but ended triumphant. One at Richhill, dull and painful. One at Caſtleſhane, ſilent until near the cloſe, when I opened to the people the impoſſibility of man's preaching the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel without immediate divine help. One at Coothill, wherein the joy of the Lord was our ſtrength, and in true goſpel authority the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were inſtructed in the goſpel myſteries of Chriſt in man, his hope of glory. At Coot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill there was a great fair, and a fight, which was in ſome degree bloody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſidering the occaſion, between the ſoldiers with ſwords, and country people with clubs, about a lad juſt enliſted, who attempting to make his eſcape, the ſoldiers endeavouring to ſecure him, the country people were enraged, and aiming to ſupport his eſcape, the quarrel ran ſo high that the ſtreet was in an uproar from end to end; and being crowded full of country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, town's people and ſoldiers, to the amount I ſuppoſe of ſeveral thouſands, the ſcene was
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:032810_0344_0FF530C0E619F3B8"/>
truly affecting; and though I believe there were no lives loſt, yet as there was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bloodſhed, and divers wounded, it afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very horrid ſpectacle of the depravity of human nature. And I thought it not amiſs to give a hint of it here, as it led me to mourn over the benighted and dreadful ſtate of poor mankind.</p>
               <p>What dreadful wars have raged, through almoſt all ages and nations! What rivers of blood have human beings drawn from human beings! and what havock are men ſtill mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of human lives, who ſay they are chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians! At this very day (Oh, ſad to mention) is France and England, and divers other Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nations embroiled in cruel wars! Will the ſtate of mankind never be meliorated! Will the ſword devour for ever, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and benign influence of the goſpel, by the wrath of men for ever be defeated! For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it, gracious heaven! Indeed, I firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the time will yet come when 'nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. ii. 4.</note> O, bleſſed day! O, precious ſtate of peace, harmony and happineſs! My ſpirit breathes unto God, that he may ariſe and haſten this great work of reformation on the earth; that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world may become the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and of his Chriſt. Amen ſaith my ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="unknown:032810_0345_0FF5319C7B8FF490"/>After this, from the 15th to the 21ſt, we had meetings at Old-Caſtle, Edenderry, Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahoe, Rathangan, Athy and Ballanakill— the firſt of theſe was open and edifying, the next very eminently overſhadowed and owned of the Shepherd of Iſrael, notwithſtanding there were ſome ſtrong oppoſers preſent. Bleſſed be the name of the Lord God Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, who reigneth and will reign over all, convincing his enemies that they are but as duſt beneath his feet, and all their oppoſition to his ſpiritual reign and government, as a cloud which the ſun diſpelleth.</p>
               <p>The reſt of theſe meetings were moſtly dull painful ſeaſons, ſeveral almoſt ſilent, and the others laborious and but little relieving. At Rathangan a young man ſat and behaved very irreverently during much of the meeting; at the cloſe I reproved him; he retorted, was angry and denied the charge, and complained of ill treatment. I felt the power of truth increaſing over the meeting, and when he had vented himſelf and ſpent his venemous ſhafts, I ſtood up and delivered what was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on my mind reſpecting the poor dark depraved creature, and addreſſed the people in the love of the goſpel, the meeting cloſed to ſolid ſatisfaction. I found afterwards he was a diſſolute ſtage-player. Oh the miſchiefs of the theatre! what diſſipation it promotes! it operates directly againſt the life of religion, and tends to the deſtruction of morals! where ſhall we go to find the fear of God in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:032810_0346_0FF5308BB5C0F898"/>
yet, ſorrowful to ſay, too many great profeſſors of chriſtianity, and ſome of the pretended miniſters of the goſpel, are not aſhamed openly to plead for, and with all their eloquence promote the deſtructive practice of ſtage-playing. My very ſoul is grieved within me when I view the fallen ſtate of poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated chriſtians, and above all the dead, dark and carnal-minded ſtate of the clergy, ſo called, like ſwarms of locuſts they darken the air, and in many places eat up almoſt every green thing. Inſtead of turning the people to God, they bring them under the adminiſtration of the letter that kills, and thus the ſpiritual freſhneſs or greenneſs, begotten of God, at times by his holy ſpirit in ſome, is as it were, eaten out. But God Almighty will ſweep them from the face of the earth. The time aſſuredly cometh when great Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon's merchandize and traffic ſhall fail, and when her fleſh ſhall be burnt with fire. The Lord of hoſts hath ſpoken it.</p>
               <p>The teſtimony at Athy was much by way of opening the deceits, worldly-mindedneſs, and want of real goſpel qualification, in thoſe hireling teachers, who, if ever ſuch in any age exiſted, are the 'blind leaders of the blind.'<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xv. 14.</note> And I am perſuaded that no claſs of men in theſe nations do more to obſtruct the true work of the goſpel, and the coming of Chriſt's kingdom on earth as in heaven, than theſe; but I repeat it again, God will do them away!
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:032810_0347_0FF5319E6F8757D8"/>
For falſe religion and worſhip ſhall be ſhaken, as well as earthly-mindedneſs and corrupt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in order to make way for that which cannot be ſhaken, the work of God's holy ſpirit in men's hearts, and that worſhip and religion which the holy operation thereof enables man to perſevere in to his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken peace, and the exaltation of the divine glory.</p>
               <p>At Ballanakill there was ſo little ſenſe of true religion among the people, and ſo much lightneſs and irreverence, that no way opened in the ſpring of the goſpel to preach Jeſus and the reſurrection among them; ſo the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was neceſſarily ſilent, for we preach not ourſelves; and not being able rightly to call Jeſus Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt, durſt not attempt to preach his goſpel without that divine unction and influence, well knowing it cannot be done; and that ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands attempting to do it, has been the means of overrunning the nations with the dead formal image of worſhip, conſiſting of words without life and ſounds without ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>When the meeting concluded I reproved the levity and irreverence of the people, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to put them upon a ſerious enquiry reſpecting a preparation for death, and left them with an aching heart. Many of them ſeemed not to know their right hand from their left more than the Ninevites did; which is indeed the caſe with too many of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:032810_0348_0FF53102E9FA75C0"/>
of chriſtianity in England and Ireland; and the prieſts above all men have mournfully contributed to its being ſo; and this I believe will ever be the caſe, where and ſo long as the preachers are mere hirelings: For, God will not give his glory to another, nor his praiſe to graven images or the works of men's hands of any kind, however ſpecious or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. He will indeed <q>glorify the houſe of his glory,</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai. lx. 7.</note> where his honour dwelleth; where his holy ſpirit is the ſpring of action; and where he is 'the worker of all things;' where his people will be ſtill, and know that he is God; where they patiently <hi>wait</hi> for him, and 'let him ariſe,'<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. lxviii. 1.</note> not ariſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before him or without him.</p>
               <p>But alas! alas! who and where are theſe? Truly not all who are profeſſing ſo to do. But this is the ſtandard unto which the true and thorough goſpel worſhipper muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. And though too many among us are falling ſhort of this ſtandard, yet there are many who are alive in the power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Truth, our firſt principle, and which is the everlaſting principle and ſupport of all that is truly religious in every ſociety to the world's end.</p>
               <p>Under theſe conſiderations I do moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently deſire we may be a living, faithful, ſpiritual people; firmly believing, if we are ſufficiently ſo, we ſhall, above all the families
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:032810_0349_0FF531B10FDF6A60"/>
of the earth, ſhew forth God's praiſe; many thouſands will flow unto Sion, there they will behold Jeruſalem a quiet habitation; be bleſſed with the dew of Hermon, and rejoice in the dew that deſcends on the mountains of Zion, where the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the bleſſing, even life for evermore; whilſt the mere ſelf-active, formal hirelings, remaining in their ſelf-active ſtate, promoting aboliſhed ſhadowy obſervations, will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend far into the mountain of myrrh and hill of frankincenſe, but continue to wither and die.—Read William Penn's riſe and progreſs of the people called Quakers, wherein is ſhewn how one people after another ſunk into formality. Conſider deeply how lamentably it has been the caſe with ſome of us; and know aſſuredly, that if we keep not in the divine life, we ſhall be rejected as well as others.</p>
               <p>However, if I am given to diſcern the ſigns of the times, a revival will take place among us; but it will be only through faithfulneſs and deep dwelling, being baptized into death, and ariſing in the newneſs of life with Chriſt. It will not be through a great increaſe of rules of diſcipline; many have been zealous therein, and centered too much in the letter that kills.</p>
               <p>The ſcriptures are good, very good; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, good rules and good order, all very neceſſary; but ſtill it is the ſpirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:032810_0350_0FF531871D4D4FF0"/>
and giveth life; and every departure from a right dependance on it, every zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous movement in ſupport of Truth's teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony independant of its neceſſary aid, tends to introduce death, and ſet man on the throne, inſtead of him who is God over all for ever.</p>
               <p>22d, we attended meeting both fore and afternoon at Mountmelick, where live our beloved friends Mary Ridgeway and Jane Watſon, lately on a religious viſit to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; they were both at this time at home, where I was glad to feel unity with their ſpirits in the freſh life of the everlaſting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. It was a time of conſiderable open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and enlargement in the goſpel. I had, as at many other places, to bear teſtimony againſt the blind leaders of the blind which ſwarm through the land, and are a grievous oppreſſion upon the poor people, grinding them down exceedingly, and yet in general doing them no good; but a great deal of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in regard to the things of religion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if ever people ſpent their money for that which is not bread, they do it moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully ſo, both in England and Ireland.</p>
               <p>23d, I viſited two ſchools, attended a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miniſters and elders, and then rode to Tullamore, where we had a meeting conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people of the town chiefly. 25th, we had a lively precious meeting at Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murry. Next day I reſted and wrote, and
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:032810_0351_0FF530A5067D3588"/>
endeavoured to be content in my preſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotment, though truly it is ſometimes difficult to feel reſignation in ſo painful a pilgrimage as much of mine has been in Ireland. There is ſo much ſuperſtition and lifeleſs formality among the people in general; ſo little real religious exerciſe, or true knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of divine things; and ſuch ſtriving to make forms and creaturely performances anſwer inſtead of life and ſubſtance; that it is often almoſt impoſſible to obtain much ſolid relief, by expreſſing among them even what opens and impreſſes the mind in the life and love of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>This was a moſt trying day to me. The elements ſeemed all in commotion. Strife, conteſt and alarm ſeemed almoſt continually to pervade the whole man, and agitate all that was alive within me. I ſtrove for calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and patience; but great was the diſtreſs, which I was left to labour under, and extreme the deſertion of all ſenſible comfort or divine good. I looked up towards heaven; I tried to draw inwardly near unto God, and to crave his aſſiſtance, and the return of his countenance and preſence; but he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thick darkneſs, and ſtood as it were aloof from my cry. I was greatly overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſorrow, and ſwallowed up of diſtreſs! I retired ſeveral times; I lay down on my bed; I read the bible and ſome other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious writings; but through all I felt almoſt as if I was entirely forſaken!—At length I
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:032810_0352_0FF5314CE58E0768"/>
yielded up my whole life and being, as I had often done before, to go through and endure every pang, peril and perturbation, which God all-wiſe might ſee meet to prove me with, and for as long continuance as he ſhould ſee needful.—So, in the evening, the waves of the ſea began to ſubſide a little at his voice whom both wind and ſea obey for ever. I grew more tranquil, and had a pretty good night's reſt. This morning when I awoke, being 27th, I felt in my body as it I had been all over bruiſed, ſuch had been my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme agony of ſoul yeſterday, and ſuch is the ſympathy between ſoul and body. Some may ſcarce believe me; but there is one who knows I lie not. I read, and then walked out a while; the ſun ſhone pleaſantly; the birds ſang, and the whole face of nature was beautiful; but my ſoul remembered the gall and the wormwood, and I ſeemed forbidden to take much ſatisfaction in any thing viſible. Oh, my God, thou art weaning me ſtill more and more, and much more than I once thought neceſſary, from the world, and from all that is in it—Well, good is thy will, and thy counſel is excellent.—Do with me what thou wilt; form, faſhion and reduce me as thou pleaſeſt. Thou haſt given me clearly to ſee, that many who have even been in thy furnace came out too ſoon, and remain droſſy and impure all their days by not abiding thy judgments, and not enduring the turnings of thy holy hand upon them, and not following thee fully into all that ſeparates and weans
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:032810_0353_0FF531B4CC93C5B8"/>
from all that fleſh and blood delights in, which thou calleſt for, and art graciouſly leading ſuch as will follow thee into. Oh! redeem my ſoul from all that hinders its full and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impeded acceſs to thee, the fountain of living waters: ſet my affections wholly on things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and make me entirely thy own in the heavenly image and fellowſhip for ever.</p>
               <p>28th, In deep depreſſion of ſpirit I attended the ſelect quarterly meeting at Moat, held for miniſters and elders of the province of Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and next day I attended the publick quarterly meeting, was ſilent excepting a few words; and the day following I attended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in ſilence the meeting for church affairs; and Oh! the want of deeper dwelling in the divine life!</p>
               <p>1ſt of 10th mo. Having thus ſpent four or five days moſtly in deep diſtreſs and agony of foul, the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed to open the ſpring of life, unſeal my lips, and make me dip my foot in oil, treading on high places in the name and ſtrength of the higheſt. He tuned my harp anew, put a new ſong in my heart and mouth, and divinely ſtrung my bow for battle: thus the concluding meeting held for worſhip this laſt day of the quarterly meeting was eminently owned of the Lord: and Chriſt the reſurrection and the life was joyfully known among us: in his reſurrection we aroſe with him; and becauſe he lived, we lived alſo; I mean principally ſuch as had
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:032810_0354_0FF531B6640079F8"/>
been baptized in the likeneſs of his death, watched faithfully with him, and continued with him in his temptations and ſufferings; for unto theſe it was he appointed a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: theirs it is; and they continuing ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with him through all tribulation, ſhall, in ſpite of death and hell, enjoy it. Much ſearching work prevailed in teſtimony, thro' the openings of life, and much conſolation to the mourners in Sion, was graciouſly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed.</p>
               <p>2d, was at Birr; and, 4th, we had a moſt triumphant meeting at Montrath; the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the goſpel flowed like oil to many, and yet antichriſt was expoſed in his true colours: bleſſed for ever be the Lord, who hitherto hath helped us. After this we had meetings at Knock-Ballamaher, Roſs-Crea, Limerick, Cork, Boudon, Younghall, Garry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Clonmel, and the ſeveral ſittings of the quarterly meeting at Waterford, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Munſter. Divers of theſe were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured ſeaſons, but ſome of them afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far leſs ſatisfaction than others. From thence we went to Dublin in order to attend the national half-year's meeting, where I was again kindly received by my kind friend Thomas Bewley and children; and many other dear friends gave me a hearty welcome: this has alſo been my experience in many other places. On the 26th, the national ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect meeting opened; it was large, and the
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:032810_0355_0FF53035B8592BC0"/>
members, at leaſt ſome of them, appeared to be alive in a good degree in the holy root.</p>
               <p>27th, In the meeting at Meath-Street and Sycamore-Alley, I was greatly favoured; Truth's divine teſtimony was, like fire among rubbiſh, againſt worldly-mindedneſs, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and revolt; and ſome freſh encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment flowed to the mourners in Sion, the drooping-ſpirited and young and tender; the doctrines and conſolations of the goſpel being pretty largely opened. The four days following were held and concluded the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional meeting for good order in the ſociety. Alſo two more meetings for worſhip, and the concluding ſelect meeting, all theſe as parts of the national meeting. A good degree of zeal appeared in many for the ſupport of our chriſtian diſcipline; and things were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a degree of brotherly love and concord. And yet the lack in too many of the divine anointing oil, in the ſeveral movements, was ſo ſenſibly felt, that I ſat rather a mourner in moſt of theſe meetings, and could ſay but very little in them from firſt to laſt.</p>
               <p>I may here relate a remarkable occurrence, viz. when I was in Dublin, ſoon after my firſt landing, I was livingly opened in the life and power of the goſpel, at a meeting at Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camore-Alley, in which, among other things, I had a good deal to ſay about the ſpiritual fire of the Lord which is in Sion, and his furnace which is in Jeruſalem, for the refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:032810_0356_0FF531984E180840"/>
of all ſuch as ever become his ſons and daughters. A man, in a ſtable near by, made a great noiſe to drown my voice, which he continued for ſome little time, and as my voice raiſed he increaſed his noiſe; and I was told that ſome heard him ſaying ſomething in contempt about the fire I ſpake of, or howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was heard ſpeaking about the <hi>burning of the fire.</hi> Another perſon diſcharged a gun juſt by the meeting-houſe, when I was in the midſt of my moſt fervent engagement; the report was very loud and diſturbed many; but I was carried through as if nothing had happened; bleſſed be the name of the Lord. But now on my return to Dublin, I was fully informed that the poor wretched man, who ſhouted ſo loudly in the ſtable to drown my voice, and ſpake ſo ignorantly about the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fire, was in leſs than two weeks after conſumed to death by fire in the ſame ſtable where he had thus impiouſly behaved; for the ſtable taking fire by ſome means when he was in it, he was burnt before he could be got out.</p>
               <p>This I heard of ſeveral weeks before my return, but I choſe not to inſert it until I had got fuller information and confirmation in the city; but finding it fact, and much noticed by many people of different religious profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Dublin, as a very remarkable inſtance of the providence or judgment of God; I thought proper to give the relation of it a place here, and I do it without preſuming to
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:032810_0357_0FF531B8116E8E10"/>
ſay how far it was in ſpecial judgment. But as God's dealings are all in wiſdom, perhaps ſuch an inſtance of his all-wiſe government as this may have a ſtriking and profitable effect upon ſome of the hardened and daring who may read it, or at leaſt may tend to guard and caution ſome of the leſs abandoned againſt giving way to the ſuggeſtions of infidelity, profaneneſs or audacity. For moſt aſſuredly there is a God of juſtice as well as mercy, who ſees and knows all our thoughts, words and actions, and for every evil will bring us into judgment; yea, for every thing contrary to his holy will and wiſdom.</p>
               <p>After the national meeting, which ended on the laſt day of the 10th month, I ſtaid in Dublin ſome days, not ſeeing my way open to go for England or elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt of the 11th month, I was again ſilent at the meeting at Sycamore-Alley, as I alſo was at the meeting in the forenoon on the firſt-day following; but in the afternoon at Sycamore-Alley, I was ſomewhat enlarged, though not a great deal relieved, My ſoul was indeed, for a number of days, in deep affliction in that great city; inſomuch that I greatly doubted my being enabled to leave it with pleaſantneſs. 3d, I attended a meeting at Ballabrigan, about fifteen miles from Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, appointed for my dear friend Ann Tuke, daughter of William Tuke of Yorkſhire, in England. This meeting was very diſtreſſing:
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:032810_0358_0FF531CE6CF9B7B8"/>
the people ſeemed to know but very little of the real nature of divine worſhip. I returned in heavineſs to the city, and next day got a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of refreſhment in the meeting at Meath-ſtreet, through deep dwelling and keeping low in and with a little low ſtream of life, which at length enlarged to ſomething of a river; but ſtill I could not quite eaſe off my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, nor riſe above my deep depreſſion of ſpirit. Another meeting at the ſame place in the afternoon, appointed by A. Tuke, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me a degree of additional relief, ſo that I began to feel a little cheerful. 5th, I felt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from attending a meeting appointed for the ſame Friend at Dunlary; I knew not why, but I felt eaſieſt to decline going, ſo I reſted and wrote at the houſe of my dear friend Thomas Bewley, bringing up this account to the time of ſaid day of reſt and writing.</p>
               <p>After writing thus far, our dear friend, not feeling himſelf at liberty to leave Dublin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the 9th of 11th month, when by accounts received he attended a publick meeting at Johnſtown, and being accompanied by S. S. and A. S. went that evening to Ballitore, to the houſe of our friend Elizabeth Shackleton. On firſt-day the 10th he ſpoke largely in the morning meeting, and very powerfully in a publick meeting which was held in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his requeſt, after which, he imparted
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:032810_0359_0FF5308D4EC595F0"/>
weighty and inſtructive counſel in a Friend's family, concluding in awful ſupplication. The following night he was taken unwell, which continued to increaſe until the 14th, when an eruption appeared which proved to be the ſmall-pox, during which time his mind was preſerved in calmneſs and reſignation, and mentioned that <q>it mattered little what part of the world he died in; that he ſometimes hoped to ſee New-England again and his dear children, but that he had no will in it; that he had looked cloſely towards home and his connections, and into the ſtate of his own mind, though he did not know how the diſorder would terminate.</q> During the progreſs of the diſorder he was kindly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral Friends, and among them was our friend Ann Tuke, who preſerved the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing daily account.</p>
               <p>5th-day 14th, He ſaid, <q>there is an eternal Arm underneath each of us, which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to bear up and ſupport, and will do it, as far as is needful we ſhould be ſupported. I have long been confirmed in the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that nothing could poſſibly happen that would harm me while I keep under the divine influence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A phyſician from Dublin having been ſent for, came this evening, with which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſatisfaction, ſaying, he deſired that he would continue near him, which he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Some time after, he ſaid, <q>though
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:032810_0360_0FF5317C2A3AD638"/>
I am not without ſome conſiderable bodily pain, yet I feel ſuch a portion of that good which is infinite, that it does not ſeem worth mentioning, and if there was no greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment hereafter, the preſent would be a ſtate truly, deſirable, through a never-ending eternity, and yet the fulneſs is ſtill more deſirable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The evening of the 14th, he dictated a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his relations and friends at home, from which the following are extracted.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>I am now at Ballitore, twenty-eight Iriſh miles from Dublin, and I ſuppoſe undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly entered five days into the ſmall-pox; the eruption began yeſterday, and is very greatly increaſed to-day. I am very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably attended by phyſicians and the kindeſt of friends.—My diſtreſs of body, through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty of breathing, &amp;c. has, for a ſhort ſpace of time, been almoſt equal to any thing I can ſuppoſe human nature capable of, but (it is now half paſt nine at night) this has been a very comfortable day; and juſt now, and for ſome hours paſt, I have been almoſt as eaſy as at any time in my life, I think certainly never more ſo in mind—I feel no kind of alarm; but the iſſue is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very doubtful. I feel eaſieſt to addreſs you in this manner, principally, that you may know that my mind enjoys a fulneſs of that which removes beyond the reach of all ſorrow.
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:032810_0361_0FF530A34643BE98"/>
My dear children are placed ſo that I have been pretty eaſy, but I could wiſh them to get a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more learning than ſome of them are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the way of; and although I do not wiſh much of the world's poliſh, yet it is, at this awful moment, my deſire that they may not be brought up with much ruſticity, for this I believe has not very often contributed either to civil or religious uſefulneſs.</p>
                     <p>My deſires for my childrens ſubſtantial growth in the truth, and ſtrict adherence to all its diſcoveries to the cloſe of their days, is by far the principal wiſh I have for them. Out of the enjoyment of a good degree of this precious inheritance I know of nothing in this world worth living for. Ye that know it, ſuffer nothing, I moſt cordially beſeech you, ever to divert your minds from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and fervent purſuit after the fulneſs of it, even unto the meaſure of the ſtature and fulneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>It is almoſt marvellous how my ſtrength of body and mind holds out to addreſs you in this manner. I may now juſt mention, that nothing will be knowingly neglected for my comfort of body or mind, that my phyſicians or friends can afford: and greater cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and even pleaſure in doing all they can, I have not met with among my neareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I pray the Lord, in the riches of His grace, to reward them with flowings of his love.</p>

                     <p>It is now eleven, I want reſt; whether I ſhall be able to add further is to me at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unknown; and however it may be, in the fulneſs and almoſt unlimited flowings of true goſpel love, I am, and truſt ſhall ever remain in beſt affection, your ſincere relation and friend,</p>

               <p>15th. <q>The diſorder is pretty ſtrongly making its progreſs; I can ſcarce get any ſleep; my ſtrength fails a little, but I admire at its holding out ſo well; the pock on the face is, if not quite, very nearly confluent; the face conſiderably ſwelled; on the body it is pretty diſtinct. The phyſicians ſpeak very encouragingly, I believe in my abſence as well as preſence; but were it not that little or no ſenſe ſeems given me as to the iſſue one way or the other, I believe from the ſymptoms as they are, and from my knowledge of my own conſtitution and the very different climate from America, I ſhould pretty ſtrongly look out for diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:032810_0363_0FF530228CEB5F80"/>
although my ſpirits are under little or no depreſſion at all. Perhaps I never ſaw a time before, when all things not criminal were ſo near alike to me in point of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance to the mind. I do not know but when awake and capable of contemplation, I nearly rejoice and give thanks in all. When I verge a little towards ſleep I am all afloat from the ſtate of my nerves, and from the extreme irritation forced almoſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with very unpleaſant ſenſations from beginning repoſe, but through all the ſoul ſeems deeply anchored in God. Many and painful have been the probationary exerciſes of this life to me. Ah! were there proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſtrength, how I could enlarge, for my heart ſeems melted within me in retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective view; but all the former conflicts, however grievous in their time, are lighter now than vanity, except as they are clearly ſeen to have contributed largely to the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the ſoul; as they are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with awfulneſs and gratitude before Him who has not been wanting to preſerve through them all; and as they ſeem likely to introduce either very ſhortly, or before a very long time to an exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Some have anxiouſly wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have their time to live over again; but though ſome of my early foibles and after deviations, might poſſibly, on a ſecond trial, be eſcaped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I know not but there is quite as much reaſon to think a ſecond might fall very ſhort of the firſt, as in any degree to exceed it; however, I have no kind of ſelf-complacency
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:032810_0364_0FF530A6C0B80948"/>
on account of any good works properly mine. My <hi>own</hi> works I have long ſeen the neceſſity to ceaſe from, and truſt, through the grace of God, by which I am what I am, I have been enabled, in ſome precious degree, to do ſo. It is the Lord who worketh my works in me, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied be his name for ever, he has often work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in me mightily, to my own humbling admiration, and I truſt, at times, to the thankful acknowledgment of many others; and as certainly as he liveth, he would work mightily in many thouſands, if they would but let him ariſe over all in them. Indeed he worketh in all as far as they give way to his ariſing. This doctrine is to me as clear and certain at this moment as ever it has been, and I have often been conſtrained to proclaim it to the nations, ſometimes with almoſt invincible authority, and ſometimes under a great deal of weakneſs and obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The laſt has tended much to keep the creature rightly dependant and humble, and through every diſpenſation the Leader of Iſrael has ſeen beſt what was beſt for me.</q>

                  <q>Let my children be engaged in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent employments, as much as well may be, out of the way of a great deal of tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and if I had need to add it, out of the way of very great accumulation; and yet through induſtry and perſeverance mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately productive. My very ſoul abhors the idea that a chriſtian can ever be at liberty, whilſt under the influence of heavenly good, to ſeek or even deſire much wealth, though
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:032810_0365_0FF530D2E02B0BE0"/>
this diſpoſition, in direct oppoſition to the life and doctrine of Chriſt, have gone far towards the deſtruction of true ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I believe in almoſt every religious ſociety in the world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>16th. The fore part of the night and this morning he ſlept; in the courſe of the day ſaid to A. T. <q>I have ſeen the magnanimity of a true believer, and how one that is really ſo would bear all the trials permitted to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him;' and by way of illuſtration added very forcibly, 'Doſt thou believe in God, thou muſt alſo believe in the juſtneſs of all his diſpenſations. It is a comfort to me thy lot is caſt among us. This is a ſervice, if I had not any other in Ireland. Death is a ſervice we all owe to our great Creator, and ſickneſs is a ſervice required of many. Oh! Ireland, Ireland! The Lord thy God hath ſervice for thee in Ireland, was often ſounded through the ear of my ſoul, before I left home, as diſtinctly as you hear me now ſpeak it.</q> In the morning, when ſpeaking to the doctors who attended him, he ſaid to this purpoſe, <q>I believe my having the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and being here, is in the ordering of Providence. It is not given me to know the event; but if there be a field of future labour for me to enter into, it is as poſſible for the Maſter to raiſe me up now as it was at the firſt; but I have no will in it I think.' The fore part of this day he ſeemed eaſy and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down ſtairs, expreſſing that he could do it nearly as well as ever.</q> The fever came on towards evening, and he became very reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:032810_0366_0FF5319AA5068018"/>
his ſwallowing was alſo difficult, but had no other unfavourable ſymptom, and this was not deemed more than uſual in this afflicting diſorder. In the night got ſome uneaſy ſleep, ſwallowing and expectoration very difficult and painful.</p>
               <p>Firſt-day morning the 17th, on being aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how he reſted, replied, <q>I have got through with what we call much difficulty to obtain a little relief.</q> He deſired his affectionate love to M. B. the family and friends in Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, intimating the weight of the diſorder, and his eſcape from many trials, if he ſhould be removed; yet ſaid, <q>The Lord is able to raiſe me up, his Arm is underneath, but from my preſent feebleneſs, it is very uncertain;</q> and ſeemed not to have any concluſion how it would terminate. He deſired to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to dear M. R. and J. W. in the love of the everlaſting goſpel. At another time ſaid, <q>I am in a very low way, cannot ſee about the event, but muſt leave all to the Lord; the ſtrength of nature ſeems very doubtful.</q> He continued all this day under much oppreſſion from the load of matter, took wine and bark every hour, but no alarming ſymptoms appeared.—He requeſted that if he was removed, ſome further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars might be tranſmitted to his friends at home, adding in ſubſtance. <q>The Lord's will is bleſſed, and I feel no controverſy with it. It is the Lord that enables us to coincide with his will, and ſay amen to all the trials and conflicts he permits to attend us. My mind is centred in that which brings into perfect
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:032810_0367_0FF5317FB5FD3E48"/>
acquieſcence: there is nothing in this world worth being enjoyed out of the divine will. It is his will that brings us into a ſtate of exiſtence, and it is for a purpoſe of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When my mind is abſtracted and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of deriving ſatisfaction from any thing outward, it is an inexpreſſible ſatisfaction that my lot is caſt here, and that I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſuch near and dear friends, both from within this family, and theſe without who have accompanied.</q> The fore part of this night ſlept more than uſual, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the whole of it tolerably eaſy.</p>
               <p>18th, 2d-day. Frequently expreſſed that nature had a hard ſtruggle, and his getting through was very doubtful. The ſymptoms, conſidering the load of matter, continued fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. He gave directions, that, if he ſhould go hence, every thing about his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be plain and ſimple, and ſaid that he who raiſed up Lazarus could, if he had further labour for him to do, break his bands aſunder; but that, when he reaſoned upon the nature of the diſorder and his own conſtitution, and felt the conflicts of nature, it ſeemed as if he was gradually advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his everlaſting home. To two Friends from Mountmelick he expreſſed his entire reſignation to divine diſpoſal, and that he found nothing to ſtand between him and the fountain of everlaſting love: ſaid, <q>he knew many Friends in Ireland loved him, and he loved them in the Lord Jeſus, and deſired to be affectionately remembered to ſuch as might enquire after him.</q> This night, and

until three in the morning, (3d-day 19th) he patiently and quietly ſuffered much; yet got ſeveral naps. About ſeven in the evening his ſtomach, too weak to bear the bark and wine, diſcharged the laſt potion; he remarked theſe efforts to ſupport nature failing; and added, <q>There are many reſources in nature, but if the great Author of nature does not think fit that any of them ſhould be for me, all is well: I could not deſire to have ſuch another ſtruggle to go through, and I think, if you can part with me, I can with you with a degree of cheerfulneſs.</q>—The fore part of the night ſpent quiet and patient as uſual, much oppreſſed and worn down with this grievous malady: he ſaid, <q>I have no fear, for perfect love caſteth out all fear, and he that feareth is not perfected in love.</q>
               </p>
               <p>20th, About five o'clock on fourth-day morning he ſupplicated thus: <q>O Lord my God, thou that haſt been with me from my youth to this day; if a man who hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with a degree of patience the various turnings of thy holy hand, may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſupplicate thy name; cut ſhort the work in righteouſneſs, if conſiſtent with thy will; thou, who haſt wrought deliverance for Jacob, evince that thou art able to break my bonds aſunder, and ſhew forth thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that ſo my ſoul may magnify thy name for ever and ever.</q> And after a pauſe, wherein he ſeemed to feel the earneſt of his petition, added, 'So be it ſaith my ſoul.'— After two o'clock his ſtomach refuſed all nouriſhment, and a hiccough came on; he
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:032810_0369_0FF52FFDC39A8410"/>
ſaid, <q>Do not force nature, let me paſs quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away to the eternal inheritance, to which I have no objection to go, and the ſooner the better if the work be done, I have no wiſh to lay here.</q>—His oppreſſion ſeemed to increaſe, and in a little while he ſaid, <q>I am waiting patiently to ſee the ſalvation of God: do you wait patiently with me. I have no deſire, nor the ſhadow of deſire, to be reſtored. I hope the doctors will ſoon find that they have done their part.</q> The fore part of this night he could take little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept water, ſlept at times pretty eaſy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, at others his breathing very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. On P. J. aſſiſting him, he ſaid, <q>I am no flatterer, but thou art one I depended on for outward aſſiſtance. Thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to the relief of this body, and thy being here has been an inexpreſſible ſatisfaction to me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>21ſt. At three o'clock on 5th-day morning, ſaid, <q>You have ſeen the awful progreſs of this diſorder; as to me, it matters little only preſent pain—may the Lord releaſe me ſhortly.</q> Complained of the want of more air, and ſeemed declining faſt. Towards evening ſaid, <q>You may tell my friends in New-England, and every part of the world, that never did my ſoul bleſs the Lord on account of any worldly enjoyment, as I do now, in the bleſſing felt by me to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the proſpect of a very ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe.</q> To a perſon who came to ſee him he ſaid, <q>Oh! Charles! Charles! an inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the eternal truth is infinitely, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:032810_0370_0FF530191BB22238"/>
ſuperior to all the enjoyments this world can afford; remember it as long as thou liveſt.</q> Some time after, <q>I do not wiſh haſtily to make my eſcape; but if the Lord will be pleaſed to releaſe me from the bonds of mortality and the ſtruggles of life, and to cut the work ſhort, conſiderably ſhort, in righteouſneſs, I think I ſhall be willing to enrol it in the liſt of his unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able favours.</q> To the aforeſaid, <q>Farewell Charles, let no poſſible conſideration divert thee from a cloſe attention to <hi>that,</hi> without which life muſt be lived in vain.</q> At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time ſaid, <q>Some of my wiſhes for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf are centred in as ſpeedy a releaſe as may be, conſiſtent with the will of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and an admiſſion, which I have no doubt at all, not in the leaſt degree, of obtaining, into that glorious kingdom, where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and the weary ſoul is eternally at reſt.</q> In a while after, <q>I think I have not, for ſeveral years paſt, known much or any thing of boaſting; I have known ſomething of that law of grace whereby all boaſting is entirely excluded; but I may ſay, through that which has ſupported me under all the trials and conflicts which have attended my paſſage through life, to you my beloved friends as to dear children,—follow me as I have endeavoured to follow Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord of life and glory, and the Rock of my eternal ſalvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At another time ſaid, <q>It would have been deſirable to me to have been favoured with
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:032810_0371_0FF5301E1690A838"/>
a clearer and more certain proſpect reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the termination of this event; yet if I ſhould be continued a while longer, I do not diſpute but my end would be unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably glorious.—It would be painful to me to have to return again to combat the trials and conflicts of mortality; but if the Lord ſhould ſee meet to continue me a while longer, I muſt ſubmit, after having in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and reſignation put up my interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be releaſed from the ſtruggle of nature; to have had proſpects of further labour is not uncommon, it has happened to many; and the Lord can raiſe up and qualify others for his own work and ſervice, and he will ſend by whom he will ſend, and is able to ſave by many or by few. I feel, and I wiſh you to feel for and with me, after the eternal Rock of life and ſalvation; for, as we are eſtabliſhed thereon, we ſhall be in the everlaſting unity, which cannot be ſhaken by all the changes of time, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted in a never-ending eternity. I do expect conſiderable derangement will now take place; it is no diſcouragement to me, and ought to be none to thoſe who truſt in the Lord, and put no confidence in the fleſh.</q>—In a while ſaid, <q>I muſt not expect a releaſe but by ſuffering a due proportion of pain and diſtreſs.—You may feel ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy with me, but you cannot feel the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction which muſt precede a releaſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the courſe of fifth-day he was rather more lightſome, and tried ſeveral things to find what would beſt ſuit his ſtomach; ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:032810_0372_0FF53087D08A7B58"/>
conſiderably relieved from the extreme difficulty of breathing, but altered much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening, and increaſed in weakneſs. About one o'clock on ſixth-day morning, after ſuffering great uneaſineſs, and getting little or no reſt, he ſaid, <q>O Lord! if it be conſiſtent with thy holy will, let looſe my bands, and ſend the moment of relief to my poor body and ſoul.</q> Afterwards ſaid, <q>We cannot approve or diſapprove by parts the works of Omnipotence rightly; we muſt approve the whole and ſay, Thy will be done in all things.</q> From one to three he was extremely reſtleſs and uneaſy, from (as he expreſſed it) the extreme irritability of the whole nervous ſyſtem, which he ſaid was as great as could be imagined. At times he rambled a little, but ſaid, <q>I find all things muſt be endured. Do you, who judge in the light, judge me for impatience?</q> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, quite the reverſe, and that we were ſenſible his bodily diſtreſs was great, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to alleviate it. He added, <q>I cannot charge myſelf on that account,</q> meaning impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. About four he ſeemed in great ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and conflict, turning his head frequently on the pillow; and ſaid, <q>Can it be upon any other ground but that the time is come that the purpoſe muſt be effected.</q> Quarter paſt four, he deſired to be turned on his right ſide, which ſeemed a momentary relief. Calling to P. J. he ſaid, <q>Make great allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for me, my diſtreſs is nearly as much as is ſupportable by human nature.—Is there no poſſibility of my getting any ſleep? Oh! the
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:032810_0373_0FF53031EAB07F50"/>
pain, the inexpreſſible pain of my lungs!</q> P. J. telling him that, from appearances, there was a likelihood of his being very ſoon releaſed, perhaps within an hour or two, he replied, <q>If ſo, the Lord's name be bleſſed and praiſed for ever; I had much rather it were ſo than otherwiſe; for ſome time I perceived it haſtening faſt.</q> Afterwards he added, <q>The deſire of my heart is, the great bleſſing of time and the conſolation of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</q> In a while ſaid to a friend, <q>Guard againſt right hand errors and left hand er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; let ſelf be of no reputation; truſt in the Lord, and he will carry thee through all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About five he appeared to be wreſtling with death; but ſtruggled little conſidering his remaining bodily ſtrength. Being aſked to take a little drink, he appeared quite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſaid, Yes, yes—Took it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without much ſtruggling until about a quarter before ſeven, when he moved to the ſide of the bed, but ſoon returned to his former poſition; and drew his breath gently ſhorter and ſhorter, until ſeven o'clock, after which he breathed no more, but aſcended with joy to his heavenly manſion, and the glory of an incorruptible crown and inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the ſaints in light. His remains were interred on firſt-day, 24th of the 11th month 1793, in Friends burial ground at Ballitore.</p>
