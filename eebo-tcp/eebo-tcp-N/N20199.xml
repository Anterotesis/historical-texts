            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>I CORINTHIANS, ii. 2.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and him crucified.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE perſons to whom theſe words were written were the members of the church of Corinth; who, as appears by the foregoing chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were not only divided into different ſects, by one ſaying, "I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos;" but alſo had many amongſt them, who were ſo full of the wiſdom of this world, and ſo wiſe in their own eyes, that they ſet at nought the ſimplicity of the goſpel, and accounted the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's preaching fooliſhneſs.</p>
            <p>NEVER had the Apoſtle more need of the wiſdom of the ſerpent, mingled with the innocency of the dove, than now. What is the ſum of all his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? He tells them, in the words of the text, "I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</p>
            <p>A RESOLUTION this, worthy of the great St. Paul; and no leſs worthy, no leſs neceſſary for every miniſter, and every diſciple of CHRIST, to make always, even unto the end of the world.</p>
            <p>IN the following diſcourſe, I ſhall,</p>
            <p>FIRST, Explain what is meant by "not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, ſave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Give ſome reaſons why every Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian ſhould determine not to know any thing elſe. And</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:026477_0003_0FD04FCC8BF7BC68"/>
THIRDLY, Conclude with a general exhortation to put this determination into practice.</p>
            <p>FIRST, I am to explain what is meant by "not knowing any thing, ſave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</p>
            <p>BY JESUS CHRIST, we are to underſtand the eternal Son of GOD. He is called JESUS, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, becauſe he was to ſave us from the guilt and power of our ſins; and, like Joſhua, by whom he was remarkably typified, to lead GOD's ſpiritual Iſrael through the wilderneſs of this world, to the heavenly Canaan, the promiſed inheritance of the children of GOD.</p>
            <p>HE is called CHRIST, which ſignifies anointed, becauſe he was anointed by the Holy Ghoſt at his baptiſm, to be a prophet to inſtruct, a prieſt to make an atonement for, and a king to govern and protect his church. And he was crucified, or hung (O ſtupendous love!) till he was dead upon the croſs, that he might become a curſe for us: for it is written, "Curſed is every man that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon a tree."</p>
            <p>THE foundation or firſt cauſe of his ſuffering, was our fall in Adam; in whom, as the living ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of GOD declare, "We all died; his ſin was imputed to us all." It pleaſed GOD, after he had ſpoken the world into being, to create man after his own divine image, to breathe into him the breath of life, and to place him as our repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the garden of Eden.</p>
            <p>BUT he being left to his own free will, did eat of the forbidden fruit, notwithſtanding GOD had told him, "The day in which he eat thereof he ſhould ſurely die;" and thereby he, with his whole poſterity, in whoſe name he acted, became
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026477_0004_0FD04FCE0A54BAC8"/>
liable to the wrath of GOD, and ſunk into a ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual death.</p>
            <p>BUT behold the goodneſs, as well as the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of GOD! For no ſooner had man been convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſinner, but lo! a Saviour is revealed to him, under the character of the <hi>ſeed of the woman;</hi> the merits of whoſe ſacrifice were then immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take place, and who ſhould, in the fulneſs of time, by ſuffering death, ſatisfy for the guilt we had contracted; by obeying the whole moral law, work out for us an everlaſting righteouſneſs; and by becoming a principle of new life in us, deſtroy the power of the devil, and thereby reſtore us to a better ſtate than that in which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>re at firſt created.</p>
            <p>THIS is the plain ſcriptural account of that myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of godlineſs, GOD manifeſted in the fleſh; and to this our own hearts, unleſs blinded by the god of this world, cannot but yield an immediate aſſent.</p>
            <p>FOR, let us but ſearch our own hearts, and aſk ourſelves, if we could create our own children, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not we would not create them with a leſs mixture of good and evil, than we find in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Suppoſing GOD then only to have our goodneſs, he could not, at firſt, make us ſo ſinful, ſo polluted as we are. But ſuppoſing him to be as he is, infinitely good, or goodneſs itſelf, then it is abſolutely impoſſible that he ſhould create any thing but what is like himſelf, perfect, entire, lacking nothing. Man then could not come out of the hands of his Maker, ſo miſerably blind and naked, with ſuch a mixture of the beaſt and devil, as he finds now in himſelf, but muſt have fallen from what he was; and as it does not ſuit with the goodneſs and juſtneſs of GOD, to puniſh the whole
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026477_0005_0FD04FCF8ADB2CC0"/>
race of mankind with theſe diſorders merely for nothing; and ſince men bring theſe diſorders into the world with them; it follows, that as they could not ſin themſelves, being yet unborn, ſome other man's ſin muſt have been imputed to them; from whence as from a fountain, all theſe evils flow.</p>
            <p>I KNOW this doctrine of our <hi>original ſin,</hi> or fall in Adam, is eſteemed fooliſhneſs by the wiſe diſputer of this world, who will reply, how does it ſuit the goodneſs of GOD, to impute one man's ſin to an innocent poſterity? But has it not been proved to demonſtration, that it is ſo? And therefore, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing we cannot reconcile it to our ſhallow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that is no argument at all: for if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that GOD has done a thing, we may be ſure it is right, whether we can ſee the reaſons for it or not.</p>
            <p>BUT this is entirely cleared up by what was ſaid before, that no ſooner was the ſin imputed, but a CHRIST was revealed; and this CHRIST, this GOD incarnate, who was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, that he might be freed from the guilt of our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin; who was born of the Virgin Mary, that he might be the ſeed of the woman only; who ſuffered under Pontius Pilate, a Gentile governor, to fulfil theſe prophecies, which ſignified what death he ſhould die: this ſame JESUS, who was crucified in weakneſs, but raiſed in power, is that divine perſon, that Emmanuel, that GOD with us, whom we preach, in whom ye believe, and whom alone the Apoſtle, in the text, was determined to know.</p>
            <p>BY which word <hi>know,</hi> we are not to underſtand a bare hiſtorical knowledge; for to know that CHRIST was crucified by his enemies at Jeruſalem, in this manner only, will do us no more ſervice,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026477_0006_0FD0552B4B2C9880"/>
than to know that Caeſar was butchered by his friends at Rome; but the word <hi>know,</hi> means to know, ſo as to approve of him; as when CHRIST ſays, "Verily, I know you not;" I know you not, ſo as to approve of you. It ſignifies to know him, ſo as to embrace him in all his offices; to take him to be our prophet, prieſt and king; ſo as to give up ourſelves wholly to be inſtructed, ſaved and governed by him. It implies an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge of his crucifixion, ſo as to feel the power of it, and to be crucified unto the world, as the Apoſtle explains himſelf in the epiſtle to the Philippians, where he ſays, "I count all things but dung and droſs, that I might know him, and the power of his reſurrection."</p>
            <p>THIS knowledge the Apoſtle was ſo ſwallowed up in, that he was determined not to know any thing elſe; he was reſolved to make that his only ſtudy, the governing principle of his life, the point and end in which all his thoughts, words and actions, ſhould center.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, I paſs on to give ſome reaſons why every Chriſtian ſhould, with the Apoſtle, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine "not to know any thing, ſave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</p>
            <p>FIRST, Without this, our perſons will not be accepted in the ſight of GOD. "This" (and conſequently this only) "is life eternal, to know thee, the only true GOD, and JESUS CHRIST, whom thou haſt ſent." As alſo St. Peter ſays, "There is now no other name given under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whereby we can be ſaved, but that of JESUS CHRIST."</p>
            <p>SOME, indeed, may pleaſe themſelves in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, others boaſt themſelves in the knowledge of a multitude of languages; but
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026477_0007_0FD0552CCC884468"/>
could we ſpeak with the tongue of men and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or did we know the number of the ſtars, and could call them all by their names, yet, without this experimental knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified, it would profit us nothing.</p>
            <p>THE former, indeed, may procure us a little honour, which cometh of man; but the latter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can render us acceptable in the ſight of GOD: for, if we are ignorant of CHRIST, GOD will be to us a conſuming fire.</p>
            <p>CHRIST is the way, the truth and the life; "No one cometh to the Father, but through him;" "He is the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and none ever were, or ever will be, received up into glory, but by an experimental application of his merits to their hearts.</p>
            <p>WE might as well think to rebuild the tower of Babel, or reach heaven with our hands, as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we could enter therein by any other door, than that of the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST. Other knowledge may make you wiſe in your own eyes, and puff you up; but this alone edifieth, and maketh wiſe unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>As the meaneſt Chriſtian, if he knows but this, though he know nothing elſe, will be accepted; ſo the greateſt maſter in Iſrael, the moſt letter-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed teacher, without this, will be rejected. His philoſophy is mere nonſenſe, his wiſdom mere fooliſhneſs in the ſight of GOD.</p>
            <p>THE author of the words now before us, was a remarkable inſtance of this; never, perhaps, was a greater ſcholar, in all what the world calls fine learning, than he: for he was bred up at the feet of Gamaliel, and profited in the knowledge of books, as well as in the Jewiſh religion, above many of his equals, as appears by the language,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026477_0008_0FD0552E4C1016C8"/>
rhetoric, and ſpirit of his writings; and yet, when he came to know what it was to be a Chriſtian, "He accounted all things but loſs, ſo he might win CHRIST." And, though he was now at Corinth, that ſeat of polite learning, yet he was abſolutely determined not to know any thing, or to make nothing his ſtudy, but what taught him to know JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified.</p>
            <p>HENCE, then, appears the folly of thoſe who ſpend their whole lives in heaping up other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and, inſtead of ſearching the ſcriptures, which teſtify of JESUS CHRIST, and are alone able to make them wiſe unto ſalvation, diſquier them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a purſuit after the knowledge of ſuch things, as when known, concern them no more, than to know that a bird dropped a feather upon one of the Pyrenean mountains.</p>
            <p>HENCE it is, that ſo many, who profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſe, becauſe they can diſpute of the cauſes and effects, the moral fitneſs and unfitneſs of things, appear mere fools in the things of GOD; ſo that when you come to converſe with them about the great work of redemption wrought out for us by JESUS CHRIST, and of his being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> propitiation for our ſins, a fulfiller of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and a principle of new life to our ſouls, they are quite ignorant of the whole matter; and prove, to a demonſtration, that, with all their learning, they know nothing yet, as they ought to know.</p>
            <p>BUT, alas! how muſt it ſurprize a man, when the Moſt High is about to take away his ſoul, to think that he has paſſed for a wiſe man, and a learned diſputer in this world, and yet is left deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of that knowledge which alone can make
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026477_0009_0FD05530464174A8"/>
him appear with boldneſs before the judgment-ſeat of JESUS CHRIST? How muſt it grieve him, in a future ſtate, to ſee others, whom he deſpiſed as illiterate men, becauſe they experimentally knew CHRIST, and him crucified, exalted to the right-Hand of GOD; and himſelf, with all his fine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, becauſe he knew every thing, perhaps, but CHRIST, thruſt, down into hell?</p>
            <p>WELL might the Apoſtle, in a holy triumph, cry out, "Where is the wiſe? Where is the ſcribe? Where is the diſputer of this world?" For GOD will then make fooliſh the wiſdom of this world, and bring to nought the wiſdom of thoſe who were ſo knowing in their own eyes.</p>
            <p>I HAVE made this digreſſion from the main point before us, not to condemn or decry human litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to ſhew, that it ought to be uſed only in ſubordination to divine; and that a Chriſtian, if the Holy Spirit guided the pen of the Apoſtle, when he wrote this epiſtle, ought to ſtudy no books, but ſuch as lead him to a farther knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified.</p>
            <p>AND there is the more reaſon for this, becauſe of the great miſchief the contrary practice has done to the church of GOD: for, what was it but this learning, or rather this ignorance, that kept ſo many of the Scribes and Phariſees from the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of JESUS CHRIST? And what is it, but this human wiſdom, this ſcience, falſely ſo called, that blinds the underſtanding, and corrupts the hearts of ſo many modern unbelievers, and makes them unwilling to ſubmit to the righteouſneſs which is of GOD by faith in CHRIST JESUS? But,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Without this knowledge, our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as well as perſons, will not be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſight of GOD.</p>
            <p>

"THROUGH faith," ſays the Apoſtle, that is, through a lively faith in a Mediator to come, "Abel offered a more acceptable ſacrifice than Cain." And it is through a like faith, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge of the ſame divine Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that our ſacrifices of prayer, praiſe and thankſgivings, come up as an ince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe before the throne of grace.</p>
            <p>TWO perſons may go up to the temple to pray; but he only will return home juſtified, who, in the language of our collects, ſincerely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers up his prayers through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.</p>
            <p>FOR it is this great atonement, this all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſacrifice, which alone can give us bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to approach with our prayers to the Holy of Holies: and he that preſumes to go without this, acts Korah's crime over again; offers unto GOD ſtrange fire, and, conſequently, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by him.</p>
            <p>FARTHER, as our devotions to GOD will not, ſo neither, without this knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, will our acts of charity to men be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by him. For did we give all our goods to feed the poor, and yet were deſtitute of this knowledge, it would profit us nothing.</p>
            <p>THIS our bleſſed LORD himſelf intimates in the 25th of Matthew, where he tells thoſe who had been rich in good works, "That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they did it unto one of the leaſt of his brethren, they did it unto him." From whence we may plainly infer, that it is ſeeing CHRIST in his members, and doing good to them out of an experimental knowledge of his love to us, that alone will render our alms-deeds rewardable at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026477_0011_0FD05532CAF81718"/>
LASTLY, As neither our acts of piety nor charity, ſo neither will our civil nor moral actions be acceptable to GOD, without this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>OUR modern pretenders to reaſon, indeed, ſet up another principle to act from; they talk, I know not what, of doing moral and civil du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life, from the moral fitneſs and unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of things. But ſuch men are blind, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may pretend to ſee; and going thus about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, are utterly ignorant of the righteouſneſs which is of GOD by faith in CHRIST JESUS.</p>
            <p>FOR though we grant that morality is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part of Chriſtianity, and that CHRIST came not to deſtroy, or take off the moral law, as a rule of action, but to explain, and ſo fulfil it; yet we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that our moral and civil actions are now no farther acceptable in the fight of GOD the Father, than as they proceed from the principle of a new nature, and an experimental knowledge of, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faith in his dear Son.</p>
            <p>THE death of JESUS CHRIST has turned our whole lives into one continued ſacrifice; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we eat or drink, whether we pray to GOD, or do any thing to man, it muſt all be done out of a love for, and knowledge of him who died and roſe again, to render all, even our moſt ordinary deeds, acceptable in the fight of GOD.</p>
            <p>IF we live by this principle, if CHRIST be the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha and Omega of all our actions, then our leaſt are acceptable ſacrifices; but if this principle be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our moſt pompous ſervices avail nothing: we are but ſpiritual idolaters; we ſacrifice to our own net; we make an idol of ourſelves, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves, and not CHRIST, the end of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026477_0012_0FD0553448F8D060"/>
and, therefore, ſuch actions are ſo far from being accepted by GOD, that, according to the language of one of the Articles of our Church, "We doubt not but they have the nature of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſpring not from an experimental faith in, and knowledge of JESUS CHRIST."</p>
            <p>WERE we not fallen creatures, we might then act, perhaps, from other principles; but ſince we are fallen from GOD in Adam, and are reſtored again only by the obedience and death of JESUS CHRIST, the face of things is entirely changed, and all we think, ſpeak or do, is only accepted in and through him.</p>
            <p>JUSTLY, therefore, may I, in the</p>
            <p>THIRD and laſt place, exhort you to put the Apoſtle's reſolution in practice, and beſeech you, with him, to determine, "Not to know any thing, ſave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified."</p>
            <p>I SAY, <hi>determine;</hi> for unleſs you ſit down firſt, and count the coſt, and from a well-grounded conviction of the excellency of this, above all other knowledge whatſoever, reſolve to make this your chief ſtudy, your only end, your one thing needful, every frivolous temptation will draw you aſide from the purſuit after it.</p>
            <p>YOUR friends and carnal acquaintance, and, above all, your grand adverſary the devil, will be perſuading you to determine not to know any thing, but how to lay up goods for many years, and to get a knowledge and taſte of the pomps and vanities of this wicked world; but do you determine not to follow, or be led by them; and the more they perſuade you to know other things, the more do you "determine not to know any thing, ſave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified." For, this knowledge never faileth; but whether
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026477_0013_0FD05535CC37E630"/>
they be riches, they ſhall fail; whether they be pomps, they ſhall ceaſe; whether they be vanities, they ſhall fade away: but the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified, abideth forever.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER, therefore, you are ignorant of, be not ignorant of this. If you know CHRIST, and him crucified, you know enough to make you happy, ſuppoſing you know nothing elſe; and without this, all your other knowledge cannot keep you from being everlaſtingly miſerable.</p>
            <p>VALUE not, then, the contempt of friends, which you muſt neceſſarily meet with upon your open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to act according to this determination. For your Maſter, whoſe you are, was deſpiſed before you; and all that will know nothing elſe but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified, muſt, in ſome degree or other, ſuffer perſecution.</p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary that offences ſhould come, to try what is in our hearts, and whether we will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoldiers of JESUS CHRIST, or not.</p>
            <p>DARE ye then to confeſs our bleſſed Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and to ſhine as lights in the world, amidſt a crooked and perverſe generation? Let us not be content with following him afar off; for then we ſhall, as Peter did, ſoon deny him; but let us be altogether Chriſtians, and let our ſpeech, and all our actions, declare to the world whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples we are, that we have indeed "determined not to know any thing, ſave JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified." Then, well will it be with us, and happy, unſpeakably happy ſhall we be, even here; and, what is infinitly better, when others that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed us, ſhall be calling for the mountains to fall on them, and the hills to cover them, we ſhall be exalted to ſit down on the right-hand of GOD, and ſhine as the ſun in the firmament, in the kingdom of our moſt adorable Redeemer, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>WHICH GOD of his infinite mercy grant, &amp;c.</p>
