            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Whereas propoſals to erect a Bank were publiſhed in the Baltimore news-papers as follows, viz: PROPOSALS FOR ESTABLISHING A BANK <hi>IN BALTIMORE,</hi> ON THE CONDITIONS FOLLOWING. Conditions of Subscription.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS, We the ſubſcribers convinced of the great advantages that would reſult from a Bank which ſhould embrace the intereſts of the ſtate, as well as the particular intereſt of Stockholders, and whoſe capital ſhould be large enough to meet the preſent and probable future demands of a growing trade, have and do hereby ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agree to eſtabliſh a BANK in the town of Baltimore, on the following principles, and to take each of us the ſhares annexed to our names reſpectively, upon its being eſtabliſhed by charter, viz.</p>
            <p>Firſt—That the original capital conſiſt of Three Millions of Dollars, divided into ſhares of 300 dollars, and five in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalments of 600,000 dollars each, payable, viz. The firſt inſtalment in 1796—the ſecond in 1799—the third in 1801— the fourth in 1803—the fifth in 1805.</p>
            <p>Secondly—That the original capital be encreaſed to a certain amount by new ſubſcriptions on the original terms, whenever the Bank ſhall divide upon an average above ten per cent. for five ſucceſſive years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:029010_0003_0FDE8988ED5D5F70"/>Thirdly—That the Bank ſhall pay to the ſtate one half the annual profits which ſhall exceed an average of ten per cent. the other half to the Stockholders.</p>
            <p>Fourthly—That the ſtate may alſo be a ſtockholder to a certain amount, and that proviſion may be made for the union of this Bank with the Bank of Maryland, the two Banks conſenting thereto.</p>
            <p>We the ſubſcribers do further agree to petition the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly, at their next ſeſſion, to grant a charter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation agreeably to the above propoſitions, reſerving nevertheleſs to ourſelves, and each of us a right to refuſe and withhold our ſubſcription money, ſhould the charter be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially variant from the ſaid propoſitions, or contain ſuch matters as we cannot in juſtice to ourſelves approve.</p>
            <p>Notice is hereby given, that Rules will be eſtabliſhed to receive ſubſcriptions by the following perſons, and books open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their reſpective houſes or offices, on the firſt Monday of June next, and continued open until the whole ſhares be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>

            <p>The petitioners conſidering that the Banks in Baltimore-town, from the ſmallneſs of their capital and other cauſes, do not come up to the end for which they were eſtabliſhed, viewing alſo banks with capitals, adequate to the trade of a country, as inſtruments fitted to excite a greater degree of induſtry, to extend commerce, to produce a more favourable balance of trade, obviate uſury, and lower the intereſt of money; and, that theſe effects have invariably followed in a greater or leſs degree their eſtabliſhment, they could not doubt as to the utility and propriety of combining together to erect a new one in Baltimore, with a capital commenſurate to the actual and growing trade of that proſperous town.</p>
            <p>The petitioners further conſidering, that a Bank of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient capital, conſtituted upon principles likely to enſure to it the continued protection of government, muſt be the means of attracting into the ſtate conſiderable ſums of money, to be inveſted in its ſtock which would not otherwiſe or without ſuch an inſtitution make any part of its wealth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that every ſum brought into the ſtate, to purchaſe ſtock, will be ſo much added to its circulating ſpecie and its capacity to carry on improvements, they deemed it of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that the Bank in contemplation, ſhould be ſo framed as to have a juſt claim to the conſtant protection of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the uninterrupted confidence ot the public.</p>
            <p>The petitioners conſidering moreover, that chartered Banks from their nature muſt be claſſed among <hi>public inſtitutions</hi> it was deemed proper to give that propoſed, ſuch an organization as might forever prevent it from becoming an inſtrument to be wielded at the will of a few individuals, or from ſinking into

a mere <hi>private eſtabliſhment.</hi> Having theſe objects for their guide, the petitioners have annexed a ſketch for an act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation, with a brief expoſition of its leading principles, in order the more fully to convey their ideas, and that their intentions may not be miſtaken or miſrepreſented, all which is humbly ſubmitted to the wiſdom of the Legiſlature.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF EXPOSITION.</head>
            <p>AS preliminary to a particular view of leading principles of the propoſed inſtitution, it may be proper to ſubmit for conſideration— 1ſt. Certain <hi>diſadvantages,</hi> that appear to be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

            <p n="1">I. As to the <hi>diſadvantages</hi> inſeparable from a Bank whoſe capital is inadequate to the demands of the trade of the place where eſtabliſhed.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to adminiſter to the demands of an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and growing trade, or to iſſue its notes to any amount, at pleaſure, and keep them in circulation, it would be wholly unneceſſary to enlarge its funds, or eſtabliſh new Banks with capitals more correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to the circumſtances of trade. As this, however, is impoſſible, as a Bank of ſmall capital cannot be made to ſupply a great and growing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as the iſſues of every Bank is limitted by imperious circumſtances; as it is an aſcertained point in banking, that the amount of notes which can be ſupported in circulation muſt, generally ſpeaking, be in a certain proportion to the funds of the Bank; it is evident, therefore, that in places
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029010_0008_0FDE8918EAAF3B18"/>
where the demand reaches beyond this proportion, that new Banks may be erected to ſupply the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, without intrenching upon the reaſonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of exiſting ones; and that they ought to be erected, as a ſecurity againſt ſuch Banks attempting to extend their paper to the whole of the demand.</p>
            <p>It is a fact aſcertained by experience, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the capital of a Bank is inadequate to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural calls originating in a regular trade, that one of two things muſt happpen. 1ſt. The Bank being incompetent to the demand will ſpend itſelf in a few large loans, which, in all probability, will run in one channel. Or, 2d. It will divide its loans among the different applicants, without favour or partiality, or in reference only to their relative ſolidity. If the Bank takes the firſt courſe, the intereſt of the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of produce muſt ſuffer, becauſe the great loans, by centring in a few buyers, will enable them to dictate the price of the produce brought to market. If the ſecond, it muſt operate againſt the general intereſt of trade, becauſe the claſs of buyers will not get enough to excite a ſpirited competition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which, of itſelf, always raiſes the price of produce. Again, taking the firſt alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for the practice of the Bank, the few who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the principal loans, will have it in their power to influence, to a certain degree, not only the price of produce, but the price of bills of exchange, by which double operation, the community may be conſiderable loſers, whilſt, in the other alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, agriculture cannot fail to be affected through the inadequacy of the means to keep up a briſk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for its productions. Theſe conſequences are inevitable.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. We have conſidered it as probable only, that the large loans of ſuch a Bank will centre in the ſame perſons, or run in the ſame channel: Should, however, the charter be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029010_0009_0FDE8997B68E85B0"/>
as to admit of the ſame men being annually choſen directors, from probable, it becomes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely certain, that theſe loans, will in time, be either ſhared among the directors themſelves (ſhould they be men in buſineſs, and want them) or among their reſpective favourites. It is eaſy to conceive the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, murmurs, and partialities that muſt take place under ſuch a ſtate of things, as well as the meanneſs of ſolicitation and dependence, which it is calculated to beget in the whole body of traders.</p>
            <p>We have ſaid alſo, that there is a certain ratio, which ought always to be obſerved between the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a Bank and its capital. Inaſmuch, however, as a Bank of contracted capital will find itſelf ſafe under certain circumſtances, in throwing paper into circulation beyond that ſtandard, and as ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities may frequently occur, eſpecially in the United States, there is much room for believing that they will be uſed with a view to larger divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends, unleſs prevented by charter.</p>
            <p>What follows? As the loans which exceed this proportion, can enjoy only a momentanious exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as the circumſtances which induced them change; as the ſurplus muſt quickly return upon the Bank from circulation, the Bank, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a ſtoppage of payment, muſt ſuddenly bring its diſcounts within the ſtrength of its capital to face; in other words, muſt ſuſpend ſo much of its loans as has exceeded this proportion. It follows, that the portion of its debtors who received the loans forming this exceſs, muſt be leſt to ſatisfy their bank obligations, by means that often involve great pecuniary ſacrifices, if not poſitive ruin, while it is fairly to be preſumed that the ſufferers in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures will ſeldom be met with among the directors or their favourites. Hence it is that we always find in places of great trade, where Banks of ſmall capital only exiſt, thoſe uſurious practices that diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029010_0010_0FDE891E4CC1BB58"/>
after the creation of capitals ſufficient to ſupport an uniform courſe of diſcounts, and prevent thoſe frequent, ſudden, and unexpected ſuſpenſions that favour, if not generate, uſury.</p>
            <p>The direct inference from theſe conſiderations is, that the general intereſt requires, either that ſuch a Bank ſhould be wholly prohibited or its capital ſufficiently enlarged.</p>
            <p>Were any further ſupport of this inference requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, it maybe found in a recent application made by the directors of the Bank of Maryland, to the ſtockholders, to add to its funds, by a payment of 100 dollars upon each ſhare; an application expreſsly bottomed upon the ground, that the capital of that Bank, is too ſmall to anſwer any longer the ends of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>We ſtate alſo with pleaſure, that the directors of the Bank of Maryland have not ſhewn any marks of public diſapprobation to the progreſs of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, calculated to obviate the evils annexed to contracted funds; on the contrary, they have openly countenanced its eſtabliſhment, by becoming ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers to it, and of courſe petitioners for a charter.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it may be aſked, will the erection of a Bank of larger capital, put an end to favouritiſm? will it extinguiſh uſury? will it obviate all irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in diſcounts? We anſwer, it will no doubt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually leſſen them, as the capital of ſuch a Bank is made to approximate the level of demand, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely remove them when it ſhall actually attain it.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then, there reſults, from what has been ſaid, that private convenience and public ſafety, the intereſt of individuals and the general intereſt, will be better promoted and ſecured by a large than a ſmall Bank capital.</p>
            <p>But this idea will receive fuller illuſtration by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining more in detail, according to the order we have propoſed.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:029010_0011_0FDE88BA8D4F8820"/>II. Certain advantages, connected with a Bank whoſe capital is commenſurate to the demands ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginating in the courſe of a regularly growing trade.</p>
            <p>Among the advantages of ſuch a capital may be reckoned, 1ſt. Its affording a more certain and ſteady demand for the productions of the ſoil. 2d. Its tendency to leſſen the prices of foreign imported manufactures to the conſumers. 3d. Its increaſing the general effort of national induſtry. And, 4th. Its enabling the ſtate to make the beſt uſe of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and geographic advantages.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to its affording a more certain and ſteady demand for the productions of the ſoil.</p>
            <p>It is certainly an object of primary importance in a country like this, where it is ſo eaſy to augment the annual quantity of its productions, beyond the quantity of ſpecie that can be employed to purchaſe them, to have at hand, an <hi>expanſive capital,</hi> ready to be applied to every new augmentation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. If there ſhould exiſt no ſuch capital, it is evident that the progreſs of agriculture muſt be ſlow, and as evident, if there does, that its progreſs will be conſiderably accelerated.</p>
            <p>Where a capital of this nature can be created within a ſtate, the trader, by a loan, anticipative of a debt that is owing to him, or the ſale of a cargo of goods, will find himſelf in a ſituation to buy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, as faſt as it can be ſhipped, and the whole claſs of purchaſers (inſtead of a few) enabled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, to enter into competition for it, with each other, a circumſtance, highly favourable to an increaſe of price and a regular and ſteady demand. Hence a Bank of extenſive capital, by multiplying the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of produce, and the means to buy, as neceſſarily promotes agriculture, as mild ſunſhine and gentle ſhowers promote vegetation.</p>
            <p>A capital of this kind has another operation
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029010_0012_0FDE892360813A60"/>
tending to the ſame point. By its facilitating the means to buy the materials for manufactures; and to the intermediate purchaſers, between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers and maker, the means to pay for them, it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours their eſtabliſhment, &amp; promotes their growth; conſequently creates a new demand for our produce by creating a new body of conſumers. It ficilitates likewiſe, by the introduction of more wealth, the amelioration of roads, bridges and inland naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by means of which the expence of tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is leſſened, eſpecially from the diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the ports of exportation; and conſequently the profits of the farmer proportionably increaſed.</p>
            <p>It merits a remark alſo, that in years of foreign good crops, when the demand for our produce to ſupply the foreign conſumption muſt decreaſe, the augmentation in the general wealth of the country, introduced by ſuch a capital, muſt neceſſarily lead to the eſtabliſhment of magazines of grain, to be held in readineſs for years of foreign bad crops, or our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed internal conſumption, a meaſure that muſt prevent any great or ſudden lowering of prices, and conſequently calculated to maintain a ſteadineſs of demand, highly favourable to agriculture.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As to its tendency to leſſen the price of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign imported manufactures to the conſumers.</p>
            <p>A nation that can buy what it wants with caſh, is always ſure to purchaſe on better terms than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is obliged to buy upon credit. It is a fact well known to the mercantile claſs, that every cargo of goods imported from Europe, upon a credit, is of the nature of a <hi>loan</hi> to this country, for which it is charged, on the original invoice, from 15 to 30 per cent. higher than if they had been bought with ready money, or, which amounts to the ſame thing, than if produce had been ſhipped to have paid for them when ordered, beſides incurring, after the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029010_0013_0FDE88C075728A78"/>
expires, at the rate of compound intereſt, till ſuch time as the debt is diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Such being the caſe, let us endeavour to aſcertain the <hi>annual amount of theſe loans,</hi> in order to appreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate fully what we annually <hi>pay for them,</hi> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the means by which they may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>"It is eſtabliſhed, by a recent inveſtigation in Great-Britain, that in the year 1791, the United States of America took from that kingdom (exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of Ireland and the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, from which they import many manufactures) the value in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh manufactures of £3,929,771:12:8 ſter." Now, as Maryland contains about a 12th part of the inhabitants of the union, it is reaſonable to apportion to her one 12th part of theſe importations. It follows therefore, that Maryland receives annually of Britiſh manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the value of about 1,500,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>How much of this ſum is obtained upon credit? A writer, whoſe duty it was to get the beſt information on this point, aſſerts "that at leaſt <hi>four fifths</hi> of the importations from Europe into the American ſtates, were at all times made upon credit."<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Sheffield</note> It muſt be obvious that numerical preciſion on ſuch a ſubject is not to be expected. Admitting, however, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion here quoted to come near the fact, and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging the coſt of <hi>credit</hi> to the ſtate at 20 per cent. only upon <hi>four fifths</hi> of its importations from Great Britain, there is paid for this credit 240,000 dollars, annually, more than if produce could be exported to buy them at caſh prices, independent of what is paid to other nations.</p>
            <p>Is there no way by which the ſtate may be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſo heavy an intereſt? Is there a ſtate in the union which obtains her European manufactures on better terms? And is that ſtate ſo ſituated as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029010_0014_0FDE8928A4CA8888"/>
by this means, any part of the trade peculiar to Maryland?</p>
            <p>There are at this moment, <hi>three</hi> Banks in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, whoſe joint ſpecie capitals may be ſtated at about ſeven millions of dollars; and <hi>two</hi> in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore, whoſe united capitals make only about 700,000 dollars. Suppoſing, then, the European importations to be neatly equal into theſe towns, it reſults, that the Bank facilities enjoyed by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia merchants, whether applied to the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of produce, to lay in their European manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures at caſh prices, or to avoid paying compound intereſt after the credit expires, is above <hi>eight</hi> times greater than the bank facilities that can be applied to the ſame purpoſes by the Baltimore merchant.</p>
            <p>What muſt be the final operation of this diſparity in the means to export produce? Need it be plainly divulged? Need it be inſiſted upon how ſeriouſly and deeply its continuance muſt affect the deareſt intereſts of Maryland, and how important it is that the Bank capitals of the latter ſhould be brought as near as poſſible, and as ſoon as poſſible, to a level with the former? Can the utility of ſuch a meaſure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a moment's heſitation?</p>
            <p>Should the ſpirit of ſyſtem, ſeek a more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious mode to rid us of this heavy intereſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a total abſtinence from European im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations, we would obſerve, that the experience of 160 years paſt, proves, that the people will have them, and our acknowledged deficiency of domeſtic manufactures, that they are abſolutely indiſpenſible.</p>
            <p>There remains therefore, no other alternative for Maryland, than to continue to procure abroad, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>credit,</hi> the manufactures which ſhe cannot do without, or to generate a bank capital which may enable the ſtate to introduce its importations at caſh prices, till ſuch time as the eſtabliſhment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029010_0015_0FDE88C5CA2D3598"/>
of her own manufactures ſhall relieve from the neceſſity of reſorting to foreign ones.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be ſaid on this occaſion, that Banks tend to raiſe the prices of imported manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, inaſmuch as they have actually come higher to the conſumers ſince their introduction. We ſhall not deny the fact as to the riſe on many articles of foreign importation; but we deny the inference drawn from it, to be true. Were it a juſt inference, foreign manufactures ought to be higheſt, where there is moſt Bank capital, the reverſe of which is actually the caſe. Were it true, the increaſe in the circulating medium occaſioned by Bank money, ought to be ſo great as to account of itſelf, for the increaſe in price, whereas it is demonſtrable that the Banks do not circulate more paper than would otherwiſe circulate of goldor ſilver, the general trade and induſtry being the ſame. We muſt therefore reſort to other ſources to explain the phenomenon.</p>
            <p>Theſe are, 1ſt. the increaſed taxes of foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which fall upon and enhance the prices of their manufactures. This connection of things, by which a non-manufacturing nation becomes, as it were, contributary to the wars or taxes of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing nation, ought to work a two-fold ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. It ought to induce the nation that depends upon another for its manufactures, to uſe every means in its power to encourage its own, in order to free itſelf from ſuch a ſtate of dependence; and the nation furniſhing them, with an anxiety to avoid thoſe ſituations, which, augmenting their prices, neceſſarily precipitate ſuch an event. 2d. The duties laid by the United States upon imported ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which ſerve to ſwell their prices to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers.</p>
            <p>To theſe might be ſubjoined ſome other cauſes, which, though temporary in their nature, apply ſtrongly in the preſent caſe, ſuch as higher wages
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029010_0016_0FDE89B1B65491C0"/>
to ſeamen, higher inſurance, greater expence in proviſioning veſſels, and of courſe, higher freights, the latter only being one hundred per centum more than in times of peace; circumſtances which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocally affect the prices of imported articles.</p>
            <p>Giving therefore, to theſe ſeveral items their due weight in the argument, any ſuppoſed increaſe of the circulating medium by Bank money, cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a violent hypotheſis, be charged with having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an effect ſo clearly deducible from other cauſes.</p>
            <p>But before diſmiſſing this objection we ſhall take the liberty to reinforce what we have advanced, by the opinions of two well known reſpectable writers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, page 80, ſays, that "As the quantity of gold and ſilver which is taken from the currency, (to be lodged in the Bank,) is always equal to the quantity of paper which is added to it, paper money does not neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe tha quantity of the whole currency."</p>
            <p>And again, in page 79, vol. 2, the ſame writer remarks, "Whatever is bought or ſold for <hi>a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money, payable on demand,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be bought or ſold as <hi>cheap</hi> as it could have been for <hi>gold</hi> or <hi>ſilver,"</hi> the reaſon of which is, that the one is preciſely of the ſame value as the other.</p>
            <p>This objection, therefore, to Bank money, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the leaſt reſpect, muſt be acknowledged by thoſe who uſe it, to apply as ſtrong againſt an equal quantity of gold or ſilver, as Bank money. Hence, as an increaſe of gold or ſilver muſt produce the ſame effects in ſociety, as a ſimilar increaſe of Bank paper, it reſults, that if it is found policy to prohibit the one, it is no leſs found policy to prohibit the other.</p>
            <p>But what is the real ſource and anſwer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection? Is it not found in the <hi>increaſed</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſtate of the nation's proſperity,</hi> in addition to the extraneous cauſes already ſuggeſted?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:029010_0017_0FDE88CB73DDE0B8"/>We ſhall trouble the houſe with one further quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, from Douglas's Political Survey of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>"This, of all others", he obſerves (vol 2. p. 242) "is the argument moſt relied on by thoſe writers on this and the other ſide of the water, who queſtion the utility of paper credit. This, ſay they, without affording the ſolid ſupport of gold and ſilver, alike valued in all countries, expoſes us to the only evil too great a plenty of money can create—the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the prices of all the neceſſaries and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of life. But is this the fact? May not two things exiſt at the ſame time, without one being either the cauſe or effect of the other? In the reign of queen Elizabeth, houſes, lands, &amp;c. roſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably in value, though paper was not then intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. May not the ſame, which operated at that time, and not paper credit, be the cauſe now? If we look cloſely into the matter, perhaps we may find that ſo it really is.</p>
            <p>"In the reign of queen Elizabeth, from a variety of cauſes, which have been already explained, trade began to ſpread, manufactures to increaſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new branches of foreign commerce were opened. In conſequence of this, numbers of families grew into eaſe and independence. This cauſed a greater conſumption of things neceſſary, and augmented the deſire of conveniences. A conſtant and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demand raiſed the price. Trade being more flouriſhing, manufactures more numerous, commerce much further extended, things are become ſtill dearer from the ſame natural cauſes: For if the fruits of induſtry increaſe, <hi>however that may be effected,</hi> the conſumers will be more numerous, the conſumption larger, and the prices of many things higher. But the people, by living better, will not grow poorer. As the fact, ſo the knowledge of this truth, is as old as the days of Elizabeth, when they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>money was the only property,</hi> but were wiſe

enough to comprehend, that he who poſſeſſed ſuch things as were worth money, was really worth as much as thoſe things would fetch. A truth obvious then, and which, remaining a truth, will ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo upon a little reflection: And yet the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking it, is the ſole cauſe of this heavy charge on paper credit."<note n="*" place="bottom">By <hi>paper credit</hi> here, is chiefly meant private notes of hand, which a change in the law of England threw into circulation, by making negociable. Before that, no action could be maintained on them, as they were not ſpecialties. How much ſtronger this reaſoning, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>Bank paper,</hi> than the <hi>axes of individuals?</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. As to its increaſing the general effort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional induſtry:</p>
            <p>We obſerve upon this effect of Banks of extenſive capitals, that it is not their faculty to augment the quantity of money, but their faculty of augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruits of induſtry, that conſtitute the baſis of their public utility. For unleſs Banks were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to the raiſing of more produce, to the erection and fabrication of more domeſtic manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to more internal improvement of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and to a more extended and profitable foreign commerce, and a more favourable balance of trade, any momentary increaſe of money they might oocaſion, would be of <hi>no real ſervice to the country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this precous faculty <hi>of augmenting the fruits of induſtry,</hi> that confers upon Banks a ſuperiority over every other mode of throwing money into cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; for it may be ſafely affirmed, that no given quantity of ſpecie, lent by government to individuals, upon a long credit, or preſented to them gratis, could excite an equal degree of national improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, induſtry, and wealth, as an equal ſum of money, diſtributed upon loan, by means of a well adminiſtered Bank. This idea may be illuſtrated, by attending to the circumſtances under which
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029010_0019_0FDE88D037442D98"/>
Bank money is emitted and kept in circulation. Whoever obtains a credit at Bank, is compelled to obſerve the moſt rigourous punctuality. Whoever, in turn, obtains a credit from him, is neceſſitated to a like obſervance of his contract; a condition, which, gradually extending itſelf to every claſs of the community, exacts from the whole, an inceſſant and ſyſtematic induſtry, capable of bringing to market commodities equivalent to the amount of the general credit obtained.</p>
            <p>Thus, bank money, by compelling, as it were, the community to draw from the earth and their labour, more productions, gives the ſtrongeſt poſſible impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to genius, and induſtry.</p>
            <p>Hence too it is, that Banks muſt <hi>increaſe,</hi> inſtead of <hi>diminiſh,</hi> the quantity of the precious metals; for, in proportion as ſuch eſtabliſhments augment the exportation of thoſe productions, by the ſale of which ſpecie is brought into the country, and enable us to buy foreign manufactures cheaper, which takes leſs of it from us, or, facilitates the erection of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic manufactures, which retains ſtill more of it with us, by their rendering foreign ones unneceſſary, they inevitably augment the quantity of gold and ſilver.</p>
            <p>Banks, therefore, may juſtly be conſidered as a valuable inſtrument, to ſwell the general tide of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and conſequently, the general maſs of natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wealth and proſperity.</p>
            <p n="4">VI. As to Banks of extenſive capital enabling the ſtate to make the beſt uſe of its natural and geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic advantages.</p>
            <p>The chief advantage that Pennſylvania has over Maryland, in a commercial point of view, does not conſiſt in her being more favourably ſituated for trade, or in having a ſoil better fitted for raiſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable productions, or harbours better calculated for commerce, but in the vaſt ſuperiority of Bank
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029010_0020_0FDE89330041F6B8"/>
capitals, which ſhe has accumulated at Philadelphia, by means of which, that market is found to be more ſteady, and to afford, generally ſpeaking, a higher price for produce, than any market in Maryland.</p>
            <p>In ſtating this fact, we diſmiſs from our thoughts the narrow idea of drawing from Philadelphia, any part of that trade to which it is entitled, from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and the induſtry of its inhabitants. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, only, for the propriety of ſuch Bank eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Maryland, as may enable its citizens, to profit by their own reſources and geographic ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Is there a ſtate in the union more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſituated for trade, or whoſe productions are more wanted abroad, or whoſe inhabitants are more capable of enterpriſe? What want of policy, then, to exclude the uſe of the means, which has been ſo ſucceſsfully employed by a ſiſter ſtate, to improve ſimilar advantages.</p>
            <p>The general welfare requires, that no town or place ſhould be neglected; but, that the advantages which may be peculiar to each, ſhould be improved to the extent of which they are ſuſceptible. The harmony, as well as proſperity of the whole, calls upon ſtateſmen to give efficacy to this maxim; for it is only by each ſtate, in conjunction with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral government, enabling its citizens to extract from their reſpective ſituations, the advantages pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to each, that either a ſtate, or the United States, can attain to that high degree of wealth, numbers, and greatneſs, to which they ſeem deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined.</p>
            <p>As to the trade of Maryland, it muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſtill in its infancy, at leaſt, as far diſtant from that maturity of growth to which it may be carried, by a due augmentation of pecuniary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Can any one ſeriouſly contemplate our uncultivated lands,—our defective huſbandry—our thin population,—our irregular and unſteady mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029010_0021_0FDE899CB5391770"/>
—the unimproved condition of our roads and inland navigation,—our inabilitity, without the aid of foreign commiſſions, agents, and extra ſtate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to buy up our productions for exportation—our want of internal manufactures—our inſufficiency of funds to participate in the fiſheries, and other enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſources of domeſtic and foreign commerce—and heſitate to pronounce, that the field for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of money, is almoſt unmeaſurable, and that the largeſt ſums which could poſſibly be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action, would be inadequate to its full cultivation. Ah, may no ſiniſter policy, or faſcinating reaſoning, cloud a proſpect, that cannot be viewed with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or obſtruct the attainment of thoſe means, ſo eſſential to its proſperous enjoyment.</p>
            <p>In purſuing the line that we have marked for our obſervations, we are next to examine.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Certain ojections that may be ſuppoſed to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate againſt the eſtabliſhment of the Bank in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
            <p>Were we to trace the oppoſition to Banks in the different countries where they have been eſtabliſhed, we ſhould find, that it has uniformly originated in men of the following deſcriptions.—Whenever two parties have exiſted in the ſtate, the apprehenſions of one of them, that the inſtitution would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a political engine by the other againſt them, has never failed to call up the ingenuity of reaſoning to prevent their erection. Another pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx of their enemies, not leſs formidable, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of men in the practice of employing their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals in profitable monopolies, which it enabled them to create, or in advantages, in the way of commerce, which it enabled them to take, or in ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their money to government or individuals, in their exigencies and diſtreſſes, at a price, much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its value, or the common rate of intereſt. As Banks ſeemed to threaten the firſt, and actually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029010_0022_0FDE893B25BA2C30"/>
the profits of the latter deſcriptions, one cannot be ſurpriſed at the reſiſtance made to their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by ſuch men. But as the evils predicted by theſe oppoſers, have been contradicted by the experience of every country, where Banks have been erected, and the arguments they have uſed, refuted by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having neither party nor ſpecial intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the iſſue, we ſhould, therefore, have paſſed the ſubject over without a ſingle remark, had it not been for the opportunity it preſented us with, of entering into certain details and explanations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the conſtruction, ſolidity and adminiſtration of well organiſed Banks, which can only be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately known to thoſe who may have made it a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular object of ſtudy and inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>We ſhall, in this view, condenſe the objections that lead to theſe explanations, under two heads. 1ſt. We ſhall conſider, whether Bank notes, as being of the nature of bills of credit or ſtate paper, may not, like them, depreciate, and injure the country. And, 2d. Whether Banks are not obſtructive to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural improvements, and promotive only of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Whether Bank notes, as being of the nature of bills of credit or ſtate paper, may not, like them, depreciate and injure the country.</p>
            <p>To this we obſerve, generally, that though bills of credit, under the colony government, did not, and could not, uniformly preſerve the ſame value as the ſpecie they repreſented, nevertheleſs, they were of great advantage to the community. If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence our enquiry on this point with the firſt emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of 1733, and follow them down to the laſt colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny emiſſion of 1773, we ſhall find ample reaſon to attribute a certain proportion of the extenſion of our trade and improvements, during that period, to their operation. As an example: When the firſt colony emiſſion took place, wheat ſold, in the ports
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029010_0023_0FDE88D5D91324C8"/>
of exportation, at <hi>one third of a dollar</hi> per buſhel; when the laſt, at <hi>three quauters of a dollar</hi>; ſo that, in the courſe of 40 years, bills of credit were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in more than doubling the price of produce. Inſtead, therefore, of their forming an objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bank bills, they furniſh a concluſive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their favour, and the more ſo, as Bank bills (as will be ſhewn hereafter) poſſeſs all the advantages of bills of credit without their inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With reſpect to our revolutionary paper.</hi>—As that was neither emitted to meet the demands of trade, nor could be ſupported by trade, and beſides reſted on a more precarious ſecurity than the colony paper, it was impoſſible that it could long maintain an equal degree of credit and public confidence; the rapid depreciation, therefore, of ſuch paper, can form no rational objection to a paper reſting upon different ground, and circulating upon oppoſite principles. But, the fallacy of the objection will emerge in a ſtronger light, by a more particular compariſon of the two papers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Bills of credit, the beſt ſupported, were always made <hi>payable</hi> at a <hi>diſtant period,</hi> a circumſtance which could not fail, to diminiſh their value, and which did diminiſh their value.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Bills of credited the <hi>funds</hi> for their <hi>redemption</hi> or ſmal payment, wholly in the power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſequently, liable upon every real or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed exigency of ſtate to be deverted to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, a circumkance that weakening confidence in the ſecurity, neceſsarily involved their depreciation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>quantum</hi> of bills of credit emitted, being regulated by no fixed rule, but intirely dependant upon the arbitrary will of an aſſembly, could afford no juſt foundation upon which to calculate their value.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to notes iſſued by a properly organiſed Bank</hi> (of which only we would be underſtood to ſpeak) every
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029010_0024_0FDE893FB87936E0"/>
circumſtance attending them, is calculated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move doubt, inſpire confidence, confine their amount within ſafe limits, and inſure to the holders the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate payment</hi> of their full value.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Every Bank has a <hi>determinate capital in ſpecie,</hi> which if its charter is properly guarded, can never be uſed for any purpoſe that might divert it from the payment of its notes.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Bank notes cannot be intruded upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic at the will or <hi>pleaſure of directors,</hi> or in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner other than by <hi>loan,</hi> and then only, upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of an ample pledge or the obligation of two or more perſons competent to repay it at a <hi>ſhort date.</hi> The holders of bank notes, therefore, have not only the ſpecie in Bank, but theſe pledges or obligations as ſecurity for their diſcharge.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. As a well conſtituted Bank can never iſſue notes to exceed the amount of the ſpecie in its vaults and ſecurities pledged for payment of its loans; at all times, therefore, and in every conjuncture of its affairs, the ſecurities and ſpecie, added together, muſt amount to the <hi>preciſe ſum</hi> of its notes in circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, conſequently, the Bank muſt be, <hi>at all times,</hi> competent to their payment.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. As it is optional with thoſe who borrow from the Bank, to receive from it, either ſpecie or bank notes to the amount of their loan, and with him who holds a bank note, to have it immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for ſpecie, the intereſt of the Bank there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imperiouſly requires, that it ſhould always have in readineſs a ſufficient ſum in gold or ſilver, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change thoſe notes which are inceſſantly returning upon it from circulation.</p>
            <p>This brief explanation of ſome of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances under which bank notes are iſſued, and the nature of the ſecurity upon which they are bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029010_0025_0FDE88E0D5D7EF28"/>
(to which, if we add a <hi>limitation to the amount of notes, it may circulate)</hi> cannot fail to afford a ſolid baſis for public confidence, and remove every doubt from the moſt ſcrupulous mind on the ſcore of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation.</p>
            <p>But it may be aſked, "inaſmuch as a part of the Bank notes, in circulation, may reſt on individual ſecurity, will not the bankruptcy of theſe perſons, cauſe a failure of the Bank?"</p>
            <p>The bankruptcy of the Bank, cannot happen from this cauſe; it being altogether improbable, eſtimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chances according to the ordinary courſe of things, that its <hi>annual loſſes,</hi> from ſuch failures, can ever exceed its <hi>annual profits.</hi> It may be obſerved, alſo, in referrence to this ſuggeſtion, that it is no ways likely, that perſons in a bankrupt, or tickliſh ſituation, will be favoured with its loans; becauſe it is the intereſt of directors to aſcertain the ſtate of men's ſolidity, who have tranſactions with the Bank, and the nature of <hi>ſhort credits</hi> and Bank tranſactions, above all others, to conduct in the moſt expeditious manner, to this knowledge. "Directors," ſays a well informed writer, on this ſubject, "being, for the moſt part, ſelected from the claſs of traders, are to be expected to poſſeſs, individually, an accurate knowledge of the characters and ſituation of thoſe who come within that deſcription; and they have, in addition to this, the courſe of dealing of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelves with the Bank to aſſiſt their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is in moſt caſes, a good index of the ſtate in which thoſe perſons are. The artifices and ſhifts which thoſe, in deſperate or declining circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, are obliged to employ to keep up the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which the rules of the Bank require, and the train of their connexions, are ſo many prognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, not difficult to be interpreted, of the fate which awaits them. Hence, it not unfrequently happens,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029010_0026_0FDE89475853F760"/>
that Banks are the firſt to diſcover the unſoundneſs of ſuch characters, and, by withholding credit, to announce to the public, that they are not entitled to it."</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, then, it may be ſafely affirmed, 1ſt. That the irrelevant principles upon which Bank paper and bills of credit come into circulation, afford not the ſhadow of a reaſon for apprehending a ſimilarity in their fate. 2dly. That under the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of ſo many precautions, pledges and double ſecurities, it is out of the verge of probability, that ſuch a maſs of failures can happen at any one time or in ſuch quick ſucceſſion, as to affect the ſolidity of a well adminiſtered Bank. 3dly. If in addition, the Bank be reſtricted from iſſuing, under any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances whatever, beyond a certain amount of notes, depreciation, or its bankruptcy, will be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impoſſible, except indeed in the caſe of a total ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of all order, property and government.</p>
            <p>This point ſettled, let us examine, 2d. Whether Banks are not obſtructive to agricultural improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and promotive only of commerce.</p>
            <p>Banks, to be injurious to agriculture, muſt act in one of two ways. They muſt either leſſen the means to purchaſe produce—or they muſt elicit money from, and prevent its being, employed in agricultural improvements.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> it has been already ſhewn, that Banks of extenſive capital, inſtead of leſſening the means to purchaſe produce, actually furniſh the whole maſs of buyers with more money, in conſequence of which more produce is actually bought. How this is accompliſhed, may be further familiariſed by example.</p>
            <p>A merchant, with a part of his capital, ſhips pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Weſt-Indies, with which he imports a cargo of ſugar, or coffee, the reſt of his capital lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029010_0027_0FDE88E580A6AFE0"/>
in debts, for goods ſold at a ſhort credit. If there be no Bank eſtabliſhed where he carries on his buſineſs, and he cannot diſpoſe of his cargo for caſh, or force a payment of his debts, he will not be able to buy produce, to commence a new voyage. On the other hand, if there is a Bank, it will ſtep in with a loan, and put him inſtantly in a ſituation to load his veſſel. Thus, delay is obviated, which is always loſs, and more voyages performed in the ſame period, which, of courſe, takes off more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from the farmer, whilſt, before the credit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Bank, expires, he finds himſelf in caſh to reimburſe the loan, either by the ſale of his cargo, during the interval, or the receipt of ſome of his debts.</p>
            <p>Again—Let us ſuppoſe every trader to have his capital doubled, by anticipations of ſales of goods, or debts, it is demonſtrable, that each would be enabled to buy more produce, give more for it, ſell it abroad at a leſs price, than when it coſt him leſs, and yet make a greater profit upon his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions. To be more explicit. If a trader, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anticipations, by waiting the ſlow courſe of ſales, and payments, can purchaſe on his capital, only 10,000 barrels of flour, annually, and fell it in a foreign market, at one dollar per barrel profit, he will clear annually, 10,000 dollars. But if he can ſhip 20,000 barrels per annum, upon the ſame capital, by means of anticipations, he may give 1-8 of a dollar per barrel more for it, ſell it abroad for 1-8 of a dollar leſs, and yet, make about 5000 dollars per annum more than in the former caſe; and the farmers an additional profit of 2,500 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, upon every 20,000 barrels.</p>
            <p>By varying ſuch inſtances to the different objects of trade, and the ſituation of debtors and credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029010_0028_0FDE894C4C6EADA0"/>
we acquire diſtinct notions of the manner in which Banks increaſe the means to purchaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, without riſk to the community, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>That ſuch is the preciſe courſe of buſineſs and profits, to both farmer and merchant, as capitals augment, is a fact well known in the commercial world; and, hence it is, that Banks of extenſive capitals have never failed, wherever eſtabliſhed, to give new energies to agriculture.</p>
            <p>Inaſmuch, therefore, as Banks do not leſſen, but increaſe the means to purchaſe produce, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cauſe more produce to be purchaſed, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the objection, which ſuppoſes, Banks to elicit money <hi>from, or prevent its being employed in, agricultural improvements,</hi> might be conſidered as already anſwered: For, ſpeaking in the abſtract, it would be abſurd to ſay, that Banks draw money from agriculture, and at the ſame time occaſion its progreſs and improvement.</p>
            <p>To examine, however, the objection by another criterion, let us enquire, to which ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion experience inclines; for, which ever way this index points, ought to have greater influence upon the candid mind, than whole volumes of ſprightly theory, or ingenious declamation.</p>
            <p>We obtain a juſt opinion of the utility or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of inſtitutions, from a correct knowledge of their effects upon induſtry, derived either from our own experience, or, where we have had no opportunity of obſerving them ourſelves, from the experience of men in whoſe veracity and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of judgment, we have juſt reaſon to confide.</p>
            <p>When both concur to eſtabliſh the ſame point, it would ſhew the height of ſcepticiſm, to reject their combined evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:029010_0029_0FDE88EDDA71DA08"/>With reſpect to the experience of others. "To the Banks of Scotland (ſays ſir James Stewart, in his political oeconomy) the improvement of that country is intirely owing." A more ſyſtematic writer, (Mr. Adam Smith, in his inquiry into the nature and cauſes of the wealth of nations) ſays, "I have heard it aſſerted, that the trade of the city of Glaſgow, doubled in about fifteen years after the firſt creation of the Banks there; and that the trade of Scotland, has more than quadrupled ſince the firſt creation of the two public Banks at Edinburgh, of which the one called the Bank of Scotland, was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed by act of parliament 1695, the other called the Royal Bank, by royal charter in 1727. Whether the trade, either of Scotland in general, or the city of Glaſgow in particular, has really increaſed in ſo great a proportion during ſo ſhort a period, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know. If either of them has increaſed in this proportion, it ſeems to be an effect too great to be accounted for by the ſole operation of this cauſe. That the trade and <hi>induſtry</hi> of Scotland, however, have increaſed very conſiderably, during this period, and that the Banks have contributed a good deal to this increaſe, cannot be doubled."</p>
            <p>This evidence therefore, as it reſpects the operation of Banks upon the general <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Scotland, is clear and concluſive. But the generative power of Banks, is far from being confined to Scotland. Wherever we trace them, whether in Italy, Germany, Holland, England, or the United States of America, we find the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects invariably following their eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>As to our own experience, ſelecting from this enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration the United States, we think we plainly perceive, in the <hi>vaſt increaſe in the exports of its native productions,</hi> ſince the eſtabliſhment of Banks, the moſt indubitable evidence of their benign influence
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029010_0030_0FDE8950AA5B71E0"/>
upon agriculture; at leaſt, if we do not, with Sir James Stewart, aſcribe this improved ſtate of the country "intirely to Banks," we may ſafely affirm, to uſe the cautious language of Mr. Smith, "that our agricultural productions have increaſed very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably ſince their eſtabliſhment, and, that the Banks have contributed a good deal to this increaſe, cannot be doubted."</p>
            <p>It follows, from this review of the actual ſtate of things, that Banks enable the agriculturaliſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his improvements, and bring more produce to market, conſequently, that, inſtead of withdrawing from his means, they on the contrary, increaſe them.</p>
            <p>But as there is another form into which the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may be caſt, of a more particular and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, it may not be improper to conſider it.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, "that inaſmuch as the profits of Banking are greater than lawful intereſt, it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily induce money lenders to veſt their money in ſuch inſtitutions, in preference to lending it to farmers a circumſtance amounting to a poſitive withdrawal of money from agriculture."</p>
            <p>The maxim upon which this argument reſts, viz. that the greater profit will always be prefered to the leſſer, though true in the main, is qualified in the preſent caſe, by the following exceptions.</p>
            <p>The claſs of men, moſt in the practice of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to farmers, live in the country, and participate in the habits peculiar to a country life. Attached to the ſoil, a mortgage on land according to their ſettled faſhion of thinking, offers a better bottomed ſecurity than the beſt conſtituted Bank. At a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance too from ſuch inſtitutions, they feel a certain kind of diſtruſt in them which is only to be removed by an intimate knowledge of their principles, and the mode of their conducting buſineſs. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029010_0031_0FDE88F2A91C4AC0"/>
alone, form ſtrong checks to ſuch men, veſting their money in Banks. Admitting, however, what may happen, that a few loans will be diverted from the farmer by this means, may we not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirm, that the loſs to agriculture, if any, is counterbalanced by infinitely greater advantages? Such private loans, like partial ſhowers in a ſeaſon of general drougth, can at beſt fall upon a few fields, while the operations of the Bank, like the inundations of the Nile, ſpread over and fertiliſe a whole country.</p>
            <p>But that the loans which may be thus diverted from the farmers, can never be ſo conſiderable as to form a ſolid objection to the inſtitution, will be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtill more apparent, by attending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of perſons who conſtitute the great body of ſtockholders. It is a fact, that the men who hold the principal part of the ſtock of the different Banks in the United States, have never been in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of lending to farmers. Theſe conſiſt, chiefly, of merchants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſons who have retired from trade, reſidents in towns and foreigners, men, who from habits and ſituation, will always prefer government ſecurities, permanent town rents, or ſuch property as may be <hi>readily converted into ſpecie,</hi> to the beſt mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages that any farmer of any country can offer them. From ſuch characters, while ſuch objects of profit exiſt, were all Banks to be deſtroyed, farmers can have little or no expectation of loans. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of men will always form the great maſs of ſtockholders in Banks.</p>
            <p>But the objection meets a further reply in the actual ſtate of things. There are at this moment ſix chartered Banks in the United States, in which ſhares may be purchaſed to a greater amount than the capital contemplated for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed inſtitution, and at a price to yield to the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers about 9 per centum per annum for their money.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029010_0032_0FDE8955F87C4808"/>
If, therefore, the higheſt intereſt is to decide money lenders, as to the application of their money, the withholding the ſolicited charter can make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in point of loans to the farmer, as ſuch muſt prefer a veſtment of their money in exiſting inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>
            <p>Again—This objection does not ſeem to have had any weight aſſigned to it in Pennſylvania. The farmers there, after granting a charter to the Bank of North-America, for 2,000,000 of dollars, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and ſeeing another Bank eſtabliſhed in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, by the United States, for 10,000,000 of dollars, granted a charter for a third Bank, in the ſame city, with a capital of 3,000,000 of dollars, in which they intereſted the ſtate, as a ſtockholder. We do not hear that theſe farmers complain that they have been embarraſſed by theſe Banks—that they have prevented their obtaining loans—or that it is more difficult for them now, than when they did not exiſt, to carry on their improvements; on the contrary, they find themſelves enabled to bring more produce to market, and at the ſame time, a market better able to pay for it; are more at their eaſe, in poſſeſſion of more money, getting faſt out of debt, and their lands greatly increaſed in value; and beſides, have attracted into the ſtate, by means of theſe inſtitutions, a large amount of ſpecie, which, had they not been eſtabliſhed, would not have found its way thither. May it not then, be permitted to Maryland, to calculate upon ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſults, from ſimilar eſtabliſhments? And does it not follow, as an undeniable conſequence, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diverting loans from the farmer, the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable operation of Banks of extenſive capital, is, to increaſe his profit, augment his wealth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his improvements.</p>
            <p>From the whole, then, of theſe facts and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029010_0033_0FDE88F9B2DCA528"/>
we conclude, that, a ſmall Bank capital, comports only with a proportionably limited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſtationary trade—that where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is greatly beyond the capital of a Bank to ſupply, both individuals and the community, are expoſed to ſerious inconveniencies and injuries— that the capital of a Bank, to anſwer the end of its inſtitution, ought to be commenſurate to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of trade, and "grow with its growth;"— that the large Bank capitals in Philadelphia, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counterbalancing capitals in Maryland, muſt gradually, and irreſiſtibly, take from this ſtate, much of its weight and importance, by attracting hence a conſiderable portion of its commerce; and finally, that as the ſtate poſſeſſes materials and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources for a great and progreſſive trade, Bank ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, co-extenſive with theſe objects, is become neceſſary, upon high conſiderations of dignity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and policy.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly ſtated the reaſons which have conduced to an aſſociation for the eſtabliſhment of a Bank of extenſive capital, we ſhall now ſubmit a few explanations, touching the moſt characteriſtic features of the propoſed inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The annexed ſketch of a charter, contemplates an original capital of 3,000,000 of dollars, payable in five equal inſtalments, in the courſe of ten years, beſides, an augmentation eventual and proviſory.<note n="*" place="bottom">Propoſition,</note>
            </p>
            <p>As there can be no doubt entertained but that our trade will furniſh full employment for this capital, in the order it is to evolve, and as we may calculate, with a moral certainty, upon its progreſſive extenſion, far beyond the proviſory augmentation of capital to ſatisfy, unleſs checked by ſome great national cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, we ſhall add a remark of Mr. Hume's, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what we have ſaid reſpecting the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029010_0034_0FDE895AC38682F8"/>
of a progreſſive capital, viz. that "the good policy of the magiſtrate, conſiſts in keeping money ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, in proportion to the progreſſive improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſociety."</p>
            <p>In theſe lights, the propoſed capital cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as too large, or its augmentative quality as a defect in the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>As to the regulations under which the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the three millions have been filled, we would obſerve, that it is not practicable, perhaps, to lay down rules for taking ſubſcriptions, in ſuch caſes, which can prevent ſpeculation, and at the ſame time, preſerve a due diſtribution of the ſhares. If in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, we have not been more ſucceſsful than others, who have preceded us in like experiments, we flatter ourſelves, at leaſt, to have fallen upon proviſions, which muſt defeat the object of ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould any have been practiſed. In this view, the charter, 1. Fixes the times of payments unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. 2. Declares an abſolute forfeiture of right to the inſtalments unpaid in every inſtance of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance. And, 3. Orders a new ſubſcription to be opened for all forfeited ſhares, upon original terms. Theſe proviſions (ſhould any perſons have ſubſcribed for more ſhares than they <hi>can pay for,</hi> in the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſelling), will ſtrip them of all ſuch, before the appointment of directors. They will alſo have the effect, to keep the ſhares at market, at the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral price</hi> in the intervals between the ſeveral inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe, thoſe who may want to buy, will expect to obtain forfeited ſhares upon original terms, when the inſtalment becomes due from failures of payment, and becauſe, thoſe who find that they cannot comply with the approaching inſtalment, will be diſpoſed to ſell at the natural price, rather than diſcover their inability to pay.<note n="*" place="bottom">Propoſition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:029010_0035_0FDE88FE6C6EC950"/>It may be ſaid, in ſupport of theſe regulations, that they are better calculated to give diffuſiveneſs to the ſhares, than regulations to oblige ſubſcribers, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite a part of the money on each ſhare, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of ſubſcribing. It may be ſaid, too, that the requiring a depoſit of money, at a time when it cannot be employed, would deprive men of ſhares, who might be in a ſituation to pay for them as ſoon as it could, while it would open a field to men who might be better provided at the inſtant of ſubſcribing, to engroſs largely, and ſell out at leiſure. In ſhort, each mode preſents advantages and inconveniencies. If no depoſit is required at ſubſcribing, the leaſt wealthy will have an opportunity to take more ſhares than they can hold, and of courſe, to get ſomething by the ſale of the ſurplus On the other hand, is a depoſit required, the moſt wealthy will be able to pay for more than they intend to keep, and of courſe, to impoſe and obtain a high price for thoſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſell. But it will reſt with government, after weighing ſuch conſiderations, whether to confirm the ſubſcriptions as already taken, or open a new one upon more improved principles.</p>
            <p>As to the capital proviſory and eventual. It is propoſed by the charter, that, whenever the dividends (after the whole original capital is paid) ſhall average above 12 per centum per annum, for and during five conſecutive years, that the directors in ſuch caſe, ſhall open ſubſcriptions under the original regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (unleſs others ſhould be preſcribed previouſly by the legiſlature,) for an additional capital of 600,000 dollars, and upon every ſubſequent five years averag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a like dividend, a freſh ſubſcription for a like ſum, till the capital ſhall amount to 9,000,000 of dollars.<note n="*" place="bottom">Propoſition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This proviſion, beſides meeting the increaſe of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029010_0036_0FDE896008B81DE0"/>
trade and "the progreſſive improvements in ſociety," is intended to operate againſt ſpeculation, by giving an opportunity, from time to time, to every citizen to come in upon original conditions (which they could not do were the 9,000,000 to be ſubſcribed for at once) as well as relieve the inſtitution from the appellation of a monopoly, a term rendered pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly odious by the 39th ſection of our declaration of rights.</p>
            <p>It is moreover meant that nothing in the charter ſhall be conſtrued, to deprive government of a right to direct further occaſional enlargements of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſhould circumſtances point to its propriety.<note n="*" place="bottom">Propoſition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But this proviſion may be conſidered as extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper upon another account. Were there to be no reſtriction upon the amount of notes that might be iſſued, and the power to augment the capital to reſt with the directors only, and not upon a fixed principle, it is to be apprehended, that the voracious ſpirit of ſelf-intereſt, having an eye to greater divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends by keeping the capital ſtationary, during a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive demand, would procraſtinate, if not prevent its enlargement, however loudly the intereſt of the community might call for the meaſure, and thus convert a public inſtitution into a mere private Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing company.</p>
            <p>The proviſion is alſo calculated to anſwer another valuable purpoſe, that of preſerving in its purity one of the objects of the inſtitution, as by its means, ſhould undue preferences have obtained, the evil may be obviated, and the equilibrium of power, among the ſtockholders, if loſt, re-eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>It being deemed eſſential, to the due adminiſtration of a Bank, to provide againſt favoritiſm in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of diſcounts, the charter eſtabliſhes an efficient rotation of directors, at the ſame time that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029010_0037_0FDE89035F3D67F0"/>
it enjoins the re-election of one fourth of thoſe who have not ſerved four years, in order to perpetuate, in the body, a competent knowlege of the affairs of the inſtitution.<note n="*" place="bottom">Propoſition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The next proviſion that requires notice, reſpects a limitation to the iſſues of paper.<note n="†" place="bottom">Propoſition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Although the ſucceſſive increaſe of Bank capital forms of itſelf a barrier againſt an inordinate circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of paper; yet that no avenue might remain open on ſo delicate a point, we have introduced a clauſe which fixes an abſolute proportion between the Bank paper and its coin.</p>
            <p>In fixing this proportion we have conſulted the beſt writers, and the experience of men, the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſuch matters, between whom we find a perfect coincidence of opinion. According to Mr. <hi>Megins,</hi> the Bank of England keeps always in coin, ready to meet exchanges, <hi>one third</hi> of the value of its notes in circulation. Such alſo is the proportion obſerved in the Banks of the United States, when adminiſtered with prudence, and without a regard to inordinate dividends. This proportion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which may be conſidered as forming the point of ſafety to Banks and the public, cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the directors of the propoſed Bank, without being anſwerable for the conſequences in their private capacities, and being rendered ineligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to office for ever after. Hence, the public can never be inundated with paper, or have every ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of circulation filled with Bank notes.</p>
            <p>The United States Bank, which is, perhaps, the beſt organiſed Bank in the world, has a limitation predicated upon this principle, but admitting of a greater latitude of circulation. It is to be obſerved, however, that the annual converſion of a part of its
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029010_0038_0FDE89649E571318"/>
funded debt into ſpecie (which conſtitutes 3.4ths of its capital) muſt gradually bring the proportion of notes it may circulate within this practical rule.</p>
            <p>There is another circumſtance that may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as confirmatory of the propriety of the adoption of this proportion. Since the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bank of England, in 1694, down to the preſent time, that nation has ſuſtained forty years of war, excluſive of that in which it is yet engaged; during which period, taking the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, found in Anderſon's Chronological Hiſtory of Commerce, and other documents of an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic nature, for data, by which to aſcertain the amount of its circulation, it appears, that it muſt have adhered, <hi>in general,</hi> to the proportion as laid down by Mr. Megins. Seeing, therefore, that this proportion has ſtood the teſt of ſuch a length of time, as well in war as peace, the Bank which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopts it for an invariable and fundamental rule, muſt be conſidered as reſting upon the moſt perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent foundation.</p>
            <p>That this reſtriction, which muſt forever prevent the Bank from ſurcharging circulation with its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, comports with a due regard to the <hi>ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the ſtockholders,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the general intereſt of the community, will appear evident, in conſidering the following important proviſion.</p>
            <p>The charter propoſes, a dividend of ten per cent. to the ſtockholders, as often as it ariſes out of the buſineſs; and further, to divide equally between them and the ſtate, the profits of every <hi>three years,</hi> which ſhall exceed an average of ten per cent.<note n="*" place="bottom">Propoſition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As ſome have affected to conſider this diviſion of profit, between the ſtockholders and the public, in the nature of a bribe to government, for a charter,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029010_0039_0FDE89090E575F18"/>
and others, as uſhering in a new rule in ſuch caſes, we ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that the <hi>principle</hi> is ſanctioned by <hi>general practice,</hi> and that the <hi>practice</hi> is founded in <hi>ſtrict juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With reſpect to the <hi>practice.</hi> It is notorious, that the charter of the Bank of England, was paid for by a loan to government, of £. 1,200,000 ſterling, on much better terms than it was obtainable elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that every renewal of its charter, has been purchaſed in like manner. To mention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances—In 1742, that Bank advanced £1,600,000 to government, without intereſt. At another time, it paid, £100,000, which was neither to bear an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, nor yet, to be repaid.</p>
            <p>In 1781, it agreed to lend government £2,000,000 for <hi>three</hi> years, at three per cent. which, though equal to about £100,000, was ſtrongly objected to in parliament, as an inadequate equivalent for the extenſion of the charter for 21 years. We find, alſo, to purſue the ſubject, that ſimilar equivalents have been paid to their government, by the Banks of Genoa, Naples, and other like Banks of circulation for their charters, long before the erection of the Bank of England, ſo that the legiſlature of England, in this reſpect, have only followed a pre-exiſtent practice.</p>
            <p>We <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd, that the ſame practice has alſo governed the United States. By the charter of the Bank of the United States, government is permitted to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe 2,000,000 of dollars, ſpecie, and to withdraw it by way of loan, for ten years, reimburſable in equal annual inſtalments, at an intereſt not exceeding ſix per cent. and to enjoy a dividend upon the whole ſum, as if no part of it had been withdrawn, in other words, government is to draw a dividend from the Bank for ten years, upon money not advanced. This equivalent which is certainly conſiderable, was objected to in congreſs, as inſufficient for a charter
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029010_0040_0FDE896A80377B20"/>
of 20 years. A like equivalent is likewiſe ſtipulated for by the government of Pennſylvania in the charter erecting a ſtate Bank.</p>
            <p>Theſe facts, we preſume, are ſufficiently pointed and numerous to prove, that the principle of this proviſion is ſtrictly conformable to the <hi>general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>juſtice of the principle.</hi> Would it be juſt, it may be aſked, for a government, to grant to a few individuals, a lucrative trade, attended with little trouble, and require no equivalent for the grant? Government could not ſupport ſuch a proceeding upon the ground of the trade of the company ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating beneficially to the community, that being an effect <hi>not ſtipulated for,</hi> or which the company do not engage, ſhall be produced by their trade. Neither could it be juſtified upon the ground, that the profit is only equal to the riſk, becauſe, in truth, there is no riſk in the buſineſs; and if there was, other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of the community, who lend money under the <hi>general law,</hi> muſt run an equal riſk, and yet be ſatisfied with a leſs profit. Nor, could government with propriety alledge, that men could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to veſt their money in ſuch buſineſs, were its profits to be <hi>reſtricted,</hi> the fact being otherwiſe, as in the caſe of the Bank of the United States, which, in fixing limits to the quantity of paper that may be circulated, eſtabliſhed, in fact, a reſtriction upon its profits, and as is further evidenced, by the liſt of ſubſcribers to the propoſed inſtitution, who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to a reſtriction. Again, were the ſuppoſition of the <hi>theoriſts,</hi> who oppoſe ſuch eſtabliſhments, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, viz. that Banks are in certain reſpects, injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the community, could government upon that ground be juſtified in granting a charter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exacting <hi>damages</hi> in the grant, to the amount of the <hi>injuries ſuſtained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:029010_0041_0FDE890E5DE0BE20"/>Each of theſe caſes, then, evince the juſtice of the principle, or propriety of the reſtriction. But its juſtice reſts upon arguments of a yet more poſitive nature.</p>
            <p>The fact is, when government grants a banking charter, it creates an artificial perſon, which did not exiſt before, and endows it with <hi>civil rights</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes</hi> of great and extenſive importance. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, therefore, is particularly <hi>gained</hi> by this charter, by thoſe to whom it is granted, which they could not gain, or obtain without it, demands a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent <hi>compenſation.</hi> To render this idea more ſimple. A ſtate, which incorporates a Bank, <hi>grants</hi> to its ſtockholders, an exemption of their private fortune, (except ſo much thereof as conſiſts in Bank ſtock) from all engagements entered into, or debts owing by the Bank, of what nature ſoever, and <hi>takes</hi> from every other citizen or company, a <hi>right</hi> which they would otherwiſe have retained, to recover from each of the ſtockholders, to the amount of the notes they may reſpectively hold, in the event of a deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in its funds or exigible effects. Here then is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing plainly <hi>given</hi> to the Bank, and ſomething as plainly <hi>taken</hi> from the people.</p>
            <p>A ſtate grants another important privilege to a Bank, when it <hi>permits</hi> its notes to be paid in taxes and public dues, and <hi>refuſes</hi> the ſame privilege to notes iſſued by individuals, private companies, or ſimilar inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>A Bank is alſo particularly benefited, when a ſtate engages to depoſit in its vaults, its unappropriated and other monies. For, inaſmuch as the time ſuch monies may remain in Bank, can be exactly known to its directors, hence, operations upon this money may be predicated with as much ſafety and certainty, as if it made a part of the Bank's capital, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that gives to the depoſits of a ſtate a ſtriking ſuperiority over the fluctuating depoſits of individuals.</p>
            <p>For ſuch grants, relinquiſhments, privileges, and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029010_0042_0FDE897186B4F310"/>
advantages, an equivalent return becomes perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt, for where value is ſo plainly given, payment cannot be rightfully refuſed.</p>
            <p>We believe it to be unneceſſary to ſay any thing further, to conclude for the juſtice of the principle. The only queſtion, then, that can fairly ariſe on this occaſion, muſt reſpect the quantum of compenſation to the ſtockholders, and equivalent to be allowed to the ſtate. How ought this to be aſcertained?</p>
            <p>Suppoſing a groſs ſum to be fixed on by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as that muſt be ſettled by arbitrary opinion or compromiſe, ſo it might be either too much for the ſtockholders to give, or too little for the ſtate to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in lieu of its grant. It has been thought, therefore, better to decline this mode of adjuſtment in favour of a fixed rule, founded upon the ſolid rights of the parties, and coexiſtent with the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The ordinary profit upon money employed in a regular courſe of trade will, perhaps, form the trueſt ſtandard by which to determine the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that ought to be allowed to the ſtockholders. Upon the preſumption, then that this profit averages about 10 per cent. the charter ſecures to the ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders a dividend equal to that ſum, as often as the buſineſs ſhall net as much, and as a reſource againſt years of ſhort compenſation, half the profits upon every three year's dividends, that ſhall exceed, upon an average, ten per cent. reſerving to the ſtate the other half of the exceſs, as a conſtantly accruing equivalent for the charter.</p>
            <p>This diviſion of profit, we flatter ourſelves, will appear ſtrictly conformable to diſtributive juſtice. But it may be aſked, after aſſigning ten per cent. to the ſtockholders, for the uſe of their money, how much will remain to the ſtate, for the uſe of its charter?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:029010_0043_0FDE8913AB847120"/>To this queſtion, it may be ſatisfactorily anſwered, that as the different Banks in the United States, average above twelve per centum upon their ſpecie capital, it is to be preſumed that the propoſed Bank, will not average a leſs dividend (of which there can be no doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) The ſtate will therefore receive (taking theſe data for a ground of calculation) dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the operation of the whole of the firſt inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 6000 dollars per annum; during the ſecond, 12,000 dollars per annum; during the third, 18,000 dollars per annum; during the fourth, 24,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars per annum; and, during the fifth, 30,000 dollars per annum; or, in ten years, the ſum of 180,000 dollars, and when the capital ſhall have reached its eventual and proviſory limitation, 90,000 dollars annually, forever, independent of what it may divide as a ſtockholder, ſhould it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one.</p>
            <p>And here we cannot forbear mentioning an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that reſults from this arrangement of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. This proviſion, and its collateral ones,<note n="*" place="bottom">Propoſitions.</note> muſt neceſſarily give a publicity to the real annual profits of the Bank, and the amount of its circulation, which muſt attach to the inſtitution, a confidence that no other Bank, differently conſtructed, can poſſibly enjoy, and repel from it, at the ſame time, thoſe fears and ſuſpicions of an exceſſive circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of paper that myſtery and a want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its real profits naturally beget. This check, as precious to the public, as it is compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the true intereſt of the inſtitution, whoſe credit it muſt render perpetual, cannot be too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appreciated.</p>
            <p>This proviſion preſents another idea, with which we ſhall cloſe the ſubject. The ſource from which this profit to the ſtate is derived, ſeems to point to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029010_0044_0FDE8977A267EC20"/>
the propriety of deſtining it to works of public utility. It is ſubmitted, therefore, as a propoſition for conſideration, whether it might not be proper, to appropriate a certain part thereof, to objects of a public nature—ſuch as the improvement of towns, roads, and inland navigation; and to pledge the faith of the legiſlature, in the act of incorporation, that the ſame ſhall be, forever, ſacredly applied to theſe purpoſes.</p>
