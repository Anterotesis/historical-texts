            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT was far from the Author's Intention or Deſire, to appear in Print upon this Subject. The earneſt Importunity of a conſiderable Number of Clergymen, for whom he has great Reſpect, and who were preſent at the Delivery of the Diſcourſe, was the only Thing that made him conſent. Diffident of his own Judgment, he has ventured on theirs. As to the Stile and Manner, he makes no Apology, more than for the Appearance of his Perſon; it is ſuch as is natural to him. Yet ſo much with Juſtice he may ſay, that when he wrote it, he did not dream but that it was fated, with innumerable more, to lie and moulder in the Oblivion of his own Deſk.</p>

                  <p>Therefore if thou bring thy Gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy Brother hath aught againſt thee; leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy Way; firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Ignorance and Inattention is often apt to miſapply Texts of Scripture, ſo an evil Temper is ever ready to catch at any Plea that may ſeem to warrant the Neglect of Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: It is therefore the undoubted Duty of Miniſters of the Goſpel, to vindicate every Part of the ſacred Record from Abuſe, and as much as poſſible, to prevent Men from turning into Poiſon that which was deſigned for their Nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>The Words which I have read in your Ears, are ſome of the Number which require our Attention, to prevent a Miſimprovement of them, to the Hurt of many. I take this Opportunity therefore to call your Attention to a calm Conſideration of their true Intent and Meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:011491_0003_0F8331365D0C2840"/>To view them in their Connections, and to ſhew you their Import as relating to the Jews, ſhall be our firſt Part.</p>
            <p>An Application to Chriſtians, ſhall be our Second.</p>
            <p>To point out the Abuſes to which theſe Words are liable, we ſhall endeavour in the laſt Place.</p>
            <p n="1">I. If you conſider the Connection of theſe Words, you find they make a Part of that aſtoniſhing Sermon which the Son of God preached to his Diſciples on the Mount. A Sermon, in which he ſeems wholly to aim at overthrowing the Corruptions of human Nature, and particularly to knock down the baſe Props of them which the wicked Phariſees had ſet up under Colour of the Law. He begins by bleſſing and pronouncing happy thoſe whom Men naturally account moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. After rectifying their Judgment in theſe Reſpects, he proceeds directly to oppoſe the corrupt Gloſſes which the Scribes and Phariſees had caſt over the Law: He aims to arouſe and alarm his Hearers, by aſſuring them that unleſs their <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> was of a ſuperior kind to that of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Men of whom they had ſuch an high Opinion, they ſhould <hi>in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Unleſs they came to ſee more of the Spirituality and Extent of the Laws of God, than the Phariſees either did or taught, they muſt aſſuredly periſh. Now the Phariſees made the Laws of God extend only to the outward Conduct, and ſeemed not to imagine that they referred to the inward Diſpoſition and Thoughts of the Heart.</p>
            <p>Our Divine Lord begins,— he goes through a Number of the moral Precepts: He gives Inſtances firſt in the Law of <hi>killing;</hi> then in that of Adultery, of Divorces, of Swearing, of Revenge, and ſo on. Our
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011491_0003_0F8331365D0C2840"/>
Text is a conſequential Inſtruction upon the firſt of theſe. The Phariſees uſually introduced their Lectures upon the Law, with this Expreſſinn; <hi>"It hath been ſaid of them in old Time."</hi> As if it was more reſpectable that theſe Laws ſhould come under the Appearance of a Tradition from Men, than of the immediate Command of God. It is by Way of Remark upon this Arrogance, that our Lord tells his Hearers,—<q>
                  <hi>Ye have heard, it hath been ſaid of them in old Time,</hi>
               </q> THOU SHALT NOT KILL. The Phariſees had made this Addition of their own, "<hi>but whoſoever ſhall kill, ſhall be in Danger of the Judgment.</hi> Now Jeſus Chriſt enters into the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Latitude of this Command; and teaches them that it extends to our <hi>Words,</hi> and to the <hi>Feeling of the Heart,</hi> as well as to the Action of Murder. He makes the Man in a Degree chargeable with Murder, who lifts his Tongue againſt his Brother. Nay, if he is only angry at his Brother without a Cauſe, he finds him guilty of the Breach of the ſixth Command. <q>
                  <hi>But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever is angry with his Brother without a Cauſe;</hi> whoſoever <hi>calleth him Raca, thou Fool,</hi> or any ſuch haſty idle Names, in a Fit of Anger, has broken this Command, and is in Danger not only of temporal Puniſhment, but of <hi>Hell Fire.</hi>
               </q> And it muſt be ſo; for if Men ſuffer their Paſſions to riſe to ſuch a Degree, as that they entertain the leaſt Deſire of private Revenge, and teſtify this their Diſpoſition, by calling Names, or reviling; they ſhew, that they have in their Hearts the Seeds of Murder, or thoſe Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings from which Murder uſually ſprings.</p>
            <p>Now mark what follows; for it is our Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>"Therefore, if thou bring thy Gift to the Altar."</hi> It is introduced within <hi>"Therefore,"</hi> becauſe it follows from what has juſt been ſaid. As much as to ſay,—<hi>from
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011491_0004_0F833137174D7FF8"/>
what you have heard, you may learn, that if you bring your Gift to the Altar, and remember that your Brother hath aught againſt you.</hi> Since, therefore, raſh Anger and abuſive Language, hath ſomewhat murd'rous in it; and while you continue in that Frame, you live in the Breach of the Command we have been conſidering; when you come to make an Offering to the Lord, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that your Brother hath a Right to accuſe you of any Thing of this Kind; <hi>hath aught againſt you:</hi> If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that your Neighbour might juſtly lay it to your Charge, that you have within you the Seeds of Murder, or an angry vengeful Spirit; if you are conſcious of it, that you entertain ſuch a Diſpoſition, and that in Juſtice he might accuſe you of it did he know it; never think that this is a proper Frame of Mind to do any Duty acceptably in: Never ſuppoſe, that while the Spirit of Murder reſts in your Boſom, God will accept your Offering. If <hi>you remember</hi> it, if you call to mind, if you are conſcious of that wicked Frame of Soul, think not that any Oblations can be accepted. While you live in Anger with your Neighbour, God will never be pleaſed with you: Unleſs you pardon, God will never Pardon, Unleſs you love, God will never accept.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"If therefore thou bring thy Gift to the Altar."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We beg Leave to remark, that theſe <hi>Gifts,</hi> or Free-will-Offerings, were much preſſed upon the People by the Phariſees. The People were taught, that theſe were the moſt important and acceptable of all their Services; that without theſe, every Thing elſe availed nothing; and eſpecially they were taught, that theſe Gifts would atone for all Sins not puniſhable by the Judge.<note n="*" place="bottom">Whitby in loc.</note> It is for this Reaſon our Lord makes mention
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011491_0004_0F833137174D7FF8"/>
of Gifts, rather than of any other Kind of Service. As if he had ſaid, "No Act of Religion, however important, however coſtly, not even thoſe Free-will-Offerings or Gifts, which your falſe Teachers tell you, are able to atone for your Crimes, can themſelves be accepted of God, while your Brother might juſtly accuſe you of having a Spirit of Anger or Revenge in your Breaſt." If you are conſcious therefore, that this is your Caſe, and have brought your Gift to the very Altar; if you are ever ſo near approached to a religious Action, pauſe—reflect upon what you are about— think how vain to approach God with an implacable Heart towards Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy Way."</hi> Here it is proper to obſerve, that this Advice was given to the Jew, and to him it was literally practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It was cuſtomary with them, as ſome tell us, when they came to the Altar, and remembered any Thing, which at that Time might prevent them, to <hi>leave there their Gift</hi> until another Time; perhaps the next Day; and then come and formally offer it. In ſuch Caſe, it was no Detriment to them, nor to the Sacrifice. Whether that particular Gift is offered To-day, or deferred until To-morrow, is a Matter of no Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo be it is offered or given. To defer a Day, doth not hinder any other Offering due at the Time. And in this Reſpect it differed from the ſpiritual Duties of the Chriſtian. With us, if deferred, the Duty in moſt Caſes is not done. A Chriſtian Duty, deferred until next Seaſon, is in moſt Inſtances, left undone. My praying To-day, will not anſwer for my not praying Yeſterday; and ſo of all other ſpiritual Duties. But of this by-and-by. It was however literally practicable by the Jew. <hi>Leave there thy Gift, and go thy Way.</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011491_0005_0F833137CFA3B150"/>
               <hi>"Firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Scope of the Text, you ſee, that the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> here intended, was to be <hi>within his own Heart.</hi> It is the ſpiritual Breach of the ſixth Command that our Redeemer is here oppoſing. Now, if the Man's Heart was thoroughly ſweetened towards his Neighbour, when he came to make the Offering, then he could not be chargeable with this Crime. Nor can it be imagined, that our Lord deſigned to forbid the Jew to make any Offering, ſo long as one of his fellow Creatures was diſpleaſed with him. To reconcile the Hearts of others, is not in our Power; and if we muſt defer Duties until this is done, we may defer forever. Our Buſineſs is not ſo much with others, as with our own Hearts; and the improper Frame of no other Man upon Earth, can be a Reaſon why I ſhould not perform my Duty. It is a great Miſtake to ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> here ſpoken of, intends <hi>the Settlement of all Matters in Debate</hi> between him about to offer, and his Neighbour. It was, it moſt certainly is, a deſirable Thing, that the Worſhippers of the ſame God, ſhould unite in Heart with each other: Happy, if, when we approach the God of Peace, in the ſolemn Duties of Religion, we can view ourſelves at Peace with all Men, and all Men at Peace with us. Nay, it is the undoubted Duty of all, to give their Neighbour Satisfaction, wherein they are conſcious they have injured him. Nor need they expect to meet with Acceptance from God, in any Duty, however important, unleſs, at leaſt, they are diſpoſed to give Satisfaction, and repair any wilful Wrong they may have done. But it is plain, that what our Lord here refers to, is the Temper of the Heart; <hi>"Go thy Way, firſt be reconciled to thy Brother.</hi> Let
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011491_0005_0F833137CFA3B150"/>
your Heart be thoroughly ſweetened towards him, before you can expect that God will accept your Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Come not with a Breach of the ſixth Command burning in your Breaſt. While in that Frame, the Lord will look upon you as a Murderer, notwithſtanding the moſt coſtly Offering you can bring. Be therefore reconciled in Heart to thy Brother, and <hi>then come</hi> and offer thy Gift. Where you obſerve,</p>
            <p>The Command is to perform the Duty ſtill. The Jew muſt not omit the Offering, tho' he is permitted to withdraw for a Time, to ſubdue his Heart to a ſoft and charitable Frame; No,—the religious Act is not to be left undone. It was not left to his Option, whether he would perform it or not. He muſt be reconciled to his Brother, and he muſt come and offer his Gift.</p>
            <p>We proceed to ſhew you the Application of this to ourſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Application of this will affect our Judgment and our Practice.</p>
            <p>It ſerves to rectify our Judgment in ſeveral Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſhews in the firſt Place, with irreſiſtible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he who will not be reconciled in Heart to his Neighbour, need not think of being reconciled to God. Sure if God will not accept the Sacrifice, he will not accept the Perſon. Object not here, that <hi>he who believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> We grant that ſuch an one <hi>is juſtified freely by the Grace of Chriſt, and has Peace with God.</hi> But a Goſpel Temper of Mind, and an Obedience to the Precepts of the Goſpel, is the only Evidence of a true Faith. You may aſſuredly know that your Faith is not genuine, if it doth not produce a goſpel Temper, and an evangelical Conduct. That Man never had true Faith, who will not be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011491_0006_0F833138B34C9D38"/>
to his Neighbour. That Man can never be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, who refuſes to be at Peace with his Brother. Nothing can be more poſitive than our Saviour's Declaration to this Purpoſe. Matth. vi. 15. <hi>But if ye forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your Treſpaſſes.</hi> You ſee, there is no Pardon of Sin for thoſe who will not pardon. When our divine Maſter gave his Diſciples (not a Form, but) a <hi>Directory for Prayer,</hi> he commanded them to pray for Forgiveneſs, only upon the Condition of their forgiving thoſe who had treſpaſſed againſt them. Our Forgiveneſs muſt not be meerly in Part, ſuch as you exerciſe when you only refrain from returning the like Injury, tho' your Heart feels unkind,—it muſt not be meerly ſuch a Forgiveneſs as will permit you to ſay Things to the Diſadvantage of the Perſon, or at leaſt will ſuffer you to withold your Hand from a kind Office, to which you would have been diſpoſed, had he not offended you. While ſuch is the Diſpoſition of your Mind, think what it is you aſk when you pray, <hi>forgive us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive thoſe who treſpaſs againſt us! As we forgive.</hi> O Sirs! were God to forgive you by Halves, as you forgive your Neighbours; were he only to puniſh you in ſome other Way,—were he to withold his divine Favour, and not do you kind Offices, (and this is what you pray for) what would become of you? The Forgiveneſs which the Goſpel demands, is entire and complete. Not only are we to pardon, but we are to love. Not only to forgive, but to love ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,—<hi>to love our Neighbour as ourſelves.</hi> And without this <hi>Charity,</hi> all other Accompliſhments in the World are <hi>nothing;</hi> are no Evidences of true Chriſtianity. It is therefore a certain Truth, that he who will not be reconciled to his Neighbour, need not think of being reconciled to God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011491_0006_0F833138B34C9D38"/>2. It informs us alſo, that the Duty of Forgiveneſs and Charity, is much more acceptable to God, than the moſt coſtly Sacrifices. Nay, he will not accept of the greateſt Gift we can preſent him, where theſe are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Jew was ordered to lay aſide his Free-will-Offering, until he had brought his Mind to ſubmit to Forgiveneſs and Love, to ſignify to him and us, that were we to give all we have to God, he would not accept where Reconciliation and Love was wanting. Let us never think, therefore, that God will take any Notice of our Reſentments, unleſs our Hearts are right towards our Neighbour. <hi>Could I ſpeak with</hi> Ten Thouſand <hi>Tongues,</hi> and could I converſe like an Angel; could I aſtoniſh the World with Miracles,—were I ſo generous as to <hi>give all I poſſeſs in Alms; nay,</hi> ſo attached to the Religion I profeſs, as to <hi>give my Body to be burned</hi> in its Vindication; yet, <hi>if I have not Charity, I am nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to apply this Direction to our own Practice. Tho' we are not literally in the Circumſtance of the Jew, and are not therefore literally to practice this Command; yet are we to act up to the Spirit of the Precept, as far as practicable in our Circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we approach God in any Duty, and reflect that our Neighbour might juſtly accuſe us of a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unchriſtian Spirit towards him, we ought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to pauſe,—accuſe ourſelves of it, <hi>judge ourſelves that we be not judged;</hi> be humble under a Senſe of our Sin, and immediately bring our Hearts to conſent to a perfect Reconciliation with him. The Moment we recollect the Evil, we ſhould put it from us; forgive without Delay, and love without Reſerve; nor dare to approach God with a Spirit of Murder in our Boſom.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is ſuppoſable in which a Duty may be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently omitted, a ſufficient Time to give us the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011491_0007_0F83313963037C58"/>
of leiſurely reflecting, and exerciſing our Minds upon the Evil of an unforgiving Temper; and of bringing it to a complete Submiſſion to the Commands of the Goſpel. But in moſt Chriſtian Duties, eſpecially in the common Ordinances of our Religion, a literal Omiſſion of them for a Time, cannot be done without Guilt. Now, in each of theſe, we bring ourſelves and all we have, and are a <hi>Gift to the Altar.</hi> Prayer is nothing leſs than a ſolemn practical Acknowledgment, that all we have and are, came from God, and is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on him,—and an Offering made of the ſame to his Service. Here then is a <hi>Gift brought to the Spiritual Altar.</hi> Here is a Duty which cannot be omitted. We are to pray always; <hi>"pray without ceaſing."</hi> But ſhall we dare bring <hi>this Gift:</hi>—ſhall we dare approach God to aſk his Pardon, while we refuſe to pardon? Shall we dare to come near the <hi>Tryer of the Reins,</hi> with an Heart filled with Rancour againſt Man? And yet, we muſt approach him,—and yet the Duty muſt not be omitted. Here then you ſee the Heart muſt be brought to bow without Delay. No ſooner, therefore, does the Evil ariſe, than it ought to be cruſhed. Extinguiſh the Spark e'er it becomes a Flame.</p>
            <p>If therefore, you will act up to the Spirit of this Precept, you will oppoſe the firſt Riſings of a vengeful Spirit, and bring your Hearts directly to Benevolence and Love; and remember, that you are utterly diſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for Attendance upon any one Chriſtian Duty, until this is done.</p>
            <p>"You can't"—ſay you? <q>You have endeavoured, but find it impoſſible to be perfectly reconciled, after ſuch egregious Abuſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And is this brought as an Excuſe for your continuing in a malignant Frame of Mind? The Exceſs of your
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011491_0007_0F83313963037C58"/>
Iniquity brought as an Apology for it? To ſay, <hi>we cannot,</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, is an Abuſe of Language. Thy obſti-Heart is averſe to the Thing; it <hi>will not yield.</hi> Speak the Truth, and you will ſay, that after ſuch ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you <hi>will not,</hi> your Heart will not conſent to the mortifying Propoſal of Chriſt. The eternal God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and you will not obey. The Lord Jeſus inſiſts upon it, as a Trial of your Allegiance to him, and you will not ſubmit. There is no Excuſe. The Greatneſs of the Injury received, is no Reaſon why we ſhould diſobey God, and conſent to be abandoned by Jeſus Chriſt. But, know ye, that unleſs you ſubmit to this Propoſal, you ſhall never be accepted in one Duty; nay, you ſhall never meet with Mercy.—</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Abuſe to which this Text is liable, is a third Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Many Profeſſors of the Religion of Chriſt, think themſelves warranted by this Text, in abſenting from Ordinances, when they have met with an Affront or ill Uſage from any of their Brethren.</hi> This is the firſt and moſt common Abuſe. An Abuſe by which the Text is turned upſide down. They do not enquire, whether their Neighbour has <hi>aught againſt them,</hi> but whether they have <hi>aught againſt their Neighbour.</hi> Upon the ſlighteſt Review of what has been ſaid, you muſt ſee, that theſe Words give no Warrant for their Abſence. The Queſtion is not, whether you have been ill-uſed by a Brother, or not? The Queſtion is, <hi>how do you feel upon it?</hi> Whether you retain in your Heart an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving unkind Temper towards him? Not whether he has injured you? But whether on that Account you injure your God and your Redeemer? Whether if he could ſee your Heart, he might not accuſe you of a Breach of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011491_0008_0F83313A6F8CBEA8"/>
the ſixth Command? Not whether <hi>you have aught againſt</hi> him? but whether <hi>he has aught againſt you?</hi> If a Man has abuſed you, this cannot unfit you to attend on God. Let him be who he will, ſuppoſe it even the Man by whoſe Hands the Ordinance is diſpenſed; if he has injuriouſly treated you, this cannot prevent your finding Acceptance with God, in the Diſcharge of your Duty, unleſs your abominable Temper prevents you. And if Men do us wrong, muſt we therefore wrong our God? Why then diſpleaſe him by neglecting his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, when a <hi>Worm of Duſt</hi> has diſpleaſed us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To refuſe to join in the Ordinances of Religion, until ſuch an Offender, whether real or imaginary, has given Satisfaction, and a Reconciliation thereby brought about,</hi> is another, or rather an Improvement upon the former Abuſe. Horrid Abuſe indeed! by which this Precept which was directly levelled againſt our own Corruptions, and inſiſts upon our mortifying them immediately, is perverted to procure their Gratification. You will not bring your Gift to the Altar of God, until his Creature has humbled himſelf, and thereby reconciled himſelf to you? Unreaſonable Man! Thou doſt not aſk, whether thy Heart has the Seeds of Murder in it, and whether thou haſt not need of Humiliation? but whether thy Neighbour is in the Wrong. But pray;—when we draw near to God, is it our Neighbour or ourſelves that we are to <hi>examine?</hi> In Attendance upon Ordinances, what Buſineſs have we with the Qualifications of our Neighbours? Is not our Buſineſs with ourſelves? The Reconciliation which we ſhould inſiſt upon, is it not in our own Breaſt? In Attendance upon God, what Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have you to inſiſt on Satisfaction from others? What tho' a Brother never gives you Satisfaction; muſt you therefore deny yourſelf the grand Privileges of a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011491_0008_0F83313A6F8CBEA8"/>
Chriſtian? If he never gives you Satisfaction, muſt you therefore be the leſs reconciled in Heart? If he never gives you Satisfaction, muſt you therefore deny God the publick Honours which you are bound to pay him? Is it to God or to Man that we attend on Ordinances? What mean you, Chriſtians, by this ſtrange Perverſion of the Counſel of the Son of God? No more plead Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on this Head; it is an Inſult on that faithful Monitor within us, to make him give his Suffrage to Iniquity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To refuſe to join the publick Ordinances of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, becauſe there may be one or more there whom you diſlike, or of whom you have a bad Opinion,</hi> is another Abuſe; which, tho' it has no Colour of Plea from our Text, yet has its Place among Profeſſors. If it ſhould be that your angry Reſentments againſt the Perſon of a Brother is at the Bottom; and your <hi>Deſire to teſtify your Diſlike,</hi> the whole Cauſe of your Refuſal to join with him; without need of a ſingle Argument to prove it ſo, we pronounce it a baſe and criminal Cauſe. Your own Conſcience confirms it. Nothing can be more unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, nothing more oppoſed to our Text. It is this Temper which it demands to be ſubdued. Now, if inſtead of this, you will make your private Picque a Reaſon why you ſhould diſobey God, and refuſe to own him before Men; if inſtead of this, you will debaſe a publick Ordinance, by making it the Means of teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the World an ungodly Temper: How criminal do you render yourſelf? Is this a Way to ſhew private Reſentment? Shall Men dare to make a ſolemn Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action with God the Means of ſupporting a Quarrel with Men? But,</p>
            <p>Should it be that your Judgment is really wrong in this Matter? Do you really think, that we are held not
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011491_0009_0F83313AE1593370"/>
to communicate with one whom we eſteem vicious? Is it Sentiment and not Temper? Sure our Text does not in the leaſt Degree tend to ſupport this Notion, as it has nothing to do with our Neighbours Characters, but with our own. The Sentiment is abſurdly wrong. For in the firſt Place; my good or bad Opinion of my Neighbour, is not to regulate my Conduct in immediate Duty towards God. Becauſe I think the Man <hi>who ſits down with me,</hi> a Villain, and that he ought to be deprived of the Privilege, is it reaſonable that on that Account I ſhould deprive myſelf of the Privilege? Becauſe he ſins, ſhall not I therefore do a commanded Duty? Shall we omit poſitive Duties, becauſe there will always be Sinners in the Church? Upon this Plan all the ſocial Duties of Religion muſt ceaſe. Sure I may confeſs my Saviour in Company with an Hypocrite, and yet not be an Hypocrite. I may ſit down with an impious Man, and yet not patronize his Iniquity.</p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p>
               <q>A Church, ſay you, ought to bear Teſtimony againſt ſcandalous Perſons.</q> We grant it: But am I a Church? Am I to be both Judge and Jury in this Caſe? Sure a Church ought to be its own Judge, when a Perſon is ſcandalous: I am not to be its Judge, and to determine when it ſhall proceed to Cenſure. An Individual ſhews great Arrogance indeed, when he preſumes to act as Judge and Executioner in any Caſe of that Kind; and, if the Church does not coincide with him, to cenſure both the Church and the accuſed too. A Church cannot cenſure until the Crime is made manifeſt to their Conſciences; they <hi>cannot condemn a Man until he is proved Guilty.</hi> Now tho' I know him to be ſo, but cannot make it appear to the Church, it is not my Province in this Caſe to take the Buſineſs of a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011491_0009_0F83313AE1593370"/>
Church upon me. I have no Right to bear my public Teſtimony againſt him, by excommunicating him, or rather myſelf on his Account. If God has made me the Judge, and given me the Right to puniſh by myſelf, any Crimes that I know to be committed, then let me act in this Office, and abſent myſelf in Teſtimony thereof. But I have no more Right to execute upon my own private Opinion, in eccleſiaſtical than in civil Cauſes. You know that a Man has committed Murder; —but you cannot make it appear ſo to the Court: Will you in this Caſe preſume to put the Murderer to Death? No,—you yourſelf would become a Murderer in the Eye of the Law. What is he then who will perſiſt in paſſing public Cenſure upon a Brother, by abſenting himſelf from Ordinances, in which his Brother joins; even tho' he knows him guilty; when he either <hi>has not,</hi> or <hi>cannot</hi> make him appear ſo the Church? What are you to ſay, M. H. who preſume to take the Keys of Diſcipline into your own Hands? How is it, that one Man will thus take the Place of a whole Church, and that too under Pretence of Duty? And how audacious eſpeciallly, and how contrary to the Laws of Chriſt, and to all Rules of good Society, does that Man act who abſents himſelf with a View to Cenſure the Church of which he is only a Member; or dare to threaten the Body of Chriſt, with leaving it, unleſs it conforms itſelf to his Judgment? And how often do Men attempt to make Church Diſcipline the Means of avenging private Quarrels? How often does meer Temper influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this Matter! O Sirs! it is tremendous trifling with the Things of God. Let us get our Views of theſe Things ſettled, and act as before him, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with our Conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:011491_0010_0F83313B929FA3A0"/>Whatever may be our Judgment of a Man, it does not diſpenſe with our Duty to God. Tho' a Judas was ſitting down with us, before he was proved a Judas, it need not alter our Conduct. Jeſus Chriſt was preſent with his Diſciples; he gave them the firſt Sacrament by way of Pattern for all Ages, and bleſſed them, tho' he knew that <hi>one of then was a Devil.</hi> But he was not proved ſo at that Time to his little Church. So he may be preſent with us and bleſs us, tho' there be more than one Traitor among us. And if the little Church, of which Jeſus himſelf was the Miniſter in Perſon, was not free from ſuch; how vain, how infinitely abſurd for any Sect of Men to pretend to, or hope for a pure Church here!</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is another Abuſe of this Text, <hi>when a Church omits the Lord's Supper on Account of ſome Quarrel or Diſaffection among them.</hi> To give Way to the Omiſſion of public Duties, becauſe of the ſinful Temper of Individuals is to give Way to the Devil, who foments Confuſion; not to comply with the Command, which is to cauſe ſuch a Temper to ſubſide immediately, and then to proceed in the Duty. The Jew was to offer his Gift notwithſtanding; and is a Chriſtian, is a whole Church permitted to omit the Ordinances of Religion, and that from Time to Time? If ever there was an Ordinance calculated to promote Peace and Love, it is the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and methinks it is a wretched Attempt to procure theſe Bleſſings, in the Neglect of God's Inſtitutions, and of ſuch in particular as are deſigned to promote Brotherly Love. Strange that whole Churches ſhould run into ſo groſs a Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Will of God!</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:011491_0010_0F83313B929FA3A0"/>5. It is, in the laſt Place, a grievous Abuſe of this Text, <hi>to apply it to the Lord's Supper, more than to any other Ordinance or ſolemn religious Duty of Chriſtianity.</hi> That it was ever applied particularly to this Inſtitution, more than to others, is ſtrange. It is plain, that our Lord mentions the Duty of Gifts or Free-will-Offerings, becauſe they were conſidered among the Jews as the moſt important and meritorious of all their Services: That hence they might naturally conclude, if in the moſt important they could not meet with Acceptance; ſure not in the leſs important. But what nearer Affinity theſe Gifts had to the Lord's Supper, than any other Inſtitution of Chriſt, it is hard to tell; and how ſo many of us perſiſt in applying the Injunction to this Sacrament more than any other Ordinance, is ſurpriſing. And yet the Man, who with this Miſapplication with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws himſelf from the Lord's Supper, does not on this Account withdraw from the Baptiſm of his Child, where one would think the <hi>Offer of a Gift</hi> is ſtill more formal,—he does not abſent from Prayer, &amp;c. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the prejudice may have originally aroſe from a Romiſh Superſtition, —(the infinitely abſurd Remains of which we ſtill ſee upheld in a <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">To have an Altar, when you declare, that there is no Sacrifice to be made upon it; to have a Prieſt under the Chriſtian Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when you confeſs that Chriſt <hi>has once offered himſelf up for us all,</hi> and <hi>made an End of Sin;</hi> to fall down in a Poſture of Adoration, when you confeſs that it is only Bread and Wine, and not the adorable Saviour, is infinitely more abſurd, than theſe Things among the Roman Catholicks, whoſe Belief correſponds with their Practice.</note>) I mean that of having an Altar in the End of the Church, which looks towards Jeruſalem, and the Order of Prieſthood —[a Name which ſhould not be known in the Goſpel-Miniſtry;]
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011491_0011_0F83313C684E9A80"/>
to offer up Sacrifices of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, into which they ſuppoſe the conſecrated Bread and Wine is really converted: At the Time of which Sacrifice, it is cuſtomary with them to bring ſome Gift and lay it upon the Altar, for the Uſe of the Church. Hence, I ſay, might poſſibly ariſe that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, by which this Text is conſidered as more Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Lord's Supper, than to other Chriſtian Duties. But as the ſame Reaſons hold good; ſo in all our Approaches to God in every Duty, it muſt be obſerved as a Rule, that it cannot be acceptable to him, if our Heart is not diſpoſed to love our Neighbour. They therefore, who omit this holy Sacrament from ſuch a Plea, ought, if they are conſiſtent, for the ſame Reaſons, to omit all Chriſtian Duties whatever.</p>
            <p>We have now gone thro' the Abuſes; it remains for you to avoid them. Let us be exhorted, to <hi>lay aſide all Malice and Guile, and Evil-ſpeaking, and as new-born Babes, receive the ſincere Milk of the Word.</hi> We would not have God deny us Pardon; let us love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Let not Temper influence us in Matters of Religion. See! what Havock it makes all around us! And as we are about to give up our Bodies and Souls and all, a Sacrifice to God, in the Ordinance approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; let us ſtrive to have our Hearts ſweetened towards all Men. O that <hi>the Love of God</hi> might <hi>conſtrain us,</hi> and the Love of Man warm our Boſoms. And as we all hope in the ſame Lord Jeſus, and wiſh to go to the ſame Heaven, ſo let us be of one Heart, and live like Brethren. AMEN!</p>
