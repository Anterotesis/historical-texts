            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>As the writer of the following narrative (being perſonally known to and well eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a number among us,) was enabled to bear a faithful and upright teſtimony to the peaceable government of Chriſt, and againſt the ſpirit of war, we think the Publication of it may afford ſtrength and encouragement to others to follow his worthy example; we therefore recommend its peruſal to the members of our religious ſociety and others, hoping it may have a tendency to advance our peaceable teſtimony.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE WAS TAKEN FROM A MANU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCRIPT LEFT BY OUR FRIEND JOHN SMITH, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THE EARLY PART OF HIS LIFE, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE SOME ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCES, TRIALS, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>I JOHN SMITH of Marlborough in Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter County Pennſylvania, was born in the townſhip of Dartmouth and county of Briſtol in New England, on the 22d. of the 4th. month 1681; my parents profeſſed the truth in their latter years; and as I grew to years of underſtanding the Lord was pleaſed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me with the knowledge of his bleſſed truth, and the work and operation thereof in my own heart, that by the virtue of it I came to be very much weaned from the vanities and delights of the world, and periſhing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that are therein, and thoſe things that I was inclined to by nature. And as I came to be acquainted with the diſcipline of the croſs, and the divine light ſhining in my heart, about
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038519_0004_101229190ED34DA8"/>the 22d. year of my age, I was called to bear my teſtimony againſt wars and fightings, as being contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt, and the nature of his kingdom, and could not join with thoſe that were for bearing arms for the defence of the country, againſt the French and Indian enemy; and accordingly, on the 15th. of the 6th. month 1703, I was notified by one William Hart, called a corporal, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the town houſe in Dartmouth, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to engage in the ſervice propoſed, under Benjamin Church, called captain, but refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for conſcience ſake to comply, I was ſummoned on the 14th. of the 1ſt. month 1704, to appear before Nathaniel By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field and Ebenezer Brenton, two magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates of ſaid county of Briſtol, and examined concerning my ſaid refuſal, in which I ſtill perſiſting for the reaſons above ſaid, I was fined in the ſum of five pounds, and one pound three ſhillings charges. But having a months time to conſider whether to pay ſaid fine or not, I found moſt peace in refuſing, for which I was ſentenced to priſon till payment thereof, where I remained till the general ſeſſions in the ſecond month following, and was then required to pay
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038519_0005_1012291C020AA4E0"/>ſaid fine and charges: but ſtill refuſing for the reaſon aforeſaid, proclamation was made in court that I ſhould be hired out to work to any that wanted a hand, for any time not exceeding four years, in order to ſatisfy ſaid fine &amp;c. but none offering to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my ſervice as above, I was ſent to priſon again, there to remain till an order was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the governor to remove me to Boſton caſtle, there to work as a priſoner till ſaid fine was ſatisfied. Here I continued in great peace of mind about two weeks, often being made ſenſible of Divine kindneſs in this my confined condition: at the end of two weeks, the above ſaid Benjamin Church came and commanded me out of priſon, which I refuſed to comply with, without the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors order agreeable to the judgment of Court, which order he never produced, but forcibly took me out of priſon, and I was ordered on board a veſſel to be ſent to Boſton caſtle; and on our way through the town we met two of our friends, who in a friendly manner aſked the perſon who commanded me, what art thou going to do with our friend? he anſwered he was going to take him to Boſton caſtle: the friends remarked to him,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038519_0006_1012291E1D62FEB8"/>how ſome people in ſuch caſes had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in their expectation and their veſſels in danger of being loſt: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this precaution, he perſiſted in his reſolution till it had like to have been our caſe, for being put on board a veſſel which had but little ballaſt in her, and ſailing on our way to Boſton, being about twenty leagues by water, there came a ſquall of wind and laid our veſſel on one ſide, on which I ran and looſed the ſails, ſo that ſhe got righted before any of the hands came to my aſſiſtance, which the hands on board ſeeing were glad of my company, and I was thankful to our great preſerver for this merciful deliverance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got to Boſton we met ſaid colonel Church, for he was both colonel and captain; I was allowed the liberty of the town, only to meet at a certain inn about the ſixth hour every evening (which liberty I thought was a trial to me, whether I would get away from them or not, but I was their true priſoner, truths teſtimony being more precious to me at that time than my outward liberty,) which order I punctually obeyed, ſo that I had time to ſee my friends in the town, who ſhewed great kindneſs and reſpect to me. Thus I
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038519_0007_10122921998F1B28"/>continued a priſoner at large in the town of Boſton about a week, for the maſter of the veſſel that brought me there, being ſenſible of the danger he was in at that time, could not be prevailed with to take me to the caſtle, nor be concerned further with me as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, but afterwards on the fifth of the third month, I was conveyed to the caſtle where I remained a priſoner four months and four days, being a priſoner from my firſt confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeven months and two days. And notwithſtanding ſome pains were taken to obtain my liberty, particularly by our friend Thomas Story who was travelling in New England at that time, in truth's ſervice, yet it had not the deſired effect; during which time the people behaved civilly towards me, as believing I acted from a religious principle, but finding they could not make me ſubmit to them they ſet me at liberty. On my mother's application to the governor, and making my caſe known to him, he ordered his clerk to write to the captain of the caſtle, an order for me to be releaſed, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. During the time of my confinement in the caſtle, there came a kinſman of mine to ſee me, he was of ſome conſiderable note
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038519_0008_101229231F57CDC0"/>in the worlds account, and therefore came in diſguiſe, not deſiring his being there ſhould be known, but as in a friendly viſit: calling me aſide, he ſaid, couſin, ſince you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, I would have you hold to your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, adding I have nothing to diſcourage you, but believe if you are faithful the Lord will proſper you in your undertaking, which he ſpoke in much love and affection, and at parting prayed the Lord to bleſs me; which kind viſit from one who did not profeſs the truth, was comfortable and ſtrengthening to me in this my ſuffering ſtate.</p>
                  <p>So being at liberty as above, I returned home to my fathers family, in much peace of mind, with praiſes to the Almighty for my deliverance thus far, where I followed my lawful calling, till near the ſpring following, when I ſhipped myſelf on board the brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,—Matthew Eaſtow commander, bound for London. It proved a very ſtormy voyage, ſo that divers times we expected to be caſt away, but the merciful hand was our preſerver. I had many times with true thankfulneſs of heart to bleſs and magnify his great and holy name, in a ſweet ſenſe of his mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:038519_0009_1012292980549C28"/>
In about eight weeks ſailing, we made King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale harbour in the weſt of Ireland, where we tarried about eight days, and then weighed anchor and ſailed for London. We came to the landſend of England on the 13th. of the 4th. month 1705, and next day near Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, a man of war met us, and took me and two more of our hands; but the captain ſent us on board our own veſſel again that night. There lay ſeventeen ſail of men of war in Plymouth harbour at that time, one of which ſent their boat with ſome hands, and took my companion Thomas Anthony, who came with me from New England and myſelf on board their ſhip, leaving but three hands in the veſſel with our maſter, although he was very weak, and not capable of any buſineſs. The ſhip we were taken on board of lay about five leagues off, and the next day went out a cruiſing: the lieutenant was very envious, and ſwore divers times that he would run us through with his ſword; the captain ſeemed more moderate, although not inclined to ſet us at liberty. The day after we ſailed, the ſhip we were in took a French prize with fifty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh priſoners on board: when they were going to engage, they placed us to a gun,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038519_0010_1012292BE9530A60"/>and commanded us to fight, but we told them we could not, for Chriſt and his apoſtles ſpake to the contrary; but they not regarding what we ſaid, hauled us about the deck to make us work, but we ſignified we could not on any ſuch account: now expecting our trials likely to increaſe, we thought it neceſſary to be conſtantly upon our watch both inwardly and outwardly, with ſtrong cries to the Lord that he would be near to ſupport us under our exerciſes; alſo we thought it not ſafe that both of us ſhould lie down together, ſo it happened on the 18th. of the month that Thomas Anthony being gone to lay down, I being uneaſy in my mind had a concern to go upon deck, for what reaſon I knew not at that time, but being faithful I went upon deck, and therein I found peace; upon which I went between decks again, but growing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy in my mind, a concern aroſe to go upon deck the ſecond time, and when there, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite eaſy; then fearing leſt I was out of my place I went down a third time, and growing very uneaſy, it was ſaid in the ſecret of my heart, thou knoweſt where to get relief; upon which I went the third time upon deck,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038519_0011_1012292D6E7D90C8"/>and being there ſome time, the lieutenant who was walking on the quarter deck, ſaid to the boatſwain who was on the main deck, have you made the Quaker work yet? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered no. The lieutenant aſked why? was anſwered, it is for want of your order; on which the lieutenant threw him his cane, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is my order, then the boatſwain took the cane and laid on my head with ſuch violence, that he beat my hat to pieces, on which the lieutenant ſaid, take him to the geers, and bring the cat and nine tails, at which time I was freely given up to ſuffer what they might be permitted to inflict on me; and being at the geers on my knees, it aroſe in my mind to pray for my perſecutors, for they knew not what they did; and if it pleaſed the Lord, to take me to himſelf from amongſt them, for their wicked converſation was a burden to my life; and indeed my life was not dear to me at that time, to lay down for truths teſtimony if required; but through the Lord's mercy they were not ſuffered to ſtrike me any more. Soon after the captain ſent for me and Thomas Anthony into the cabbin, where being come he talked much with us, and on ſeeing my hat he aſked how
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038519_0012_1012292EF35094D8"/>it came torn ſo, was anſwered it was done at the boatſwains pleaſure. There was the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of another man of war with him, who ſwore he would kill us, as ſoon as he would kill a Frenchman, with many ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The boatſwains mate ſeeing how I was uſed, took me by the ſhoulder, and aſked why I did not ſtay below decks as he would have me, adding you have been beat enough to kill an ox; which expreſſions of his ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome reſpect he had to me, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bad enough in his converſation; but the ſweet peace and ſatisfaction of mind, that I enjoyed in this time of my ſuffering, is ſcarce to be expreſſed in words, and far exceeded their ſhew of kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now there being upwards of twenty ſail of the Engliſh together at that time, in a few days they ſailed to Breſt, a place in France, to fight the French fleet, but they not coming out, and our fleet meeting with a ſtorm that ſeveral ſhips loſt their top maſts, we ſailed for England, and went into Torbay, and lay there three days, in which time I deſired the captain to ſet us at liberty; but he ſaid if we would work, we ſhould have our liberty, purpoſely as we thought to enſnare us; but
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038519_0013_10122930811BDBF8"/>through the Lord's mercy and goodneſs to us, we were preſerved from their ſnares, and found his pure peace and preſence, to be with us in a large manner, that in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of our ſufferings and trials, he was near, and in his comfortable preſence we did rejoice, that we were counted worthy to ſuffer for truth's teſtimony. The Sd. of the 5th. month we ſailed for Plymouth, but came not to an anchor: the captain went on ſhore, and we ſent a letter to a friend of ours at Plymouth, but received no anſwer. The next day we ſailed for Breſt again, being more than forty ſail in company, and the ſhip we were in, and another, went to the mouth of the harbour, and took a ſhip going in loaded with ſalt, and lay off from Uſhant waiting for the French fleet, until our hopes of getting clear from them was almoſt ſpent. At another time they ſent for me to make points for reefing the fails, which I refuſing to do, ſome mocked and ſcoffed, while others filled with envy and malice, could ſcarce keep their hands from me: and thus we paſſed through many deep exerciſes, looking every day when we ſhould receive ſtripes, and ſometimes could ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death before us, but the Lord
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038519_0014_101229340F01F6F8"/>wrought deliverance for us in his own way and time, beyond our expectation, and hath been near for our preſervation, bleſſed be his great name therefor.</p>
                  <p>The 14th. of this month we ſailed to Breſt to ſpy what ſhipping there was in the harbour, and we went ſo near in, that the French fired many guns at us from the caſtle. I and my companion Thomas Anthony ſat then between decks, not knowing how ſoon it might be our lots to be ſhot; my companion not being well at that time nor for ſeveral days before, the doctor ſent his mate in kindneſs to enquire if he wanted any thing he had that he ſhould have it, but he refuſed taking any thing from him, altho' he acknowledged his kindneſs. The 20th. of this month we ſailed for Breſt again, and being becalmed, we thought we muſt come to an anchor, which if we had it might have gone hard with us; but after ſome time there ſprang up a breeze of wind, and we got away from the French, and a few days after we ſailed for England again, and got into Plymouth harbour.</p>
                  <p>So on the 27th. of this month as ſoon as we came to an anchor, the captain ſent for us
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038519_0015_10122937009A8E68"/>into the cabbin, and being before him, he ſaid he would let us go on ſhore, to ſee our friends, and refreſh ourſelves, which he did: ſo being on ſhore, and it being meeting day we went to the meeting, although in a poor dirty condition by reaſon of our lying on board ſo long, and no cloaths to ſhift us, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been on board about ſix weeks. Friends were glad to ſee us on ſhore, and kindly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us into their houſes. The firſt friends houſe we went to was Henry Cane or Crane who was very kind to us, and provided things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us. And Daniel Zachary the owner of the veſſel we were preſſed out of, had wrote to a friend of Plymoth to take care of us when we came on ſhore, alſo a friend of London that was appointed by their mornings meeting, ſent a letter to a friend of his at Plymoth, to help us to what neceſſaries we ſtood in need of, and he would pay him again, which he did; alſo ſaid friend ſpoke to the captain twice about ſetting us at liberty. Since we were not men for his purpoſe, the captain ſaid he gave us leave to go on ſhore, but ſaid nothing of our coming on board again, ſaying he could not anſwer diſcharging us, becauſe he was under the command of the flag.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:038519_0016_101229390A7039D8"/>
So having well refreſhed ourſelves, and were provided with neceſſaries we travelled through ſeveral towns, as Exeter, Briſtol, Bath, and divers others, till we came to London, when there we lodged at our friend Thomas Lurtings, and having tarried near four weeks in London, alſo attended meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as they came in courſe pretty conſtantly. We got a paſſage to Philadelphia in a veſſel commanded by one Joſhua Guy, there were divers friends going in her, as John Salkeld and wife, with other paſſengers. About the 9th. of the 7th. month 1705, we left London, and the veſſel fell down to Deal, where my companion Thomas Anthony being taken ſick of the ſmall pox, he was put on ſhore at Deal.</p>

                  <p>I WAS preſſed in Scarborough-Piers, and refuſing to go on board the ketch, they beat me very ſore on the ſand, and I refuſing to go on board, they hoiſted me in with a tackle, on board of the ketch that preſſed for the ſhip called the Royal-Prince, and they bunch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with their feet, that I fell into a tub, and was ſo maimed, that they were forced to ſwaddle me up with cloths: from thence we ſailed into Bridlington-Bay, where Thomas Swailes and Mary Stranger hearing of me ſent me victuals on board the ketch; then we ſailed to the Buoy and Nore, where
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038519_0019_1012293FB8611B00"/>they haul'd me in at a gun-port, on board of the ſhip called the Royal-Prince. The <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> day of the third month they commanded me to go to work at the capſtane; I refuſed, and told them, that as I was not free to do the king's work, I would not live at his charge for vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals; then the boatſwain's mate beat me ſore, and thruſting me about with the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtane till he was weary. Then the Captain ſent for me upon the quarter-deck, and aſked me, why I refuſed to fight for the king, and why I refuſed to eat of his victuals? I told him, I was afraid to offend God, for my warfare was ſpiritual, therefore I durſt not fight with carnal weapons. Then he fell upon me and beat me with his ſmall cane, then called for his great cane, and beat me ſore, and felled me down to the deck three or four times, and beat me as long as his ſtrength continued. Then came one Thomas Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, (who was brought up at Eaſington) and ſaid, I pray you, noble captain, be merciful, for I know him to be an honeſt man, and a good man. Then ſaid the captain, he is a Quaker, I will beat his brains out; then falling on me again, he beat me till he was weary; then called ſome to help him, for, ſaid he, I am not able to beat him enough to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038519_0020_10122941C254BDA0"/>make him willing to do the king's ſervice. Then came out the commander's jeſter, and told the captain, he would lay a guinea with him that he would make me work, and haul the king's ropes, and told the captain he was a fool; ſo two guineas were thrown down upon the deck, then the jeſter called for two ſeamen, and made them make two-ropes faſt to the wriſts of my arms, and reeved the ropes through two blocks in the mizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrouds, on the ſtarboard-ſide, and hoiſted me up aloft, and made the ropes faſt to the gunnel of the ſhip, and I hung ſome time; then the jeſter called the ſhips company to behold, and bear him witneſs, that he made the Quaker haul the king's ropes; ſo veer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ropes, they lowered me half way down, then made me faſt again: now, ſaid the jeſter, noble captain, you and the company ſee that the Quaker hauleth the king's ropes, and with that he commanded them to let fly the ropes looſe, where I fell upon the deck: now ſaid the jeſter, noble captain the wager is won, he haul'd the ropes to the deck, and you can haul them no farther, nor any man elſe. Then the captain called the boatſwain's mate, and bid him take the Quakerly-dog away, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038519_0021_101229434FD39AF0"/>put him to the capſtane, and make him work, and beat him and ſpare him not. So the boatſwain's mate had me down to the geer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capſtane, and thruſt me about with the men at the capſtane, and beat me withal, when he could get time; then he went and ſat him down upon a cheſt-lid, and I went and ſat down upon another cheſt-lid beſide him, then he fell on me and beat me again, then called his boy to bring his two ſeizings, and he ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed my arms to the capſtane's bars, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the men to heave the capſtane about, and in three or four times paſſing about, the ſeizings were looſed, no man knew how, nor when, nor could they ever be found, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſought them with lighted candles; then the boatſwain's mate, ſeeing what was done, cauſed all the men to come from the capſtane, and took a bible, and commanded them all to ſwear, that they neither looſed me, nor knew how I came looſe, (they all being willing to ſwear) he then ſearched their pockets for the ſeizings, but could find none, ſo he let them go; then he called them all again to him, and ſaid, hear what I ſhall ſay to you; you ſee this is a wonderful thing, which is done by an inviſible hand, which looſed
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038519_0022_10122946ECE98B18"/>him, for none of you could ſee his hands looſed, that were ſo near him: I ſuppoſe this man, ſaid he, is called a Quaker, and for conſcience-ſake refuſeth to act, therefore I am afflicted, and do promiſe before God and man, that I will never beat, nor cauſe to be beaten, either Quaker, or any other man that doth refuſe for conſcience-ſake to act for the king; if I do, I wiſh I may loſe my right hand.</p>
                  <p>Then on the third day came the admiral, Sir Edward Spragg, on board of his own ſhip, called the Royal-Prince, and hearing of a man that was preſſed on board, that was called a Quaker; alſo hearing that the boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain's mate had beaten me much, and had given me over, and had denied to beat me any more, he was therefore called to come before the admiral, to anſwer for himſelf, why he would not beat the Quaker? he ſaid, I have beat him very ſore, and I ſeized his arms to the capſtane's bars, and forced them to heave him about, and beat him, and then ſat down, and in three or four times of the capſtanes going about, the ſeizings were looſed, and he came and ſat down by me;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038519_0023_101229487376E188"/>then I called the men from the capſtane, and took them ſworn, whether they had looſed him or no, but they all denied that they either looſed him, or knew by what means he was looſed, neither could the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ever be found; therefore I did, and do believe that it was an inviſible power that ſet him at liberty, and I did promiſe before God and the company, that I would never beat a Quaker again, nor any man elſe for conſcience ſake. The admiral told him, he muſt loſe his cane: he willingly yielded it, and told him, he muſt alſo loſe his place: he was willing. He alſo told him, he muſt loſe his right hand: he held it out and ſaid, take it from me if you pleaſe. So they took his cane from him, and diſplaced him. So the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander gave order to the ſeven yeomen, to beat me where ever they met me, for ſeven days and nights, and make me work: they being called to an account, what they had made me do? told the commander that they were weary, and could not make me work, ſo they deſired to be excuſed. Then the eighth yeoman was called, who promiſed he would beat me, and make me work; and he did beat me for a day and a night, when he met with me, and he being weary, he deſired
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038519_0024_1012294B465598E8"/>to be excuſed. Then the commander ſent for me upon the quarter-deck before him, and cauſed my clothes to be ſtript off, ſhirt and all, from my waiſt downward, then he took a view of my body to ſee what wounds and bruiſes I had, but he could find none, no not ſo much as a blue ſpot on my ſkin. Then the commander was angry with them for not beating me enough: then captain Fowler anſwered him and ſaid, I have beat him myſelf as much as would have killed an ox. The jeſter ſaid, he had me hung a great while by my arms up aloft in the ſhrouds. The men ſaid, they had alſo beat me very fore, and they might as well beat the main-maſt. Then ſaid the commander, I will cauſe irons to be laid upon him during the king's pleaſure and mine. Then the boatſwain was called, and commanded to call the ſhip's company together, and make ready the irons: the commander Sir Edward Spragg, ſaid, you gentlemen ſailors and ſoldiers, whoſoever ſerves here under me for the king, on board his Majeſty's ſhip called the Royal-Prince, the admiral of the blue, you are to take notice, that there is a man on board called a quaker, he is to be laid in irons during the king's pleaſure and mine, for refuſing to fight and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038519_0025_1012294D5BDEB078"/>eat the king's victuals, therefore I charge you all and every man, that none of you give or ſell him any victuals, meat, drink, or water, for if you do, you ſhall have the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he hath. So this being called three times over, he commanded the boatſwain to take me away and put me in irons. So I being kept in irons ſix days and nights, and falling ſick of a fever, I grew very weak, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that when I was ſet out to caſe myſelf, (which was but once in twenty four hours) I could neither ſtand nor go: ſo the officers that let me out, called ſome of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to carry me into the ſhip's head to eaſe myſelf, and bring me back again to the irons. Then the officer took pity of me, and bid me lay down upon the bilboes that night, and he would hap me with a coverlid, ſo I lay there that night, and next day till evening; then the officer deſired me to go by the way a little, ſeeing all was quiet, and ſee if I could get a little reſt: ſo I being lame of a leg with the irons, was creeping over the larboard ſide of the ſhip, the lieutenant coming down, ſaid, thou damn'd rogue, (and many other wicked words) haſt thou broken the irons? and with that drew his rapier, and ſwore
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038519_0026_1012294F93C612A0"/>he would ſtab me, and ſo drove me back again to the irons, and called the yeomen, and would have known who let me out, and he ſhould be puniſhed, and I would not tell him; but the ſame yeoman came in the crowd, and I put my hand out to him, and he locked it, and none knew how: I then being the king's priſoner, I bid them begone, they had nothing to do with me: ſo I remained in irons ſix days more, and recovered very well of my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: then on the ſeventh day at night, ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, all ſeamen, fell to drinking of brandy, and playing at cards, and became very loud, the boatſwain's mate hearing of them, came down, and deſired them to leave off; they being full of drink, would not, ſo a quarrel aroſe, and the boatſwain's mate cried out murder, and immediately there came aſſiſtance to him, but the men ran away and hid themſelves, only two were taken, and put in irons with me.</p>
                  <p>"Now I ſhall ſpeak a little of the carpenter's mate's Lindneſs to me; when I had been in irons ſome days, and my food being taken from me, which was three day's victuals, that I had left of that which Thomas Swales
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038519_0027_10122951A049DA98"/>and Mary Stranger ſent me in Bridlington bay, he came in the crowd, and joined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo near me, that he gave me ſome meat &amp;c. ſo privately as not to be known to any others; and told me he would ſupply me daily; for, ſaid he, I have meat of my own, which is not at the king's charge; and ſaid further, that he had a ſtrict charge given him by his wife and his mother, before he came on board, that if any Quaker came on board with him, he ſhould be kind to him; and that he had lately received a letter from them, wherein they charged him to remember his promiſe, and be kind to the Quakers, if any were on board: but there being ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more than ordinary, he was taken off on board, and I had nothing for three days and three nights, and the two men before ſpoken of, that where in irons with me, while the commander was with us, the men would lie no where but upon me, and as ſoon as he was gone, they laid off me, and gave me brandy to drink, and promiſed they would not hurt me: then the lieutenant came at the middle of the night, and found them lying upon me, he aſked why they did lie upon me? they
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038519_0028_1012295325B5FDE0"/>ſaid, you would have him kill'd, ſo now we will kill him for you; then he came down the third time in the morning, and found them lying upon me, for they ſet one to watch his coming, and he found them lying very cloſe upon me, ſo that he could ſee nothing but my feet, I being ſo preſſed and weak, that he could ſcarce hear my voice.</p>
                  <p>Then the lieutenant went to Sir Edward's cabbin door, and knocked; the boy anſwered, who was there? he told him, it was the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant who would ſpeak to Sir Edward, for there had been a mutiny in the ſhip by ſome men playing at cards, and they had beat the boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wain's mate: he told him, he ſhould have laid them in irons, and not called on him. He ſaid, they are already in the bilboes. He alſo ſaid, if it pleaſe your highneſs Sir Edward, to remember, that there is a poor Quaker in yet, that was laid in two weeks ſince, and they will lie no where but upon him, and they will kill him for us. He bid him go to the yeomen that had the keys, and take him out of the bilboes, and put up a flag at the mizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt's head and call a council of war;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038519_0029_10122957256D8B00"/>which was done: then the captains of the other ſhips all came on board to anſwer the council of war, before eight o'clock in the morning, (it being the firſt day of the week) ſo I being brought before the council of war, the commander aſked me, if I would go on board of an hoy that was a tender, and had ſix guns? I refuſed, and deſired to ſtay on board, and bear the puniſhment that I had to abide. Then he bid the council of war go on with their buſineſs; ſo they did proceed, and I being ſet on a bulk head, being ſo lame with the irons that I could not ſtand, and hearing them paſs ſentence of condemnation upon me. The judge was a Papiſt, being govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of Dover caſtle, and went to ſea on plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. So they could not tell at preſent what death to put me to; the judge ſaid, I ſhould be put into a barrel or caſk driven full of nails with their points inwards, and ſo roll'd to death. But the council of war taking it into conſideration, thought it too terrible a death, and too much unchriſtian-like, ſo they agreed to hang me: and I hearing them ſpeak ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things againſt me, which I was clear of, had a deſire to ariſe from my knees where I was ſet to anſwer for myſelf, but I had not
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038519_0030_10122958AC35B020"/>any power to ariſe or open my mouth, but was condemned within myſelf, inſomuch that I had not power to breathe unto God; prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to riſe again the ſecond time, there came a motion within me, and bid me be ſtill, be ſtill, be ſtill, three times, which I obeyed and was comforted; then I believed God would ariſe: and when they had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then God did ariſe, and I was filled with the power of God, and my ſpirit lifted up above all earthly things, and wonderful ſtrength was given me to my limbs, and my heart full of the power and wiſdom of God, and with glad tidings my mouth was opened to declare to the people the things which God had made manifeſt to me: with ſweat run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down, and tears trickling from my eyes, I told them, "the hearts of kings were in the hand of the Lord, and ſo are both yours and mine, and I do not value what you can do to this body, for I am at peace with God and all men, and you my adverſaries; for if I might have an hundred and thirty years longer, I can never die in a better condition, for the Lord hath ſatisfied me, that he hath forgiven me all things in this world, and I am glad through his mercy, that he hath made me
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038519_0031_1012295AEE4156D0"/>willing to ſuffer for his name's ſake; and not only ſo, but I am heartily glad, and do really rejoice, and with a ſeal in my heart to the ſame." Then there came a man and laid his hand upon my ſhoulder, and ſaid, where are all thy accuſers? then my eyes were opened, and I looked about me, and they were all gone; and one ſaid there goeth thy chief friend, the judge: then it aroſe in my heart, that I had news for him from the power of God, and I ſaid, man come back, I have news for thee better than ever thou heardeſt in any coffee-houſe, or elſewhere; and anſwer for what thou haſt done. Then came a lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and ſaid, Sir. Edward, this is an hypocrite Quaker. I ſaid, commander, I entreat thee to look upon me a little, ſo I looſed my knee-ſtring and put down my ſtockings, and let him ſee how the blood and rotten ſtuff ran down my leg round about; he ſaid, put up thy ſtocking, there is enough. Then preſently came an antient ſoldier, and looſed down his knee-ſtrings, and put down his ſtockings, put his cap under his knees, and begged his pardon three times: then ſaid he, ariſe up ſoldier, and ſpeak, and he intreated him and ſaid, "noble Sir Edward,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:038519_0032_1012295C82FDAFA0"/>you know that I have ſerved his majeſty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you many years, both in this nation and other nations by the ſea, and you were always a merciful man; therefore I do intreat you in all kindneſs, to be merciful to this poor man, who is condemned to die to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and only for denying your order, for fear of offending God, and for conſcience ſake; and we have but one man on board out of nine hundred and fifty, but one which doth refuſe for conſcience-ſake, and ſhall we take his life away? nay, God forbid: for he hath already declared, that if we take his life away, there ſhall a judgment appear upon ſome on board within eight and forty hours, and to me it hath appeared, therefore I am forced to come upon the quarter-deck before you, and my ſpirit is one with his; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire you in all kindneſs, when you take his life away, to give me the liberty to go off on board, for I ſhall not be willing to ſerve his majeſty longer on board of ſhip: ſo I do intreat you once more, to be merciful to this poor man: ſo God bleſs you, Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I have no more to ſay to you."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="unknown:038519_0033_1012295FA633DC88"/>
Then came the chief gunner, that had been a captain, and looſed down his knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings, and did beg his pardon three times, being upon his bare knees before Sir Edward: then he ſaid, ariſe up gunner and ſpeak. So he ſaid. "if it pleaſe your worſhip, Sir Edward, we know you are a merciful man, and therefore I intreat you in all kindneſs, to be merciful to this poor man, in whom there remains ſomething more than fleſh and blood, therefore I intreat you, let us not deſtroy that which is alive, neither endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do it: and ſo God bleſs you Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I have no more to ſay to you." Then he went away. Then the commander deſired me to go down and take my leave of my friends (this day) that were on board; ſo he gave orders, that any that had a mind to give me victuals might, and that I might eat and drink with whom I pleaſed, and that none ſhould moleſt me that day. Then came the lieutenant, and ſat down by me while they were at their worſhip, and he would have given me brandy, but I refuſed: then the dinner came up to be ſerved, and ſeveral gave me victuals to eat, and I did eat freely, and was kindly entertained that day; then
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:038519_0034_101229628D0D8998"/>the night being come, a man kindly proffered me his hammock to lie in that night, becauſe I had lain long in irons, and I accepted of his kindneſs, and laid me down, and ſlept well that night. The next morning being come, it being the ſecond day of the week, on which I was to be executed, about eight of the clock in the morning, the rope being reeved upon the mizen-yard's arm, and the boy ready to turn me off, and boats having come on board with captains of other ſhips that were of the council of war, who came on purpoſe to ſee me executed; I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon called to come to be executed, then I coming to the execution place, the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſked the council, how their judgment did ſtand? ſo moſt of them did conſent, and ſome of them were ſilent. Then he deſired me freely to ſpeak my mind, if I had any thing to ſay before I was executed: I told him, I had little at preſent to ſpeak. So there came a man and bid me go forward to be executed, ſo I ſtepped upon the gunnel to go towards the rope; the commander bid me ſtop there if I had any thing to ſay. Then ſpake the judge, and ſaid, Sir Edward is a merciful man, that puts that heretick to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:038519_0035_1012296411761F90"/>no worſe death than hanging. Sir Edward turned him about to the judge, and ſaid, what ſaidſt thou? I ſay, replied he, you are a merciful man, that puts him to no worſe death than hanging. But, ſaid he, what is the other word that thou ſaidſt, that heretick: I ſay, ſaid the commander, he is more a chriſtian than thyſelf; for I do believe thou wouldſt hang me, if it were in thy power. Then ſaid the commander unto me, "come down again, I will not hurt an hair of thine head, for I cannot make one hair grow." Then he cried, ſilence all men, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it three times over, that "if any man or men on board of the ſhip would come and give evidence, that I had done any thing that I had deſerved death for, I ſhould have it, provided they were credible perſons." But no body came, neither opened a mouth againſt me then. So he cried again, ſilence all men, and hear me ſpeak: then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that the Quaker was as free a man as any on board the ſhip was. So the men heaved up their hats, and with a loud voice cried, God bleſs Sir Edward, he is a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man: the ſhrouds, the tops, and decks
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:038519_0036_101229668EDB6FB0"/>being full of men, ſeveral of their hats flew over board and were loſt.</p>
                  <p>Then I had great kindneſs ſhewn me by all men on board, but the great kindneſs of the Lord exceeded all, for the day I was condemned to die on, was the moſt joyful day that ever I had in my life-time, and ſo remained exceeding joyful, until the very time that I was proclaimed a free man. But ſoon after troubles came upon me again, for I being laid upon the deck one night, as it was my uſual lodging-place, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared to me, and ſtruck me as it were dead, and I being in great dread and fear, believed our ſhip was to engage ſuch a day of the month, with the wind at ſouth eaſt, then appeared alſo a ſmall cloud to me about as big as an hat; after being engaged, the ſame cloud ſpread and became a great one, inſomuch that it darkened part of the ſhip, then I ſtepped over on the ſtarboard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the ſhip, into the ſhrouds, and looked aft, and I ſaw a thick water ariſing in the wake of the rudder, then I feared the ſhip was near ground. This appeared to me three times that night, and I would gladly have put it from me, but I could not: then
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:038519_0037_1012296996E004A0"/>I did believe, and was ſatisfied of the truth of it, then I was at peace and quiet in my own mind, but then I was to make it known to the pilot, and I did believe it was death by law to diſcourage them: ſo I thought, then I ſhould give them an occaſion that they ſhould take away my life; but I could not reſt, eat, drink, or ſleep, until I had declared it; ſo I breathed unto God, and deſired that he would find me a way to reveal it, ſo it remaining with me two days and two nights, and being walking upon the deck, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of the chief gunner of the ſhip, I was ordered to go to him, and walk with him; very ſolitary were both of us, and he perceived I had ſomething to ſay to him, of ſome weighty matter, ſo he deſired me to ſpeak my mind to him, and I told him, I had ſuch a weighty matter to declare, that it was death by the law to declare it, I deſired that he would ſtand true to me in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and he promiſed me fidelity in the preſence of God, before whom we were: that he would be true to me in all reſpects, and if one ſuffered, both ſhould ſuffer. Then we eſpied the mate of the ſhip walking, he being a ſober man, we drew near to him, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:038519_0038_1012296C0B8DF648"/>he perceived we were both afflicted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what was the matter? ſo we told him, we had a weighty matter, and if he would be as faithful to us, as we were one to another, we would declare it to him: ſo he promiſed to be faithful to us, for he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it did concern him: then we told him the matter, and he was fully ſatisfied of the truth of it; but ſaid he, it doth belong moſt of all to the pilot; ſo we muſt ſpeak to him, and he being ſuch a brittle, high-ſpirited man, we ſcarce knew how to ſpeak to him, but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to us, and walking with him, he took notice of our heavineſs, and aſked our buſineſs with him; we told him, we had a matter to declare to him of great concern, therefore we deſired him to be faithful to us, and we would declare the matter to him, and he promiſed to be as faithful to us, as he ſuppoſed we were to one another: ſo they told him the matter, then he aſked, who ſaw it? I told him, I ſaw it. Then he fell into a rage, and ſeemed to fly from his promiſe, and ſaid, he would go and tell the commander, ſo away he went, and ſaid, he would have me executed ſpeedily: I ſaid, let him go, better I die, than the whole company periſh; but they ſaid if thou die, we will all die. Then he
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:038519_0039_10122BC31BDC89B0"/>came to us again near weeping, and told us that when he came before the commander, his mouth was ſtopt, that he could not ſpeak a word good or bad: he was very tender, and praiſed God that he had ſuch a meſſenger. Then he took me by the hand, and deſired me to tell him the name of the ſand, I told him I did not know, I never came there, but at that time I looked up with my eyes, and told him where-abouts the ſand laid; ſo he deſired me to go to the compaſs, and he aſked me, if I knew the compaſs; I told him, very well; ſo I ſhewed him upon what point of the compaſs the ſaid ſand laid, and he took a book out of his pocket, and found the ſand, and the name of it. Some days after we were engaged on that very point with the Hollanders, and as ſoon as we were engaged; the cloud appeared to me, and came and darkened the ſhip, then I ſtept into the main-ſhrouds, and I ſaw the thick water, then I ſhewed the pilot it, and he called two of the beſt men to the lead, they cried five fathom and a quarter; then the pilot cried, ſtarboard your helm; then the commander cried, larboard your helm, and bring her too: the pilot ſaid, he would bring the king's ſhip no nearer, he would give over his charge: the commander cried, bring her
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:038519_0040_1012287D52B47B90"/>too. The pilot cried to the leadmen, ſing aloud that Sir Edward may hear, (for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry was very great amongſt the officers and ſeamen, becauſe the ſhip was ſo near a-ground, and the enemies upon them) ſo they cried a quarter leſs five: the commander cried, we ſhall have our Royal Prince on ground, take up your charge pilot. Then he cried hard, ſtarboard your helm, and ſee how our ſhip will veer; ſo ſhe did bear round up: the men at the lead cried, five fathom and a better depth; then the commander cried, God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Royal Prince: then the pilot cried, be of good cheer, commander: they cried ſix fathom, then nine fathom, then fifteen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, then ſixteen fathom. The Hollanders then ſhouted, and cried, Sir Edward runs. Then he cried, bring her too again, and the fight continued till the middle of the day was over, and it fell calm: and the ſhips being engaged on head of us, we could ſee nothing but fire and ſmoke; ſo out of that ſmoke I eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fire-ſhip deſigned to lay us on board of the larboard-bow: then I cried to the chief gunner to come to me quickly, and I ſhewed him the fire-ſhip coming to board us on the larboard-bow: then he fired a chaſe gun with a ball in her, and as ſoon as the ſmoke was gone from the gun, we eſpied the fire-ſhip all
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:038519_0041_10122BC71663D3A8"/>on a fire, blown up, and what remained of her ſallied on board of the cambridge, and only burned her enſign. The fight continued, and my employ was to carry down the wounded men, and look out for fire-ſhips, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was mightily pleaſed with my ſervice, and ſaid, it would have been a great pity that my life ſhould have been taken away before the engagement, and the chief gunner ſaid, I was inſtrumental, through mercy, not only for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of the ſhip coming on ground upon the ſand, but alſo for preventing of the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that was near to board us, who gave me the firſt notice, whereof I am witneſs. And the lieutenant ſaid to the commander, that there was not a more undaunted man on board except his highneſs.</p>
                  <p>Eight days after, we were engaged again with the Hollanders, and the officers ſent for me upon the quarter-deck, and aſked me what I would do that day? I told them I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do as I had done before: they deſired I would do that ſervice, and take that care upon me, only to look out for fire-ſhips coming on board; I told them, I was free to do it, likewiſe to carry down the wounded men if there were occaſion; ſo preſently we engaged, but not one fire-ſhip troubled us that day, but we loſt about two hundred men. The lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:038519_0042_10122BC9F8A140E0"/>meeting me, he aſked me, if I had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any wounds? I told him, I had received none, but was well. He aſked me, how came I to be ſo bloody? then I told him, it was with carrying down wounded men. So he took me in his arms, and kiſſed me, and that was the ſame lieutenant that perſecuted me ſo with irons at the firſt. Then we came to the Buoy and Nore again, and then went up near Chatham, and the king coming on board, the lieutenant deſired me to go and walk upon the deck, with him in ſight of the king, that haply ſome might give him notice of me, hoping I might be brought to a trial, and have my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; but I did not underſtand that he had any intelligence of me. The next day the ſame lieutenant came to me, and deſired me to walk along with him upon the quarter-deck: I being ſomewhat unwilling, told him, I did not uſe to go upon the quarter-deck, unleſs I was called by the officers: he ſaid, my uncle hath much buſineſs, and doth forget you, ſo walk along with me, I deſire you: and I did as he deſired me, and he being with me, walked away and left me alone; the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being there, and ſeveral captains with him, he came from his company to me, and laid his hand upon my head and ſaid, "thou laſt done well, and very well too:" ſo he w<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ked by me
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:038519_0043_10122BCB8AB75110"/>and I bluſhed; then he aſked me, why I bluſhed? I told him I deſired to know wherein I had done ſo well: he ſaid, by encouraging them which ſhould have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged both thee and me. Then ſaid he, thou ſhalt have thy liberty to go on ſhore. I aſked him, if I might go on ſhore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit, or go to my own being? he ſaid, I ſhould chuſe whether I would. I told him I had rather go to my own Being: he ſaid I ſhould do ſo. Then I told him, there was one thing that I requeſted of him yet, that he would be pleaſed to give me a certificate under his hand, to certify that I am not run away: he ſaid, thou ſhalt have one to keep thee clear at home, and alſo in thy fiſhing; for he knew I was a fiſherman. So he called the captain, and ordered him to write me a certificate, and bring it to him; which he did with ſpeed, but he did not like it, but ſlung it him again, and ordered him to make him one more legible; then he brought ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſigned it and gave it me, and wiſhed me well, and ſaid, he deſired to hear from me if I got well home, and I told him. I would ſend him a letter, and ſo I did: but ſoon after I got into London, two preſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crews came to me, and ſaid, this is Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:038519_0044_10122BCDE694C520"/>Quaker; you are welcome to ſhore, will you pleaſe to go to the tavern with us? I told them I would not go, nor drink any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; then they wiſhed me well home.</p>
                  <p>Alſo they proffered me my pay, before I came off on board, and ſaid, I deſerved it as well as any man on board; but I refuſed, and told them, I had of my own, that I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped would ſerve me home. And the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was troubled becauſe I would take nothing; he would have given me twenty ſhillings, but I would not take it.</p>
                  <p>Thus ends the <hi>remarkable narrative</hi> of the ſufferings of this faithful ſailor, who rather than violate his conſcience by being inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to deſtroy other men's lives, endured with much patience many and ſore trials, perſevering faithful in his teſtimony againſt war and fighting, even near to death; to which he was wholly reſigned, and from which he was preſerved by a ſingular providence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him, in thoſe moments of time which he thought would have been his laſt. But the virulence of the Popiſh judge againſt him as an Heretic, gave the commander, Sir Edward Spragg, who profeſſed himſelf a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:038519_0045_10122BCFA5F9E4B0"/>Proteſtant, ſuch diſguſt, that ſcorning to be made a tool to execute the vengeance of a Papiſt in this caſe, he delivered the innocent man from the death he was condenmed to: Being thus preſerved alive, he was made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to the ſaving of the ſhip, and the lives of many therein: and by the exerciſe of an undaunted Chriſtian courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, triumphed over the malice of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who, conſcious of his innocence, at length became his friends and favourers.</p>
