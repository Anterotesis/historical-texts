            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SOLOMON</hi> obſerves that many are the devices of a man's heart, but the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand. Many have been the devices of men's hearts and heads, againſt chriſtianity. From its youth up have they fought againſt it; but it is the counſel of the Lord, and therefore has hitherto ſtood, and if there be any truth in the divine promiſes, it will forever maintain its ground. This is an age when the love and practice of true religion is greatly on the decline, when iniquity abounds, and when infidelity raiſes her infernal head, and refuſes to be aſhamed. There are many who boldly profeſs their diſbelief of a divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and employ all their wit and ingenuity in order to exhibit the moſt important doctrines of our holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in a ridiculous point of view. Perſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f ſuch depraved minds, examine the Scriptures as it were with a microſcope, which confines them to ſome ſingle point, but does not enable them to contemplate the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſiſtency of the whole, or to perceive the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which each part has to another. Nay, ſome of our modern infidels are ſo daring and preſumptuous
<pb facs="unknown:028262_0003_0FD7DAB3EF661FF0"/>as to condemn the whole ſyſtem of divine revelation as a cunningly deviſed fable, declaring at the ſame time, that the Bible is a book with which they are very little acquainted. But every good man can ſay from his own experience, that the more he examines the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with an humble, an honeſt, and unprejudiced mind, and with a ſincere deſire to attain the knowledge of the truth, the more he will admire them. For they are like thoſe perſons whom an intimate acquaintance endears more and more, whatever prejudices we might at firſt ſight have conceived againſt them. He will find that they afford as much light as our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſtands in need of, and much more than we could poſſibly attain, by the exerciſe of our unaſſiſted faculties. The Bible is a book which takes in a vaſt extent of time. It begins with the creation of the world, and the formation of man, and ends in eternity, with the laſt judgment and the conſummation of all things. And yet, through all this variety of diſpenſations there is one chain, and regular ſeries of well connected events. And is it not highly proper, that chriſtians ſhould be firmly eſtabliſhed in the ſaith of theſe important truths, and be able to give a good reaſon for the hope that is in them: eſpecially at a period when the emiſſaries of Satan are employing every engine to undermine the grounds of our holy religion. But from what ſource does infidelity ſpring? The anſwer is obvious; it proceeds from the depravity of the human heart. When our hearts are deceitful, when our lives are immoral, we wiſh to baniſh from our minds the idea of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judge of all the earth, who will render unto every one according to his works. And it is not very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for us to perſuade ourſelves into the belief of what we earneſtly wiſh to be true. And il has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerved, that the more vicious the age, the more has infidelity gained ground. This was the caſe in ancient Greece and Rome, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en the ſenſeleſs ſyſtem of Epicurus was patroniſed by many of much
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:028262_0004_0FD7DAB575A1A128"/>greater and more eminent abilities, than any that now eſpouſe infidelity. This was alſo the caſe in Judea, when the ſect of the Sadducees prevailed. But perhaps ſome may be ready to ſay, that the great number of deiſtical books, which have been lately written in this country, and alſo imported from Europe, has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great degeneracy of the preſent age. But the truth is, it is the almoſt total depravity of ſentiment in matters of religion, to which bad writers will be always ready to accommodate themſelves, which has occaſioned thoſe infidel writings, which are ſo carefully circulated and ſo eagerly read by thoſe who deny the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And is it not high time for the friends of Jeſus to exert themſelves in his ſervice, and to employ every mean in their power, for the ſupport of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And is not this the time, when men of piety, and learning, and abilities, ought to employ their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, in the defence of that goſpel, upon which our everlaſting all depends. Many publications have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the preſent age, which ſeem to be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly calculated to anſwer this purpoſe. Some of theſe, however valuable in themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e but little known. This is the caſe with the volume which is now offered to the public, and it is hoped that it will be peculiarly ſeaſonable at this time, when our modern deiſts are ſo exceedingly zealous in ſupporting and propagating the unhappy cauſe they have the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to eſpouſe. If theſe ſermons are read with an unbiaſſed mind, I doubt not but they will be read with great advantage, which will certainly be the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way of praiſing and recommending them. The Almighty who is wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working, can eaſily bring good out of evil. We ſeem to be ſunk into a fatal indolence and inſenſibility with regard to the great objects of religion, and ſome ſignal judgments, ſome extraordinary manifeſtations of the divine diſpleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That theſe awful calamities may be prevented, may the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great king and head of the church, by his bleſſed ſpirit, render theſe diſcourſes effectual for rebuke, for correction, and for inſtruction in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>

            <p>THERE has been a mighty controverſy in the world about fundamentals in religion, points abſolutely neceſſary to be believed by all chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; how many ſuch there are, and which they are. Now without entering into that debate, I take it for granted the ſubject before us, (the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine original of the Bible) muſt be reckoned in the number of fundamentals. It is certainly a thing of the laſt importance to be well inſtructed in this matter. I have therefore thought fit to give you a few diſcourſes upon the inſpiration, and great uſefulneſs of the ſcriptures. I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore treated upon this ſubject; but finding that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of you deſire a fuller account of theſe things, I have determined to reſume the point, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the plan and ſcheme; that I may take in the main matters that concern this important doctrine,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028262_0007_0FD7DABDF8483BD0"/>the eſtabliſhing and vindicating the authority of the Bible: which I reckon the more ſeaſonable in regard of the peculiar oppoſition it meets with at this time. To this purpoſe, I ſhall conſider the words I have read, <hi>All ſcripture is given by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> Where we have two things obſervable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have here aſſerted the divine original and authority of the ſcriptures. <hi>All ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God.</hi> That the apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers immediately to the ſcriptures of the <hi>Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament</hi> cannot be queſtioned. For, not to ſay the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was not (all of it) then written, he ſpeaks of the ſcriptures that <hi>Timothy</hi> had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the knowledge of, <hi>from a child thou haſt known the holy ſcriptures,</hi> which could be no other than the ſcriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> But whereas he affirms, that <hi>all ſcriptures were given by inſpiration of God;</hi> and it is probable ſeveral books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> might then be written, theſe muſt be included in the general expreſſion. Beſides, when he mentions <hi>Timothy's</hi> knowledge of the holy ſcriptures, and takes notice of their ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency <hi>to make wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> he adds, <hi>through faith in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> which ſeems to lead us to the <hi>goſpel,</hi> where we have the fulleſt and cleareſt revelation of him.</p>
            <p>And indeed, whatever evidence the <hi>Jews</hi> had of their canons being divine and given by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have the ſame, and greater, for the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ours. If the ſcriptures of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were <hi>by inſpiration of God,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are certainly no leſs ſo; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, we may retain the apoſtle's general term, including the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e canon or all the books of the Old and New Teſtament, and ſay, that <hi>all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:028262_0008_0FD7DABF4BFBFE40"/>
2. We have the uſefulneſs of theſe inſpired wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings aſſerted here, They <hi>are profitable,</hi> ſays the text, <hi>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> The meaning of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral phraſes I ſhall enquire into afterwards, and ſhew how the ſcripture is uſeful for all theſe purpoſes.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, two propoſitions very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally offer themſelves from hence; which I ſhall lay down as the foundation of what I deſign upon this ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) That <hi>all ſcripture,</hi> or all the writings of the Old and New Teſtament, <hi>were given by inſpiration of God.</hi> And</item>
               <item>(2.) That the ſcriptures, or the ſeveral books and parts of the <hi>Bible,</hi> are of great uſe and ſervice to the church. Particularly, they <hi>are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe, namely, that the ſcriptures, all the books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament, were given by inſpiration of God.</hi> This is a point of great conſequence, among the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the chriſtian religion, as I ſaid before; and therefore I ſhall now take occaſion to conſider it pretty fully. To moſt of you, I doubt not, what will be ſaid will be wholly new, and others may find advantage in a review of the ſubject, as it tends to refreſh their memories, confirm their faith, and improve their joy.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this obſervation, I ſhall,
<list>
                  <item>(1.) give ſome account of the inſpiration of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</item>
                  <item>(2.) Shew how it muſt be underſtood, that <hi>all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God.</hi> And then,</item>
                  <item>(3.) prove the divine inſpiration of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or, as we commonly expreſs it, that the Bible or ſcriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are the word of God.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028262_0009_0FD7DAC1D623C538"/>
I. I ſhall give ſome ſhort account of the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the holy ſcriptures: the ſubject is too <hi>copious,</hi> and it may be too <hi>curious,</hi> to be handled largely here, and is fitter for the <hi>preſs</hi> than the <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</hi> However, I ſhall mention a few particulars for explaining it, as far as ſuch a diſcourſe will allow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſuppoſe divine revelation lay in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, immediate, ſenſible intercourſe that the inſpiring ſpirit, from whence the afflatus or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration proceeded, had with the minds of thoſe that were inſpired: in making impreſſion or motion on the imagination, and thereby conveying ſuch and ſuch things to the mind of the perſon concerned. When we converſe with one another by words, a vibration or peculiar kind of motion is made in the air, which ſtrikes the ear of the perſon, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a motion in the brain, whereby thoughts and ideas are excited, or our thoughts tranſmitted to the mind of him we ſpeak to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now when God inſpires any he makes ſuch impreſſions upon, or motions in the brain immediately, and ſo tranſmits his mind and will to the perſon he inſpires. Indeed this is not eaſily apprehended by us; nor is it eaſy to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how my ſpeaking to you, conveys ſuch or ſuch ideas to your minds. But as we are ſure this is poſſible and fact, the other certainly may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed equally poſſible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that were inſpired knew as certainly that they were ſo and that it was from God that they received the impreſſions, as you know that I am now ſpeaking to you. I grant this is not eaſy to be conceived or explained by others, (as I have already ſaid.) But thoſe concerned in it had ſuch a ſenſible aſſurance that it was God who ſpake to them, as leſt them free from all ſuſpicion of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is manifeſt in the caſe of <hi>Abraham.</hi> He heard a voice from Heaven, which bid him <hi>take</hi> his <hi>ſon, his only ſon, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028262_0010_0FD7DAC3E7C457F8"/>the land of</hi> Moriah <hi>and there offer him up for a burnt-offering.</hi> A command ſo ſurpriſing and ſtartling, in regard to the matter of it, that had he not had the utmoſt aſſurance it was from God, he would have abhorred the motion. There was ſomething in the manner of the inſpiration, that carried its own evidence along with it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The inſpired were not only aſſured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own inſpiration, but were enabled to give ſatisfaction to others concerning that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They felt, and certainly knew, they were inſpired; and could evidence it to others. How the ancient prophets proved their commiſſion, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and inſpiration, I muſt not now enquire; only I would hint in ſhort, that there were three ways, among others, of proving this, viz. by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miracles, by foretelling things to come, things that came to paſs afterwards, and by the teſtimony of known allowed prophets. When God ſent any to make a new revelation, they did not expect men ſhould believe them upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their own mere word, but they produced their credentials, <hi>the works they did teſtified concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them, as Chriſt ſpeaks in his own caſe. Thus we read that God <hi>bore Wilneſs</hi> to the apoſtles <hi>with ſigns, wonders and diverſe miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This teſtimony often attended the doctrine of inſpired perſons, and always it may be, when they delivered a new doctrine to the world. In other caſes, when they were only ſent to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

4. The inſpiring ſpirit did not act and influence all that were inſpired in one and the ſame manner, but variouſly. This the apoſtle hints at <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 1. <hi>God who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

In ſhort, God ſometimes ſpake to their outward ſenſes when awake, and ſometimes to their more inward ſenſes, as I may ſay in dreams and extacies, the mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill informed concerning the meaning of ſuch repreſentations in both caſes. Again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. As the ſpirit communicated himſelf to them in different ways, ſo there was a difference in the kind or degree of inſpiration. And here to paſs over other leſs material diſtinctions, I ſhall take notice of that common and well known one, into an inſpiration of ſuggeſtion, and an inſpiration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>There was an inſpiration of ſuggeſtion; which was, when the whole matter that this or that inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon was to publiſh to the world, whether by word or writing, was revealed to him <hi>de Novo,</hi> and entirely communicated to him from above. Many of the writers of the Holy Scripture had ſuch an inſpiration as I now refer to, an inſpiration of ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. The ancient prophets had it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. They had it alſo in their prophecies concerning the riſe and fall of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our monarchies, and in foretelling many other events relating to the church and the world; and no doubt in deſcribing many paſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028262_0012_0FD7DAC6E0D672C8"/>events. So Moſes, in giving the hiſtory of the creation, may well be ſuppoſed to have had the whole matter, the entire proceſs of that great work laid before him, and communicated to him, by the ſpirit of God. This was alſo the caſe of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> writers in many inſtances; as in their prophecies concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſpreading the goſpel, &amp;c. and it is certain <hi>John</hi> muſt have this kind of inſpiration in delivering his viſions mentioned in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> He paints there a ſcene of things which extends through every age of the church, to the end of the world; which he could not have done without that ſort of inſpiration I am ſpeaking of, or with any leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it. The apoſtles had a like degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration in publiſhing to the world ſuch things as are termed <hi>myſteries;</hi> as the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Eph. iii. 2, 3, 4, 5; the converſion and calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> into the chriſtian church, Rom. xi. 25, 26. The reſurrection of the body, 1 Cor. xv. Theſe and the like were myſteries, things they could have no notion of, till God revealed or ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted them to them by his ſpirit. And I reckon they had the ſame inſpiration in expounding many paſſages of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and accommodating them to the ſtate of things under the goſpel, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to this or that event. In theſe, and many other inſtances, the ſacred writers had the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuggeſtion, the matter they delivered and publiſhed they had wholly and immediately from the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>But then there was another kind, a lower degree of inſpiration, namely, that of direction. And this I ſuppoſe all the ſacred writers had in ſeveral caſes. As for inſtance, when the evangeliſts relate that <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed his maſter, and that <hi>Peter</hi> denied him, they need not herein be inſpired in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe, need not have theſe points of hiſtory ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028262_0013_0FD7DB17DE0695A0"/>to them, as if they had known nothing of the matter, which obſervation may be applied to moſt of the other hiſtorical narrations contained in the ſcriptures. Where the penmen knew the things they recorded, it is reaſonable to conclude they had no more than the inſpiration of direction: the ſpirit of God firſt ſtirring them up to write, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to make a fit choice what to write, and what not to write; and then guiding them in the performance. Further,</p>
            <p n="6">6. All the penmen of the holy Scripture had that degree of inſpiration, that divine <hi>afflatus</hi> or aſſiſtance that effectually ſecured them from errors and miſtakes. Some had the higher meaſures thereof, the whole matter, and it may be the very words and ſyllables ſuggeſted to them, while others had only direction and conduct in delivering what they were intruſted with. Yet all of them were infallible, they delivered nothing but what is true, and what may be depended upon as true. I might add,</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the holy ſpirit when he inſpired the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who penned the Scriptures, not only left them poſſeſſed of their natural faculties, but to the free exerciſe and uſe of them. They were not like a trumpet that a man ſpeaks through, nor like the <hi>Pagan Oracles,</hi> mere paſſive inſtruments in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their meſſages and doctrines. But they had their reaſon, memory, underſtanding, and all their rational powers, which they made uſe of and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: And in many inſtances were even allowed to indulge their own fancies and phraſes.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly touched and explained the inſpiration of the Bible; in the next place.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am to hint how it muſt be underſtood, that <hi>all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God.</hi> For ſo ſays the text, and this is what we are taught to believe that the whole Bible is of divine original,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028262_0014_0FD7DB1979FA1A20"/>the word of God. The queſtion is, How we muſt underſtand this? Now certainly it is not meant, that God himſelf ſpake immediately all the things contained in the Scripture; ſometimes indeed he is introduced and repreſented as ſpeaking immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, as to <hi>Job</hi> out of a whirlwind, <hi>Job</hi> xxxviii. 1. and at the giving of the law on <hi>Mount Sinai, Exed.</hi> xx. Though ſome paſſages in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> make it probable, that he uſed the miniſtry of angels on that occaſion, particularly, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 2. <hi>If the word ſpoken by angels, was ſtedfaſt, &amp;c.</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeems to have been thus; the <hi>Schechinah</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing on the <hi>Mount</hi> with the uſual guard of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending angels, made uſe of their miniſtry in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the law to the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor muſt we ſuppoſe that all thoſe who are brought in ſpeaking in the Scripture, ſpeak from God. The <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> contains a great many hiſtories of the words and actions of bad men. The book of <hi>Job</hi> relates the words of the Devil himſelf, and the miſtaken ſpeeches of <hi>Job's</hi> friends. The evangeliſts give you the words of the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees,</hi> and other avowed enemies of Chriſt and his goſpel: as likewiſe doth <hi>Luke</hi> in his hiſtory of the acts of the apoſtles.</p>
            <p>So that when the apoſtle here ſays, <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> we are to take it thus, that all the writers of the ſacred Scripture were by the ſpirit of God infallibly aſſiſted to write thoſe things that are contained in the Bible for the uſe of the church. In ſome things they had an inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in the fulleſt, higheſt ſenſe, receiving their doctrine wholly from God. In other things they had only infallible conduct. So that all contained in the Bible is either a divine doctrine, or a true hiſtory. There are ſeveral wicked ſpeeches of bad men, ſeveral miſtaken ſpeeches of good men, there recorded. But the hiſtory is faithful and true.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028262_0015_0FD7DB1AAAFC0F10"/>Nothing is here ſaid to be done, which was not done; nothing is here feigned; nothing falſely repreſented. The whole of it, as it is written for our uſe, ſo it is one way or other <hi>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> But to inſiſt no longer on this ſubject, I now proceed to the main thing intended, which is,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To prove the divine authority of the Scriptures; that <hi>all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> or that the whole canon thereof is of divine original, the Bible the word of God. Here I ſhall,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Premiſe ſome particulars to prepare my way for the proof of the point.</item>
               <item>2. Offer arguments for that purpoſe. And,</item>
               <item>3. Anſwer the moſt material objections againſt the divine authority of the Scriptures.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall premiſe ſome particulars to prepare my way for what I intend to ſuggeſt for the proof of the point. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me premiſe that the queſtion, Whether the Scripture be the word of God? is not to be taken for granted, nor the reſolution of it expected from the immediate teſtimony of the holy ſpirit. But it is capable of ſolid evidence, and may and ought to be ſubmitted to a rational enquiry and trial.</p>
            <p>It is not to be taken for granted as a firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Such principles there are (firſt principles we call them), generally allowed and received: ſelf-evident maxims agreeable to the reaſon of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and theſe are not to be diſputed and proved; but are the mediums by which we prove other things. But that the Scripture is the word of God, is not a principle of this kind. Indeed among chriſtians it is a principle allowed and received on all ſides. But when we have to do with unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or when we are eſtabliſhing the ground and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028262_0016_0FD7DB1C28F90768"/>foundation of our ſaith, we propoſe it to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I am ſatisfied we may ſtand the trial here, and ſubmit it to the moſt critical enquiry that will proceed without prejudice and partiality. In ſhort, this propoſition, that our Bible is an inſpired book, is not to be believed without rational evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not to be admitted purely becauſe others have told us ſo, becauſe it is received in the country where we live, or becauſe it pretends to be a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God: for as much may be ſaid of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> But it is to be proved; and upon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be received and believed. The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> pretends his <hi>Bible</hi> is a revelation from heaven, the <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> or diſciple of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> pretends his <hi>Alcoran</hi> is ſo. Now, I ſay, in order to determine that queſtion, reaſons are to be offered on both ſides; and if the <hi>Mahometan</hi> can produce better reaſons in behalf of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> than can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in behalf of our Bible, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ought to be preſerred.</p>
            <p>Nor muſt we depend on the teſtimony of the ſpirit for the reſolution of this queſtion, Whether the Scriptures be the word of God. Indeed the divine veracity, or authority of God ſpeaking in his word, is the reaſon into which our faith is ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately reſolved. <hi>Whatſoever God ſays, is true;</hi> this is a firſt principle and maxim. I therefore believe all things contained in the Scripture, and what God has revealed, becauſe God is true, and cannot deceive me; here the faith of a chriſtian reſts. But if it be aſked, How do I know that God has ſpoke theſe things, or that the Bible is a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God? I muſt here ſeek for rational evidence (as I ſaid before); and not rely purely on God's teſtimony, as it is recorded in the word, or expect an immediate teſtimony from the ſpirit, a ſecret whiſper, an inward ſuggeſtion, that the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028262_0017_0FD7DB1DB8A213D0"/>Scripture is the word of God. For this is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ſaith into private inſpiration, and make one inſpiration a reaſon of receiving another, which opens the way to dangerous deluſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the Scripture is to be proved by rational arguments, and received upon proper evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; yet the teſtimony of God's ſpirit, rightly underſtood, is of great uſe and neceſſity to us, in order to the diſcerning the evidence of Scripture, and reſting in it as a divine revelation. By the teſtimony of the ſpirit, I do not mean a particular inſpiration to this or that particular perſon, but the inlightening ſanctifying work of the holy ſpirit in the hearts of believers. And concerning this, let me note two or three things. As, that the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſpirit doth not produce the evidence of the divinity of the Scriptures, but helps us to diſcern it. It doth not give, but ſhow the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and prepares us to receive it. Thus when God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſhe attended to the apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 14. ſhe became better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to inquire into and receive the chriſtian revelation, and to take in the evidence of the truth of it. God writes his law in the hearts of believers, impreſſes their minds with it, ſanctifies them by his word, produces affections and inward frames agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereto; and hereby he gives teſtimony to his word in their hearts. <hi>The entrance of thy word giveth light,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. xix. That <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad for it. <hi>Thy teſtimonies are more to be deſire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er alſo than the honey, and the honey-comb,</hi> Pſal. xix. 10. So Pſal. cxix. 140. <hi>Thy word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>eth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Now when good men find the great uſefulneſs and excellency of the word of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028262_0018_0FD7DB2707D39DC8"/>God, that it converts, quickens, conducts, comforts them; when they find an inward correſpondence with it, that it deſcribes their various caſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts and frames, affords relief and conſolation in all their difficulties, is their light, their monitor and comforter; as they cannot but love it, ſo they are better prepared to believe it on this account. And this, I reckon is that teſtimony of God's ſpirit, which helps believers to receive the word of God, <hi>as it is indeed the word of God.</hi> It has taken faſt hold of them, they feel the power of the word, and taſte its conſolation. God has given them his ſpirit, and they know of the doctrine that it is of God. But it muſt be conſidered, this is not the evidence of Scripture; but a help to receive that evidence, it removes prejudices, makes us attentive, recommends the Scripture to the mind; but it doth not exclude other reaſons of believing, though it enforces them.</p>
            <p>Further, I would note, that this teſtimony of the ſpirit of God did (it is likely) generally attend the preaching of the goſpel in the firſt ages of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, together with miracles, and other extraordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary works. There was ſome extraordinary ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aſſiſtance indeed accompanying the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the word. Thus <hi>Peter's</hi> ſermon we read converted three thouſand at once, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41. And beſides the numerous and ſpeedy converſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable at that time, the chriſtian religion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have an incommon wonderful efficacy and power among thoſe that received it. Hence, Lactantius ſays, <q>Shew me a perſon that is wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and furious, by a few words of the goſpel, I will render him as meek as a lamb; ſhew me a perſon that is intemperate, unclean, the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion ſhall render him ſober and chaſte.</q> And the like he ſays in other inſtances. It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God at the firſt planting of the goſpel, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028262_0019_0FD7DB29438A5388"/>in order to it, to arm his word with power. There was a glorious effuſion of the divine ſpirit, which ſubdued the hearts of men to the belief and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Scriptures, and wrought a ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>al reformation, even to the aſtoniſhment of the world. Now where any experienced this divine energy of the ſpirit, going along with the word and bearing teſtimony to it, they could never queſtion the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine itſelf. They found <hi>the word of God quick and powerful,</hi> and conſequently, could not but believe it was the word of God.</p>
            <p>I might add, the ſame teſtimony in one or other degree of it, is ſtill neceſſary to the ſaving belief of the Scriptures. We may give a general aſſent to this propoſition, that the Scripture is the word of God; may be convinced by clear rational ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that it is ſo. But we ſhall not believe it, ſo as to mind it, reliſh it, delight in it, and comport with the deſign of it, (without which we do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed believe it, and receive it as a revelation from God) we ſhall not do this, I ſay, without the ſpirit influences on our minds, enlightening the eyes, opening the heart, removing prejudices, and caſting down lofty imaginations.</p>
            <p>Though ſtill let me repeat it, that whatſoever the ſpirit of God doth here, ſignifies not ſo much to give evidence, as to diſcover evidence. His teſtimony doth not prove the Scripture to be the word of God, but helps us to ſee the proof of it. It may indeed tend to ſatisfy us in particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the proof; but the proof is diſtinct from the teſtimony; at leaſt, this teſtimony is but one part of the proof, and cannot be pleaded with others, of whatever uſe it may he privately to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But theſe things I know require a great deal more diſcourſe to explain them, and ſet them in a full light, than at preſent I hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

3. The revelation contained in the Scripture, is not inconſiſtent with, or oppoſite to natural religion, (or the dictates of right reaſon and natural light;) nor, properly ſpeaking, diſtinct from it, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it, and perfects it. I reckon the firſt law or covenant innocent man was under, was made known in nature, the will of God concerning duty and rewards was viſibly therein. Man in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity could not but diſcern his obligations to his maker, not to ſay, that he had the whole law and all his duty written upon his heart, and found a propenſity and inclination thereto. There was no darkneſs in his mind, or depravity in his affections, but it was natural for him to love God, to converſe with, and obey him in every inſtance; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a principle of love, juſtice, and benignity to his neighbor was implanted in him. This, which may be called, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e law of nature, was the firſt law, antecedent to any ſupernatural revelation. This was the covenant of innocency, or works revealed in nature; and I reckon that the poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 17. was not the covenant itſelf, or firſt law, but added as a teſt and trial of man's obedience, and as a mark of God's ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>Now this law, ſounded on the nature of things, and on the relation man ſtands in to God, his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, preſerver, and ſovereign, is immutable, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be changed, and never ceaſes. Accordingly it runs through every diſpenſation of religion. The patriarchs and <hi>Jews</hi> were under the obligation of it. And it ſtill remains as a branch of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-diſpenſation. It was ſummed up in the <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> given to the <hi>Jews</hi> of old. Chriſt makes it in part the ſubject of his ſermon on the mount, where he illuſtrates and comments upon it; and it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained through all the writings of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> So that ſhould any aſk, Whether the <hi>Bible,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028262_0021_0FD7DB2BF8C11550"/>or the law of nature, be a revelation from God? The anſwer muſt be, that theſe two are not oppoſed. The <hi>Bible</hi> comprehends all the laws of nature. Whatever is agreeable to reaſon, and that reaſon could diſcover as matter of duty towards God, our neighbor and ourſelves, this the <hi>Bible</hi> takes in and eſtabliſhes. In a word, the <hi>Bible</hi> contains the moſt excellent ſyſtem of morals in the world. There is nothing valuable in all the writings of the philoſophers, but it is to be found in the <hi>Bible;</hi> all the laws of juſtice, charity, meekneſs, gratitude, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they have recommended in their books, are not only ſet in a better light, but more ſtrongly inforced in the <hi>Bible.</hi> Not but that the <hi>Bible</hi> contains a great deal more than this; but I thought fit here to remark, that it contains this; and conſequently, that our modern <hi>deiſts,</hi> that talk ſo much of natural religion, have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Had mankind preſerved their integrity, the light and purity of their minds, I do ſuppoſe, they would have underſtood their duty in the whole compaſs and latitude of it, without any ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral revelation. All the precepts of divine morality, all man's obligations and debts towards God, his neighbor and himſelf, would have laid open to him. He would have ſeen them clearly and diſtinctly, and been convinced of the equity and reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them without teaching and ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Not but that God might, even in that ſtate have given poſitive laws by ſpecial and ſupernatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.

               </hi> intimating, that they had been uſed to converſe with him in a ſenſible manner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately knew his voice. There would have been a conſtant intercourſe, no queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, had not man apoſtatized, and it is probable ſome occaſional revelations, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with reference to poſitive duties. But here, I grant, I am talking in the dark, and can only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. But what I chiefly aſſert, is, that had not man fallen and loſt his original light and rectitude, all the duties of natural religion (as we call it) had been obvious and ſelf-evident, and there would have needed no ſupernatural revelation, either to diſcover, or inculcate and inforce them. I add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Such is the ſtate of mankind, having apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and fallen from God, ſuch the weakneſs and blindneſs of his mind, and ſo general the depravity and corruption of his nature; that a ſupernatural revelation is new become exceeding neceſſary. This I might prove, (I think I might call it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate) at large. But that I may not be tedious, I ſhall ſatisfy myſelf with juſt touching a few heads of arguments. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let it be conſidered, that the law of nature with the rules and maxims of moral good and evil, however certain in themſelves and obvious at firſt, are now become leſs legible to us. Such is the weakneſs and darkneſs of the human mind, ſo many our prejudices, luſts and paſſions, that we cannot eaſily read the law of nature, nor apprehend the demands of it. Some have magnified that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation and deſcription, the great philoſopher <hi>Tully</hi> gives us of this matter, (<hi>Tuſc. Queſt.</hi> lib. iii,) part of which I ſhall here recite, <hi>If we had come into the world in ſuch circumſtances as that we could clearly and diſtinctly have diſcerned nature herſelf, and been able in the courſe of our lives to have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028262_0023_0FD7DB9397B45430"/>her true and uncorrupted directions; this alone might have been ſufficient, and there would have been little need of teaching and inſtruction. But now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given us only ſome ſmall ſparks of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which we ſoon extinguiſh with corrupt opinions and evil practices, that the true light of nature no where appears. As ſoon as we are brought into the world, immediately we dwell in the midſt of all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</hi> And then he goes on to ſhew the influence that our ſenſes and evil examples have upon us, and concludes, that hereby our very natures are transformed as it were into corrupt ſentiments. Now this being ſo, the voice of nature or of right reaſon, is not heard without extraordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch as the moſt of mankind are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. And indeed what we now call the law of nature, is of ſo nice a conſideration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſo much nice abſtract reaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nd great ſtudy, are capable of deducing the doctrines of it from their firſt principles, and of repreſenting them with proper light and evidence. So that conſidering the univerſal depravity of men's minds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the circumſtances of the bulk of mankind, it may I think be aſſerted, that the law and light of nature, would have been a very ſufficient rule, and comparatively of little uſe to us. We that have the <hi>Bible</hi> to direct us, and the labours of learned men, who have lighted their torch at that ſun, can talk finely of the law of nature; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that help, very few, I am perſuaded, would have had any tolerable notions of it. Which will appear more evidently, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the greateſt proficients in ſtudy, the moſt profound philoſophers, were at a lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and at great uncertainty as to ſome of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant doctrines in religion. To repreſent this would require a diſcourſe by itſelf, and therefore you can
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028262_0024_0FD7DB94F41DEB40"/>expect only a few hints. They were groſsly in the dark as to the foundation of all religion, the being and perfections of God; as appears from their notions of theſe matters, and particularly from this, that they allowed a plurality of gods, which is in effect to undermine and deſtroy all true divinity, and really leave no God. They <hi>worſhipped crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> beſides, and inſtead of <hi>the creator,</hi> as the apoſtle charges them, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 25. and <hi>did ſervice to them which by nature are no Gods, Gal.</hi> iv. 8. What a rabble of deities they had brought into the world, and honored with ſacrifices, and all ſorts of religious rites, I ſhall not now ſtand to ſhew: only take notice, that though ſome great men among them laughed at theſe ſuperſtitions, and contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearts the baſe and vile deities of the vulgar; yet it was a principle allowed by them, and according to which they themſelves practiſed, that all were to comply with the rites eſtabliſhed in the country where they lived, and worſhip the gods according to the law. So that natural reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as taught by the philoſophers, and univerſally eſtabliſhed in the heathen world, failed in this fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental article, the unity of the Godhead, the owning and acknowledging one only living and true God.</p>
            <p>Further, they were ignorant of the origin of the world, and maintained opinions on this head ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconſiſtent with religion. It was their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maxim, that nothing could be made out of nothing; and conſequently, they held that matter was 'uncreated,' and the world ſelf-exiſtent. Some of them thought the world was not made at all, but from eternity, either with or without a deity, and ſo was God itſelf, or with a deity, being co-exiſtent with God, and a ſort of neceſſary ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from him; which is ſaid to be the opinion
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028262_0025_0FD7DB97A43DAA08"/>of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and his followers. Others aſcribe it to chance, or a fortuitous concourſe of atoms, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Epicureans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were equally bewildered in their notions of providence: a numerous ſect of the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> denied all providence: others, as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and his ſchool, confined it to heaven, leaving all human affairs without any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency of God: others acknowledged a general providence, but denied it extended to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons and their concernment. And even the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> the moſt zealous aſſertors of divine providence, confined it to the more important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of mankind. Now it would be eaſy to ſhew, that ſuch a doctrine as this, ſuch principles as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and almoſt univerſally, obtained among them on this head, tended not only to leſſen, but deſtroy every thing that deſerves the name of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For why ſhould we love, fear, truſt, pray to, or worſhip a God that concerns not himſelf about us, on whom we do not depend, and who neither doth us good nor evil.</p>
            <p>They were equally at a loſs about the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> the great end and happineſs of man. They knew not wherein happineſs conſiſted, and conſequently, muſt rove in uncertainties, act and live without any particular aim. Some of them placed happineſs in one thing, others in a different; and ſo ſtrangely were they divided here, that <hi>Varro</hi> reckoned up no leſs than two hundred eighty-eight opinions about it.</p>
            <p>Nor were they at any certainty about the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoul and a future ſtate. The greateſt part of them were downright <hi>infidels</hi> as to theſe points; and the beſt of them, after their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reſearches, fluctuated, lived and died in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. <hi>Socrates,</hi> though he ſeemed to incline to believe and hope for another world, ſpeaks doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028262_0026_0FD7F40208576428"/>and ſo does <hi>Cicero,</hi> he owns, he could but gueſs; and plainly ſays, which of the two opinions (that the ſoul is mortal, or is immortal) is true, God only knows: and again, which is moſt probable, is a very great queſtion.</p>
            <p>Now, if the great men among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to ſtudy the book of nature, and who had carried their inquiries to the higheſt, fell into ſuch errors and miſtakes, and at beſt were at ſuch uncertainties; one may eaſily infer, the caſe of the ignorant vulgar would be very deplorable, and that religion among them would be in a moſt wretched ſtate. I may add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. As thoſe that cultivated natural religion, and made the greateſt improvements in the ſtudy of it, thus blundered and run into errors in matters of the higheſt conſequence; ſo natural light, in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent, was defective. Suppoſing the law of nature had been underſtood better by thoſe that ſtudied it, it is not ſufficient to direct men in all the concernments of religion. In two points particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it falls ſhort, <hi>viz. The right manner of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God, and the terms upon which ſinners may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly be accepted with him.</hi> Neither of theſe two things, which yet are of the utmoſt moment to us, doth it diſcover with any ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe, <hi>the right manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God;</hi> the light of nature could not of itſelf be a ſufficient direction. I do not ground my argument or proof of this upon the abſurd, cruel, and filthy manner in which generally they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. For, I grant, natural reaſon would condemn that; and we find the wiſer among the philoſophers, exclaiming againſt ſuch fooleries very freely; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they fell in with them in practice. <hi>What a frenzy is it to imagine,</hi> (ſays <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>that the Gods can be delighted with ſuch cruelties, that even the worſt of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> could ſcruple to authoriſe or commit. One out
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028262_0027_0FD7F40C5BD89210"/>of zeal mutilates himſelf, another lances and cuts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> he adds, <hi>if this be the way to pleaſe the Gods, what ſhould a man do if he had a mind to anger them?</hi> and again, <hi>if this be the way to pleaſe them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not to be worſhipped, or pleaſed at all.</hi> Reaſon would vote againſt many of the follies of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and their wiſe men were generally aſhamed of them. Nor do I deny, but the philoſophers ſpake many grave and good things concerning the worſhip of God. The love of him, and obedience to him, they concluded was the moſt acceptable ſervice, and that a pure heart was infinitely better than all their hecatombs or moſt coſtly oblations. But then, as to the particular manner and form of external worſhip, they knew not, neither could the reaſon and light of their minds herein direct them. They could not tell, what mode of external ſervice would be acceptable to God. And hence, even the greateſt of them thought it beſt to comply with eſtabliſhed cuſtoms, which they did ſo as to involve themſelves in the guilt of the moſt vile and ſtupid idolatry.</p>
            <p>And then, as to the other point, the terms upon which they might hope for, and have aſſurance of acceptance with God, and of being received into favor: reaſon, or the light of nature could afford them, very little ſatisfaction. Here their oracle was ſilent, and the light of nature utterly failed.</p>
            <p>It is conſiderable to my purpoſe, that the light of nature could not diſcover the origin of evil, <hi>whence this evil,</hi> was the great puzzle of their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and it would be no great difficulty, to infer hence, that it could not ſufficiently direct how to get it removed; at leaſt, thoſe that had nothing but nature for their direction, were at a mighty loſs as to both theſe particulars. Some of them attributed evil to antipathy, a certain quarrelſome principle, which they knew not what to make of. Others to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028262_0028_0FD7F40E47B7A1B8"/>the neceſſary perverſity of matter. Others to a certain malignant ſpirit. Though the moſt common opinion was, that there were two Gods, the one the author of all good, and the other, the author of all evil. Now ſuch confuſion as this, I dare ſay, muſt leave them in the dark, to whom, and how to apply for the removal of evil, the pardon of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould they apply to God, the living and true God, as I grant reaſon would direct; yet they could not be aſſured, that he would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to them, and paſs by their offences. They might indeed infer ſomething encouraging from the mercy and goodneſs of God; might build ſome probable hope upon the methods of his providence, the kindneſs, and forbearance diſcovered in the conſtant courſe thereof. But yet, there are inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable difficulties remaining here, in which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon cannot relieve us. For inſtance, as we are ſinners, as all men muſt own themſelves to be, and the heathens univerſally did acknowledge it. We ſtand expoſed to the juſtice of God, deſerve puniſhment, and God has a right to puniſh us; and I think natural reaſon cannot aſſure us, he will depart from his right. If it be ſaid he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and this reaſon diſcovers; I anſwer, it alſo diſcovers, that he is juſt and righteous; and how can we be aſſured that he will exerciſe mercy againſt the demands of juſtice. Should it be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that reaſon may ſatisfy the ſinner, that if he repent, ſo good and gracious a being, as all men believe God to be, will forgive ſin. I anſwer, reaſon cannot give any aſſurance of this. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we ſee does not ſatisfy human governors, who, as concerned for the honor of their laws and government, often puniſh criminals, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their repentance, and for ought reaſon can tell us, the righteous governor of the world may do ſo too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:028262_0029_0FD7F40FAF725CC0"/>
Further, reaſon cannot aſſure us, how often God will pardon; whether he will pardon all ſin; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will not only pardon, but receive into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; how he will pardon, whether abſolutely, or upon what terms. That the heathens were at a loſs as to all theſe things, is evident from the ſhifts they were put to, when under apprehenſion of the divine diſpleaſure. Witneſs their numerous ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and ſuperſtitious rites, their offering the <hi>fruit of their body for the ſin of their ſoul,</hi> and the like; which were the means they deviſed for appeaſing the anger of the Deity, and rendering him propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In ſhort, the utmoſt length that natural light could carry any in this matter, we have I think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the caſe of the Ninevites, <hi>Who can tell if God will repent, and turn away from his fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that we periſh not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, they were in ſo much darkneſs about the nature of God, about ſin, about repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the methods of applying to God; they had ſo much to increaſe their fears, as well as encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their hopes; that in theſe reſpects it muſt be owned, that natural religion, had they attended to its utmoſt light, was lame and defective.</p>
            <p>It is too ſoon to infer from hence, the neceſſity of a ſupernatural revelation; that I ſhall do with more advantage from all the particulars when I have finiſhed them. Only let me obſerve as I paſs on, how great a bleſſing we have in the Bible on this account as well as many others. This clearly ſhews us our diſeaſe and points out our remedy. This tells us, that <hi>God made man upright,</hi> but that <hi>he ſought out many inventions;</hi> and that <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> We now know that he will forgive ſin, having publiſhed an act of grace and indemnity from heaven, declaring that if we repent, <hi>our ſins ſhall be blotted out,</hi> that he <hi>will be merciful to our iniquities, and our ſins he will
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028262_0030_0FD7F41179B00930"/>remember no more.</hi> This our Bible is full of. We cannot doubt of it, but have a ſure foundation for our faith and hope to reſt upon, and are not left to fluctuate in uncertainties, as the Gentiles did that knew not God, nor were acquainted with the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the goſpel. The Son of God came from heaven to procure this favor, and he left ſtated of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in commiſſion to proclaim it to the world; for ſo we read that he commanded, that <hi>repentance, and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 47. We have reaſon therefore to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Bible, and value it exceedingly. But this will further appear in the progreſs of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on this ſubject. In the mean time to proceed,</p>
            <p n="4">4. As it might be probably concluded from the foregoing particulars, that there would be great diſorder, darkneſs and corruption among mankind that wanted a ſupernatural revelation; ſo it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent this was the caſe. The heathen world as they were the regions of darkneſs, the dark places of the earth, ſo among them were the habitations of cruelty. Their minds were wofully depraved, their principles corrupt, and their manners vile and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. A ſhort view of the ſtate of heatheniſm, which you will conſider, as the ſtate of thoſe that wanted the advantage of the Bible, will convince you of this. And as it may be of uſe to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent argument, you will not I hope think it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your attention.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid ſomething, already concerning their principles with reference to religion; by which it appears how defective their notions were. They were ignorant of ſome of the greateſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant doctrines; others they ſo much depraved by a mixture of their own fancies, and in all were at ſuch uncertainties, that their principles could be of little uſe, either as to practice or comfort.</p>

To ſhew this, let me briefly compare their faith with that of chriſtians, as we have the latter ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in an ancient creed, which we call the apoſtles, containing the chief doctrines of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. They were ſo far from believing aright in God the Father Almighty, that the generality of them run into the abſurdity of polytheiſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving there were many Gods. And few of them had any tolerable notion of the Supreme Being, the one true God. They were ſo far from own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as maker of heaven and earth, that many of them thought that heaven and earth had no maker. And for the reſt of their belief, there is an entire chaſm and defect. It is all blank in their creed. They knew nothing of Jeſus Chriſt, his only Son our Lord; of his birth, death, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, aſcenſion, nothing of the Holy Ghoſt; the holy catholic church; had no ſolid principles on which they could ground the hope of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin; without which even the beſt of them muſt live in continual ſuſpicion and fear. As for the reſurrection of the body, that great article of the chriſtian faith and hope, their philoſophers could not reach it, but rejected it as abſurd and ridiculous when propoſed to them. Nor had they any ſteady belief of the concluding article, the life everlaſting. Some hoped there might be another ſtate after this; others laughed at the notion as weak and groundleſs, poſſeſſing men with needleſs apprehenſions; and the beſt of them were in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence between hope and fear. So that, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if we had wanted our Bible, we had wanted our creed, wanted theſe great articles of religion, on which a chriſtian founds his faith and comfort, and which have ſo conſtant and powerful an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on practice: we had known little of God, nothing of Chriſt, little of heaven, or the way to it.</p>

And as their faith, ſo their worſhip, was ſadly defective and depraved, as would appear upon a ſhort view of it, even to amazement. They were miſtaken as to the object of religious worſhip. For as they had deified in their own imaginations the vileſt creatures, and things, and diſtributed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity among a multitude of fictitious deities; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, to theſe they paid their honors, doing <hi>ſervice to them that by nature were no gods.</hi> The apoſtle tells us, they had <hi>gods many, and lords many.</hi> They had, indeed, multiplied them to a prodigious number, and divided them into various claſſes; as celeſtial, aerial, terreſtial, infernal, hurtful gods, and kind beneficent gods. The ſun, moon, and ſtars, were their moſt ancient deities, to which they had added a vaſt many more, deifying almoſt every thing they thought, they had cauſe either to love or fear. Their kings and emperors were uſually brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the claſs, and received divine honors. Not to take notice, how much lower the ſuperſtition of the vulgar carried them, worſhipping the vileſt things.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Worſhipping the vileſt things</hi>] As a Cat, or a Plant. For we are told, that the Egyptians in particular worſhipped ſuch things, and the beſt apology or excuſe, that can be made for them, is to ſay, it was only a civil and political worſhip or regard they paid to theſe objects, and had very little of ſacred or religious in it, even among the vulgar. Huſbandry being the chief employment and way of living among that people, they declared by a law, that all thoſe creatures which were of eminent ſervice in agriculture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of vermin, or upon ſome other account in peculiar eſteem with them, ſhould be holy, ſacred, and inviolable; ſo that it was death to deſtroy any of them, either deſignedly, or by accident. For conſidering them as inſtruments of divine providence towards the ſupport of human life, they treated them as things ſet apart and ſacred to that particular uſe and purpoſe, nor did they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate any thing without ſuch a view, as Cicero tells us, <hi>Aegyptii nullam belluam, niſi ob aliquam utilitatem quam ex ea caperent, conſecra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus vain were they become in their imagination. Let me only obſerve here, that as they worſhipped this confuſed medley of gods, the devil took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their folly, played upon them and abuſed them by his impoſtures, and really drew them to the worſhip of himſelf. This the apoſtle expreſsly charge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> upon them, <hi>The things which the</hi> gentiles <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, they ſacrifice to devils, and not to God.</hi> They had various images and altars erected to this or that deity, before theſe they worſhipped, theſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted as oracles; and in doing ſo, they really wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped devils, who poſſeſſed themſelves of their idols, ſpake in them, and received the homage of theſe wretched people.</p>
            <p>And, as this was the common caſe of the gentile world, it was the caſe of the ancient Britons in particular, as hiſtory informs us, <q>They were foul idolaters, ſaith a learned writer,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Church Hiſtory; p. 1</note> who miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great truth, that God is in every thing, made every thing God, as trees, rivers, hills, mountains.</q> He adds, <q>they worſhipped devils, whoſe pictures remained in the days of <hi>Gildas,</hi> within and without the decayed walls of their cities, drawn with deformed and ugly faces,</q> as no doubt they ſometimes appeared. Their great goddeſs was <hi>Diana,</hi> the goddeſs of the game. They thought their buſineſs was mainly with that deity, becauſe hunting was not their recreation but their life; and veniſon the chief of their food. And we are told, that there is a place near St. Paul's
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028262_0034_0FD7F4175F1C4390"/>in London, called in old records <hi>Diana's Chamber,</hi> where in king Edward the firſt's time, thouſands of the heads of oxen were dug up, which had been offered in ſacrifice to <hi>Diana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus were our anceſtors <hi>carried away to dumb idols, as they were led,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 2. And this had been our caſe, had we not been viſited with the light of the goſpel, and had the Bible put into our hands; we had been ſacrificing our ſheep, and our oxen, and our children to <hi>Diana, Apollo,</hi> and a hundred more deities; <hi>i. e.</hi> to devils, under differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent names and appearances. The conſideration of which ſhews us plainly how much we needed a revelation, and at the ſame time ſhould excite our gratitude for it. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>As the object of their worſhip was wrong, the manner of it was no leſs ſo. To inſtance only in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> the cruelty, and filthineſs of their worſhip. The cruelty of it, as cutting, lancing and maiming themſelves; which was frequently their practice in religious worſhip, and thought to be an acceptable ſervice to their gods; to which I may add human ſacrifices,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Human Sacrifices.</hi>] There is a curious account of two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory diſſertations upon the ſubject of human ſacrifices in <hi>l' Hiſtoire de l' Academie Royale des Inſcriptions and Belles Lettres.</hi> The Abbot de Boiſſi produces abundance of teſtimonies both from greek and latin authors to prove that they were in uſe among the moſt polite, as well as barbarous nations. That the Phaenicians, Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Canaanites, Tyrians, Carthagenians, Athenians, Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Iconians, and all the Grecians, both of the continent and the iſlands; Romans, Scythians, Germans, Britons, Spaniards, Gauls, &amp;c, were equally involved in that ſuperſtition, which he, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, concludes was derived from an imperfect tradition, of Abraham's intended ſacrifice of his ſon; the attempt of that patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch leading the neighboring people really to ſacrifice their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. On the other hand; M. Morin, out of a concern and zeal for the honor of mankind, cadeavers to vind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this end, he either rejects, or labors to weaken, the numerous authorities alledged to prove the fact, ſaying many plauſible things on his ſide of the queſtion; from whence he would infer, that if the pagans ever offered human ſacrifices at all, they never ſac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſatisfactory; eſpecially ſince, if travellers may be credited, the practice obtains among many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilized nations, even at this day.</note> very common among them, and becauſe they thought, the more dear to them and valuable the ſacrifice was, of greater account
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028262_0035_0FD7F4218869DEA0"/>it would be, and the more effectual; to appeaſe their gods, they were wont to ſacrifice their own children: ſome that had no children, uſed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them of the poor for this purpoſe. And it is likely, this practice was taken up by others out of tenderneſs to their own off-ſpring. Hence <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus Siculus</hi> tells us, the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Saturn</hi> might be angry with them, becauſe they formerly ſacrificed the beſt of their own ſons, but of late had ſacrificed ſuch as they bought; they therefore choſe out two hundred of the prime of their children and publicly ſacrificed them.</p>
            <p>For the other inſtance, the filthineſs, the obſcene rites of their worſhip, it would be indecent to mention them. Their <hi>Floralia</hi> and <hi>Bachanalia</hi> were celebrated with the utmoſt vileneſs, debauchery, and lewdneſs. But I ſhall not enter into ſo horrid a ſubject. The apoſtle ſeems to give us a caution here, when he ſays, refering it may be to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour on theſe occaſions, <hi>It is a ſhame even to ſpeak of thoſe things which were done of them in ſecret.</hi> I ſhall only remark, that as abominable as theſe ceremonies were, they placed a great deal of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in them, and held it as an opinion, that to be initiated and entered into ſuch myſteries, was a means of purging them from their other ſins, and of procuring them a place in their <hi>Elyſium,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of happineſs. If it be ſaid, their wiſe men and philoſophers laughed at, and deſpiſed ſuch fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>es;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028262_0036_0FD7F4236FE06C88"/>I anſwer, it is true. But it muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they were the eſtabliſhed rites reverenced by the bulk of the people, and even thoſe that knew better, gave them countenance by maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the gods were to be worſhipped according to the cuſtom and law of every country.</p>
            <p>What their morals would be conſequent upon ſuch principles, and ſuch a manner of worſhip, it is eaſy to conjecture; and I ſhall leave it very much to be infered without deducing the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Try them upon the decalogue, and you will find them living down all the duties of it, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying both tables in their avowed practices. I have hinted how ill they can ſtand examination upon the firſt table, and might ſhew the ſame with reference to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>They groſsly violated the ſixth commandment, by authoriſing murders in their gladiatory exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by procuring the abortion of children, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing new-born infants, and by laying violent hands on themſelves, which they plead for as matter of honor on ſeveral occaſions. They as boldly condemned the ſeventh commandment by adultery, inceſt, ſodomy, which they allowed, and even brought into their religion as ſacred rites. <hi>Tully</hi> in a public oration pleads for fornication. They tranſgreſſed the eighth commandment by theft, which many nations gloried in, rather than account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it a fault. And the ninth by lying, which their philoſophers recommended as lawful, whenever it might be profitable.</p>
            <p>Thus vile and immoral were the heathens, too generally as is evident from their own books and hiſtorians. And I need not tell you, that the <hi>New Taſtament</hi> conſtantly repreſents them in characters agreeable hereunto. See the apoſtle's deſcription of them in <hi>Rom.</hi> i. from <hi>ver.</hi> 21, to the end of the chapter. He tells us, <hi>God gave them up to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028262_0037_0FD7F4250DB14790"/>and to vile affections, and a reprobate mind;</hi> the conſequence of which was, that they <hi>were filled with all unrighteouſneſs, fornication, wickedneſs, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, maliciouſneſs, envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity,</hi> with many other defilements of fleſh and ſpirit, there ſpecified; and in the ſame manner the Scripture every where paints them. I ſhall only mention one paſſage thereof more, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 18, 19. where, ſpeaking of the Gentiles, he ſays, <hi>their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings were darkened, being alienated from the life of God;</hi> he adds, <hi>who being paſt feeling, have given themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> This was the general character of the heathen world. They had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their notions of God and religion, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings were darkened, hearts hardened, and conſcience utterly laid waſte. So that their lives were ſtained with the worſt abominations. In a word, it is in them that deſcription we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 11, 12. is moſt literally fulfilled and anſwered, <hi>there is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God; they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that does good; no not one:</hi> and again, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction and miſery are in their ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from hence, I think, I may conclude, the propoſition I am upon ſtands good, <hi>viz.</hi> That a ſpecial revelation from heaven, was become neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. You have ſeen the inſufficiency of natural light, have heard ſome of the blunders and errors of thoſe that cultivated it, the defects in principle, and univerſal depravation of worſhip and manners that overſpread the heathen world: the conſequence from which is exceeding clear, that there needed help and light from heaven to retrieve matters, and to reſtore the knowledge and worſhip of the true God.</p>
            <p>But here it may be objected, that there were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028262_0038_0FD7F42679A2B708"/>men among the philoſophers, who taught divine and noble doctrines, ſufficient to reform the world, and heal the diſtempers of it, had they been attended to. Chriſtian divines often borrow from them, embelliſh their diſcourſes with their ſayings, quoting their writings with great applauſe. In anſwer to this, I grant there were. <hi>Socrates,</hi> for inſtance, ſeems to be preſerved, like <hi>Noah</hi> in the old world, in the midſt of a deluge of immorality. Some ſuch there were, but few, here and there one in an age, that overcame vulgar prejudices, and gave themſelves up to the conduct of nature's light, without ſuffering themſelves to be blaſſed with their paſſions. A <hi>Socrates</hi> in one age, a <hi>Tully</hi> in another, a <hi>Seneca</hi> or an <hi>Antonine</hi> in another. But as theſe were over-numbered by libertine philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and poets, who ſpread the poiſon among the people; ſo the notions, principles, and religion of the country was againſt them. <hi>Socrates</hi> loſt his life for ſtanding up for that fundamental point of all religion, the unity of the godhead. Beſides, even theſe few great men labored under the defects, I before-mentioned. They could not attain to any true ſcheme of divinity. They were at an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as to ſome of the more important articles of faith, the immortality of the ſoul, a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And even their morality was far from being complete. They have not ſo much as a name for the great chriſtian grace of humility: what we call ſo, paſſed with them for abjectneſs, lowneſs and littleneſs of mind. And their pureſt morals had a dangerous mixture: ſelf-ſufficience, pride, and revenge, were not only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but accounted, a ſort of virtue with them. There were great blemiſhes in the lives of their beſt men. <hi>Socrates</hi> had his <hi>Noevi:</hi> he did not wholly abſtain from idolatry, nor from a regard to the heathen oracles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:028262_0039_0FD7F428A09362D0"/>
I will only add, that how great and excellent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe men were, and how excellent ſoever their writings; they wanted authority, they were too few to be much heard, too weak to ſtem the tide. This they themſelves ſaw, and ſome of them are ſaid to have declared their apprehenſions, that without a divine and ſupernatural aſſiſtance, no conſiderable reformation was ever like to be wrought in the world; that their reaſonings and philoſophy would not do, unleſs god appeared from heaven, and in a divine manner influenced the hearts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The general prevailing noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were exceeding corrupt: idolatry was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; the public rites of their religious worſhip were ſcandalous and lewd; and they found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that their philoſophy was too feeble to ſubdue ſinful paſſions and headſtrong luſts, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade men to renounce their falſe gods, and falſe worſhip, and purſue the maxims of reaſon and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. This they themſelves were convinced of, (ſome few among them I mean) wherein they own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great truth that ought always to be in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with chriſtians, <hi>viz,</hi> that ſupernatural help, or what we call grace, is neceſſary to change the hearts and reform the manners of men.</p>
            <p>It may further be objected, that many of thoſe that receive and profeſs the chriſtian religion, are as Sad as the poor Pagans: that as the Jews of old were exceeding vicious, notwithſtanding they enjoyed a revelation from heaven, ſo there are multitudes even among chriſtians themſelves as ſcandalous in their practice, as the heathens were. I muſt confeſs this is an objection that may be urged too plauſibly, and give occaſion to take up the apoſtle's complaint in his days, <hi>The name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is written.</hi> But notwithſtanding, there is no force in the argument, if it be offered to prove, that a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028262_0040_0FD7F42CEFD9C180"/>revelation is not neceſſary, or that it is of no uſe; that the world needs it not, or has been no better for it. For as to the Jews, it is utterly falſe, that they were generally as bad as their heathen neighbors. It is granted they often apoſtatized, and were ſeverely puniſhed on that account. Yet I think it highly probable, that they knew more of God, and practiced more of religion, than all the world beſides. Even when things were worſt with them, they had many eminent and great men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the lower ſort, that preſerved their veneration for God and religion. But, as the objection more peculiarly concerns chriſtians, ſeveral things might be ſaid to it: as, that there are great numbers that uſurp the name of chriſtians, and live in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church, who yet really are no chriſtians, can ſcarce be ſaid to receive the Bible. If they have a Bible in their houſe they ſeldom look into it, and make no other uſe of it, than to cavil at a few paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that fall in their way. And no wonder, that ſuch are not reformed and bettered by divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, when they have ſo little regard to it. But then, as the chriſtian church juſtly diſowns them, at leaſt the head of it doth, and will do ſo at laſt, their behaviour ought not to be turned to the reproach of the chriſtian profeſſion. <hi>He is not a Jew that is one outwardly:</hi> every man that was baptiſed, by the care and procurement of his parents, is not therefore a chriſtian, he might as well be called a Mahometan, a Pagan, did he not live in a chriſtian country. I anſwer further, that where the chriſtian revelation is received to purpoſe, it has glorious effects; enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, transforming, and making a beautiful change in the ſtate of things, which was ſeen eminently in the firſt ages of chriſtianity. The reformation the goſpel wrought in the lives of its profeſſors was ſo remarkable, that their heathen neighbors ſtood
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028262_0041_0FD7F42DDDC51800"/>amazed at it. Once more, conſider the chriſtian church under all its diſadvantages from the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of good men, and the ſcandals given by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and there is no compariſon between that and the Pagan world. Not, but there are ſome called chriſtians, as vile and every way as bad, as any of the heathens were, but the main body of chriſtians are another ſort of perſons, they have not only better principles but they practiſe better; the bad among them are not ſo bad, do not run to the ſame exceſs of riot, and the good among them are far better.</p>
            <p>So that, I think, I may ſtill adhere to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I laid down, that the ſtate of mankind requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſupernatural revelation; that this was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to relieve them amidſt their prevailing darkneſs and depravity. Nor can it be ſaid, that it hath not this tendency, or where it is truly received, has not this effect, in ſome meaſure. I go on now to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther propoſition, which I ſhall inſiſt upon but briefly.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That it is reaſonable to expect God ſhould give ſuch a revelation. How much this was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you have heard; and that we might expect it may be proved. I ſhall only offer two things for this purpoſe.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It may be argued, with ſome probability, from the attributes of God. His mercy is ſuch as would incline him to pity his creatures in their deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances, groaping after him in the dark, and led captive by the devil. His wiſdom alſo encourages the expectation. By the fall, man was ſo diſabled, and by a courſe of ſin, the world was become ſo degenerate, a mere maſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and corruption; that had not God interpoſed, I cannot ſee but this part of the creation muſt have been loſt to all the purpoſes of religion: all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between God and man muſt have been cut
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028262_0042_0FD7F4330D734C60"/>off, at leaſt, in a great meaſure; God muſt have abandoned man, and man muſt have lived without God in the world. Now God's gracious purpoſe of redemption being ſuppoſed, it ſeems reaſonable to expect there ſhould be a revelation from him, enabling man to anſwer the ends of his creation, to teach him his duty, fit him to fill his place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the creatures, and prepare him to receive the bleſſings intended through a redeemer. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,</item>
               <item>2. Some of the wiſeſt and greateſt men among the heathens had ſuch an expectation. Thus <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> is brought in by <hi>Plato,</hi> expreſſing his ſenſe that they wanted a divine revelation; and therefore, having taken notice of the uncertainty they were at, as to ſome things, after their utmoſt inquiries, he tells his diſciples, that he thought it beſt to wait patiently till ſuch a time, as they ſhould learn cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, how they ought to behave themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and towards man; and then, after ſome diſcourſe upon the ſubject, he intimates his apprehenſion, that a divine perſon will appear and take the miſt from before their eyes. This is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by ſome,<note n="*" place="bottom">

All the uſe I make of it is this, that as the world exceedingly needed a revelation; ſo it is evident hence, that one of their greateſt men, the greateſt and wiſeſt among them, had a conviction that they needed it. He ſaw they were plunged in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and could not find the way to extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, could not attain to a clearneſs and certainty in things; and therefore, as he found the neceſſity of it, ſo he had a preſage in his own mind, I do not know but it might be from heaven, that God would

            </list>
            <p>Thus I have advanced pretty far towards the main point deſigned, and ſhall only ſubjoin here one propoſition more.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Suppoſing it reaſonable to expect a revelation from God, and that there is ſuch a thing in the world, I think it certain our Bible muſt be that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Two conſiderations will ſupport this propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is no other book that pretends to be a revelation from God, that can have an equal claim to be ſo, or that ſo well deſerves to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as ſuch. As to the books of nature, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural law, I have already ſaid the Bible doth not exclude that. The Scriptures contain nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to natural religion, but compriſe it, explain, and improve it; they take in all that is valuable and truly deduced from the principles of reaſon, among the philoſophers. So that there needs be no oppoſition between the one and the other. If philoſophy be ſet up as a competitor with the Bible, you have heard how very defective it is, and enough I think has been ſaid to diſgrace its pretences.</p>
            <p>As to the books of Moſes, they are a part of Scripture revelation. There remains therefore, but one book more of any account in the world, that can be called a competitor, and that is the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> the Bible or pretended revelation of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> and his followers. And if the queſtion be, whether that, or the chriſtian Bible, be truly a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from heaven? we need but compare them together, and it will be eaſy to make a judgment. Concerning the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> let me remark a few things without enlargement: as that what is valuable in it, is generally taken from our Bible; and then it is, for the greateſt part of it, ſuch a jargon, a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of incoherent nonſenſe as renders it unworthy
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028262_0044_0FD7F4371168BDC8"/>of a wiſe man, much more of the infinitely wiſe God. Beſides, there are a great many direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in it, one revelation inconſiſtent with another, laws given, and then revoked, juſt as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion required; which ſhow, it could not be by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration. Further, it propoſes an heaven of ſenſual delights, which it neither becomes man to expect, nor God to promiſe. And in ſhort, all its ſucceſs and progreſs in the world, is owing to the ſword and outward violance; which certainly are characters that ſufficiently diſparage it. It follows therefore, either that the Bible is a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, or there is no ſuch thing in the world. To which let me add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Bible is a revelation, every way worthy of God; ſuch as we might expect, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God ſhould afford mankind ſo great a favor as a ſupernatural revelation. My time is gone, and I have, it may be, ſtaid long enough on theſe things; or I might let you ſee the ſeveral general characters of this revelation, which would make it at leaſt probable that it is from God. Let me only juſt mention ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>It comprehends, as I ſaid before, all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the books of the moral philoſophers. They have indeed their enlargements, their fine ſayings, and ornaments, which are not to be found in the ſame form in the Bible. But there is no moral law or duty, no neceſſary rule of life and practice, in any of them, but the Bible takes it in. Not to ſay, that as it delivers all with greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſo it enforces all with higher motives and arguments.</p>
            <p>It corrects the miſtakes of the philoſophers, blots out their errata. It delivers the precepts of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence and love, without reſtraining that affection as they did to friends only. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends juſtice and charity, without admitting
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028262_0045_0FD7F4385AE75440"/>revenge. In a word, it contains the law of right reaſon in a more correct edition than is to be found elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Again, it ſupplies the defects of natural religion, and particularly, as it is delivered to us in the books of the profeſſed ſtudents thereof, the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. And here, as a concluſion to this diſcourſe, I ſhall juſt mention ſome points of no ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, wherein the philoſophers of the heathen world were at a loſs, and in which our Bible gives us abundant ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>It makes known the great object of all religious worſhip; aſſures us there is a God, and that there is but one God.</p>
            <p>It gives us juſt notions of this God, ſets him forth in the ſeveral perfections of his nature; as a ſpirit of infinite power, wiſdom, goodneſs, every where preſent, unchangeable, and eternal. Now as ſome of the heathens were groſsly ignorant of both theſe points, ſo others knew them but very imperfectly; and yet all acceptable worſhip, all true religion, depends on them.</p>
            <p>The Bible gives us a clear, ſatisfying diſcovery of the origin of the world, and of all things in it. The firſt verſe of the Bible tells us more than we can learn from all the writings of Plato and Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the other wiſe men of old: <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God created the Heavens and the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It aſſerts the doctrine of divine providence in the full extent of it, and lets us know that the ſame power and wiſdom that made the world, conſtantly upholds and governs it; watching over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſuperintending their affairs.</p>
            <p>It informs us of the riſe of evil in the world, which was the great problem of heathen divinity, that about which they could never come to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; acquainting us, that the firſt man ſinning againſt God, corrupted the human nature, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028262_0046_0FD7F43BA24423F8"/>hence the fountain being defiled, the ſtreams that iſſue from it are defiled alſo.</p>
            <p>It reveals the great deſign of God, and the ſcheme for the reſtoration and recovery of guilty, loſt man. It ſets forth a ſaviour, and proclaims reconciliation in his blood: a point of the higheſt uſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to mankind; and yet not one word of it in nature, or in the books of the philoſophers.</p>
            <p>It provides ſupernatural help for us in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all our duties. This it doth by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the holy ſpirit. The heathens, as I have hinted, were convinced of their wants and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity here, but knew nothing of a remedy.</p>
            <p>It calls men up to a divine, ſpiritual intercourſe and converſe with God, as the life and comfort of their minds. Indeed here lies the true ſecret of religion; for which all moral duties and acts of worſhip fit us, and thereby prepare us for heaven. And how little the heathens knew of this by the light of nature, I need not ſay.</p>
            <p>The Bible is full of glorious promiſes ſuited to a chriſtian in all the varieties of his caſe. And I add to all the reſt, it gives him aſſurance of a future ſtate of immortality and bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe are points of the utmoſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to us, and of the higheſt conſolation; points in which natural religion, and the writings of the philoſophers, leave us in the dark, and at a loſs; but wherein our Bible gives us full certainty; they ſhould, methinks, ſerve to recommend it to us as moſt likely to be a revelation from God. I do not ſay, they abſolutely prove it to be ſo; but they may prepare us for the belief of this truth, which is all I intend by them, making it manifeſt, that it is ſuch a revelation as we wanted, and had reaſon to expect.</p>

And that I may do this the more effectually and diſtinctly, I ſhall conſider three things of very great importance in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent argument, and all tending to eſtabliſh the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and divinity of the Scriptures.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> propoſe the following arguments.
<list>
                  <item>1. That our Bible is of equal credit with any other
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028262_0048_0FD7F440F77BE738"/>ancient hiſtory; and conſequently, if it be not true, we have no ſufficient reaſon to receive and believe any ancient book in the world.</item>
                  <item>2. That our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble has greater marks of credibility than any other ancient book. And,</item>
                  <item>3. That the circumſtances of it conſidered, it is morally impoſſible it ſhould not be true.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Bible is of equal credit with any other ancient book; I do not ſay, it has not a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior credit. I ſhall endeavor to prove by and by that it has. But it is enough for my preſent purpoſe to claim an equal credit in behalf of the Bible. And what I aſſert, is, that nothing can be ſaid for any ancient book, any hiſtory wrote before our time, (whether more or leſs ancient is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial) but the ſame may be ſaid for the Bible; nor any thing objected againſt the Bible, as to the truth of it, but the ſame may be urged as ſtrongly againſt that ancient hiſtory, whatever it is. So that if there be ſufficient reaſon to receive and believe any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtory; for inſtance, <hi>Thucydides, Plutarch, Livy,</hi> or <hi>Tacitus:</hi> to believe that theſe books were wrote by the perſons whoſe names they bear, and to whom they are aſcribed, and to believe the facts they relate; there is as good reaſon to receive the Bible, to believe the ſeveral books of it were wrote by ſuch and ſuch perſons who paſs for the writers of them, and to believe the account of things they give, to be genuine and true. This I dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove; and conſequently, that no man can reject the Bible under pretence that it wants evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but he muſt at the ſame time reject all other ancient Books, and turn a perfect <hi>Sceptic</hi> and unbeliever with reſpect to all hiſtory.</p>
            <p>That this may appear, let us examine upon what evidence, what principles and motives, we receive and believe any ancient books or hiſtories. And you will allow me to ſuggeſt here ſomething in the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028262_0049_0FD7F4433237C238"/>negative, to hint what is not neceſſary in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and what cannot be thought an objection againſt them: as</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not neceſſary that we ourſelves ſaw the things done which we are to believe. In this caſe, there would be no proper believing; for faith or believing, is, an aſſent upon the teſtimony; and what a man ſees, he does not receive upon the teſtimony of another, but he knows it by means of his own ſenſes. Nor could we believe any thing that was tranſacted before our own time, or at which we were not preſent.</p>
            <p>Nor is it neceſſary that we ſhould ſee the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian write his book, and put his own name to it. For if this was requiſite, there are few or no hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the world, not to ſay of ancient times, but even of our own, that we could be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
            <p>I the rather mention this to ſtrike at an objection, that I am afraid is lurking in the minds of many, and is at the bottom of their infidelity, though they may not ſpeak out. They never ſaw <hi>Moſes, Chriſt,</hi> nor the apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> for inſtance, how do they know there were ſuch perſons? and that they did or wrote ſuch things? but I aſk, did you ever ſee <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Julius Caeſar, Pompey,</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi> VIII of <hi>England?</hi> and yet do you not believe that there were ſuch perſons? he that doth not believe there were ſuch perſons becauſe he never ſaw them, has ſo far laid aſide the nature of man, that he is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ble of being dealt with in a reaſonable way. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he doth believe, though he never ſaw them, then the not ſeeing <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the believing the Scripture account of them, that there were ſuch perſons, and did ſuch things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould it be any objection againſt believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ancient hiſtory, that there have been, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028262_0050_0FD7F444728F8310"/>are ſome falſe hiſtories in the world. There are cheats and impoſtors we know; but it doth not thence follow, that there are no honeſt men. There is a great deal of trick and juggle, a great deal of falſhood and knavery in the world; but I hope notwithſtanding, that there is ſome ſincerity and truth; otherwiſe, all mutual confidence and truſt would be deſtroyed, there would be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing together, ſociety muſt diſband and break up and mankind either live ſeparate, or put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a ſtate of war; look upon every body as an enemy, and arm for ſelf-defence.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, as bad as the world is, there always have been, and will be ſome upright, honeſt men. While God continues the human race and his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over mankind, he will preſerve ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of juſtice, fidelity, and truth ſo neceſſary to the being and order of ſociety. The pretence therefore, that there have been falſe hiſtories, only bids us be cautious what hiſtories we receive, but not that we receive none, according to the apoſtle's admonition in another caſe, <hi>Beloved, believe not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they are of God; becauſe many falſe prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> There are many falſe hiſtories and falſe men: we ſhould therefore try them before we believe them. But as this does not prove there are no true hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and no honeſt men on whom we may with ſafety depend; ſo it is no argument againſt giving credit to ſuch. Nor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it neceſſary in order to believe an ancient hiſtory or ancient book to be true, that it ſhould be impoſſible for it to be falſe. To expect this is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the world. We do not go upon ſuch evidence in other matters, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and truſt without ſuch high ſecurity. All trade and commerce proceeds upon probabilities, and what we call moral certainty. The merchant
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028262_0051_0FD7F4462A8E0EE8"/>believes there are ſuch and ſuch places in the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies. It is not impoſſible but he may be miſtaken. But the concurring teſtimony of ſo many perſons, gives ſo ſtrong a moral evidence, that he cannot reaſonably queſtion it. Men depend on their ſervants, on their fidelity and honeſty, and often they themſelves, and all they have in the world, are in their power. They put their lives in the hands of their phyſician, and even of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. There is no impoſſibility in it but they may be undone in all theſe dependencies; and yet that is no argument againſt ſuch truſts, or for being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy therein. It is poſſible any morſel of meat you take may poiſon you: but we do not abſtain from eating for all that; it is enough that there is a great deal of wholeſome food, and we have no reaſon to ſuſpect what we take, though it is poſſible it may be pernicious. In a word, as it is the part of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man not to believe a thing purely becauſe it is poſſible to be true, ſo it is equally his part not to reject any thing becauſe it is poſſible it may be falſe. We are to conſider the probabilities of things, the evidences they have, what evidences are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, what they are capable of, and ſhould be thought ſufficient: For as it is folly and raſhneſs to believe without proper and ſufficient evidence, ſo it is unreaſonable not to believe with it, or when we have it. It is poſſible this or that book or hiſtory may be falſe, that any book or hiſtory may be ſo; but then I ſay, if we will exerciſe no faith, no truſt, no dependence but where it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible we ſhould be miſtaken; we muſt believe nothing, truſt no body, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with mankind no more; but withdraw from the world, or at leaſt live in continual jealouſy and fear.</p>
            <p>I would not have this thought impertinent or a digreſſion. I apprehend it to be full to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028262_0052_0FD7F44C96FF5828"/>nor would it appear any great difficulty to prove that moſt of the objections of our deiſts and cavillers at Scripture turn upon this. I do not ſay they make this a formal objection; but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, if they would examine their own minds, and inquire what it is that ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cks with them, it would be found this is all that remains to keep their infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in countenance. They may have learned to flouriſh a little upon other topics of raillery; but puſh them home and this will be their laſt reſort. They cannot pretend to prove the Bible is falſe, or that they can demonſtrate it to be ſo, nor pretend that they have leſs evidence of it, than of other books which yet they believe. But their evaſion is this, theſe things were done a great while ago, we neither ſaw nor knew any thing of them; they may be ſo, but they may be otherwiſe; and we ought to have good proof before we give our faith to we know not what. I fear this is the caſe of a great many among us, that call in queſtion the Bible. But how unreaſonable their cavil is, appears from what has been ſaid. The queſtion concerning the Bible, or any other book, is not, whether it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it may be falſe; but whether we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon to believe it is true. If ſo, certainly our unbelievers muſt be highly faulty, who ſo boldly reject it; eſpecially conſidering the weight and conſequence of the things it propoſes. And they are the more inexcuſable here becauſe they do it upon a pretence that will deſtroy the credit of all hiſtory in the world, turn mankind into <hi>Sceptics,</hi> make them diſtruſt one another, and diſtruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too in every thing.</p>
            <p>But to go back to my point, my argument is, that we have equal evidence that the Bible is true, as that there is any true hiſtory in the world; or that any other ancient book or hiſtory is true. And that this may appear, I told you we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uſt inquire
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028262_0053_0FD7F44E05497460"/>upon what evidence we receive an ancient hiſtory, what evidence is ſufficient to make it paſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually doth make it paſs current, as a true and good hiſtory.</p>
            <p>And I reckon the credit of ancient books de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon ſuch things as theſe,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the perſons, who wrote them, had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge of the things they wrote.</item>
               <item>2. That they were men of integrity. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhows they were not deceived, and this that they would not deceive.</item>
               <item>3. That they wrote at the very time when the facts, they relate, are ſaid to be done, and might be known, publicly known, to be done.</item>
               <item>4. That their account of things be confirmed by the co-temporary writers of good credit, by perſons that lived at the ſame time and had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opportunity to know the facts recorded in the hiſtory. I add,</item>
               <item>5. Any ancient book or hiſtory receives a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty confirmation if it treats of ſubjects of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, in which the intereſts of mankind are highly concerned or at leaſt of a part of mankind: ſo that as it would be carefully examined by others, it was not contradicted by any, but in the main facts of it owned and acknowledged by all.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Were it proper to enlarge on the ſubject in this place, I could ſhow that theſe are the characters and principles upon which the credit of all our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient books ſtands. But as this would carry me into a long diſcourſe, which many of you would account unprofitable ſpeculation, of how great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance ſoever it may be, I ſhall at preſent omit it and inſtead of that ſhall immediately apply myſelf to the point before us, ſhall illuſtrate the ſeveral particulars I have mentioned, in the inſtances of the Bible; ſhow that they all belong to it, and conſequently, that we have reaſon to receive it, as

                  </hi> Originae Sacrae.</note> in a celebrated performance, has abundantly proved this, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moſes,</hi> who has given us the hiſtory of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the world, the fall of man, the promiſe of a ſaviour, the beginning of a church, and the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes and main doctrines of religion. This is a conſiderable part of the Bible, and contains an hiſtory of about 2500 years, and is the foundation of all the reſt. And how excellently <hi>Moſes</hi> was qualified to write this hiſtory, the author I refer to has ſhown at large. His inſpiration, which we chriſtians believe, and of which we have the ſtrongeſt evidence, removes all difficulties at once. But ſetting that aſide, and conſider him only as a common hiſtorian, he had a very exact intelligence of the things he relates, and ſuch as would enable him to write of them in as authentic a manner as any other common hiſtorian in the world.</p>
            <p>As to the four laſt books that go under his name, the hiſtories of <hi>Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy,</hi> he himſelf was an actor in all, and had the chief management of affairs as lawgiver and ruler; every thing was done under his eye and cognizance. So that this part of the hiſtory, excepting the laſt chapter of the laſt book, which gives the ſtory of his death, may be fitly called the hiſtory of Moſes's life and times.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt book, that of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he might learn the contents of it from tradition, which as the piety and intereſt of the firſt patriarchs obliged them to preſerve pure and uncorrupt, ſo their long
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028262_0055_0FD7F4515521F150"/>lives enabled them to do it. All theſe facts paſſed but through a few hands, and could not well be miſunderſtood or miſrepreſented. For inſtance, can we imagine that the grand-children of <hi>Jacob</hi> could be ignorant of the affairs of their family, of their pedigree, and whence they came into <hi>Egypt?</hi> can we imagine a thing ſo remarkable, which was attended with ſo many memorable circumſtances, eſpecially the ſelling of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſhould be forgotten in ſo little a time? Could <hi>Jacob,</hi> the father of theſe <hi>Iſraelites, Moſes</hi> converſed with, be ignorant of the country whence his grand-father <hi>Abraham</hi> came, eſpecially when he himſelf married into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and lived ſo long there in <hi>Laban's</hi> family? could <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was co-temporary with <hi>Shem,</hi> be ignorant of the truth of the flood, when <hi>Shem</hi> from whom he deſcended, was one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſerved in the ark? and can we ſuppoſe <hi>Shem</hi> ignorant of the tranſactions before the flood, when he was born near 100 years before the death of <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> who lived a conſiderable part of his time with <hi>Adam?</hi> So that the knowledge of theſe things would eaſily be conveyed down to <hi>Moſes.</hi> For as <hi>Adam</hi> might carry it down to <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> and <hi>Methuſelah</hi> to <hi>Shem,</hi> ſo it is likely <hi>Shem</hi> lived ſome part of <hi>Jacob's</hi> time, at leaſt of <hi>Iſaac's.</hi> And how ſhort and eaſy the paſſage of ſuch things in the hands of ſuch men, from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> any one may collect.</p>
            <p>Let me further remark here, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a perſon of great wiſdom, judgment and experience, capable of diſtinguiſhing truth from falſhood, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity from impoſture. He was this way at leaſt, as well qualified as any other writer. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> are famed for their learning in all ancient books. They were indeed, the great ſource of learning from whence other nations derived theirs. Now
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028262_0056_0FD7F4635CD6C830"/>the Scripture gives this account of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that as he was brought up in <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> court, ſo he was ſkilled and <hi>learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians,</hi> Acts vii. 22. It is likely he was eminent for his natural and political knowledge. He lived and converſed with the moſt eminent men, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of every profeſſion; and that he did not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the opportunities he had of improving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the text I mentioned witneſſes, which ſays, he was <hi>learned in all their wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſe I would make of this conſideration is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not like to be eaſily impoſed upon. If you allow him to be honeſt and upright, as to which I ſhall ſay ſomething preſently, there is no reaſon to ſuſpect him credulous, and that he would publiſh any thing, the truth of which he had not reaſon to know or believe. For inſtance, had there been any thing abſurd and repugnant to reaſon, in the hiſtory of the creation, of the fall of man, the flood, the dimenſions of the ark, and the like: ſuch a perſon as <hi>Moſes</hi> would not have publiſhed them in the manner he doth. He was a wiſe and learned man, of far greater capacity to know and judge of theſe things, I do not ſay than the poor little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villers of our age, but than moſt men ever ſince of any age.</p>
            <p>So that it is evident, <hi>Moſes</hi> who wrote one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of our Bible, had this firſt qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good hiſtorian in an extraordinary manner. He did not write of things he underſtood not, and of which he had not a ſufficient knowledge.</p>
            <p>It would be too tedious in ſuch a diſcourſe to go through the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>n,</hi> the writers of the other hiſtorical and poetical books of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> Otherwiſe, ſuch an account might be given of their acquaintance with the materials they publiſhed as would be ſatisfactory to modeſt, reaſonable men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:028262_0057_0FD7F465E0BE0CB0"/>
But I paſs to the writers of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the apoſtles and evangeliſts, in whoſe writings are contained the doctrines of the chriſtian religion; and in the hiſtorical part of them the facts upon which the whole of chriſtianity is founded. Now though they had not the learning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they had the qualification I am inſiſting upon, as neceſſary in an hiſtorian, <hi>viz.</hi> a particular acquaintance with the things they wrote. St. <hi>Luke</hi> owns this in the preface to his goſpel, <hi>Luke i.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order, a declaration of thoſe things which are moſt aſſuredly believed amongſt us; even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye-witneſſes, and miniſters of the word:</hi> he adds, <hi>It ſeemeth good to me alſo, having had perfect underſtanding of all things from the very firſt, to write to thee in order, moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Theophilus, &amp;c.</hi> They did not write with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a perfect underſtanding of the things they relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he there intimates; nor could they want this when they were eye-witneſſes of all that paſſed. That they were ſo is plain, ſince we find it inſiſted upon as a neceſſary part of an apoſtle's character, that he muſt have converſed with Chriſt. <hi>Am not I an apoſtle? have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt our Lord?</hi> ſays the apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 1. he was <hi>born out of due time,</hi> as he tells us, had not ſeen Chriſt on earth; and therefore to ſupply that defect, Chriſt appeared to him in heaven. The apoſtles were not only ſelect men, choſen of God; but were eye-witneſſes of the majeſty of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 16. <hi>They had heard and ſeen, had looked upon, and their hands had handled the word of life,</hi> The great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their teſtimony, 1 <hi>John.</hi> i. 1.2. This I ſay was of abſolute neceſſity, and therefore when <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das's</hi> place was to be filled up, one muſt be choſen that had <hi>accompanied with them all the time that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus went in and out among them,</hi> Acts i. 21. An
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028262_0058_0FD7DAAF8486FB38"/>apoſtle was a witneſs of Chriſt, and that he might be aſſured of the matters he was to teſtify, it was neceſſary he ſhould perſonally converſe with Chriſt, hear his doctrine, ſee his miracles, and have a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible evidence of the truth of all he was to bear witneſs of.</p>
            <p>It would add ſome ſtrength to this ſhould I ſhew you, what is exceeding evident concerning them, that theſe perſons were ſo far from being credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t they were with difficulty brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ral of the main articles of their doctrine and teſtimony. They could not tell how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the notion of their maſter's death, and could ſcarce be perſuaded of his reſurrection. Thus it is ſaid, when he appeared to them after his reſurrection <hi>that they believed not,</hi> Luke xxiv. 41. They believed not till he <hi>opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they might underſtand the Scriptures.</hi> And you read of <hi>Thomas</hi> in particular, one of their number; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he declared, he would not believe, unleſs he ſhould <hi>ſee in his hands the print of the nails, put his finger into the print of the nail, and thruſt his hand into his ſide,</hi> John xx. 25. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that theſe witneſſes were not prepared to report any thing, but muſt be convinced of the things before they could believe them themſelves and report them to others.</p>
            <p>Now I think it is evident, that the apoſtles and evangeliſts, muſt on this account be eſteemed very authentic and ſufficient witneſſes. It is a rule in the civil law, that teſtimony upon hearſay, is not valid; becauſe, ſay the civilians, witneſſes are to teſtify the truth, and not the poſſibility of things; which is agreeable to the law of nature, and every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Witneſſes are to tell what they themſelves have ſeen and heard, and not what others report. And thus did the apoſtles of our Lord.</p>
            <p>So that this firſt and moſt neceſſary character is
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028262_0059_0FD7F468E96726D0"/>found in the writers of the Bible. They had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge of the things they wrote.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As they were acquainted with the facts they publiſhed, ſo they were perſons of integrity, and may be depended on in the account they give. The former is neceſſary that they might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on themſelves, and this is neceſſary that they might not impoſe on others. And in how eminent a manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they poſſeſſed this character, might be ſhewn at large, would the time and your patience allow me to inſiſt on the argument.</p>
            <p>As for Moſes, he has many characters of great openneſs, integrity, and ſimplicity. We find him ſpoken of by ancient hiſtorians with a very high encomium, as alſo by Stephen who repreſents him as exceeding fair, as learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians, as mighty in word and deed; and yet theſe things he himſelf paſſes over, without any mention at all; though he takes very particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his own infirmaties; as his want of eloquence, and being <hi>ſlow of ſpeech,</hi> Exod. iv. 10; his impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Numb. xi. 10; his unbelief, Numb. xx. 12; his rebelling againſt the commandment of God, with which God was ſo far diſpleaſed that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him the promiſed land, Numb. xxvii. 14; of his great anger, Exod. xi. 8; and of his being very wroth, Numb. xvi. 5. He takes notice of his declining the meaſures God calls him to over and over; aſcribes the new modelling of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to Jethro's advice; and not to his own wiſdom and policy. In ſhort, he neither ſpares his people nor himſelf, but ſets forth their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and apoſtacies, and his own weakneſſes and frailties with all imaginable freedom. And when he came to die was ſo far from ſeeking to aggrandize his family, that he leaves them in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and devolves the government upon Joſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:028262_0060_0FD7F469D3F39EC8"/>
I will add one conſideration more, which I think a glorious inſtance of Moſes's integrity, and that he was fully convinced of the truth of what he wrote, and the juſtice of the cauſe he eſpouſes, <hi>viz.</hi> his forſaking the honors and advantages of a court, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> his turning his back on all the preferment he mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> have expected there. This the apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as a proof of his ſelf-denial, that he <hi>refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaoh's daughter; chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> And I think it no leſs a proof of the conviction he had of the call of God, and that he engaged in the office he undertook upon principles of religion and ſincerity. In a word, there is nothing that looks like ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vanity and a ſelfiſh deſign in any of the writings, or any part of the conduct of Moſes; nothing that ſavours of counterfeit and impoſture: but a great air of ſimplicity, ſelf-denial and honeſty appears in all.</p>
            <p>The ſame I might ſhew with reference to the apoſtles and writers of the New Teſtament. Give me leave to ſele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t a few inſtances. That they were no cheats, and did not deſign an impoſture, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the world by fraud, is evident from a great many particulars in their character and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. I will but juſt mention three or four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were plain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>terate men, no way qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to manage ſo great and high an impoſture as they were con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſtrangers.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028262_0061_0FD7F46B8BE81880"/>to the arts of politicians, ſhould be capable of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on ſo deep an intrigue, inventing ſuch ſtories as the goſpel contains, and palming them upon mankind. That they ſhould undertake it is not reaſonable to be ſuppoſed; but that they ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in it, as actually they did, againſt all the power and learning of the world, exceeds even the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt imagination that can be formed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The doctrine they preached to the world was ſuch as ſhews it could not be a contrivance of their own; but that they faithfully delivered what they had received and learned from above. Had it been of their own framing, they would certainly have ſuited it more to the genius and guſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Whereas nothing was more contrary thereto. They lay reſtraints upon the darling paſſions of all ſorts of men; the ambitious, the covetous, and the voluptuous; and call them to the ungrateful duties of mortification and ſelf denial. Inſtead of falling in with the common prejudices of the world, and of their own countrymen particularly, who expected a pompous triumphant Meſſiah, they conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him under the low and ignominious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of one crucified, than which nothing could be more offenſive, being to the <hi>Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs.</hi> They inſiſt upon the abrogation and repeal of the ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh law,</hi> which they knew their nation would never bear; having the higheſt zeal for that law, and being perſuaded it muſt abide for ever. They declare with the greateſt freedom againſt pagan idolatry, endeavor to demoliſh the altars of their gods, and pour contempt upon their ſacred rites. They ſet themſelves to oppoſe the traditions and cuſtoms that were held moſt venerable, both among Jews and Gentiles; and as was complained of them, <hi>turned the world upſide down.</hi> Now I would aſk any reaſonable perſon, whether if they had been
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028262_0062_0FD7F4713B27A570"/>impoſtors, had publiſhed a hiſtory and a doctrine out of their own heads, they would have laid the beginning in ſo unpopular a manner? certainly, had they deſigned to win proſelytes by inventions of their own, they would have made their inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more agreeable, more like to have gained on thoſe they hoped to deceive.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are eminent marks of ſincerity in their writings. How freely do they publiſh their own faults? their pride, ambition, cowardice, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, emulation, and the like. They tell you that one of themſelves betrayed their maſter, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them denied him, that all of them forſook him and fled. They publiſh a ſhameful ſtory of themſelves, that they contended which of them ſhould be greateſt. And Matthew leaves a cenſure upon his former life, which Euſebius obſerves is mentioned by none but himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had been a <hi>publican and ſat at the receipt of cuſtom,</hi> a thing of very ill fame at that time. Peter, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Mark wrote his goſpel under his conduct, as is generally thought, ſets forth his denying his maſter with all the aggravations of the ſin, more than is to be found in the reſt of the evangeliſts; but paſſes over very ſlightly the account of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>Now theſe, and the like, are ſuch inſtances of ſimplicity, humility, and honeſty, as are never to be found among impoſtors and writers of falſe hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. They generally take care to ſecure their own reputation, and make themſelves the heroes of the ſtory, and to ſerve their party and their cauſe at any rate. But as theſe writers are free from ſuch blemiſhes, and thus on all occaſions lay open their own infirmities, it is a good argument they had no cauſe to ſerve but that of truth. I might add,</p>
            <p n="4">4. They could propoſe to themſelves no worldly
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028262_0063_0FD7F4723A59F918"/>advantage, but fully expected reproach, perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, poverty, and all ſorts of ſufferings, as what would attend and follow the cauſe they had eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And accordingly it ſell out. But yet,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Notwithſtanding they perſiſted in their ſtory even to death, and ſealed their teſtimony with their blood. Not one of them ever recanted, or ever owned himſelf an impoſtor.</p>
            <p>Now to ſuppoſe theſe men were cheats, that they did not themſelves believe the truth of what they publiſhed to the world, is I think to ſuppoſe human nature in them different from what it is in all others. One muſt really change it into another thing in them, quite different from what we know it and feel it to be in ourſelves, before he can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that herein they acted a part and deſigned to deceive. For let us ſuppoſe them cunning enough to have forged their hiſtory, and hammered the ſcheme of the goſpel out of their own heads, which yet I think is impoſſible, and let us ſuppoſe them wicked enough to have undertaken it. Yet I aſk, what motive could they have to do it? would they be at all this pains, and guilty of all this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>leneſs, for no other end but to be undone in this world, and damned in the next? as they muſt know was their due, if they believed another ſtate.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid may let us ſee that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Bible were qualified to publiſh a true hiſtory. What follows will more fully prove that their hiſtory is certainly true; otherwiſe there is no true hiſtory in the world. I proceed therefore to illuſtrate the next particular requiſite in an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic hiſtorian.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They wrote at the time when the facts they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late are ſaid to have been done; and I add, thoſe facts are of ſuch a nature that it could not but be publicly known, whether they were done or not.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028262_0064_0FD7F47A4D709CE0"/>Cheats generally lay the ſcene at a great diſtance, when none alive is capable of diſpro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing them. Thus the heathen mythologiſts tell ſtrange ſtories of things tranſacted many ages ago, no body knows when nor where. But the writers of the Bible report things done in their own times, and freſh in the memory of multitudes to whom they appeal.</p>
            <p>That Moſes did ſo, is evident to any one that peruſes his hiſtory. He wrote when that generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was alive that was concerned in the main ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his book. And he publiſhed ſuch things that it is impoſſible he ſhould have impoſed them upon the people, had they been falſe. For inſtance, the ten plagues of Egypt, their deliverance out of that land, their paſſage through the red ſea, the drowning of Pharaoh and his hoſt therein, with the many ſurpriſing circumſtances that attended that event; the feeding them in the wilderneſs by the conſtant miracle of manna, the iſſuing water out of the rock at Horeb upon Moſes's ſmiting it with his rod, the defeat of Amalek, the giving the law at mount Sinai, the pillar of fire, and of a cloud, which conducted their march through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the deſtruction of Corah, Dathan, and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, with their company, the earth opening her mouth and ſwallowing them up. Now I would aſk any impartial perſon, whether there was room for impoſture here? could not this people tell whether they had ſeen any of the wonders in Egypt, Moſes gives ſo particular an account of? could they not tell, whether they had paſſed through the ſea? or had ſeen the Egyptians drowned therein? whether they had been fed with manna or not? and heard the thunders of Sinai, and ſeen the glory of the Lord there?</p>
            <p>I might take notice, could I here expatiate, that there were ſeveral circumſtances of theſe events, which rendered them ſo remarkable and notorious,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028262_0065_0FD7F47D97056AD8"/>that it is not poſſible they ſhould be miſtaken. Thus when the law was delivered at Sinai, the people were commanded to prepare themſelves for it three days beforehand; and it is ſaid that all the people ſaw the thundering and lightning, and beheld the mountain ſmoaking, which filled them with ſo much terror, that they ſtood afar off, and deſired Moſes might mediate between them and the Lord, and that the Lord might not ſpeak any more leaſt they ſhould die. And we read, that <hi>the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was upon it by night, in the ſight of all the houſe of Iſrael, throughout all their journies,</hi> Exod. xl. 38. And ſo great a regard had they to it, that it preſcribed and determined all their marches whilſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Whether it was two days or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, the children of Iſrael abode in their tents and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed,</hi> Numb. ix. 22. So the manna was their conſtant ſupply till the day after they had eaten of the corn of Canaan, and then it ceaſed, Joſh. v. 12. So long alſo their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laſted without any decay, Deut. xxix. 5. This Moſes relates in his hiſtory. Whether it was fact or no, there were as many witneſſes as there were people; their eyes, their ears, all their ſenſes were witneſſes whether theſe things were ſo. Had not they been true, or had they been otherwiſe than is related, thouſands might have ſtood forth and diſcredited the whole ſtory; and ſuppoſing them falſe, I dare defy any unbeliever in the world to give a reaſonable account why they did not.</p>
            <p>Let me obſerve further, as what very much ſtrengthens the argument, that we find Moſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf making a ſolemn appeal to them concerning theſe facts. Conſult the paſſage, <hi>Deut.</hi> xi. from <hi>ver.</hi> 2, to the 8th, <hi>And know you this day: for I ſpeak not with your children which have not known, and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028262_0066_0FD7F47EE07D8140"/>which have not ſeen the chaſtiſement of the Lord your God, his greatneſs, his mighty hand, and his ſtretched out arm; and his miracles, and his acts which he did in the midſt of Egypt, unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; and what he did unto the army of Egypt, to their horſes, and to their chariots, how he made the water of the red ſea overflow them; and what he did unto you in the wilderneſs, until ye came to this place; and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, how the earth opened her mouth and ſwallowed them up, their houſholds, tents, and all the ſubſtance in their poſſeſſion in the midſt of all Iſrael. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t your eyes have ſeen all the great acts of the Lord, which he did,</hi> You ſee he appeals to the people themſelves as witneſſes, eye-witneſſes of what he ſaith, and what he records; which he could never have done, had he acted the impoſtor, and deſigned to have impoſed upon them a narrative of ſtrange things, without any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that the people were not witneſſes of all the hiſtory he relates; that in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis particularly. They knew nothing of the creation, the flood, and affairs of the patriarchs. Theſe things were at a great diſtance, and Moſes might here impoſe on their credulity.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that beſide the extraordinary character of Moſes's ſidelity, he gave ſuch proofs of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration, (of which hereafter) that he could not be ſuſpected. But more directly to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I ſay, that it was ſcarce poſſible for Moſes to forge this part of his hiſtory, and make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe it. Theſe things paſſed through but a few hands, as remarked before, and the memory of them was eaſily preſerved. Granting there were above two thouſand years from the creation to Moſes, yet if Adam, Methuſelah and Shem, lived the far greateſt part of them, they ought to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed no more than three generations. And
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028262_0067_0FD7F4806FA3C530"/>therefore, allowing for the length of men's lives at that time, the diſtance from the flood to Moſes, cannot be computed ſo much as from the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preſent year. Now is it poſſible that ſuch things as Moſes's hiſtory contains, ſhould be invented by an hiſtorian at this time, and the nation made to believe them? could any man in his ſenſes be made to believe that Henry VIII, was the firſt king of England, that there was a deluge in his time that took off all the inhabitants of the iſland, except ſeven or eight perſons, or that at the revolution, the Thames was diverted from its proper channel, and the prince of Orange paſſed over with his army on dry land. And yet this, as abſurd as it appears, might as eaſily be believed among us, as what Moſes ſays of the deluge, and of the children of Iſrael's deliverance out of Egypt, by the people of his time, had it not been true. Several hundred years were no more, by a juſt computation, conſidering how much longer men lived than they do now, than one hundred years is with us, a thouſand years, not much more than a hundred now, in one part of the period, and but about equal to two hundred in another part of the period. And upon this principle, I do affirm, it was no more poſſible for Moſes to invent the things of an earlier date in his hiſtory, and bring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his age to believe them, than it would be for a cunning ſophiſter to contrive a legend of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious things done at, or ſince the reformation, and make them paſs current among us.</p>
            <p>Some may farther object, that the hiſtory we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to Moſes, might not be wrote at the time that is pretended, but might be the invention of later times. But that there is not the leaſt probability of this. I think I could demonſtrate, was the pulpit the proper place for ſuch an argument, and the auditory prepared to attend to it. I will only mention a few
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028262_0068_0FD7F481D57BC568"/>things, that would admit of greater enlargement.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Moſes was univerſally owned as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver of the Jews. That people themſelves uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally believed this, and have in all ages paid the utmoſt veneration to his memory. Nor did any of the moſt ancient heathen writers pretend to deny, there was ſuch a perſon as Moſes, or queſtion, whether he gave laws to the Jewiſh nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The objector cannot give any account when, or by whom, this hiſtory, and theſe facts related in the five books we aſcribe to Moſes, were forged. He cannot tell us the name of this imaginary hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian that perſonated Moſes; tell us when he lived, nor produce any authentic vouchers of the thing he ſuppoſes. So that in reaſon, the objection ought to be looked upon a mere cavil, and ſuch as might be made againſt any other book in the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is moſt abſurd to imagine theſe things ſhould be the invention of later times, or of any time. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The whole polity and government of the Jews was founded upon their laws. Not only their religion, but civil rites depended upon them, their courts of juſtice, their private privileges, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral properties, their inheritances, all depended upon, and were regulated by the laws ſaid to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the miniſtry of Moſes. Now let any one conſider, whether it be poſſible for any impoſtor to contrive a body of laws, and when he has done, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them upon a whole nation, and perſuade them to ſubmit all their rights, claims and privileges, to the deciſion of thoſe laws. He that ſuppoſes this is the caſe of the Jews, ſuppoſes a thing altogether ſingular, and what never came to paſs in any other nation in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many of their laws were of that nature, that one cannot with the leaſt reaſon, think they would have received them, had they not been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they were divine. How but thenſome a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028262_0069_0FD7F48661662008"/>circumciſion? how coſtly and troubleſome their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, with all the numerous precepts about eating, uncleanneſs, purgation, waſhing and the like. Theſe things made their law a yoke, as the apoſtle calls it, <hi>which they were not able to bear.</hi> Their weekly ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, was a very great confinement and reſtraint, which they never would have come under upon the motion of a private man, that enjoins ſuch things without authority. And to add only one particular more, their ſabbatical year I reckon a law of ſuch a nature, that it would never have been eſtabliſhed among them upon the credit of an impoſtor. The law in ſhort was, that every ſeventh year their land was to reſt. They were neither to ſow their ground, prune their vineyards, nor to gather any corn or fruits that grew ſpontaneouſly that year, Exod. xxiii. 10, 11. This was a ſtatute that their lawgiver, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, obliged them to. The obſervation of which would have expoſed them to the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and diſtreſs, without the ſpecial interpoſition and bleſſing of heaven for their relief. That they might juſtly apprehend this, is intimated, Lev. xxv. 20, 21, 22. <hi>And if ye ſhall ſay, what ſhall we eat the ſeventh year? behold we ſhall not ſow nor gather in our increaſe.</hi> It follows by way of anſwer, <hi>Then will I command my bleſſing upon you in the ſixth year, and it ſhall bring forth fruit for three years, and ye ſhall ſow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year, until her fruits come in ye ſhall eat of the old ſtore.</hi> Here was you ſee, a law that caſt them entirely upon an extraordinary providence, for two years. The ſixth year was to afford proviſion for three years. Now I aſk any conſiderate perſon, whether he can reaſonably ſuppoſe they would have embraced ſuch a law from an impoſtor? or if they had not thought it to be from heaven? I aſk fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they did receive it, as it is certain they did, was this ſecurity given them, of an extraordinary
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028262_0070_0FD7F492A3F5F2A8"/>bleſſing the ſixth year, made good or not? If not, that of itſelf would have diſcovered the cheat. If it was made good, it is a full evidence the law was divine,</p>
            <p>So that conſidering the nature of theſe laws, I think it a demonſtration, they could not be the contrivance of any, but were given by Moſes, and that by the ſpecial appointment of heaven, as he affirms. The reaſon is, they would not otherwiſe have received them. They were ſo much againſt their caſe and their preſent intereſts, had not God made up all to them by a peculiar providence, they had ſo much of burden in them, that no leſs autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than that by which Moſes acted, and which they knew he was inveſted with, could have inforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them upon them. Their heathen neighbors laughed at them as a fooliſh people, for throwing away a ſeventh part of their time; becauſe they kept the weekly ſabbath, and would they have yielded not only to this, but to a ſabbatical year, and to many other cumberſome obſervances, if they had not had a full conviction of Moſes's commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the divine authority of their laws.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The methods taken to inſtruct the people, both in the law from the firſt promulgation of it, and in matters of fact from the time that they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; were ſuch as leaves no room for impoſture. They were all of them obliged to the moſt careful ſtudy of the law, and to propagate the knowledge of it in their families: <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day,</hi> (ſays their legiſlator) <hi>ſhall be in thine heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſhall talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, when thou walkeſt by the way, when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> Add to that, every ſeventh year, at the end of the year, the book of the law was brought forth and read in the audience of all the people, men, women, children, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028262_0071_0FD7F4949AFCA930"/>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxi. 10. The autograph or original book of Moſes, as ſome think, was then produced that the people might hear their law recited in the words in which Moſes left it.</p>
            <p>Now it muſt be remembered, that this book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not only their decalogue, their ordinances of worſhip, ſacrifices and ceremonies, their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of feſtivals, and the like; but alſo the hiſtory of God's providence towards them, the judgments he had wrought among them, and the deliverances he had wrought for them. Theſe they often heard read, theſe they read themſelves, and were ſo well acquainted with, that Joſephus tells us, they knew them as perfect as their own names. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of that people, of the main body of them at leaſt, I would demand, could it be poſſible for any man after Moſes's time to invent ſuch a book, and perſuade people to receive it? to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a narrative of ſuch facts, and prevail with a whole nation to own them as facts, though they knew nothing of them, and though they could not but know they were falſe?</p>
            <p>The books were in their hands, and in their hearts, as you have heard. Now there muſt be a time when theſe books were firſt read. If it was a long time after the facts were done, could not the people tell, whether they had ever heard of ſuch things before, as the plagues in Egypt, the dividing the red ſea, the delivering the law at mount Sinai, and the miracles in the wilderneſs? and if they knew all theſe things, the point is granted I am plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, the book was wrote, when we ſay it was wrote, in Moſes's time, and when a great part of the generation remained, that had ſeen the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions there deſcribed. If they knew them not, how came they to receive a book that relates ſuch ſtrange things, and not only ſo, but appeals to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028262_0072_0FD7F4961775DFE8"/>as knowing them. He that can ſuppoſe this, is ſtrangely prepoſſeſſed in favor of infidelity, and indeed prepared to believe any thing, but the Bible.</p>
            <p>Let me add, they had public memorials of many of their great events. To ſay nothing of the names of perſons, and places, which were given at the time of this or that event, and deſigned to perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the memory of it; ſome of their feſtivals were of this nature. Their paſſover was a monument raiſed up to preſerve the memory of their deliverance from Egypt, and of the ſlaying the firſt-born there. The feaſt of tabernacles was a memorial of their dwelling in booths in the wilderneſs. Aaron's rod, the pot of manna, the golden cenſor, the braſen ſerpent; theſe and the like were ſtanding records of great and eminent providences towards that nation.</p>
            <p>And two things I infer from them, <hi>viz.</hi> that as they were monuments, public records of ancient facts expounded to the people and well underſtood by them, they could not be ignorant of theſe facts. The feaſt of the paſſover was a conſtant memorial of what happened in Egypt, and whilſt it was yearly repeated among them, they could not forget that great ſalvation. And further, as theſe memorials took riſe, and were inſtituted immediately, upon ſuch events to which they refer, the hiſtory of theſe facts could not be the forgery of after times.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſufficiently proved, that Moſes's hiſtory was wrote at the time when the facts they relate are ſaid to be done, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> could not be an invention of a later date. You will excuſe me for inſiſting on ſuch things. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>am ſenſible they will be leſs acceptable to thoſe, that never had their thoughts employed about ſubjects of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But as I am perſuaded of their importance, ſo, I hope, in the progreſs of theſe diſcourſes, to make you ſenſible of their uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:028262_0073_0FD7F497B3017AD8"/>
Some may aſk probably, though we allow the hiſtory to be as ancient as is deſired, how doth it appear that Moſes was the writer of it? I anſwer, it was conſtantly believed by the Jews themſelves: other places of Scripture aſcribe it to him; it was owned by the moſt ancient writers among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, at leaſt he was owned by them as the Jewiſh lawgiver. As for the objections of Spinoſa, Hobbs, and father Simon, I apprehend it would be thought tedious, ſhould I go about to conſider them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly. They all amount to little more than this, that ſome paſſages in the Pentateuch could not be written by Moſes; and, I muſt declare, I know no inconvenience in allowing they might be inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome after-writer; as, for inſtance, by Ezra; though I am ſatisfied moſt of thoſe they inſiſt on, may fairly be accounted for, without any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
            <p>I next proceed to conſider the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And what I have here to aſſert and maintain is, that the facts there recorded were publicly done, and the hiſtory wrote at the very time when it might be known, whether they were done or not.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe, I think, I need not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at large upon that ſubject. The doctrine, the miracles of Chriſt and his apoſtles were none of them concealed; but all things were tranſacted in the preſence of their enemies, and expoſed to their view. Hence our Lord pleads in his own defence before the high prieſt, <hi>I ſpake openly to the world, I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always reſort; and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing.</hi> And both the goſpels, and the hiſtory of the Acts, inform us of the miracles the apoſtles wrought in the moſt populous cities, at Jeruſalem, Samaria, Antioch, and other places. How eminent an event was the effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt upon the apoſtles on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt;
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028262_0074_0FD7F499AA4B0E90"/>and how viſible and public the effects of it. They were enabled to work miracles, and to ſpeak with all ſorts of tongues, which they did in the preſence of a multitude of people from all parts of the world. At that great feſtival, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was filled not only with the natives of Judea, but with the Jews of the diſperſion. They came from the eaſt as far as Perſia and Media; from the weſt, as far as Rome and Lybia; from the ſouth, as far as Arabia; and from the north, as far as Parthia, and many provinces of Aſia the leſs. Now in this convention, in the midſt of ſuch an aſſembly, and in the moſt public manner, the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and preachers of Chriſt gave a ſpecimen of the extraordinary power with which they were indued from on high, and ſpake all kinds of languages they had never learned: an aſtoniſhing thing! at which the auditory were all amazed: <hi>Are not theſe Gallileans?</hi> ſay they, <hi>and how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, as the facts recorded in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were done in the face of the world, ſo the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was publiſhed in that age, and whilſt the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were alive. That it was thus early publiſhed is evident, ſince it mentions the temple and nation of the Jews as ſtill ſubſiſting: ſo that conſequently, it muſt be written before the deſtruction of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. The Acts of the Apoſtles, were wrote by St. Luke, ſoon after St. Paul's going to Rome, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which he gives at the cloſe of that hiſtory. Now this was but about twenty years, after our Lord's reſurrection. And you find he there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his goſpel, as wrote before that time. But I need not ſtand to prove what none of the enemies of chriſtianity dare take upon them to deny. Hobbs himſelf owns, that the writers of the New Teſtament lived all in leſs than an age after Chriſt's aſcenſion, and had ſeen our Lord, or been his diſciples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:028262_0075_0FD7F49B79BA07C8"/>
The purpoſe I bring this for, is, to ſhew that the hiſtory of the New Teſtament, muſt be unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably true; otherwiſe, the writers of it would never have publiſhed it to the world, and in the midſt of their enemies of all ſorts, when ſo many thouſands were living that could have detected the falſhood. The books they wrote, were immediately diſperſed, read in all chriſtian aſſemblies, as Juſtin Martyr aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, And the apoſtles and firſt preachers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, always inſiſted upon the great facts of them, the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and the miracles that were wrought, <hi>God ſtill working with them, confirming their words with ſigns following.</hi> To which may be added, that the next chriſtians,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The next chriſtians in the age after the apoſtles.]</hi> Remarkable to this purpoſe, is that of Quadratus, who as Euſebius aſſures us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated and preſented an apology for the chriſtian religion to the emperor Adrian, about the year 120: in which were theſe words, <hi>The works of our Saviour were always conſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Thoſe that were healed, ſuch as were raiſed from the dead, did not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after they were healed, and raiſed, but alſo were afterwards ſeen of all, and that not only whilſt our ſaviour was converſant upon earth, but alſo after he was gone; they continued alive a great while, inſomuch that ſome of them ſurvived even to our times.</hi> Euſebius declares in the ſame place, that this book of Quadratus was extant among many of the brethren in his time, and that he himſelf had it, Eccleſ. Hid. L. iv. c. 3. And we have another obſervable paſſage to the ſame effect in the epiſtle of Irenaeus to Florinus, where that father, who flouriſhed before the year 170, ſpeaks of his being with Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp in his youth, whoſe perſon and diſcourſes he perfectly rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embered, the converſation, he uſed to ſay, he had with St John, and others, that had ſeen the Lord: and what Polycarp had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning our Saviour, his doctrine and miracles, from thoſe who had been the eye witneſſes, all exactly agreeing with the ſcriptures. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now I appeal to any reaſonable perſon, whether this looks like impoſture, or whether there be any inſtance in the whole world, of an impoſture that
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028262_0076_0FD7F49CEA1DAD60"/>comes up to it? Would the apoſtles have taken this method, and have expoſed themſelves to the contempt of mankind, had they not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own integrity, and aſſured that none of their enemies could contradict what they ſay? They report to the world that their maſter roſe again, that the jews ſealed the ſepulchre, that they craved a watch of Pilate to guard it, that the guard run away, and that the chief prieſts, and others, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſoldiers to ſay, while they ſlept, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came and ſtole him away. They affirmed, that a perſon born lame, and known to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Jeruſalem, by begging daily at a gate of the temple, was cured by Peter, only with invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the name of Jeſus, Acts iii. 6.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like things, they report and write, and you will conſider, that they do not write in a remote country and age, but at the very time when, and in the very place where, the matters were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted: which I think ſo ſtrong an argument of the truth of their hiſtory, that all the cavils of infidelity can never ſhake it.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome may object, that in all this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, we appeal to the hiſtory itſelf, and are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that for granted, which is the queſtion. We ſuppoſe that there were ſuch perſons as Moſes, as Chriſt and the apoſtles; that they did ſuch things, and that their hiſtory was wrote at ſuch times. But this, ſaith the unbeliever, wants to be proved. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is certain theſe hiſtories are now in the world, and I dare ſay, the objector will not pretend they were wrote either this or the laſt century. I demand therefore, when they were wrote? who wrote them? who invented the ſtories of Moſes and Chriſt, and when they were invented. It is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect from them, that they ſhould fix upon ſomething as certain, in oppoſition to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we give; which yet, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> confident, they
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028262_0077_0FD7F49E803AC2F8"/>will not pretend to; and conſequently, this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection muſt paſs for a cavil.</p>
            <p>However, I ſhall more directly conſider it, and remove the difficulty that it ſeems to throw in our way, which will bring me to the next head, viz. That we do not depend purely on the authority of the hiſtorians of the Bible, but have the chief facts confirmed by very ancient, and ſome of them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary writers. Now this, as it fully anſwers the objection I juſt mentioned, ſo it tends very much to confirm the truth of the ſcripture hiſtory. But as the ſubject is too copious to be brought into this diſcourſe, and too important to be paſſed over ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially, I ſhall take leave to reſume it on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion. At preſent, let me make a reflection or two upon what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Bible be true, as I am proving it is; how weighty and important a thing is religion? the doctrines and concerns of which have been handed down to us in the way mentioned there, by ſuch a train of wonderful providences, ſuch ſurpriſing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſuch labors and ſufferings of holy men; and which eclipſes all the reſt, of the Son of God himſelf. The Bible gives that account of theſe things, and makes all ſubſervient to the great ends of religion: that one cannot but infer, it muſt be the moſt important thing in the world. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the church, divine worſhip, God's covenant and promiſes, his favor and eternal life, &amp;c. Theſe muſt certainly be the moſt momentous affairs. They muſt be ſo if the Bible be true; otherwiſe, they had never been ſo much the care of heaven, had never employed the council of God ſo much as they have, if we may believe the Bible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Bible be true, it deſerves our moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and ſerious ſtudy, its ſubject is ſo great, its tendency ſo divine, and we have ſo mighty an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the diſcoveries it makes, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028262_0078_0FD7F4A09871F710"/>it propoſes, that to neglect it, muſt argue great ſtupidity. And indeed, it is to revive and increaſe our veneration for the Bible, and to aſſiſt you in underſtanding and improving it, that I have undertaken theſe diſcourſes, and the exerciſes that may follow. Did we believe the Bible more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with it, and ſtudy it more, it would tend to give us a diſtaſte of many of thoſe little things that fill our time and thoughts. Nor do I ever expect to ſee religion recover its luſtre, till the Bible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers its reputation among us. I do not mean, only reſcued from the contempt of ſuch low tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers as prefer a play book to it; but from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and careleſſneſs with which moſt chriſtians treat it. Were our tempers and frames right, we ſhould only divert and turn aſide to the things of this world, when, and ſo far as the neceſſity of our affairs, and duties of our places obliged us. But the ſtudy of the Bible, and the practice of the great things it directs to, would be the main buſineſs to which our minds ſtood bent. And happy will it be for us, if we find a ſtrong and prevailing bias this way! I have good authority for it, when I ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe delight is in the law of the Lord, and therein doth meditate day and night.</hi>

            <p>I AM endeavoring to prove the Bible is true, and particularly, that it is of equal credit with any other hiſtory in the world. To which purpoſe I have ſhewn,
<list>
                  <item>I. That the perſons who wrote it, had ſufficient opportunities of knowing the things they publiſhed.</item>
                  <item>II. That they were perſons of integrity, who, as they were not deceived themſelves, would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others.</item>
                  <item>III. That they wrote at the time when the facts they relate, are ſaid to be done, and might be known to be done. I now add,</item>
                  <item>IV. The account the writers of the Bible give of things. The particulars of their hiſtory is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by co-temporary, or at leaſt, very ancient writers, that had an opportunity of knowing the facts publiſhed there, and could not be ſuppoſed to be biaſſed in favor of thoſe that publiſhed them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>What can one expect more in an hiſtorian, than that he knows his ſubject, whether the things he publiſhes be true or falſe; that he be a perſon of
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028262_0080_0FD7F4AD5799B3C8"/>unblemiſhed honeſty: that he writes at the very time of action, and when the things he relates were done; and that perſons of the ſame age, who have an opportunity alſo of knowing the ſame things, do not deny, but confirm his account. If theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters be not ſufficient to make an ancient hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an authentic, there is none in the world to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on. Now the writers of the Bible have them all in a degree above any others. I have proved this with reference to the three former par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and am now to do it in relation to the laſt.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt part of the Bible, the hiſtory of Moſes, there may ſeem a defect and want of vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And it muſt be granted, we cannot find co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary writers to confirm Moſes's hiſtory. The reaſon is, there are no ſuch, Moſes being the moſt ancient hiſtorian in the world. And yet ſomething we have to alledge in confirmation of the ſacred hiſtory, and indeed as much as can reaſonably be expected, in the firſt ages of the world. Now this being a point of great nicety, and yet of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in the preſent argument, allow me to make a few obſervations; in which, I ſhall not only let you ſee what footſteps we have of Moſes's hiſtory among the moſt ancient writers, but alſo why we have no more, nor more early vouchers among them. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me obſerve that the ſacred hiſtory, that of Moſes, is properly the hiſtory of the church. After the diſperſion of the ſons of Noah, when the world was relapſed into idolatry, God was pleaſed to ſingle out Abraham and erect a church in his family, to give them a covenant of peculiarity, diſtinguiſhing them by many ſpecial favors and privileges. Thus he tells them, <hi>Deut.</hi> xiv. 2. <hi>Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God; and the Lord hath choſen thee to be a peculiar people unto himſelf, above all the nations that are upon the earth.</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:028262_0081_0FD7F4AEE3C10F98"/>They were a ſeparate peculiar people, had peculiar laws; <hi>he ſhewed his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any nation; and as for his judgments they have not known them,</hi> Pſal. cxlvii. 19, 20. The apoſtle takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 4. <hi>To them pertaineth the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes.</hi> God was pleaſed to incloſe and incorporate this people, for the ſpecial purpoſes of religion, to ſet them apart for himſelf; among them was his taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle and ſhechinah, the ſeat of his worſhip, his ſpecial preſence, the diſplays of his grace, and thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of his wonderful works. Now it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of Moſes, is an hiſtory of facts that more eſpecially concerned this people; of revelations made to them, and of things done among them and for them, that is, of things done within the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The circumſtances of the reſt of the world were ſuch, that no very authentic memoirs, no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular hiſtory, eſpecially of the affairs of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, could be expected from them. They were left out of the pale of the church, and could have but a very imperfect knowledge of what was tranſacted within it. It was the poſterity of Abraham, the children of his grandſon Jacob, that went down into Egypt and ſojourned there, they and their deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants for ſome hundreds of years; who were the perſons that ſaw the miracles in Egypt, and at the red ſea. Theſe were they that received the law at Sinai, and were entertained with that ſurpriſing ſcene of wonders in the wilderneſs, for forty years. The reſt of the nations as they bore no part in theſe things, ſo all the knowledge they could have of them muſt be by diſtant reports. They never ſaw Moſes by his rod turn the waters of Egypt into blood,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028262_0082_0FD7F4B092EC1DC0"/>and afterwards divide the red ſea, never ſaw the flaming mount, on which the divine law was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; the myſterious cloud that deſcended, and conducted God's people for ſo long a time. All theſe ſtrange phoenomena were among the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, and part of that glory and diſtinction God put upon his peculiar people.</p>
            <p>And beſides, it muſt be conſidered, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world were involved in groſs ignorance, over-run with idolatry, and ſunk into barbariſm. Upon the confuſion of tongues at Bable, and the defeat of that impious attempt thereby; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of the true religion, began to decline in the world, and in a few generations was very much loſt. I cannot better repreſent this, than in the words of a learned man.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> Originae Sacrae. p. 11.</note> 
               <q>The ſons of Noah, after their ſeveral diſperſions and planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſeveral countries, did gradually degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into ignorance and barbarity; for upon their firſt ſettling into any country, they found it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment enough to cultivate the land, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves habitations and food</q> He adds, <q>They were often put to remove from one place to another, which Thucydides ſpeaks of as the caſe of the ancient Grecians, and it was a great while before they came to embody in towns and cities, and from thence to ſpread themſelves into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and to ſettle the bounds of their territories.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This being the ſtate of moſt nations in the firſt ages after their plantation, there was no likelihood of any great improvement in knowledge; ſo far from it, that there would probably be a great decay of that knowledge, which had been conveyed down to them; their neceſſities keeping them in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual employment. It was a conſiderable time before they were ſettled under regular and formed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028262_0083_0FD7F4B2D5B49848"/>and till then, they had no opportunities to purſue arts and ſciences, or write hiſtory. And that this was the caſe is paſt queſtion, with reſpect to moſt of them, they had ſo far loſt knowledge of themſelves, and their anceſtors, that they could give no tolerable account of their own original, but generally thought themſelves to have ſprung out of the earth, where they inhabited. From which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Thucydides tells us, the Athenians uſed to wear their golden graſshoppers.</p>
            <p>There were two other cauſes, beſides what I have juſt mentioned, of the ignorance, and particularly of the defect of records and hiſtory, among the heathens, namely, the want of neceſſary means and helps to preſerve the memory of things. The Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that moſt of all others glory in their antiquity, had not the uſe of letters till Cadmus<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Had not the uſe of letters till</hi> Cadmus.] Some learned men indeed have imagined the Greeks had the knowledge and uſe of letters before his time, having learned them from Cecrops the firſt king of Athens, who led a colony out of Egypt, where learning and letters had long flouriſhed, fixed in Greece, built that city, and taught the uſe of letters to that people. But this conjecture, how probable ſoever it may appear, is not ſupported by ſo many and good arguments, as the opinion of thoſe, who make Cadmus the firſt author of the Greek letters. It is very certain if Cecrops did introduce any, there are no monuments of his characters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, nor were they known to the moſt ancient writers of that nation, whoſe works are come down to us. The oldeſt we have any memoirs of being thoſe taught by Cadmus, and his followers, that ſeem at firſt to have been the ſame with the Phaenician, as Herodotus teſtifies they were, and as may be concluded from the moſt ancient Greek inſcriptions, that we have copies of, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Sigaean, given us by Dr. Chiſhul; whence it is eaſy to obſerve a very great affinity between the old Greek letters, and thoſe now called Samaritan, thought by many to have been origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Heb. e. v. and Phaenician characters.</note> taught them the ſame; who, carry his antiquity the higheſt, was but co-temporary with Joſhua, and many think him only co-temporary with Samuel. And as they wanted means, ſo alſo an inclination to ſuch work.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028262_0084_0FD7F4B2FACDA278"/>They had not learning ſufficient, to record things concerning themſelves, much leſs any inclination to intereſt themſelves in the affairs of other nations. The great events of the Bible were done among another ſort of people; as thoſe barbarians knew little of them, ſo they had little zeal about them.</p>
            <p>Add to this, as what may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that after God had confounded their language at Babel, and ſcattered them abroad upon the face of the earth; he in a great meaſure took his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from them. And as they had not the ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from heaven, that the family of Abraham enjoyed, nor that intercourſe with God; they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually fell into a forgetfulneſs of him; loſt the knowledge of the true God, ſet up idolatry, and run into thoſe horrid ſuperſtitions, that in proceſs of time, were the diſgrace and reproach of human nature.</p>
            <p>Now that a people in theſe circumſtances; thus abandoned of God, <hi>a people ſitting in darkneſs, and in the regions of the ſhadow of death;</hi> deſtitute of arts and ſciences, in a great degree, and for a long time of letters; that knew little of their own affairs, had few or no memorials of their anceſtors; and ſeldom extended their view beyond their own times and concerns; that theſe ſhould not be hiſtorians, and eſpecially hiſtorians of the church is now wonder.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As there are no hiſtories among them, but what fall much below the time of Moſes, ſo when they began to write the hiſtory of their reſpective nations, and of others, they mix it with fables to that degree, that little dependance can be had on the accounts they give.</p>
            <p>Thucidides owns, they have no records of Greece before the Peloponneſian war. All that he could diſcover in the ancient ſtate of that country, was a great deal of confuſion, as he tells <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, unquiet ſtations, frequent removals, continual piracies, and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028262_0085_0FD7F4B4D630F438"/>no ſettled form of government. So that before that period, according to this writer, who is juſtly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated as the moſt impartial of all the greek hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, there was nothing certain among them, but all was mere chaos and confuſion. Indeed, the Phaenician hiſtory by Sanconiatho, is acknowledged to be of more antiquity.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Phaenician hiſtory by Sanchoniatho is acknowledged to be of more antiquity.] It is ſo by the generality of learned men, as to ſay nothing of Euſebius and others anciently, by Grotious, Bochart, Stilling fleet, Cumberland, and many more among the moderns: not to mention Kircher, who pretended he had ſeen Sanchoniatho's original hiſtory; but there are ſeveral others, both of the laſt and the preſent age, who have called it into queſtion, and even rejected it as ſpurious. That great antiquary Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well offered divers arguments to prove it to be ſo, and to ſhew it was a forgery, if not of Porphyry himſelf, yet of Philo Biblius the tranſlator; and an ingenious writer has of late expreſſed his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious concerning the genuineneſs and antiquity thereof, in ſome diſſertations publiſhed in the preſent ſtate of the republic of letters, with a view of confuting biſhop Cumberland's ſyſtem of mythol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy in his learned treatiſe upon Sanchoniatho's Phaenician hiſtory, in order to defend and eſtabliſh the chronology of the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sir Iſaac Newton. However, without entering into that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and admitting the book under conſideration to be genuine, and as old as it can be ſuppoſed to be, there are ſeveral things therein that are a ſurpriſing confirmation of the Moſaic hiſtory.</note> And yet his greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, Prophyry, is forced to grant he was younger than Moſes; Bochart makes him co-temporary with Gideon; though others think him much later.</p>
            <p>I hinted, as their hiſtories are of leſs antiquity than the ſacred hiſtory, ſo they are very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed with fables. This might be ſhewn at large, was it proper here to ſtand upon it. They found themſelves at a loſs for materials for true hiſtory, wanting ancient monuments, and therefore made uſe of inventions to ſupply the defect. Hence the famous diſtinction by Varo, of time into unknown, fabulous, and hiſtorical; accounting all time, either abſolutely unknown, or fabulous, till the firſt Olympiad, which was when the world was three
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028262_0086_0FD7F4B8D3EB22E8"/>thouſand years old. If it be aſked, what purpoſe this ſerves? I anſwer, it affords a ſatisfactory reaſon why we ſhould not expect the records of the Bible among heathen hiſtorians.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is no wonder we find ſo little in heathen authors concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jews, their religion and affairs. As for the Romans their writers are comparatively of a late date. And for the Greeks they were not only very ignorant in antiquity, but ſo full of themſelves as to deſpiſe all other people, and eſteem them barbarians; not excepting even the Romans, whom they appear to have known little of, till they were brought into ſubjection to them. Add to this, that it ſeems highly probable, if not certain, that many of their authors deſignedly omitted ſpeaking of the Jews, and their concerns, out of envy and hatred to them as Jeſephus obſerves, and indeed proves by a remarkable inſtance. Beſides, it is not to be doubted, but ſeveral of their works are now loſt, wherein we might have met with accounts of that nation that would have confirmed the ſacred hiſtory. This we know to be actually the caſe with Hecataeus's book relating to the Jews, and we may be ſure it is ſo in regard of many other Greek authors. Though after all, there are not a few of the old heathen writers, whoſe works are come down to our hands, that make mention of them, and ſome particulars of their affairs agreeably to the ſacred records, as Herodotus, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Trogus, Pompeius, and other.</note> You ſee they were out of the church, that Goſhen of the world, the land of light, and ſpot where God diſplayed himſelf in the wonders of his providence. They can give no tolerable account of themſelves, their own original and affairs, for want of ſufficient authentic records. And we need not think it ſtrange that they ſay ſo little of a people ſeparated from them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within ſuch an incloſure as the Jews were.</p>
            <p>And then, what has been ſaid may alſo ſerve to promote our veneration for the Bible. We had known little of the origin of the world, the maker of it, or of thoſe glorious acts of providence on which our religion is founded; had it not been for Moſes's hiſtory. So that however our modern deiſts deſpiſe the Bible, and inſult Moſes, as they ſometimes do with an impious freedom, they are
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028262_0087_0FD7F4BB1C99BB48"/>beholden to the ſacred writings for all that is valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their knowledge of ancient things; the creation of the world, the fall of man, God's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of grace towards fallen mankind, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his power and providence in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world for ſome thouſands of years; the knowledge of theſe things we derive from the Bible, and entirely depend on divine revelation for. The moſt ancient profane hiſtorians here give but very little ſatisfaction; they do not begin ſoon enough, their diſcourſe is dark, obſcure, broken, and diſguiſed; the reaſon of which has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently intimated. So that not only our faith, as chriſtians, is eſtabliſhed, but our curioſity, as men, gratified by the Bible. But.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Notwithſtanding the great diſadvantages the heathens lay under, and the manifeſt defects of their hiſtories; it may reaſonably be expected, that there ſhould be preſerved among them ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the great events recorded in the Bible. I ground this chiefly upon a fact, which with me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> That all mankind proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſame ſtock, and had originally the ſame parents. What cavils are advanced againſt this, I ſhall not at preſent take notice of; nor can I find the leaſt weight in any of them. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo plain in this matter, that I apprehend none can make a queſtion of it that believes the ſacred writings. The apoſtle tells us Adam was the firſt man. And our Lord, ſpeaking of Adam and Eve, ſays, that at the <hi>beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</hi> And the apoſtle more directly to our purpoſe, <hi>God hath made of one blood all nations of men, to dwell on the face of the earth;</hi> ſome Greek copies followed herein by the Arabic, vulgar Latin, and others, read "of one," that is, of one man, leaving out "blood;" but there is no need of the criticiſm; blood ſignifies,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028262_0088_0FD7F4C584A4CC08"/>as is common in the beſt Greek authors, the ſtock out of which mankind ſprings. Add to this, that Adam expreſsly calls his wife, the mother of all living, making that the reaſon of her name Eve. So that I need not call this a poſtulatum, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be granted by thoſe that receive the Bible: It is a certain truth, fully revealed there, that from this pair, Adam and Eve, all mankind derived, and the whole world was peopled.</p>
            <p>I am only to obſerve further, that after the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of the world by the deluge, Noah and his ſons were the heads and parents of a new world. For this, at preſent, I appeal to the Scriptures; you have it in expreſs words, <hi>Gen.</hi> x. 32. after an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the deſcendants from Japhet, Ham, and Shem, it is added, <hi>theſe are the families of the ſons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations, and by theſe were the nations divided in the carth aſter the flood.</hi>

It is not accountable that all theſe things ſhould be utterly loſt, and no footſteps of them continue in the heathen nations, ſince they had the ſame original. So that what remains here to be done, is to enquire, what traditions we find of the ſacred hiſtory among the heathen writers.

            <p>I muſt not deſcend to particulars, and trace all the paſſages that occur to our purpoſe.

Change the name of Deucalion for Noah, and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian's repreſentation of this matter is almoſt paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to that of Moſes; he tells you the firſt genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men were deſtroyed, and Deucalion was the progenitor of a ſecond generation: he aſcribes their deſtruction to their wickedneſs, and makes the means of it to be a flood of water; that Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion and his family only were ſaved, and that in
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028262_0092_0FD7F4CC18278090"/>a great cheſt, into which he came with his children, and with ſeveral animals; and that the deluge of water ſunk into a great hiatus, or gap in the earth. Theſe, and a great many more particulars of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hiſtory, are commemorated among them, though changed and mangled in their fables. But any one, that has the Bible in his hands, may trace them in the ſtories they tell.</p>
            <p>I will only hint at two things more here, namely, that Moſes was univerſally owned among them, and celebrated as a lawgiver. Longinus mentions him as no ordinary man. Strabo ſpeaks of him with great commendation, and Diodorus Siculus places him among the chief lawgivers, Trogus Pompeius takes notice of his beauty and wiſdom, agreeably to the character Stephen gives of him in Acts vii. Farther, they had among them a great many religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rites, which I think is evident, they derived from the Jews; as circumciſion, ſo famous among the Iſhmaelites in Arabia. So their weekly ſabbath, new moons, and above all, the conſtant cuſtom of ſacrificing. Theſe things were notorious among the heathen nations, and I look upon them as ſo many footſteps of the original laws given to the patriarchs and Jews, and atteſtations to the ſacred hiſtory.</p>
            <p>And from the whole, without further reaſoning, I think I may infer with good evidence, that the hiſtory of Moſes is true. That they ſpeak of them ſo fully as they do, and that there is ſuch a general concurrence and agreement among them upon the main heads of the ſacred hiſtory, I think can never be accounted for, but upon ſuppoſition that the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is genuine and authentic. Whence ſhould all the world have theſe notions of a chaos, of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of it, of the flood, of Abraham and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, of Jewiſh rites? and whence ſhould they take up the practice of ſacrificing, which univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally obtained among them, had not God appointed
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028262_0093_0FD7F4CEC0DA3F18"/>it, and had it not come to them from the patriarchs and Jews? That the reaſon of mankind ſhould agree in ſuch a rite of worſhip for appeaſing God, and recommending themſelves to his favor, is not imaginable. For how ſhould they conclude, that the deity would be pleaſed with the deſtruction and blood of any of his creatures. So that I think their opinions and ſentiments, the ſcattered frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſacred hiſtory, that occur in the pagan writers, and their religious obſervances, are ſo ſtrong a teſtimony to the hiſtory of Moſes, that no reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man can queſtion it, unleſs at the ſame time he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ill queſtion all hiſtory, and deſtroy all the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ancient facts, both ſacred and profane.</p>
            <p>If any aſk, whence had the gentiles their account of theſe things? I anſwer, in ſhort, ſome of them might be had by tradition from the ancient patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, from N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>h and his ſons. Several things they might learn from the Iſraelites during their ſtay in Egypt. And they might get intelligence of ſome other particulars from the Jews themſelves, after their ſettlement in Canaan, and from their ſacred Scriptures,<note n="*" place="bottom">The heathens may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to have had their knowledge of theſe matters ſome or all of the ways here hinted at. For mankind deſcending from one common father Noah, who we may be ſure carefully inſtructed all his children in the hiſtory of the world, the creation, fall, deluge, &amp;c. It is by no means likely, that the more remarkable paſſages concerning theſe great events ſhould ſoon be totally forgotten among any of his poſterity. Certainly they would be handed down from age to age, and ſome kind of tradition be preſerved of them a conſiderable while, though indeed it is natural to imagine, it would by degrees be ſo broken and altered, as exceedingly to diſguiſe the truth. Beſides, one cannot but conclude, that during the long reſidence of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in Egypt they would communicate many things to the Egyptians, and others, who frequently correſponded with them. Without queſtion Joſeph, and other good men, would improve the opportunity they had of ſpreading the knowledge of thoſe truths, which had been faithfully tranſmitted down to them from their excellent anceſtors the Patriarchs, and would take care to leave ſome laſting memorials of them among a people they had ſo much converſation with. And then the Gentiles undoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived a great many of their notions from the ſacred oracles after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, both in Judea, whither ſeveral of them travelled for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and in Egypt, where a multitude of the Jews, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at leaſt, reſided, and whence, the beſt records we have of thoſe times inform us, moſt of the famous ſages and philoſophers of old fetched their learning, as Solon, Thales, Pherecydes Syrus, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras, Plato, &amp;c. That this was really the caſe, we have the teſtimony of the ancient Jews, chriſtians and heathens, as has been ſhewn at large, and the matter of fact atteſted, and clearly proved, by abundance of our moſt learned modern writers, ſuch as Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Grotius, Bochart, Voſſius, Seldon, Huetius, Stilling fleet, Gale, and many others.</note> as might be made appear highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but that I muſt not enlarge upon theſe things.</p>

I muſt yet beg your patience whilſt I touch the other part of the hiſtory of the Bible, that of the New Teſtament, as recorded by the four evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and in the acts of the apoſtles. I have here a noble ſubject, and ſufficient matter had I time to launch out. The facts related there were done openly in the face of the ſun, and expoſed to the view of the world: not done in a corner but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly.

            <p>As to particulars, I muſt be forced to take the ſame method as before, give you an abſtract from the ſame learned author,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Clark's evidence of natural and revealed religion p. 271.</note> which he takes from Grotius.

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from thoſe writers to the matters of fact recorded in the goſpels, I am perſuaded, he will rather admire that we have ſo many, and ſuch clear ones, as we have. Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, how ſeldom it was to their purpoſe to take nonce of theſe things, how unacquainted they muſt be ſuppoſed to have been with them for the moſt part, and how little they believed them, having never impartially examined into their truth. In ſhort, nothing ſeems to me more unreaſonable than to urge the want of plainer and fuller teſtimonies from heathens and Jews, to the facts on which the belief of the chriſtian religion is grounded, as an argument againſt it, when the very plainneſs and fullneſs of a teſtimony of this ſort, is by many thought a ſufficient reaſon to ſuſpect it to be ſpurious and counterfeit, the forgery of ſome over officious chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>n. This is the caſe with reference to that famous controverted paſſage in Joſephus, the beſt argument that I know of produced againſt the genvineneſs of which is, that it contains an higher character of our ſaviour than it is likely an unbelieving Jew would give. And as I doubt not the caſe would have been the ſame in other inſtances, it muſt needs be very unfair to make the paucity of ſuch teſtimonies an objection againſt chriſtianity. So that upon the whole, I think it manifeſt, that we have as many and juſt ſuch as we could in reaſon look for and expect.</note>

I might add to theſe teſtimonies the acts of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, which though queſtioned by ſome, have I think a great probability in them. The caſe was this: it was uſual for the Roman deputies, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of provinces, to give an account of the chief things, during their adminiſtration, to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: accordingly, Pilate gave an account to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius of what had happened in his time concerning Jeſus of Nazareth; an account of his miracles, death, crucifixion and reſurrection: upon which, it is ſaid, that emperor propoſed it to the ſenate, that he ſhould be admitted into the number of their gods; and decreed, that none ſhould be accuſed for being a chriſtian during his reign. Two things I may remark with reference to this matter, namely, that Pilate's account was enrolled in the public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords at Rome: and, that the fathers, as Juſtin Martyr, and Tertullian afterwards appealed to the emperor and ſenate upon the head, in their apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for the chriſtian religion. Which we cannot imagine they would have done, had they not been well aſſured of the fact, that ſuch things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtered,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028262_0097_0FD7F4DFDFC87D68"/>and that their enemies had nothing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tion to it.</p>
            <p>Now this was a teſtimony of a public nature. Pilate, you know, was the judge before whom our Lord was tried, and by whom he was condemned. The thing was of ſo great conſequence, and made ſuch a noiſe in the world, that one cannot think he would paſs it over in ſilence, and take no notice of it to the emperor. The fact is conſidered, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laid before the ſenate, and committed to their records; and thereupon a decree made in favor of the chriſtians. That this is likely to be true, may be argued from the circumſtances of the caſe. The emperors expected from their deputies, an account of any notable event that happened where they were. And can we imagine, that Pilate either would or durſt conceal ſo great an event, as that concerning Jeſus Chriſt, about which all Judea was in an uproar, and in which he himſelf had ſo great a ſhare, From hence then, we may infer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the ſtory; and, I think, conclude its certainty from the apologies I mentioned of Juſtin Martyr and Tertullian. They were both learned men, lived in the next century, and I cannot think it conſiſtent with their character to appeal, as we find they do, to the head of the Roman empire, and to ſo auguſt a body as the Roman ſenate, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this fact had it been in the leaſt doubtful.</p>
            <p>So that here you ſee, we have the teſtimony of all ſorts of authors in behalf of our point, of thoſe that lived in the time, and neareſt to the time, when the things mentioned in the New Teſtament hiſtory were done. The teſtimony of enemies, of Jews, of Pagans, of the emperor and ſenate, of Pilate, the very man that judged and condemned our Lord. All theſe own there was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt, that he lived at the time the goſpel relates, that he wrou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ht miracles, that he was put to death
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028262_0098_0FD7F5476B78D860"/>by crucifixion, that he had many diſciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, of whoſe affairs ſeveral of them ſpeak. And it deſerves obſervation, that the moſt ſpiteful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the chriſtian religion, and ſuch as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked it formerly with the greateſt ſharpneſs, as Julian, Porphyry, and Celſus, do not dare to deny the facts; they own what is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt; and that he wrought miracles; only they pretend he did it by the power of magic, the Jews lay by the Tetragrammation, juſt like the abſurd cavil of his enemies in the days of his fleſh, that he caſt out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.</p>
            <p>You will allow me, I hope, to ſay now, that ſo far I have made good what I undertook, and have ſhewn you, that the characters of authentic hiſtorians belong to the writers of the Bible; they have, you ſee, the teſtimony of other ancient writers, even of their very enemies to confirm their hiſtory. The Old Teſtament has as much of this as could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and the New Teſtament more plain, direct, and early vouchers. So that I think I need not ſcruple hence to conclude, that the Bible is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true. But I have not yet given you all the evidence of its truth. I proceed therefore to the next particular, which I ſhall diſpatch in a few words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That the writers of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment treat of ſubjects of great importance, in which the intereſts of men are very much concerned: in conſequence of which, we may conclude their relations of things would be examined by all ſorts of perſons: and yet none of the moſt critical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers are able to diſprove them, or pretend they were falſe. If any ancient hiſtory be a triſle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains things of no moment to the world, mankind will not think themſelves obliged to look very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into it. Be it true or falſe it is all one to them. When this is the caſe, as it often is, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               </gap> it paſs, even though the greateſt part of it be fiction and romance.</p>
            <p>But when a hiſtory comes forth full of great and ſurpriſing events, eſpecially of new laws and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in which the higheſt intereſts of men are nearly concerned; we cannot imagine, it ſhould be admitted without trial and ſufficient evidence. And of this nature is the hiſtory of the Bible, There is no hiſtory of equal weight with it, as may be ſhewn with reſpect to both thoſe parts of it, I have already more than once touched upon.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of Moſes, that contains the memoirs of the creation, the fall of man, the promiſe of a redeemer to recover loſt ſinners, the apoſtacy and deſtruction of the old world, the preſervation of Noah and his family, as heads of a new race, the laws and covenant of God, and the wonders of his providence towards the church, has ſomething in it not only great and auguſt, but of conſequence to the world above any other hiſtory. And though I grant the Jews being diſtinguiſhed and ſeparate from the reſt of the world, their law was not of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and univerſal concernment; yet even their hiſtory, as well as that of the patriarchs, was ſuch as would excite the attention of mankind; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, as ſo many things are related in it that give them a preference to the reſt of the nations, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles God wrought for them, the triumphs of his providence over their enemies, and in their behalf, in Egypt, in the wilderneſs, and afterwards in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. Their neighbors and enemies could not be ignorant of many of theſe things, and had they been falſe, would loudly have remonſtrated againſt them. Would not the Egyptians have borne teſtimony againſt what Moſes lays of the deſtruction of their monarch, and diſgrace of their country by ſo ſtrange a ſeries and train of judgments, had there been any room to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>dict his report? And yet we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028262_0100_0FD7DAD206802388"/>of this, no counter hiſtory, but, as has been obſerved, have evident footſteps of the facts reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Moſes, in their moſt ancient records.</p>
            <p>I need not ſhew how important Moſes's hiſtory was to the Jews, and that they could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it without examination. They would never have ſubmitted to Moſes, had he been an impoſtor; would never have embraced his laws, had they not known they were divine, nor believed his hiſtory, if they had not been aſſured it was true. When he delivers his law to them, he doth it in ſtrains of very high authority, and ſignifies to them that he ſets before them a bleſſing and a curſe. <hi>A bleſſing if they obeyed, and a curſe if they would not obey.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe he ſays, <hi>I have ſet before thee this day, life and good, and death and evil.</hi> And again, <hi>I call heaven and earth to record this day againſt you, that I have ſet before you, life and death, bleſſing and curſing.</hi> He tells them, that <hi>if they walked in the ſtatutes and judgments of God they ſhould live and multiply, and God would bleſs them in the land whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went to poſſeſs it. But if their hearts turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away and they would not hear,</hi> he ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces to them, that <hi>they ſhould ſurely periſh.</hi> And as their law came with ſuch an awful ſanction, ſo the authority of it reached to all their affairs; their inheritances, civil rights, peace, health, and proſperity of every kind, depended upon it. I might add, that though the whole hiſtory of Moſes tends very much to exalt the mercy and grace of God towards that people, and ſets forth the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his providence done among them and for them, yet it leaves them under ſevere cenſures; it repreſents them as a ſtiff-necked, rebellious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful people; gives an account of their frequent murmurings and apoſtacies, and of the judgments of God inflicted upon them for their ſins; ſets a mark of infamy and reproach upon ſome eminent
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028262_0101_0FD7DAD386EE42F0"/>perſons and families among them, as Aaron, Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Corah, Dathan, Abiram and others.</p>
            <p>Now had not this hiſtory been true, and known to be true beyond all poſſibility of queſtion, had not the laws publiſhed been from God, the cenſures paſt been juſt, the things related been done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the revelation; as it had been in the power of a multitude to have confronted the deceiver and contradicted the ſtory; they would not have failed to have done it. The account given of them was of too great conſequence to the community, and too nearly touched particular perſons, to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, and to be received without ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible evidence.</p>
            <p>As to the New Teſtament, every one will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the importance of its hiſtory and of the facts it contains; the incarnation, death, and reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of God, were the greateſt events that ever entertained the world, and could not but draw the attention of men, as we know they did. Conſider the matter a little, Jeſus of Nazareth an obſcure perſon by his birth and education, aſſumes the character of the Meſliah; declares himſelf ſent and commiſſioned by God the Father; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly acts as his ambaſſador, repeals the ſtatutes of Moſes; condemns the forms of worſhip that had ſo long obtained among the gentiles, and calls upon them to renounce their idols; reveals a new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and plan of religion; works miracles and ſends forth apoſtles to preach his doctrine, and gives them alſo power of miracles to confirm that doctrine. He lays down his life, riſes again from the dead, promiſes eternal happineſs to his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and demands of all, as ever they expect an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his ſalvation, that they believe in him, and ſubmit to his authority.</p>
            <p>Now theſe were ſuch very important things, of ſo mighty conſequence to all ſorts of perſons, that I
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028262_0102_0FD7DAD4E6B24BB8"/>think it was impoſſible they ſhould be paſſed over with indolence and neglect. Here was a new ſtate of religion introduced, the venerable rights of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes cancelled, the ſuperſtitions of the Pagans tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under foot, and not only ſo, but the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of the one and the other ſtruck at. For to ſay nothing of any other inſtances of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſet forth and cenſured in the ſacred hiſtory, we find they are repreſented there as acting a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous part in the tragedy of Chriſt's death, the Jews perſecuting and delivering him up for envy. and Pilate condemning him againſt the conviction of his own conſcience. The former, the Jews, ſeem apprehenſive how much their credit was touched in the matter, and therefore endeavored to ſilence the apoſtles and ſtifle their report, alledging they had <hi>filled Jeruſalem with their doctrine, and intended to bring this man's blood</hi> upon them. So that had there been room for cavilling, any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon which they might hope to invalidate the teſtimony of the ſacred writers, their malice, nay, a concern for their own reputation, would have put them upon it. They were avowed enemies to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, nothing galled them ſo much as the fame of his miracles, and the ſpreading of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine thereupon; and we may be ſure as they did obſerve theſe things, they would not let them go without contradiction, but that there was no ground for it.</p>
            <p>As for chriſtians, the whole body of chriſtians, they were ſo deeply intereſted in the facts recorded in the goſpel, that it is certain they could not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect them. They profeſſed to believe the goſpel hiſtory and indeed ventured their all, their preſent and everlaſting all, upon the credit thereof. They could not be chriſtians without believing, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ordinarily, without being martyrs. Their maſter made the firſt neceſſary, and their enemies
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028262_0103_0FD7DAD6676649D8"/>the latter. Chriſt would not accept them unleſs they would own him, confeſs him, and be faithful to him: and if they did ſo their enemies generally perſecuted them, even unto death.</p>
            <p>This was the ſtate of the ſacred hiſtory, eſpecially of the goſpel hiſtory. It relates matters of the greateſt importance to mankind, wherein their higheſt intereſts are immediately concerned; and conſequently, they could not but think themſelves obliged to enquire narrowly into it, as actually they did: and after their utmoſt examination, none were able to deny the facts, or deſtroy the credit of the hiſtory: from whence I may conclude, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true.</p>
            <p>It was not poſſible to forge ſuch an hiſtory as that of Moſes and of Chriſt, and perſuade man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to believe the ſame. The reaſon is, they were too much concerned in theſe things, not to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine whether they were true or not. There are many ancient hiſtories of ſo little moment to any part of mankind, that no body thinks it worth his while critically to enquire into all the particulars of them; and therefore no wonder that ſome ſuch paſs current, whatever fictions there may be in them. But when the hiſtory is of general and great moment and importance the caſe is otherwiſe. Should any one for inſtance, pretend to give us an hiſtory of our own nation, or but of the reign of one of our kings, wherein a great many facts are forged, and a great multitude of ſtories told againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and reputation of any conſiderable party. And ſhould he moreover alter public laws, and go about to impoſe a new ſtatute book; I aſk, whether ſuch an hiſtory could poſſibly obtain any credit, and ſuch an attempt ſucceed among us? would not thouſands riſe up and detect the impoſture? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the attempt would ſink and ruin itſelf by the
<pb facs="unknown:028262_0104_0FD7DAD8A1E72748"/>abſurdity and impudence of it. The ſame may be ſaid with reference to an abuſe and forgery of the records in the Bible. No man could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived ſuch a book, with ſuch laws and facts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing himſelf to the contempt of the world, of Jews, Pagans and Chriſtians. England may as ſoon be perſuaded to receive a forged body of ſtatutes never enacted in parliament, nor pleaded in any court of judicature, as the Jewiſh and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church could have been perſuaded to receive the laws and hiſtory of Moſes and Chriſt, from the hands of an impoſtor.</p>
            <p>And thus I have gone through the firſt of the three particulars I propoſed to inſiſt upon; have ſhown you, that the ſacred hiſtory has equal credit with any ancient hiſtory, and that all the characters of credible hiſtorians belong to the writers of the Bible. They had ſufficient knowledge of what they wrote; they were perſons of great integrity; they wrote at the time when the facts they publiſh are ſaid to be done, and when it might be known whether they were done or no; their hiſtory is confirmed by co-temporary writers, and the things, they relate, are of ſo much importance to mankind, that they could not but think themſelves obliged to enquire into them. From whence it follows, that either the Bible is true, or we can have no evidence that there is any true hiſtory in the world.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude this diſcourſe with a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical remark, or inference from what has been ſaid. If the Bible is true, then on the one hand, how ſad and deplorable is the caſe of wic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d men; of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, worldly, ſenſual ſinners. The Bible is wholly againſt them. It cenſures their principles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns their practice, repreſents God as their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and hell as their portion. Which, by the way, I doubt is one great reaſon of many perſons' enmity to the Bible. It checks and controuls them in
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028262_0105_0FD7DAFFB1643210"/>their ſinful purſuits, and did they believe it, would exceedingly terrify them. Hence they hate it, as Ahab did the prophet, becauſe it ſpeaks evil to them. If the Bible be true, <hi>the way of the ungodly ſhall periſh, and the wicked ſhall be turned into hell.</hi> On the other hand, we have hence matter of great joy and comfort to good men. It is ſo much our intereſt that the Bible ſhould be true, that methinks thoſe that are inclined to queſtion, whether it is, or not, ſhould yet wiſh it true. And indeed was that the caſe with the oppoſers of it, I do not doubt but their ſcruples would ſoon be over, and the diſpute ceaſe.</p>
            <p>A good man would not for the world that the Bible was not true. He finds there ſo much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction concerning God and providence, as govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things and intereſting himſelf in all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; ſo much aſſurance concerning another better ſtate, ſo much ſupport and comfort in this, that he juſtly eſteems his Bible his inheritance and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Rejoice then, chriſtian, that we have ſuch good evidence of the truth of it. There thou haſt a glorious revelation, <hi>a ſure word of prophecy,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent rules to direct thy practice, exceeding great and precious promiſes to afford thee comfort, and a certain proſpect of eternal life hereafter. O be thankful for the Bible; ſtudy, love, and live the Bible; and you ſhall find all true at laſt, and that not one iota, or tittle of the word ſhall paſs till all be accompliſhed.</p>

            <p>I HAVE made it appear, I think, that our Bible is of equal credit with any other ancient hiſtory, and conſequently, that if it be not true, we have no ſufficient reaſon to receive and believe any ancient book in the world.

            <p n="2">II. To ſhew that our Bible has greater marks of credibility, ſtronger evidences of truth, than any other ancient book. I might argue this at large; but I ſhall content myſelf with a few obſervations. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The writers of the Bible ſeem to have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led other hiſtorians in their moral character. They appear to have been perſons of eminent integrity, goodneſs and virtue; and diſcover in all their writings, the greateſt impartiality, and love of truth. Compare them in theſe things with moſt hiſtorians in the world, and it is eaſy to ſee on which ſide the advantage will be.</p>
            <p>To touch only on their impartiality; how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly does that ſhine through all their narrations. Moſes fully relates the evil things of his nation;
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028262_0107_0FD7DB08AF93A448"/>both their ſins and their ſufferings; their offences againſt God, and his judgments upon them. Nor doth he ſpare himſelf, he records ſeveral inſtances of his own infirmities, and tells you, that God was angry with him and Aaron, and for their ſins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them out of the promiſed land. The New Teſtament writers repreſent their maſter under all the diſadvantageous characters of a ſufferer, as load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reproach and contempt, and at laſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going an ignominious death. And I before took notice, they do with gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t freedom ſet forth their weakneſſes; their cowardiſe, ſlowneſs of belief, their pride and emulations; the many rebukes they met with from their maſter, and their ſhameful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking him, and denying him in his laſt ſufferings. It is left on record againſt the great apoſtle Paul, that he conſenter to the death of Stephen, and made havoc of the church; on which account, he calls himſelf the <hi>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ef of ſinners, a perſecutor, a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, and injurious.</hi> And when he mentions that glorious and diſtinguiſhing inſtance of favor to him, his rapture into the third heaven, he doth it with ſuch circumſtances as tend to mortify him; for he tells us thereupon, <hi>God ſent a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, leſt he ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above meaſure.</hi> This and the like, way the conduct of theſe men from firſt to laſt, as might be made out in a multitude of inſtances. But it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſay, there never were in the world more candid fair writers; perſons that acted a more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted part than the writers of the Bible. Bring other writers to the teſt, hear and examine their characters, compare them to that of Moſes and the apoſtles, and I am confident ſew can bear the trial.

And even Joſephus, the celebrated Jewiſh hiſtorian, paſſes over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſeveral things diſhonorable to his nation; particularly, their folly in making the golden calf. But the ſacred writers have none of theſe blemiſhes upon them, none of theſe objections lying againſt them. They ſought not their own glory, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of their own nation, their friends, their party; but appear in all they ſay and do, to act from no other principle but love and zeal for the truth.</p>
            <p>Not but there are a great many hiſtories wrote by very honeſt and ſincere perſons, who had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in any particular to impoſe upon the world; but as good men, the beſt of men, are in all things fallible, it many things prejudiced; ſo none of them could come up to the manifeſt character of the writers of the Bible. Theſe have been actuated by an higher ſpirit, have diſcovered a purer zeal, a more ſteady, uniform, divine intention in their compoſures. Allow me therefore again to repeat the corrollary and conſequence from hence, that if we do not admit the Bible, we muſt give up all other hiſtories as legend and juggle.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It adds to the credit of the ſcripture hiſtory, and gives it the preſerence to all others, that, as I remarked before, it contains matters the moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and important of any in the world. It treats of things of ſuch a nature, that all mankind, before
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028262_0109_0FD7DB0D264E4258"/>whom it was laid, would think themſelves bound to look into it, and fift it to the bottom. There is no other hiſtory like to undergo ſo critical a ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the ſacred; the reaſons of which, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted at: and, I think, I may juſtly alledge it as a circumſtance in favor of the Bible, and as what gives it a ſuperior credit to any other ancient book.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſcripture hiſtory has had more enemies than any other, and has ſtood the teſt of the moſt nice c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Nor have their enemies, for ſo long a while, been able to diſcover any fraud, or cheat in the ſacred writings, notwithſtanding their utmoſt efforts.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That the adverſaries of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity might confute theſe things at the time they are ſaid to be done, though we have not now the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that matter. I anſwer
<list>
                  <item>1. We have no proof, no records remaining of any ſuch confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let the objector name by whom this was done, or undertaken; produce any tradition of ſuch a fact, any book wrote on ſuch a ſubject. If he cannot, there is nothing in the allegation, but it muſt be looked upon as a mere cavil.</item>
                  <item>2. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the enemies of the Bible never pretended to confute or deny the facts therein reported; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the miracles of Chriſt and his apoſtles. On the contrary, you find ſome of them freely confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. <hi>What ſhall we do,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to theſe men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifeſt to all them that dwell in Jeruſalem; and we cannot deny it.</hi> Should the objector turn upon me, and ſuggeſt, that I am producing the teſtimony
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028262_0110_0FD7DB0F8C8B6530"/>of a book under diſpute, that it is only the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf that tells us this. I reply, theſe facts are owned by the heathens and Jews of that time, as has been proved. And beſides, the Jews ſince do not pretend to deny them; but plead, that Chriſt wrought miracles by the power of magic, or by the myſterious uſe of the Tetragrammaton, the name Jehovah. I anſwer further,</item>
                  <item>3. Had there been any ſuch confutation of the facts in the Bible, the Jews, no doubt, would have preſerved the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or writings of ſuch oppoſers; would have made uſe of them in their diſputes againſt chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; which yet they never did. So that, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this character, this ſuperior character of the credit and truth of the Bible, is unqueſtionable. No other ancient book has been ſo much examined and criticiſed upon, and ſtood the attacks of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo long and ſo much.</item>

            <p n="4">4. The Scripture hiſtory receives a mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from the concord and harmony of its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral writers. It was wrote by ſeveral perſons, in ſeveral parts and ages of the world, and every one gives teſtimony to another; which is a circumſtance that cannot be alledged with the like advantage in behalf of any other book or hiſtory. Moſes ſpeaks and writes of Chriſt, as he himſelf tells us, John v. 46. and in his types and prophecies points out and delineates the great events of the goſpel diſpenſation in his ſong. <hi>He hath raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for us in the houſe of his ſervant David; as he ſpake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been ſince the world began.</hi> So Acts iii. 24. <hi>And all the prophets from Samuel and thoſe that follow after, as many as have ſpoken have foretold of theſe days.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the prophets give teſtimony to Chriſt and the goſpel; foretell and deſcribe the things thereof. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> goſpel owns Moſes and the prophets and gives
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028262_0111_0FD7F4E30ABCBBC8"/>teſtimony to them. So that it is a good argument, that if any part of the Bible be true, all is true; if Moſes be true, the prophets be true, the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament is true: and on the other hand, if the New Teſtament be true, ſo are Moſes and the prophets. They have a mutual dependance and give mutual teſtimony. They ſtand or fall together. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that will ſerve no other book or hiſtory in the world, at leaſt not ſo fully as the Bible. I might add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. God himſelf hath owned this hiſtory, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it a divine teſtimony in a manner, that cannot be pleaded in behalf of any other hiſtory. He has owned this book to be his; owned the penman of it, and vindicated its truth and authority. But as this belongs to another argument and will be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſidered as a proof of the inſpiration of the Bible, I ſhall not here inſiſt upon it. In the mean time it may fitly be obſerved as one of the particulars that give the Bible a preference to all other books.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice for the evidence of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond particular, that the Bible has ſuperior marks of credit and truth in it above any other hiſtory. It remains according to what I promiſed,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That I ſhew, that all circumſtances conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is morally impoſſible the Bible ſhould not be true. I ſay morally, by which I diſtinguiſh the impoſſibility I ſpeak of, from that which is ſtrict and abſolute, ariſing from the nature of things. All human underſtandings are, and will be, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. If we have the teſtimony of one man, of an hundred, of a thouſand, concerning this or that particular, we may have great reaſon to believe this or that teſtimony. But it implies not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction when any ſay, it is falſe. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, there may be ſuch a concurrence of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in a teſtimony or an hiſtory concerning
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028262_0112_0FD7F4E414CD2648"/>paſt things, as renders it not only highly reaſonable to believe it, but even impoſſible to be falſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing the faculties and nature of man, and the ſtate of things among mankind. And of this kind, I think, is the evidence we have, that the Scripture contains a true hiſtory. It is I ſay, with the diſtinction mentioned, impoſſible the Bible ſhould be falſe. To confirm which poſition, I ſhall offer a few conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not poſſible that the writers of the Bible ſhould be deceived themſelves. They had the help of all their ſenſes and faculties to enable them to diſcern whether the things they publiſhed were true or not. And if ſo many perſons, in ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent caſes, were not enabled to make a judgment about what they relate, having all of them their ſenſes and the uſe of their reaſon; others in the like circumſtances may be deceived, you and I, and ten thouſand more, and conſequently nothing can be certain in the world.</p>
            <p>Moſes could not but know, whether he had been with Pharaoh, treating with him time after time in the manner he reports. He could not but know, whether he uſed his rod for the working ſuch mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as are contained in his hiſtory; he could not but know whether he had been on the mount with God, and received two tables of ſtone from God there; whether he brought them down in his hands, broke them at the foot of the mount, and had them afterwards renewed. The New Teſtament writers could not but tell, whether they had ſeen Chriſt, heard his diſcourſes, been witneſſes of his miracles, ſeen him hang on the croſs, converſed with him after his reſurrection, and ſeen him aſcend into heaven; they could not but know, whether they had wrought the miracles they give an account of; and, particularly, could not but know ſuch as were wrought upon themſelves, as their ſpeaking with
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028262_0113_0FD7F4E603D838F0"/>tongues they had never learned; they might know as certainly, whether they received the miraculous gift of languages at Pentecoſt, as they knew their own exiſtence. To ſuppoſe, that a multitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of perſons, and that of all ſorts, ſhould be deceived in things of this kind; is to deſtroy the nature of man, deny that he is a reaſonable creature, capable of moral government, and reflects the utmoſt diſhonor upon God, the author of his nature. I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, it is impoſſible theſe perſons ſhould be themſelves deceived. If what they wrote was falſe, they knew it was falſe, and they could not but know, whether it was true or falſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As they could not be deceived themſelves, ſo it is impoſſible they ſhould mean and intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. For,
<list>
                  <item>1. I have ſhewn they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great integrity and truth. The characters thereof were conſpicuous in all they ſaid and did.</item>
                  <item>2. They were under great obligations to ſpeak the truth. Nothing is more contrary to the religion they propagated, and the doctrine they taught, than lying; not ſo much as a pious fraud, an officious lie, was allowed by them. When a thing of that kind was imputed to them, they rejected it with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, <hi>If the truth of God,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why yet am I alſo judged as a ſinner? and not rather as we be ſlanderouſly reported, and as ſome affirm that we ſay, let us do evil that good may come; whoſe damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is juſt.</hi> And you every where find a mark of reprobation ſet upon lying in ſcripture, and ſuch as indulge to that vice, appointed to deſtruction. Thus we are told, <hi>All liars ſhall have their portion in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone.</hi> Now is it poſſible, that theſe perſons ſhould invent a lie, ſo prodigious and blaſphemous a lie, as that of the goſpel, if it be falſe? Invent, publiſh, and palm it upon the world in the name of God: that
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028262_0114_0FD7F4E71E2744D0"/>they ſhould do this in contradiction to their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt character and avowed doctrine? He that will impute this to them, makes them the moſt ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting, ſelf-condemned men in the world.</item>
                  <item>3. They could have no motive to ſuch a vile under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. It was againſt their worldly intereſt; as is evident to any one that knows their caſe, and reads their hiſtory. What the apoſtle Paul ſays of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was true of all of them: Chriſt had forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of it, and they expected it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>bonds and afflictions</hi> did abide them. They were aſſured, that to follow Chriſt in hopes of another world, was the certain way to be undone in this; that they ſhould be hated of all men for his name-ſake, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, every way perſecuted even unto blood and death. If it be ſaid, they had not much to loſe, I anſwer, ſome of them left a very comfortable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Matthew was a toll-gatherer, an officer of the cuſtoms, and, no queſtion, was in the way, not only of living, but growing rich in ſome meaſure. Luke was a phyſician, and the apoſtle Paul was in ſo much eſteem among the great men of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church, and ſo much devoted to their intereſt, was ſo learned, exact, and zealous in his profeſſion, that he might have expected conſiderable prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: all which he chearfully renounced, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, as he tells us, not only loſs, but dung for Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. The reſt of the apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were fiſhermen; but we are told they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſervants, which implies, their circumſtances were not very mean, at leaſt not neceſſitous. But the argument is not concerned in this. Whatever their former circumſtances were, it is certain, they could not propoſe to mend them by following Chriſt. If they had but little, that little muſt be much with them, becauſe it was their all; and no man can loſe more than all. Nor did they only quit their livelihood and means of ſubſiſtence, but their eaſe,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028262_0115_0FD7F4E8E2A71FD0"/>their outward peace and their life was ſacrificed for the ſame cauſe.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now I think it not poſſible, had they been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of a lie, and that the goſpel was a forgery, that they ſhould have promoted it upon ſuch terms. They could have no motive, no temptation hereto; and conſequently to ſuppoſe them guilty of this, is to ſuppoſe them to have abandoned the principles of ſelf-preſervation and ſelf-love, to do evil for evil-ſake: not only without, but againſt their own intereſt; and to contrive the moſt enormous wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, for no other reaſon, but to be miſerable here and damned hereafter, which I reckon impoſſible, as not being conſiſtent with any principles of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature that we are acquainted with. If there ever were any that did ſuch things as theſe, they muſt not be men, but another ſpecies of creatures than we have any idea or notion of.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that honor and reputation might ſet them at work. I anſwer, that obſcure perſons, ſuch as were the firſt propagators of the goſpel, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of its hiſtory, are ſeldom puſhed on to great enterpriſes, upon motives of honor and vain glory. They have little ſenſe of theſe things. Beſides, they could have no expectation of honor from the world. They were told of hatred, of reproach; of the moſt infamous, barbarous uſage. And they ſaw that muſt be their lot, if they engaged in the ſervice of Chriſt. So that, I may conclude, it was not poſſible theſe men ſhould deſign a cheat and impoſture. They muſt know the truth and goodneſs of the cauſe they eſpouſed, or they had never eſpouſed it. Again, 1. I think it altogether unaccountable, and indeed impoſſible, ſuppoſing ſome particular perſons, ſhould be capable of ſo much wickedneſs and vileneſs, that ſo many of them ſhould agree therein, and that none o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them ſhould detect the villainy. All ſorts of perſons, Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028262_0116_0FD7F4ED79473540"/>pagans, multitudes of both, were engaged in the profeſſion and ſervice of the goſpel. They had their different ſentiments, divided into parties, run into debates, and mutual cenſures and ſchiſms: ſome fell into heraſies, and were publicly cenſured by the churches, and excommunicated. The apoſtle Paul himſelf had zealous enemies that endeavored to ruin his reputation, among the Corinthians, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and others; againſt whom he was forced to write with ſome ſharpneſs, for the vindicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and eſtabliſhing the churches. Now, what I remark is, that among all theſe perſons, this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of converts, too often drawn up in factions one againſt another; full of animoſities, bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, party heats and quarrels, none of them ever undertook to accuſe chriſtianity of impoſture, or to diſcover any deceit of confederacy among the profeſſors of it. Think of the caſe of Judas here particularly. You know he betrayed his maſter, ſold him for thirty pieces of ſilver. Now, either he knew that Chriſt was an impoſtor, and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> a forgery or not. If he knew it, would he not upon this account have proclaimed the thing to all the world, and thereby vindicated his own honor? but ſo far was he from it, that you know conſcience flew in his face, and he comes to his abettors with a ſorrowful complaint, <hi>I have betrayed innocent blood,</hi> and not being able to bear the load of ſo much guilt as he found preſſing his mind; he throws down the money, goes his way, and hangs himſelf. Certainly, had the goſpel been falſe, the device of ſome cunning men, one or other would have ſpoke out; the provoked and enraged; the apoſtates, ſuch as Judas, particularly would have done it. It is not, I think, poſſible they ſhould all perſevere in a lie, a known lie; and neither the love of truth, nor love of themſelves, nor hatred of ſuch as they accounted enemies, prevail with them
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028262_0117_0FD7F4F8C2DB1440"/>to make a diſcovery. To which I might ſubjoin, that multitudes of theſe perſons carried their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth of chriſtianity with them to death, ſealing it with their very blood: no fears, no terrors of their enemies, nor remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, could make them draw back or recant.</p>
            <p>Now all this conſidered, I preſume, I may ſay, it is not to be accounted for, it is not agreeable to any thing we know of the human nature; and that indeed it amounts to an impoſſibility, that there ſhould be any fraudulent deſign, in the writers and preachers of the goſpel. They could never, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them thus have agreed, and thus have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in a known lie and falſhood. And then as they could not be deceived or deſign to deceive, ſo</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was not poſſible they ſhould be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. Had the writers of the ſcripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and endeavored, to have impoſed their hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory upon the world, they could not have ſucceeded in the attempt. This may be ſufficiently collected from what has been ſaid. I ſhall however remark two or three things for the proof of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They had not art enough to manage an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture. The apoſtles of Chriſt particularly had not. Their education was low and mean; they were not bred up in the courts of princes, or in the ſchools of the philoſophers; but were taken from the fiſher-boat moſt of them to preach the goſpel; and ſome have obſerved, their employment tended to make them more heavy and dull; for being much upon the water, and in the night, the cold phlegmatic air would have an influence upon them and flatten their ſpirits. Hence Plato, when he would expreſs a rude dull man, ſays he was brought up among mariners. Add to this, that they lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſadvantages from their country, being Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, whoſe dialect was accounted the moſt ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel and rude of any; a Gallilean, was a term of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028262_0118_0FD7F4FAAFC91FB0"/>diminution, a ſort of a nick-name, by which they meant a mean and contemptible ruſtic.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, view them in all their circumſtances, and it will appear impoſſible that ſuch perſons, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they have the confidence and folly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a cheat of this nature, ſhould ever be able to carry it on. Their enemies took notice they were ignorant and unlearned men. They had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depth of underſtanding, nor fluency of ſpeech, were neither ſcholars, nor orators. And is it to be imagined, that they ſhould be able of their own heads to contrive ſuch a ſtory, as that of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hiſtory? and not only ſo, but perſuade others to receive it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. They relate facts of ſuch a nature, that it is not poſſible they ſhould have cheated the world into the belief of them, had they not been true. For inſtance, they give an account of facts done before a multitude of witneſſes, who could not but know whether ſuch things were done, and in that manner done or not. Let us conſider, among many other inſtances, the paſſage of Chriſt's crucifixion with the circumſtances of it; that at the time of the paſſover when there was a mighty concourſe of people at Jeruſalem, he was condemned by Pilate againſt his conſcience, and publicly put to death; that the vail of the temple was thereupon rent, the rocks ſplit, graves opened, and there was a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural darkneſs over the land for ſeveral hours; and all this was done, as they pretend, before great numbers of ſpectators, both Jews and Romans. Now, if theſe things really were done, as is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the goſpel, our point is ſo far gained, the hiſtory is true. If falſe, why did not their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies contradict them; eſpecially ſince the honor of ſome of them was ſo nearly touched. If this ſtory be falſe, and Chriſt was not crucified, and ſuch
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028262_0119_0FD7F4FAB4D2FEB8"/>and ſuch events did not happen at the time of his crucifixion, it is impoſſible the apoſtles ſhould have gained credit to the forgery.</p>
            <p>The like I might ſay of abundance of miracles recorded in the goſpel. Let us reflect a little on the raiſing of Lazarus from the dead, an account of which you have in the eleventh of John: where you will obſerve he was not only dead, but buried four days; this was publicly known in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood: and therefore ſeveral of the Jews came to the ſiſters of the deceaſed to pay them a friendly viſit, and to condole with them: upon this you are told of a conference between Chriſt and Martha; and read of the deſpair they were in of receiving any help with reference to their brother: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Chriſt goes to the grave, calls upon the dead man, and immediately he comes forth. Thereupon, as the hiſtory goes on, many of the Jews believed in him. Others lay the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Phariſees, who immediately ſummon a council, and being alarmed with the report of ſo ſurpriſing a miracle, to prevent the conſequence they feared from it, determine to put Jeſus to death. <hi>What do we?</hi> ſay they, <hi>for this man doth many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and if we let him alone all men will believe on him.</hi> And you read in the following chapter, they paſſed the ſame reſolution with reference to Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus; the fame of the miracle encreaſing, people flocked to ſee the dead man now alive, and many believed on Jeſus, by reaſon of Lazarus. Hence they thought it neceſſary, that he ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched out of the way too, and be put to death. This is the ſubſtance of the ſtory, and I think I may warrantably conclude, without much reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, that it was impoſſible to make it paſs current had it been falſe. Here are a great many perſons introduced, as having a part in the ſcene, Lazarus, his ſiſters, the Jews; ſome of whom are
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028262_0120_0FD7F4FC18276538"/>repreſented as convinced, and others as taking diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable methods to ſlur the miracle and diſgrace the author. Lazarus lives as a ſtanding monument of the divine power of Chriſt; multitudes are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by their curioſity to ſee and converſe with ſo remarkable a perſon; and of theſe many are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and profeſs faith in Jeſus as the Meſſiah. Now what I inſiſt on is, that had this ſtory been falſe, it could never have been admitted as true. Lazarus himſelf, we may ſuppoſe, would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he had been dead, and was raiſed to life again; his ſiſters, the Jews, would have been ready to have cried out of the impoſture. And upon the whole, I think it is not poſſible, circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that all of them ſhould have ſuffered a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of this nature to remain undetected.<note n="*" place="bottom">Upon the occaſion of what is here tranſiently ſaid concerning the reſurrection of Lazarus, I cannot forbear remarking, that this is one of the miracles of our ſaviour that Mr. Woolſton has lately endeavored to diſcredit as much as he can; though was it a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to enlarge upon the ſubject, it would be no difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſhew the weakneſs and abſurdity of his exceptions and cavils. But as the diſcourſe comes in here occaſionally, I ſhall not at preſent ſtand to take notice of what he ſays. Only, I think, I may be allowed to obſerve, that the hints given in this paragraph are ſufficient to vindicate the matter of fact, and manifeſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the miracle. But if any deſire to ſee the caſe confidered more particularly, I would recommend to their peruſal the Rev. Dr. Harris's two diſcourſes upon it, intitled, the reaſonableneſs of believing in Chriſt, and the unreaſonableneſs of infidelity, with the appendix.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I might alledge under this head, and for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the point I am upon, that the writers of the goſpel hiſtory relate many miracles, which a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of perſons were the ſubjects of. For inſtance, the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, and their ſpeaking with tongues. Thus Peter tells his hearers, that if they repented, and were baptiſed, they ſhould receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. And we are informed, that while Peter ſpake to the people <hi>the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028262_0121_0FD7F4FD9B01B628"/>Holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word.</hi> Now this was a ſenſible thing; the perſons that received the gift could no more doubt of it than of the moſt obvious, plain and certain truths: they could not be deceived in the matter, could not but know whether they ſpake with tongues they had never learned, and whether they wrought miracles or no. The thing was evident to others, and therefore Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus deſired that he might have power granted him <hi>that on whomſoever he ſhould lay hands he might receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Others ſaw it, the perſons themſelves felt it, and it was impoſſible that herein they ſhould be deceived.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſtrengthens the argument and further ſhews the impoſſibility of an impoſture, that a multitude of perſons, and of all ſorts of perſons, received and believed the goſpel hiſtory; the Jews, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, many thouſands and myriads of theſe; ſuch as had been avowed enemies, owned their convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and became converts, and that againſt the moſt inveterate prejudices. Thus we are told, that <hi>the word of God increaſed, and the number of the diſciples multiplied in Jeruſalem, and a greal number of the prieſts were obedient to the faith.</hi> Among the reſt, let me only mention the caſe of the apoſtle Paul. It is known how deeply he was engaged in another intereſt, in oppoſing Chriſt and the goſpel. He was a perſon of character and eminency in the Jewiſh church, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, bred up under the famous Gamaliel, entered into the ſect of the Phariſees, and exceeding <hi>zealous for the traditions of the elders,</hi> as the reſt of that faction were. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the name of Chriſt became odious to him, as a perſon that not only leſſened the authority of Moſes, but had declared himſelf an enemy to the traditions and inventions of the Phariſees, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning them as the groſſeſt hypocrites, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> religion as vain and worthleſs. This inflamed him
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028262_0122_0FD7F4FFB62DD3C8"/>againſt chriſtianity; and you know how much he ſet himſelf to run it down. He was preſent at the death of Stephen, the firſt martyr, and was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of it, received a commiſſion from the chief prieſts to do the honorable work of a perſecutor, which he followed with a zeal, that he himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called madneſs, haling men and women to priſon, and breathing nothing but threatnings and ſlaughter, and death againſt them. Now, I would demand of any reaſonable man, whether it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nay, whether it was poſſible, on ſuppoſition, that the facts in the goſpel had been a forgery to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade this perſon and others to have received them. They could not believe the goſpel without quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the moſt ſtubborn prejudices which had long poſſeſſed their minds; without quitting their hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, their intereſts, and preferments; without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting and condemning themſelves, and expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to all manner of reproach and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. And would perſons in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be gulled and cheated by a company of poor fiſhermen, and contemptible Gallileans? he that can believe this, is prepared to believe any thing; and indeed believes the moſt abſurd, incredible thing in the world, even whilſt he pretends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the goſpel for want of credibility.</p>
            <p>So that I do not think I talk in too high a ſtrain, when I ſay, that it is impoſſible the goſpel hiſtory ſhould be falſe; and particularly, that if the writers of it had a mind to deceive, it is impoſſible they ſhould have been able to do it. I may add to what has been ſaid,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is not poſſible the goſpel hiſtory, had it been falſe, ſhould have maintained its credit in the world to this day. Not to repeat here, what has been obſerved already, that it was embraced by ſo many againſt the ſtrongeſt prepoſſeſſions and prejudices, has been examined by ſuch multitudes
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028262_0123_0FD7F5032C530008"/>of perſons of different opinions and intereſts. What I would at preſent remark is, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would not have ſuffered ſuch an impoſture to have been palmed and impoſed upon the world. It is not conſiſtent with the divine knowledge, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and goodneſs, to have ſuffered in his providence a book ſo full of the ſtrongeſt evidence to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to mankind, a book that looks ſo like true, that it is impoſſible by any faculties we have, to diſtinguiſh it from true, had it been really falſe. He would not have ſuffered his creatures, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the wiſeſt and beſt of them, and I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear accounting them ſuch that have ſhewn the greateſt veneration for chriſtianity and the Bible, to be thus tried, and to have lain under a deluſion from age to age.</p>
            <p>I grant there are many impoſtures and cheats in the world; but God is true, wiſe and good, the beſt as well as greateſt of beings, and he will not neglect, or be wanting, to his upright ſervants that ſincerely deſire to be taught by him, and be ſubject to him in all things. In a word, ſhould we be deceived here, I cannot ſee but we are deceived by an evidence that is in a great meaſure irreſiſtable. We cannot reject it without denying our faculties, going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the faculties God has given us, or if I may be allowed to ſay ſo, governing ourſelves by other faculties than he has given us. And conſequently, to ſuppoſe the Bible may be falſe, is to ſuppoſe that our very faculties enſnare, and that God has left us to be deceived in the proper uſe of them, without ever interpoſing for our relief; which is an horrid arraigning the author of our nature, and iſſues in no leſs a blaſphemy than this, that if we be deceived, God has deceived us.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſufficiently proved that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is true, that it has all the characters of truth that any other ancient hiſtory has, and that if we
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028262_0124_0FD7F5046627D280"/>are not to receive it, we can believe no hiſtory in the world; I have proved it has greater evidence of truth in it, and that all things conſidered, it is impoſſible it ſhould not be true.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome may be ready to ſay, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is all this waſte? we do not queſtion the truth of the Bible. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is good to be provided againſt the day of trial. You do not know what temptations you may meet with on this head; the time may come when you may want your faith aſſiſted and confirmed, and then ſuch arguments will be of uſe to you, if you have digeſted them and made them your own, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you think of them now: and even though you could not recollect many of them, it will be of advantage at ſuch a ſeaſon, that this point has been cleared up to you to the ſatisfaction of your minds; and that you have ſeen the evidence of this great point, and have made a judgement concerning it. This may help to repel a temptation to infidelity, when you are not, it may be, able at preſent to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer every cavil and ſuggeſtion. As a perſon may be very eaſy, and reſt ſatisfied in his title to his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, after it has been examined, though he ſhould have forgot the particulars of his ſecurity, and even the very names of the witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſay, you believe the Bible, but it may be you only take it for granted without believing, or knowing wherefore you believe it. If this be your caſe, as I am afraid it is too commonly the caſe of profeſſed chriſtians; your faith has nothing rational or divine in it; it ſtands upon no better founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the faith of the mahometan with reſpect to the Alcoran. The Bible has been delivered to you, as a divine book, and accordingly you receive it without examining, which is not truly believing, and only ſhews you are chriſtians by accident, and that your religion comes to you as many mens
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028262_0125_0FD7F505D3D61830"/>eſtates do, by ſucceſſion and inheritance from their fathers. I add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The fuller evidence we have for our faith, the more effectual it is like to be, the more it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the heart and command the life. Did we believe the Bible more firmly upon ſolid grounds and clear conviction of its truth, diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with thoſe arguments by which the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it is eſtabliſhed, its doctrines would have greater force upon us, and be embraced with more affection, we ſhould mind it more, ſtudy it more, live it better.</p>
            <p>Do not therefore think I am miſpending your time and my own, whilſt I inſiſt on theſe things. I am ſo much convinced of the neceſſity and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them, that I account it well worth while to allot a conſiderable proportion of my time and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, as God gives opportunity, to the vindicating and explaining the holy Scriptures. Nor do I know and ſubject of more uſe to the ſerious chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. <hi>The Scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> By the knowledge of which, as it is in the verſe following my text, with which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>the man of God is made perfect, thoroughly furniſhed to every good work.</hi>

                  <item>II. That it is inſpired. And.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I have hitherto inſiſted upon the firſt of theſe particulars, and have proved, I hope, to ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<list>
                  <item>1. That our Bible is of equal credit with any other ancient hiſtory.</item>
                  <item>2. That it hath greater marks of credibility. And</item>

               </list>
I do not intend that it is naturally impoſſible. What is naturally impoſſible, cannot be otherwiſe without a contradiction in the very nature of things. Thus it is naturally impoſſible that the ſame thing ſhould be, and not be, at the ſame time; ſhould be true and falſe at the ſame time, and in the ſame ſenſe.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028262_0127_0FD7F50DB2EEECD8"/>And thus I grant, it is not impoſſible but the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Bible may be falſe. For inſtance, it is not impoſſible but the writers of it might be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves. They might loſe the uſe of their ſenſes and faculties; their imagination might be diſturbed, and the texture of their brain altered. It is not naturally impoſſible but they might, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their fair appearances of integrity, be at the bottom groſs cheats. A man may be deceived himſelf, and he may deceive others; he may be weak and deluded, he may be a knave and intend to delude and cheat. This is true of every man in the world, for all mens faculties are finite and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, weak and defective. It is a contradiction and naturally impoſſible that God, a being of infinite perfection, ſhould either be deceived or deceive, but it is not ſo with reſpect to man, the greateſt and beſt of men. It is not naturally impoſſible that men may miſtake their intereſts, may invent and imbelliſh an unprofitable lie, that they may run upon their own deſtruction for no advantage; a frenzy may ſeize them, or a falſe appearance of things may carry them on without ſuſpicion of the tragical iſſue. All this, and a great deal more that might be ſuppoſed, is not naturally impoſſible.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding, it muſt be aſſerted, that there are caſes, and the caſe before us is of that nature, in which we have ſuch evidence of the truth and certainty of facts, and of the perſons teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, on which we believe the facts, that it is morally impoſſible we ſhould be deceived. This is too abſtruſe and nice a ſpeculation, or I durſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the proof and even demonſtration of it, that it is morally impoſſible, that the writers of the Bible have impoſed a falſe hiſtory upon us, and that the Bible ſhould be falſe. I beg leave only to retouch what I have already enlarged upon, which I think makes good this aſſertion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:028262_0128_0FD7F50EDD538D98"/>
It is morally impoſſible, that ſo many perſons ſhould be deceived themſelves, in ſo many ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and in the ſeveral facts related by them; that Moſes, the evangeliſts, and apoſtles ſhould be deceived. The reaſon is, they have all the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that men are capable of having: had the aſſurance and cloſeſt teſtimony of all their ſenſes. And conſequently, if they were deceived all other men may be deceived in all other inſtances, and there is no certainty of any thing remaining. And if this be granted, there is an end of all converſe and of all religion: we can neither have correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with our follow creatures, nor receive any revelation from God. For how do I know what any man ſaith to me, or that he ſpeaks at all; that God ſpeaks, or what he ſpeaks, if I may not truſt my ſenſes and faculties. And if Moſes or the apoſtles might not truſt their ſenſes, but might be deceived in the report they make of the miracles and facts that fell under their obſervation, you and I, and all the world, may be deceived, and that in every thing. The reſult of which is, that we can depend neither on God, our neighbor, nor ourſelves.</p>
            <p>It is alſo morally impoſſible they ſhould deceive others, or deſign an attempt to do it. One reaſon of this may be taken from the conſequence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the ſincerity of theſe perſons. It is certain that man was made for ſociety, with an inclination and love to it: he needs it, deſires it, derives his ſupport and comfort from it. And as God deſigned him for ſuch a ſtate, he has given him principles, or made impreſſions upon him, ſuitable thereto. It is alſo certain that there can be no ſociety without mutual truſt and confidence, which is the band and cement of it; nor any mutual truſt without truth and integrity ſuppoſed, which is the foundation on which it reſts. Now what I aſſert and argue from is this, that the perſons I am ſpeaking of, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028262_0129_0FD7F5106BAAD928"/>of the Scripture, had the higheſt characters of integrity. If we do not admit them to be credible, none are, none ever were, or can be credible. The conſequence of which, if it be conſidered will be no leſs than the diſſolution of ſociety. Where there is no truth there can be no truſt, and where there is no truſt there can be no ſociety. And if we may not truſt ſuch men, appearing with ſuch criterions and marks of honeſty as Moſes and the apoſtles, we can truſt none in the world.</p>
            <p>Further, they could have no motive to deceive, which is another reaſon of my aſſertion, and ſhews it impoſſible they ſhould intend to do it. Men do not uſe to invent lies for nothing; much leſs to ſpend their time, ſacrifice their eaſe, reputation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and even their lives, in propagating an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable forgery, and what they know to be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. And yet this was the caſe of the writers of the Bible, of the New Teſtament preachers and writers particularly, if their hiſtory be falſe. The facts they publiſhed to the world, and the doctrines they preached, were ſuch as brought all ſorts of ſufferings upon them. They were told and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it would be ſo; and yet ſtedfaſtly, reſolutely and unanimouſly, give their teſtimony, and adhere to it to the laſt, ſealing it with their blood. Now I reckon it morally impoſſible they ſhould have acted ſuch a part, had they been conſcious of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, and known they were deceiving the world. It is contrary to the human nature, to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſelf-preſervation, and to that ſelf-love that is natural to every man: for though the will chuſe freely and cannot be forced, yet no man can chuſe evil as ſuch, chuſe miſery, ſufferings, and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that we have the utmoſt ſecurity here that theſe perſons were no deceivers, that the Bible is true, and that it is impoſſible it ſhould not be ſo.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only mention one thing more, <hi>viz.</hi> that it
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028262_0130_0FD7F51402F7EEF8"/>is morally impoſſible, ſo many perſons of different ſentiments in other things, different intereſts and parties, ſhould agree in contriving an impoſture, and ſo many others ſtill of different intereſts, and the like, ſhould be impoſed upon by it, and none of the former ever confeſs, nor any of the latter ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the impoſture. This I affirm impoſſible. We muſt ſuppoſe mankind to have faculties and natures very different from what they now have, and to be governed by different laws, before we can admit ſuch a caſe as poſſible. There is no ſufficient cauſe of ſuch an effect; but on the other hand, there are cauſes, known, certain, and conſtant, proceeding from nature, and the governing principles of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that would produce a contrary effect. It is not poſſible that among the many thouſands that owned chriſtianity, ſome eſpecially when they came to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and death, ſhould not have acknowledged the villainy, had there been any. Surely ſome of them would have done it, to have delivered their conſciences from reproach, or at leaſt to have ſaved their lives. It is not poſſible, had their ſtory been falſe, that their enemies, who were ſpectators and witneſſes of the facts they report, and to whom they appeal, ſhould be ſilent, and never contradict or undertake to diſprove them: but inſtead of it, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them be wrought upon to eſpouſe the ſame cauſe, and confirm it with their teſtimony and blood. Lay ſuch a ſcheme nearer home and among ourſelves, and it will be eaſy to ſee, that a forgery is impoſſible in any caſe that bears a tolerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to that we are conſidering.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not dwell any longer upon theſe things, having conſidered the matter more fully before; and only deſigning by this review a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to limit, explain, and confirm the laſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I advanced, <hi>viz.</hi> that circumſtances conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is morally impoſſible the Bible ſhould not be
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028262_0131_0FD7F5181E889EB0"/>true. Taking it therefore for granted, as a point I have already, I think, ſufficiently proved; that it is true: I now proceed a ſtep further, to the next thing propoſed, which was,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To prove, that the Bible is the word of God, or, that the books which compoſe our ſcriptures were given by divine inſpiration. I have enlarged upon the foregoing head, the truth of the ſacred hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, beyond my firſt intention, and indeed had I deſigned to have taken ſuch a compaſs, I ſhould have caſt part of my diſcourſe into a different me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. I ſhall endeavor to be ſhorter on the preſent ſubject, namely, in confirming the inſpiration of the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>What I mean when I ſay, the penmen thereof were inſpired, is that they wrote under the ſpecial and infallible conduct of the Holy Spirit; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the prophets and apoſtles, they that were concerned in delivering to us the truths and doctrines of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, were ſont of God and commiſſioned by him, were ſtirred up to their reſpective undertakings and ſervices by God, by whom they were alſo infallibly affiſted, ſo as, that the things they deliver muſt be eſteemed a revelation from him.</p>
            <p>There were indeed different modes of revelation, and different kinds and degrees of inſpiration: as I obſerved in the firſt diſcourſe from this text. <hi>God at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake unto the fathers by the prophets.</hi> Sometimes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelf to them by dreams, ſometimes by viſions; ſometimes by a voice, an audible voice, thus he ſpake to Adam, Abraham, Moſes, and others: and ſometimes by inward impreſſions upon the mind or underſtanding, which is more properly inſpiration.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he ſuggeſted the very matter and words to them. Sometimes, I ſuppoſe, he left them to the uſe of their own words, ſupplying them with
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028262_0132_0FD7F525F05955A8"/>the matter; and in things they were well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and recorded as hiſtory, and of which they had been eye-witneſſes, all that I think neceſſary to aſſert is, that he concurred with them and aſſiſted as there was occaſion, and ſo as might ſecure them from miſtake: juſt as a guide to a traveller, he needs not direct him in that part of the way he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf knows, it is enough to attend him, and when he is like to wander, to admoniſh, or reduce when he doth wander. In a word, by the inſpiration of the Bible is meant, that it is a divine revelation, a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God. The hiſtory of it is infallibly true, and immediately inſpired ſo far as was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the doctrines of it communicated from heaven, in various ways and different manners, I grant; but all from heaven; publiſhed by perſons that had a divine commiſſion, who were ſent of God to make ſuch revelations to the world. The further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtating this point, I am ſenſible, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a great deal of time; but as ſomething was ſaid of it before, though very ſhort and defective, I ſhall not reſume it, but directly go on to prove what I am upon, namely, that the Bible is the word of God, or that the books of the Old and New Teſtament, are divinely inſpired. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſhall lay before you ſeveral arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The writers of the Bible profeſſed themſelves to be inſpired, to be ſent of God, and accordingly ſpeak in his name. We have many general aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with reference to this; as in the text, <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God.</hi> So, 2 Pet. i. 20.21. <hi>No prophecy of Scripture is of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For the prophecy came not of old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It is not of private interpretation, or rather private ſuggeſtion or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, for ſo the word <hi>Epiluſis</hi> may ſignify, though ſome crities think that the text ſhould be read dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028262_0133_0FD7F528AC5B29E0"/>and that <hi>Epiluſis,</hi> is put for <hi>Epeluſis,</hi> thus Calvin, Grotius, and others, which notes an afflatus or conception within: ſo that what the apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends is, that the prophecy of Scripture, or the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, was not the product of mens own fancies and conceptions; but was by a divine afflatus, that is, it was given by inſpiration of God. And indeed, whether we have recourſe to this criticiſm or not, and change the reading, for which the authority of ſome copies is pleaded, the apoſtle's reaſoning in the words that immediately follow makes this ſenſe plain, and I think neceſſary; <hi>For,</hi> he adds, <hi>prophecy came not of old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> If by private interpretation we mean the expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture by particular perſons, and every one for himſelf, as if that was denied here, to which purpoſe the papiſts apply the words, though they have nothing in them favorable to their cauſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſound, and build upon them a neceſſity of a public authoritative interpreter; if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the text thus, I ſay, there is no force in what the apoſtle ſubjoins. But if we take <hi>Epiluſis</hi> for inſpiration, as I think we are conſtrained to do, what follows in <hi>ver.</hi> 21 is a confirmation of that which is ſaid in the 20th. No prophecy is by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate impulſe, for <hi>it came not by the will of man,</hi> it was not the iſſue of their own faculties and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was not from any motion or choice of their own, they did not go upon their ſeveral errands, and deliver ſuch and ſuch meſſages to the world from their own heads; but had a divine impulſe, <hi>ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This I take to be the ſenſe of that text: and ſo you ſee it is a full teſtimony to the truth I am upon, that the writers of the Scripture were inſpired.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing we have elſewhere and often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, as <hi>Acts</hi> iii. 21. <hi>God ſpake by the mouth of all
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028262_0134_0FD7F528AE7FCB18"/>his holy prophets ſince the world began.</hi> Acts i. 16. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſpake by the mouth of David.</hi> And again, <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 25. <hi>Who by the mouth of thy ſervant David hath ſaid, why did the heathen rage!</hi> &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the ſecond Pſalm. The prophets were God's meſſengers, his inſtruments; he ſpake by them, by <hi>all of them ſince the world began.</hi> And we have the ſame account given of the apoſtles. Hence they are mentioned jointly with the prophets, as the foundation on which we are built. And Chriſt ſays to them, <hi>It is not ye that ſpeak, but the ſpirit of your Father, that ſpeaketh in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may add, that they all profeſs, for themſelves, to be ſent from God, to ſpeak from him, and to deliver his doctrine and meſſage. Moſes gives an account of his commiſſion, of his being ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by God, with the circumſtances thereof; he tells how God appeared to him in a burning buſh, as he was keeping Jethro's flock, and gave him orders to go to Pharaoh and undertake the deliverance of oppreſſed Iſrael. And you know when he afterwards came to deliver laws to that people, he always introduces God as the author of them; thus you read, the <hi>Lord ſpake unto him out of the tabernacle,</hi> and appointed the laws and ſervices following. And, <hi>God ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, ſpeak unto the children of Iſrael,</hi> which is conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated when any new matter was to be laid before them. Nor did the following prophets of the Old Teſtament pretend to act without the like authority, the word of the Lord came to them when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> was the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to their meſſages and diſcourſes. The ſame might be obſerved concerning them that delivered the doctrine of the New Teſtament. Chriſt himſelf, the great prophet of the church, owns his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Father, and that he received his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028262_0135_0FD7F52A0B007F70"/>from him, <hi>my doctrine,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is not mine, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> his that ſent me.</hi> Again, <hi>he that ſent me is true, and I ſpeak unto the world thoſe things which I have heard of him.</hi> And, <hi>I do nothing of myſelf, but as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has taught me, I ſpeak theſe things.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe, <hi>I have not ſpoken of myſelf, but the Father which ſent me, he gave me commandment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The apoſtles claimed the like authority; I do not mean, equal to Chriſt, but a divine miſſion and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as he did; hence when they proceed to the determination of the queſtion debated in the council at Jeruſalem, they intereſt the Holy Ghoſt therein, <hi>it ſeems good to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and lo us,</hi> intimating, that what they delivered to the churches the Holy Ghoſt delivered; or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly delivered it by and under his immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and direction. The greateſt and moſt copious writer of the New Teſtament, was the apoſtle Paul, and we find him on all occaſions aſſerting his divine authority and inſpiration. He tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that he had <hi>received of the Lord, what he delivered to them.</hi> That the <hi>things he wrote were the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</hi> And to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that he was <hi>an apoſtle not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father.</hi> And how direct that to the <hi>Theſſalonians, when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God.</hi> And St. Peter, ſpeaking of the goſpel, ſays, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt ſent it down from heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what the writers of the Scripture profeſs; many of them in the moſt expreſs terms, and you have heard the ſame is affirmed of all of them. If it be objected, that impoſtors have profeſſed the like; many have pretended to inſpiration, that were deluded by their own fancies, or by a warm and heated imagination, and how do we know that
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028262_0136_0FD7F52CAB3B13E0"/>the writers of the Bible were not impoſed upon as well as others. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is granted, ſome have been deluded, and have taken their own imaginations for a divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; but this is no argument that all are ſo; and that none ever had a revelation from God. A man may fancy himſelf awake when he is in a dream, and have a great many ſcenes laid before him in his ſleep, which he takes for real, though all be imaginary. But it doth not follow from hence, that he cannot know when he is awake, or be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ever he is awake, or of any thing that is tranſacted before him, or that he himſelf doth when he is awake. No more doth it follow that becauſe ſome perſons of diſtempered brains have thought themſelves inſpired, when they were not, that none could ever know that they were inſpired.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would aſk the objectors here, whether they will allow that God is able to reveal himſelf to any part of mankind, ſo that they ſhall be certain of the revelation? If not, they ſuppoſe God has leſs power and ſkill than men have, who can expreſs their minds to their fellow-creatures in ſuch a manner, as that they are ſure who it is that ſpeaks to them, and what it is they ſpeak. And if God is able to do this, the objection falls to the ground. Some perſons may then have a revelation from him, any may, to whom he pleaſes to vouchſafe it, in which they may reſt aſſured there is no impoſture or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The perſons inſpired might know by inward ſenſation and feeling, that they were inſpired, and that God ſpake to them; and I doubt not, with as an infallible a certainty as we know when another perſon, like ourſelves, is converſing with us, and ſpeaking to us. God might make ſuch an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon their ſenſes and minds as carried its own evidence with it, and though we that are utterly
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028262_0137_0FD7F52E04C9D480"/>ſtrangers to ſuch a communication with God, have no idea or notion of it, they that were concerned could feel it, and knew how to diſtinguiſh it. To clear this in all the inſtances of inſpiration, by voices, dreams, viſions, and more direct and mental inſpiration, as I may call it, would require a long diſcourſe of itſelf, which I know you will excuſe me from, though a ſubject well worthy our ſerious thoughts, was this a place for it. I will only ſay, if we allow God is able to make any revelation of himſelf, we muſt ſuppoſe he can do it in a way that is diſtinct and certain: and I need not ſcruple to add, that the perſon to whom he makes it, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it by the faculties to which he applies in his revelation, as clearly as we do our mutual diſcourie, the communication we have one with another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There was nothing that looks like deluſion in the caſe of theſe ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red writers and preachers. They had all the marks of a regular head and of a calm ſedate mind, that can be; had none of the heats of enthuſiaſts ſo far as appears. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they were not credulous, did not ſeem for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they engaged in; nor to have any preparation and bent towards the ſervice they undertook. You know what objections Moſes made againſt the errand God called him to, <hi>who am I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that I ſhould go unto Pharaoh, and that I ſhould bring forth the children of Iſrael out of Egypt? They will not believe me nor hearken to my voice.</hi> And after God had condeſcended to give him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this matter, ſtill he objects, <hi>O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor ſince thou haſt ſpoken unto thy fervant.</hi> And notwithſtanding God had promiſed to be with him and aſſiſt him, his reluctancy ſtill remains. <hi>O my Lord, ſend I pray th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend.</hi> So little was this perſon prepared to be played upon
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028262_0138_0FD7F5310FC6BA10"/>and abuſed, either by his own imagination or the management of others.</p>
            <p>And the like might be obſerved of the apoſtles. They were themſelves very much prejudiced againſt the main articles of the doctrines that they were to teach the world, <hi>viz.</hi> the death and reſurrection of Chriſt. Though their maſter had often ſpoke thereof to them they could not believe it, nor did they underſtand him: ſo far from it, that when it came to paſs and he was actually put to death, their hopes ſeemed to die with him, <hi>we truſted,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi> Words of deſpair, intimating they thought their cauſe loſt and ruined. So when they were told of his reſurrection, it is ſaid, <hi>the words ſeemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</hi> This was the caſe of the apoſtles at that time. The apoſtle Paul was not then of their number, but afterwards called to the ſame office, and had an eminent part in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the doctrine of the New Teſtament, and I need not tell you that he had even ſtronger preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices than the reſt againſt the cauſe he eſpouſed. He perſecuted Chriſt in his members with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fury; and ſo much had his zeal blinded him, that as he owns in his defence before Agrippa, he <hi>verily thought with himſelf he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> In which temper of mind divine grace, and the call of God ſound him. Now how little there is in all this of the characters of enthuſiaſin, how oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it is thereto, every one may eaſily diſcern. Enthuſiaſts generally have a preparation in the bent and temper of their mind, to receive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion; they readily believe that to be true, which they would have to be true: they are prejudiced in favor of their pretended revelation. Whereas, the prejudices of theſe perſons lay the other way, and were ſo ſtrong that it is plain they would not
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028262_0139_0FD7F5329C3EA2F8"/>act without full conviction of the call of God, and till they were overpowered, as I may ſay, into the belief of it. I add,</p>
            <p n="5">5 That no ſcruples might remain God gave them ſuch evidence of his ſpeaking to them and of their miſſion as could not be reſiſted. Let us ſuppoſe, that when God ſpake to Moſes in Horeb out of the burning buſh, he might doubt whether it was real or not, whether he was in a dream or trance, whether it was not ſome unaccountable phoenomenon that had nothing of divinity in it, or the artifice of an evil ſpirit. Suppoſe this I ſay, he could not doubt any longer when God bid him caſt his rod upon the ground and it became a ſerpent. Much leſs could he carry his ſcruple with him in all his journey from Horeb to Egypt, and ſtill maintain it after all that paſſed in Egypt; after he had by the power of God wrought ſo many miracles there, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Pharaoh and of the Iſraelites. He that can ſuppoſe this is too great a ſceptic to be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with; and indeed it is impoſſible he ſhould, upon his principles, be certain of the reality of any thing that he ſees or hears, or that he himſelf doth. God reveals himſelf to Moſes, that is the thing I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, and that he might be ſure of the revelation, he firſt ſummons and awakens his attention by a ſtrange appearance, a buſh all in a flame and not conſumed. Then he ſpeaks to him out of the buſh in a manner that no queſtion, had ſomething great and majeſtic in it, and brought along with it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of divinity. And that Moſes might be able to ſatisfy others, and at the ſame time be further ſatisfied himſelf, for what would do the one, muſt be ſufficient to do the other, he enables him to work a miracle, and afterwards repeat that, and do many more miracles. All which conſidered, I think it even impoſſible that Moſes ſhould be deceived; and if any are ſo reſolute, as to ſuppoſe he might
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028262_0140_0FD7F533625D12C8"/>be under a deluſion, notwithſtanding all this ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the contrary, they muſt be forced to ſay that God cannot reveal himſelf to mankind with certainty, or mankind is not capable of receiving the revelation, which comes to the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>I might illuſtrate the argument in many more inſtances, particularly in that of the apoſtles. But I will only obſerve, that when they were firſt called to their office they labored under a great many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities, wanted light, wiſdom, courage; and were no way equal to ſo difficult a work as lay before them, <hi>viz.</hi> preaching the goſpel to and proſelyting all nations. This they were but meanly qualified for, and therefore their great maſter, when he took leave of them juſt before his aſcenſion, bid them tarry at <hi>Jeruſale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> until they were indued with power from on high.</hi> What this power was we are told, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 8. <hi>Ye ſhall receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you: and ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me, both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and unto the uttermoſt part of the earth.</hi> This he promiſed, and in the ſecond of Acts you have an hiſtory of the great event, an account of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the promiſe, when the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them at the day of Pentecoſt. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which was their ſpeaking all ſorts of tongues which they had never learned, to the amazement of thoſe that heard them, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Now as this was the power from on high, their maſter had given them reaſon to expect, and an eminent inſtance of their inſpiration; ſo it was a ſenſible thing and carried its own evidence along with it; they found that change in themſelves, that exaltation of their faculties, that new light in their minds, and that new furniture of ſtrength and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity communicated to them, that they could no more queſtion the thing, nor that it was from God, than that they could queſtion their own beings, and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028262_0141_0FD7F53C4D15AF88"/>whether they were men or not. If their ſenſes and faculties might deceive them in this particular, they might deceive them in all other things; and I think I may add, all other men in all other inſtances may be deceived; and conſequently it will be true, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, we are, and can be, certain of nothing.</p>
            <p>So that thus far, I would hope the way is toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably clear. The writers of Scripture affirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be inſpired; and they could not be under a deluſion, but might know whether they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired or not.</p>
            <p>But it may here again be aſked, how doth this prove the point I bring it for, namely, that they were inſpired? they might impoſe upon us, and take upon them to be inſpired, to be ſent of God, and to be entruſted with a revelation from heaven, when they were not. We have only their bare word for it. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the arguments I before produced, to prove their hiſtory true, will conclude in their behalf in the preſent caſe. I have given you ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that there were ſuch perſons, that they did the things they relate, that the matters of fact they record were genuine, that they had all the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ingenuity, integrity, and veracity, that any hiſtorians ever had, or can have, and that if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe them, and depend on their teſtimony, it follows, none in the world are to be believed in any of their reports; that there is no ſuch thing as credible hiſtory, and as was further argued in a former diſcourſe, no ſafe converſe; all mutual truſt and converſe is deſtroyed; and in a word, human ſociety muſt be diſſolved. This it was proved, would be the conſequence of denying the credit and refuſing the teſtimony of perſons ſo qualified, as the writers of the Bible were. And, I think, it needs no proof, that if we cannot believe them in this part
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028262_0142_0FD7F5412F55DBE0"/>of their teſtimony concerning their inſpiration and divine miſſion, we may believe them in nothing. So that the reſult is this, if there be any ſufficient witneſſes among mankind, theſe were ſuch; if any true hiſtory, the Bible is true, and if the Bible be true it was inſpired.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſuppoſe them guilty of forgery, and to pretend to a commiſſion and revelation from God, when they knew they had none, is to make them act contrary to all the principles of human nature that we are acquainted with. It makes them guilty, not only of an unprofitable, but of a deſtructive lie. They knew, according to the rules of the religion they propagated, they could have no reward in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; and they knew as certainly they muſt be undone in this world. And what ſort of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt we ſuppoſe them, if we make them act ſo extravagant a part, expoſing themſelves as they did without any motive. For inſtance, what temptation could Moſes have to forego the honors and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Pharaoh's court, and chuſe to ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with the people of God, had he not been aſſured of a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e call? What could induce the apoſtles to follow Chriſt through ſufferings, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and death, had they been conſcious of a lie, queſtioned the authority of their maſter, or their own ſincerity, in engaging in his ſervice? Would the apoſtle Paul, think you, have renounced the commiſſion he had from the great men of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church, with all the advantages he expected from them, and become a preacher of Chriſt, upon no other proſpect but bonds, impriſonment, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom? Would he have done this, had he not been aſſured of the juſtice of the cauſe he eſpouſed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the certainty of the heavenly viſion, as he calls it? So that we have not only an argument taken from their veracity, but a ſtrong evidence
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028262_0143_0FD7F5419DA32C68"/>ariſing out of the principles of the human nature. To ſuppoſe they were deceivers in this inſtance, is to ſuppoſe them ruining themſelves for nothing, guilty of the greateſt wickedneſs without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and doing evil for evil's-ſake; which it may be is more than can be charged on the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. They not only ſaid they were inſpired, but proved it by a train of facts that alarmed and amazed them. God gave ſatisfaction to Moſes concerning his miſſion by enabling him to work miracles upon the ſpot, as you read in the third and fourth of Exodus. And by the ſame means, <hi>viz.</hi> a courſe of miracles, he gave the ſame ſatisfaction to the Iſraelites concerning it. Chriſt ſent the apoſtles, they were aſſured, as otherwiſe, ſo by the <hi>power from on high,</hi> that he had ſent them, and by exerting that power in a ſeries of ſupernatural mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous works, they gave ſufficient evidence to the world of their divine miſſion, that God had ſent them, and ſpake by them, and that he owned their teſtimony and doctrine; as I may more fully ſhew hereafter.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt argument, the authors of the Bible profeſs themſelves to be inſpired; wherein I have ſhown, that they could not but know whether they were or not; and that they cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed to deceive us in their teſtimony. I go on now to another argument, which I ſhall go through more brieſly.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As the writers of the Scripture profeſs to have their doctrine from God, ſo it could not be the invention of men. This will abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the progreſs of my diſcourſes. What I at preſent ground my argument upon, is, the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ability of men to contrive ſuch a book as the Bible, of men as ſuch, or of any ſort of men.</p>
            <p>It could not be the contrivance of bad men.
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028262_0144_0FD7F54463453490"/>Had they invented a religion, ſurely they would have made it more favorable to their own inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, luſts and appetites; would not have fettered themſelves, laid themſelves under ſuch reſtraints as the Bible doth, and denounced ſuch tremendous judgments againſt the ways they chuſe and love; they would not have conſulted ſo entirely the honor of God, and the reputation of virtue and goodneſs, as we find the Scripture doth; but would have calculated it more according to their own natures and deſigns. I may add, could we ſuppoſe them capable of this, which yet is to make them act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their nature, we cannot imagine they ſhould be at ſo much expence to promote the cauſe of the Bible, ſacrifice their worldly intereſts, and even their lives for the ſake of it. Did ever bad men act ſuch a part, contrive the greateſt good, ſuffer and die to advance it.</p>
            <p>It could not be the contrivance of good men. This ſuppoſition involves them in a guilt, perfectly inconſiſtent with their character. They ſpeak, as you have heard, in the name of God, and profeſs to have received their doctrine from him. Now if it was otherwiſe, and they were conſcious of a forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they muſt be the groſſeſt impoſtors in the world, which is ſo directly contrary to all virtue and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty, that it can never be imputed to any man that deſerves the name of good. In ſhort, the former ſuppoſition makes bad men do the beſt thing that can be, and this makes good men do the worſt; both which are abſurd.</p>
            <p>It could not be the invention of any man or men. This might be demonſtrated, had I time to ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and ſeveral things will afterwards occur that may confirm the aſſertion. No man nor body of men could invent ſuch an hiſtory as that of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A learned Jew, Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael, inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the account Moſes gives of the creation,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028262_0145_0FD7F545974FED10"/>which he maintains could not be his own invention. For no man's reaſon, ſays he, will dictate to him that the world was made in ſix days, and at certain intervals of time, ſince it is more for the glory of God's power to make the world in an inſtant. Who can imagine, adds he, that the heavens were made without the ſtars, and adorned with them on the <hi>fourth day?</hi> What judicious mind can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the plants were created on the <hi>third day,</hi> and the ſun on the <hi>fourth,</hi> ſince naturally they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their vegetation from the ſun? He mentions other particulars, and concludes, the creation of the world was revealed to Adam, and that his poſterity had it by tradition from him. But becauſe it was not fit, a thing of ſuch weight ſhould rely on the authority of one man, God in the ſecond place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Moſes on mount Sinai, and gave him a clear aſſurance of theſe things. Whether this be thought throughout ſolid or not, the ſubject he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to muſt paſs for a pertinent inſtance of a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that has ſomething more than human in it. Longinus the heathen philoſopher, and maſter of Porphyry, is ſaid to have admired Moſes's hiſtory of the creation; and he makes the account of the firſt day's work, an inſtance of the true ſublime. There is indeed more ſatisfaction in it about the original of the world, the author of it, and manner of creation, than in all the books of Pagan philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>
            <p>And what ſhall we ſay of the many events record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bible in a prophetic manner? Some of them many hundreds, and ſome ſeveral thouſand years before they came to paſs. I cannot enter upon the particulars now, though I may do it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, any one that ſeriouſly conſiders the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons recorded in the Scripture, muſt ſee it could be indicted by no underſtanding leſs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n infinite.</p>
            <p>I might take notice of the doctrine of the Bible,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028262_0146_0FD7DACDF7C340D8"/>and ſhew how much this exceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> human invention. How majeſtic and ſublime a part of it? How ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably the whole is ſitted to the circumſtances of man, preſcribing to him in every relation and caſe, anſwering all his occaſions and neceſſities; and every way adapted at once to promote his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the honor of God. Theſe and a great many other particulars that might be inſiſted upon, ſhew that the Bible could not be the invention of any human mind, of any man or men, of whatever quality or capacity; and fully prove what the apoſtle afferts, that <hi>no prophecy of Scripture is of private inſpiration,</hi> or impulſe, that it <hi>came not by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſeveral other arguments to offer, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the aſſertion, but muſt leave them to another opportunity. In the mean time I cannot help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking, how unreaſonable the cauſe of infidelity is. The deiſts and others, that reject the authority of the Bible, do it upon a pretence that would ruin all the hiſtory in the world, deſtroy all human truſt and teſtimony, and introduce univerſal ſceptiſciſm. For if the perſons, who publiſhed the Bible, might not be certain of what they ſaw and felt, of the facts they relate, and inſpiration they pretend to, no man can be certain of any thing whatſoever. If we may not depend on ſuch teſtimony as that of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we can depend upon no teſtimony, nor believe any thing unleſs we ſee it, nor indeed then neither. For if they might be deceived and deluded, ſo may others, all others; it could not be expected that any ſhould have a greater aſſurance of things than they had, and conſequently, there is an end of all evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence even of that of the ſenſes; an end of all truſt, of all certainty: ſo very abſurd is the iſſue of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.</p>
            <p>And I cannot forbear adding, it would be well
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028262_0147_0FD7F548D438AA90"/>for theſe men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>at cannot reſt in the evidence of the truth and divinity of the Scriptures, could they carry their ſceptiſciſm with them into the other world. But theſe unreaſonable cavils by which they now ſupport the worſt cauſe, will then vaniſh, and all will appear real; the truths they deſpiſed real, the diſtreſſes they feel real, and neither the one nor the other to be run down with a jeſt and a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. O let us believe this before-hand, believe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the prophets, Chriſt and his apoſtles, that we come not to the place of torments, and there receive a terrible, as well as unavoidable convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; believe and reverence the Scriptures, and conduct ourſelves according to the glorious rules thereof. It is the Bible that deſcribes heaven and the way to it: it is the light by which a wiſe and gracious God would guide us through this world, a dark and dangerous place, and the more we love, ſtudy and practice the Holy Scripture, the more we ſhall know of the future heavenly ſtate, and the fitter we ſhall be for the enjoyments of it. Let the word of God therefore dwell richly in you. <hi>Peace ſhall be upon all them that walk according to this rule, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The excellency of its doctrine, is an internal character of its divinity. The Bible contains the moſt glorious ſyſtem of religion. Conſider the general ſcheme of it, and it will appear a revelation admirably ſuited to the caſe and circumſtances of men, and every way worthy of God.</p>
            <p>That we are fallen creatures, and, as ſuch, guilty and defiled, all the world is, or may be convinced by their own experience. The wiſer heathens were ſenſible of this, though how to account for it they knew not. <hi>Whence comes evil?</hi> was a queſtion they could not reſolve. What more agreeable to the acknowledged perfections of God, that infinite goodneſs, kindneſs, and love we aſcribe to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the world, and Father of all things, than to pity, relieve, and reſtore his loſt creatures? And what method more congruous and ſuitable to that end, than that which is laid down in the Scripture, namely, by repentance, and remiſſion of ſins through the mediation and atonement of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? What was more neceſſary for God to do for us, than to forgive our ill, and make us good again? And what way to remove the guilt of ſin, but his grace, ſince it was impoſſible we ſhould make him ſatisfaction? As for the method in which he has done it, by the ſacrifice of his Son, though we cannot at preſent comprehend the depth of that deſign, it appears however a diſpenſation full of wiſdom and goodneſs, highly tending to advance the honor of God, and ſecure the gratitude and obedience of the creature. This is the general ſcope of all the evangelical writings. They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the plan and council of infinite wiſdom for the ſalvation of ſinners through the Lord Jeſus, make known the purpoſe of God for the redemption and recovery of fallen man, the method, means, and terms thereof; a contrivance ſo wonderfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the great end it is refferred to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028262_0150_0FD7F5500733B448"/>ſo profound a myſtery both of wiſdom and grace as ſpeaks its author, and ſhews it could not be of man, but from God.</p>
            <p>Which would appear with greater advantage, could we here ſurvey more particularly the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Scripture. The Bible is a revelation, a diſtinct and full revelation, of all that concerns our duty and happineſs, of all that it behoves us to know and practice. I might illuſtrate this, in the three great branches of religion, as it refers to God, our neighbor and ourſelves. With reference to God, we are there inſtructed in all the particulars of religion as he is the object of it. For inſtance, we have a glorious diſcovery of the divine nature and will. I grant that the being and attributes of God are not to be proved from Scripture, a belief and ſome knowledge of theſe is ſuppoſed to the belief of the Bible. The divine perfections, eſpecially his goodneſs and veracity or truth, are the greateſt ſecurity we can have that we are not deceived in embracing the Scriptures as a divine revelation. And theſe perfections are otherwiſe to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated and muſt be known beforehand. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of them doth not firſt and chiefly depend on the account we have of them in the Bible. But notwithſtanding, it may juſtly be reckoned among the benefits and advantages of Scripture revelation, and among the excellencies thereof, that it gives us ſo clear a view of the perfections of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Moſes and the prophets revealed God to the world, and the only begotten Son, that lay in the boſom of the Father, who is the brightneſs of his glory, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs image of his perſon,</hi> hath more fully revealed him. The Bible makes God known in his nature as the one God, the living and true God, infinitely wiſe, powerful, juſt and good; the bleſſed and only potentate, who alone hath immortality, whom no
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028262_0151_0FD7F5513122FAC0"/>man hath ſeen, or can ſee. It makes known the glorious myſtery of the trinity, repreſents the three divine perſons jointly carrying on the work of our ſalvation, acting ſeveral and diſtinct parts in this great affair, according to the council of the divine will, and all conſpiring in the ſame deſign and end. A diſpenſation of wiſdom and grace, that no book in the world can pretend to give an account of but the Bible.</p>
            <p>We have here alſo a full diſcovery of our duty towards God in the diſſerent parts thereof; as, that we muſt love him with all our heart, ſoul, mind and ſtrength; that we fear him, and fear him above all others, as being <hi>able to caſt both body and ſoul into hell;</hi> that we truſt in him, hope in him, rejoice in him, and the like; that we worſhip him, outwardly by prayer, praiſe, thankſgiving and faſting; and as to the manner, that we <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth;</hi> that we <hi>lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting,</hi> and that we <hi>do every thing in the name of the Lord Jeſus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</hi> A glorious plan of religious worſhip this! grounded upon the perfections of the divine nature, and mediation of Chriſt, and admirably correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with the caſe and neceſſities of ſinful man.</p>
            <p>As to our duty towards our neighbor, nothing can exceed the rules and preſcriptions of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture herein. We are commanded to <hi>love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor as ourſelves;</hi> and whatever we would that men ſhould do to us, we are required to do even ſo to them; which glorious and divine laws the great author of the Bible hath there more particularly explained, and filled up with ſuch inſtances of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, charity and love, that nothing can be added to them. He requires, that we put away all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil-ſpeaking; that we lie not one to another, nor take up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach againſt our neighbor; that we be gentle and
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028262_0152_0FD7F5597541AAC0"/>courteous, that we be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives us; that we walk with all lowlineſs and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love; that we owe no man any thing but love; and in a word, that we imitate the great pattern of goodneſs, our heavenly Father, and with a charity as extenſive as the beams and influence of the ſun, do good againſt evil, bleſs them that curſe us; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, pray for, and love our enemies, and overcome evil with good.</p>
            <p>I might ſhew at large, what proviſion is made, in the rules laid down in the Scripture, for the duty and comfort of the ſeveral ſpecial relations men ſtand in towards one another. In whatever ſtations men are placed, by the providence of God, the way of duty is there made plain before them; which did they mind and purſue, the conſequence would be the beauty and order of the world, the peace and harmony of ſociety. Every office, was it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged according to the direction of God's word, would appear glorious and uſeful among mankind, and every relation amiable and comfortable. The magiſtrate is here taught how to be a guardian of the ſociety, to defend and ſerve it in all uſeful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtries, agreeably to the original deſign and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his office, and therefore he is required to be juſt, ruling in the fear of God, to be a terror to evil works, and a praiſe to the good. Parents are here taught, with what tenderneſs and care, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and provide for their children; to treat them as an holy ſeed, conſeerated to God, bringing them <hi>up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> And that moſt intinate relation between huſband and wife is made an emblem and ſigure of the relation between Chriſt and the church. The huſband is to love his wiſe, as Chriſt the church, the wife to obſerve and reverence her huſband, as the church doth
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028262_0153_0FD7F55B71E740D8"/>Chriſt; and both together are to make up a lively image of the love and ſubjection there is between Chriſt and the church. And ſhould I purſue the account through all other relations, as ſubjects and children, miniſters and people, maſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and ſet before you the ſeveral precepts and rules of Scripture for the conduct of perſons in thoſe relations, the excellency of the doctrine of the Bible might be demonſtrated from thence to the conviction of all. It would appear, how well it is calculated to promote the good of ſociety, and that it muſt proceed, not only from a friend to mankind, but one that perfectly underſtands the human nature, that knows what there is in man, and what man is; what is the juſt decorum of every action, and what becomes him in every ſtate; that underſtands his intereſts, defects and wants; what belongs to his whole duty, and what would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his happineſs.</p>
            <p>But to touch a little the next particular, our duty towards ourſelves, here the Bible exceeds all other inſtitutes, all the laws and maxims of the moral phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, though it is granted, ſome of them have ſpoke admirably on this head. The Scripture above all other books teaches us the knowledge of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It enjoins, that we ſhould not think of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>more highly than we ought to think, but to think ſobely, according as God has dealt to every man the meaſure of faith.</hi> And it hath directed us to make a right eſtimate of ourſelves, preferring the ſoul to the body, and the intereſts thereof, to all the little concerns of the preſent life. Which is the import of Chriſt's doctrine, <hi>What is a man proſited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> The Scripture teaches us the proportion of our cares, and the moderation and government of our paſſions in a moſt exact and divine manner. Tells us one
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028262_0154_0FD7F55D96FC1C08"/>thing is needful, bids us not <hi>labor for the meat which periſhes, but for that which endureth unto everlaſting life,</hi> to take no thought for the body, ſaying, <hi>what ſhall we eat, or what ſhall we drink, or wherewithal ſhall we be clothed.</hi> And becauſe the mind of man is too confined and limited to be intent upon two ſtudies at once, which tend to divide and diſtract it, we cannot ſerve two maſters, we are therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to give up the one, whenever it comes in competition with the other, and to ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And how many and excellent its rules concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſobriety, moderation, humility, temperance, chaſtity, and the like. It enjoins us to <hi>mortify our members which are on the earth, fornication, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inordinate affections and evil concupiſcence;</hi> to take heed leſt our <hi>hearts be over-charged with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting and drunkenneſs and cares of this life;</hi> to <hi>poſſeſs our veſſel in fanctification and honor;</hi> to be content with ſuch things as we have, and to depend on the providence and promiſe of God, who hath ſaid, he will never leave us nor forſake us. In a word, the Bible preſcribes to men in every ſtate and circumſtance, and lays down moſt excellent laws and rules, ſuch as tend to reform and perfect their natures, to make them comfortable, uſeful and happy in this and the other world; it regulates their deſires, paſſions and affections, and as it is in the verſe following the text, <hi>is able to make the man of God perfect, thoroughly furniſhed to every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me add what I obſerved before, <hi>viz.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is excellent in natural religion, and to be found among the philoſophers, is all of it taken into the Bible. And further, the Bible repreſents the ſame with much advantage; what lies ſcattered in the books of the heathen philoſophers, and muſt have been gathered from thence with much care and difficulty, is here brought to our hands and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028262_0155_0FD7F55E9C1F3030"/>us in a ſhort ſummary, truths that were hid under much rubbiſh and mixed with many miſtakes are here pure and clear, and without adulteration. And again, the Bible ſupplies the defects of natural religion; ſome of theſe have been before taken notice of, and I ſhall now enlarge.</p>
            <p>Natural religion, or the light of reaſon, ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the myſtery and redemption of the Son of God incarnate, it diſcovers nothing certainly of the pardon of ſin, the terms and means of it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of the atonement by the ſacrifice of Chriſt; it leaves us very much in the dark about the main article and foundation of all religion, a future eternal ſtate of rewards and puniſhments; and indeed is lame and imperfect, as to moral duties and virtues. It is obſervable, that the philoſophers have no name for that eminent chriſtian grace of humility. What we call ſo, paſſes with them for abjectneſs and lowneſs of mind; nay, ſo unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was their vanity, that they thought a wiſe man might make himſelf happy, and was not beholden to God for his virtues. Ariſtotle places ſeveral things in the claſtes of virtues, which the Scripture brands as vices and ſinful diſorders; as indignation and diſpleaſure at the proſperity of unworthy men, ſo expreſsly cenſured in many places of the Bible; a diſpoſition to jeſting, a lightneſs of diſcourſe, the philoſopher repreſents as a virtue, and the apoſtle condemns as not convenient among chriſtians, not being ſuitable to the gravi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y with which a chriſtian ought to conduct himſelf. Greatneſs of mind, which he defines, a man's judging himſelf to be worthy of great things, and accordingly purſuing them with an elevation of mind; thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo has the character of a virtue and excellency with that philoſopher. But how contrary it is to that modeſty, abaſement, and ſelf-denial, the becoming little children, ſaying, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have done all, that we are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:028262_0156_0FD7F55FD6CAAFB0"/>which the Scripture recommends I need not ſtand to ſhew.</p>
            <p>I might obſerve, that ſeveral of the greateſt phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers allowed lying, theft, fornication, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder, &amp;c. Even the famous Cato thought it was a point of honor to make away his own life, rather than fall into the hands of Caeſar: which Seneca, one of their ſtricteſt moraliſts, is ſo far from bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in him, that he undertakes his vindication, and applauds him for the greatneſs of his mind. Thus mixed and corrupted was their divinity, even among thoſe that had moſt refined it.</p>
            <p>But nothing of this can be charged upon the Scripture. It has none of theſe blemiſhes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. As it ſupplies what is wanting in their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo it corrects what is wrong in their edition of morality. It recommends every grace, preſcribes an entire holineſs without any blots and ſtains, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Pſalmiſt, which he mentions as an encomium upon the word of God, and one reaſon of his affection to it, <hi>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul; the ſtatutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the Lord,</hi> that is, the word or law of God teaching religion, or the fear of the Lord, <hi>is clean, enduring forever.</hi> Theſe are properties of the law of God, theſe are excellencies of the Scripture. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a doctrine according to Godlineſs, admirably ſuited to promote the great ends of religion and Godlineſs in the world. And though I will not call this, and the other argument under this claſs and order, demonſtration; yet I think they have a great deal of force in them. It is certain, if we might expect a revelation from God, the Scripture is ſuch a revelation as we might expect from him. It is a revelation every way becoming him; and to ſuppoſe it came from an impoſtor, as muſt be the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028262_0157_0FD7F5629DA1C120"/>caſe if it be not from God, is very unreaſonable and ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d. It is in its contrivance above the reach and capacity of any man, and it is manifeſt, the ſtructure and frame of it is quite contrary to the guſt and heart of a bad man.</p>

The ſpirituality of its nature, its divine ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, may be pleaded to the ſame purpoſe, and reckoned among the internal characters and marks of its divinity. And here I might take notice that no book condemns ſin like the Bible, and appears againſt it with ſo ſtrong an oppoſition. It ſtrikes at the very root of it in the thoughts, heart and deſires, and purſues it through every part of the converſation and life; repreſents it as the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing which God hates, and threatens it with eternal death.</p>
            <p>I might alſo remark, that no book ſo much and ſo effectually teaches us to deny ſelf and exalt God, as the Bible doth; to refer all to him, and give him the glory of every attainment.</p>
            <p>Thus the apoſtle, <hi>by the grace of God I am what I am.</hi> And having taken notice of his labors, his more abundant labors, in the ſervice of the goſpel, he adds, nevertheleſs, <hi>not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all ſaints.</hi> And again, <hi>though I be nothing.</hi> Where will you find any ſtrains like this in all the volumes of the philoſophers. So far from it, that pride and ſelf-exaltation was their great idol; honor, applauſe, and glory, the main ſpring of all their actions; even of their more generous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, when they ſacrificed their lives for the good of their country. But the Bible breaths all ſelf-denial, it teaches, that whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we ſhould do all to the glory of God; that we ſhould not receive honor from men, but be content with the honor that cometh from God only.</p>

I will only ſubjoin under this head as a glorious character of Scripture, that it every where recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends and promotes a right frame and poſture of ſoul towards God, and what I may call a devotional temper. The main ſcope of heathen philoſophy, was to regulate the paſſions, which it is granted was a noble ſubject; or to direct them in homiletical and ſocial virtues. The firſt tended to fit them for converſe with themſelves, and the other with their fellow creatures. But for converſe and intercourſe with God in the exerciſe of divine graces, thoſe moraliſts knew little of it. There is a deep ſilence in their writings about it. And I am ſorry to find there is ſo much of the like defect in the diſcourſes and writings of others, whoſe buſineſs and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it is to explain the Bible, and recommend the religion there taught to the world. In the mean time, the Scripture has this mark of divinity in it throughout; every part of divine revelation leads to God, to a devout communion and converſe with him; and in order to this it directs us to beg for the holy ſpirit, to ſanctify the nature, impreſs, renew, and transform the mind, and thereby prepare us for this divine and heavenly employment. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes rules of inward and outward purity, that we may not loſe the devout frame. It appoints ſolemn ordinances as ſo many means and opportunities of intercourſe with God. And I might ſhew you that this has been the temper of good men in every age of revelation. How much it was of David parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, under the Old Teſtament, every one knows that has read and conſidered his Pſalms. You of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hear him ſpeaking in theſe, and the like ſtrains, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God. In thy favor is life, thy loving-kindneſs is better than life. A day in thy courts is better than a thouſand. My ſoul thirſteth for thee,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028262_0159_0FD7F565613E50A0"/>my fleſh longeth for thee, to ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the ſanctuary.</hi> Nor are theſe expreſſions of the peculiar experience of David, but pious breathings that in ſome meaſure ſuit all good men, and deſcribe the heart and frame of the church of God. And you have a great deal to the like purpoſe in the book of Canticles, which muſt alſo be underſtood in the ſame latitude.</p>
            <p>In ſhort the Bible is a book of devotion: ſo it may not unfitly be termed. It not only preſcribes it, but ſeems very much calculated to promote it. Its principles and articles of faith, its rules and laws, its ordinances of worſhip, are all directed to this end; to elevate and raiſe the mind to God, to bring him and his ſoul near together. The ſpirit and grace it beſtows are for the ſame purpoſe given to refine the nature, purify the heart, and fit the ſoul for the divine preſence and embraces. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly all the great heroes of the Bible, thoſe divine ſouls that have lived under the impreſſion of its doctrines, have been men of devotion, a temper that the greateſt among the philoſophers, as I have hinted, were very much ſtrangers to.</p>
            <p>Now from hence without further enlargement, I think I may juſtly piece this among the characters of divinity, that we may diſcern upon the Scripture. It is pure and ſpiritual, wholly favors of God. It ſo directly leads to him in the deſign of it, that one cannot but infer it comes from him. It teaches to live godly, as well as ſoberly and righteouſly. It preſcribes an high point, the dignity and glory of human minds, which the light of nature a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the philoſophy of the heathens fell ſhort of, <hi>viz.</hi> a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commerce with God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is ſomething in the ſtyle of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that favors of divinity. As for inſtance, the majeſty and grandeur of it. I do not mean with reſpect to pompous figures, or any rhetorical flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028262_0160_0FD7F56E68AD2D70"/>and flights of oratory: but with reſpect to the authority with which it ſpeaks. It ſpeaks in the name of the great God, the maker of heaven and earth, and demands the attention of the whole world. Some have obſerved there is a great deal of majeſty in that often repeated expreſſion of our Saviour, <hi>he that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</hi> Which is a ſolemn admonition to mankind of the mighty importance of the thing ſpoken. What I would chiefly remark, is the awful ſanctions with which this book enforces its laws and precepts, no leſs than eternal rewards and eternal puniſhments. <hi>Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live. He that believeth ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Such as this, is the language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hereby it is too ſublime and great for any human lawgiver. How far any might have gone in this way, perſonating the ſupreme majeſty of God, and abuſing the world with a counterfeit of his divine authority, is not eaſy to ſay. But it has been obſerved, that no book has ever yet come forth, that has ſpoke with ſuch a ſublimity and height of ſovereignty, as the Bible doth.</p>
            <p>Further, there is an admirable ſimplicity mixed with the authority. This appears in the laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures, particularly, the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Every thing is delivered with an air of greatneſs, and yet with a plainneſs that cannot be enough admired. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods before me. Thou ſhalt not make unto thyſelf any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven image, &amp;c.. Thou ſhalt not take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame of the Lord thy God in vain, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt not kill. Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> and the like. I know ſome make this, which they call a lowneſs and flatneſs of ſtyle, an objection againſt the divinity of the Bible. But it is a cavil without all reaſon. There is really a grande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> in ſuch ſimplicity. Even human lawgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would think it a diminution to them to deliver
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028262_0161_0FD7F56E8F2DB248"/>their laws in the ſtrain of an orator, Speeches from the throne, the edicts of princes, and acts of parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, come forth in naked plain terms, and the greater their ſimplicity and plainneſs, the greater marks of authority they have in them. Perſons whoſe buſineſs it is to perſuade, addreſs to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of men, and make uſe of their art; but where the higheſt authority ſpeaks, and the will of the ſpeaker is a law, the more plainneſs there is in the ſtyle, the more authoritative it appears.</p>
            <p>There is the like ſimplicity in the narrations and hiſtory of Scripture. The writers delivered things without diſguiſe, relate facts, even the moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſurpriſing, and their ſeveral circumſtances, with freedom and boldneſs; like men that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their integrity, and depend upon the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and importance of the things they report, and the authority of him that ſent them. They make uſe of no artful apologies, nor ſtudied addreſſes, to poſſeſs their readers in their favor. When they command it is with a majeſtic plainneſs, as thoſe that ſpeak in the name of God, and when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late paſt things it is with the like ſimplicity, as thoſe that ſpeak in the name of truth, as I may ſay.</p>
            <p>Now this is ſo far from being the manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors and cheats, that it is not really the manner of common men. I do not think any men, left to the conduct of their own wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would have repreſented ſuch things, as the Bible contains, in the way the writers of it do; making their reports, and delivering their meſſages with a freedom and indifference of ſtyle, that may ſeem rather to favour of careleſſneſs, than any thing of affectation. And though I do not ſay, that theſe, and the like properties and characters of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtyle, are a full argument of its divinity; yet I cannot help thinking the ſtyle thereof has a great deal in it recommending; it is ſomething worthy
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028262_0162_0FD7F57124B1EFA8"/>of God, and what one might expect in a divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The harmony and agreement of the ſeveral parts of the Bible is another mark and character of the inſpiration of the writers thereof. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is an harmony in the greateſt point of all, I mean exact truth. Survey the Scriptures from the beginning to the end, examine the part every penman has born in this compoſure, and there is nothing to be found, but what can ſtand the teſt of the moſt ſevere and critical judgment. It may be affirmed of all the ſacred writings without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, what is affirmed of ſome part, <hi>theſe ſayings are faithful and true.</hi> Let us reflect a little on this matter. The Scripture conſiſts of three ſorts of ſubjects, doctrines, hiſtories, and prophecies. And in none of theſe can it be convicted of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. As to its doctrines, you have heard that it compriſes a very glorious and large ſyſtem, articles of faith, rules of practice, all were concerned to know, believe, and do; our whole duty towards God, our neighbor, and ourſelves. And in all this there is no flaw, no falſe doctrine. No caviller in the world is able to pronounce upon evidence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any principal, maxim, or rule laid down in the Bible, that it is corrupt and erroneous; what cannot bear the trial of ſound and impartial reaſon. As to the hiſtorical and prophetical part, it is of great extent, takes in a compaſs of ſome thouſand years; and yet here one may challenge all the adverſaries of the Scripture to produce a ſingle inſtance of miſtake, any facts miſrepreſented, or any predictions given forth, diſgraced by the event; which is a circumſtance that diſtinguiſhes it from all human compoſures, and gives it a ſort of triumph over all competitors. In the beſt writings of uninſpired men there are marks of frailty and infirmity, weakneſs of judgments, ſlips of memory,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028262_0163_0FD7F5712900FE78"/>inconcluſive arguments, miſtaken facts, and the like. But there is nothing of this in the Bible. All is without a blot, true and irreproveable.</p>
            <p>Further, this harmony is among all the writers of the Scriptures. They not only ſpeak truths, but many of them the very ſame particular truths. When they touch the ſame doctrine they give the ſame account of it, the ſame in the main, no one contradicting or interfering with another. They teach the ſame things concerning God, his nature, attributes, providence and government; give the ſame account of the creation, apoſtacy, general flood, and other facts of ancient date. The New Teſtament writers deliver the ſame things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, his incarnation, death, burial, reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſcenſion; his doctrine, miracles; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt, and the like. Not that they copy from one another, or expreſs the ſame parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thoughts upon every ſubject. But there is no repugnancy among them. They harmoniſe in every thing. One may enlarge upon and explain what another has ſaid, add to his account and carry it further; but he never contradicts him.</p>
            <p>Again, this harmony is among a great number of perſons, living in very diſtant places and ages of the world; ſo that they could not act by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy and combination. The prophets that follow Moſes, and who confirm his hiſtory, laws and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, had, many of them, never ſeen him. Chriſt and his apoſtles, that lived above a thouſand years after Moſes, all agree with him. In ſhort, they are all of a piece; their revelations, their doctrines and narrations, accord as much as if they had lived at the ſame time; had done every thing by concert and contrivance before one word was written. This will appear afterwards with more advantage when I ſpeak of the prophecies of the Bible, and their accompliſhment. I ſhall only at
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028262_0164_0FD7F57299D1C590"/>preſent mention one inſtance for the illuſtration of what I am upon. Moſes writes that the <hi>ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſerpent's head.</hi> This was a promiſe made to our firſt parents in paradiſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the apoſtacy, about four thouſand years before it came to paſs. This Moſes records, places in his hiſtory, lays his credit upon it, and leaves it to the examination of after ages. The ſucceeding prophets likewiſe, all with one voice bear teſtimony to the ſame thing, point out the ſame glorious event till it was actually accompliſhed. They reſume the ſubject and comment upon it, one after another, and in one age after another, ſtill enlightening it more and more, one adding this, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a different circumſtance; as of what family he ſhould come, of what perſon, namely, a virgin, where he ſhould be born, at what time, and the like; which I take to be an irreſiſtable evidence of their inſpiration, and that their <hi>prophecy came not of their own will,</hi> but that they <hi>ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> otherwiſe they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have agreed in an event ſo ſtrange and ſurpriſing as this. Had Moſes ſpoke of it on his own head, what could induce the other prophets to venture upon the ſame prediction, with more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and determining circumſtances. This would never have been the doctrine of one prophet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched and enlarged by others, and confirmed by all, had they not been guided by the ſame ſpirit, and proceeded under the conduct of God. In a word, all the parts of the Bible are in cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, and like the ſeveral parts of a regular building, give ſtrength and ſupport to one another. The Old Teſtament contains th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> New in types, ſhadows and predictions; and the New Teſtament is an accompliſhment of the Old. Hence the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle takes notice in his defence before Agrippa, that he had ſaid no other things than what Moſes and
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028262_0165_0FD7F5742D766998"/>the prophets had foretold ſhould come to paſs. <hi>Even all the prophets, that have been ſince the world began, ſpake of theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might ſubjoin, that this harmony appears the more beautiful and divine, as it is with ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial variety and difference. They preach the ſame doctrine, but not in the ſame manner, relate the ſame facts, but not with the like circumſtances; and often foretell the ſame events, but place them in a different light and cloath them with different circumſtances, which is ſo far from diſparaging their writings, that it really gives reputation to them, and is an argument of their ſincerity and inſpiration. Had they acted with a fraudulent deſign they would have been more cautious in this reſpect, and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all appearance of diſcord; had they contrived a deceit, they would have laid it cloſer together, and not have expoſed themſelves to any ſuſpicion of contradiction. Common writers think themſelves obliged for their credit-ſake to guard every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, are timorous and anxious, eſpecially if there be any deſign of falſhood an impoſture. But the ſacred writers conduct themſelves with a noble freedom of expreſſion, as being ſecure of the truth and juſtice of their cauſe, and that under all this variety, the ſame divine truth would appear and triumph upon examination.</p>
            <p>Well, as this is the caſe of the Bible; as there is ſuch a wonderful agreement and harmony among the writers of it; it muſt, I think, imply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their inſpiration. It is not to be conceived, that a weak and fallible underſtanding, as that of man is, ſhould go through ſuch a variety of matter, doctrines, hiſtories, prophecies, of exceeding great latitude and compaſs, and always be conſiſtent with itſelf. We do not find that two perſons can write on the ſame ſubject, eſpecially if it be copious and diffuſive, without claſhing; nor can one man write
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028262_0166_0FD7F57593C3A1A0"/>on a multitude of ſubjects, but he will forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſhow his weakneſs and infirmity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Scripture is clear of all imputation of this kind, I mean all juſt and well grounded imputation. As to the objection of contradictions therein, I may afterwards conſider it; at preſent I take it for granted there are none and thence argue, that they who wrote it were under the ſpecial and infallible influence of the Holy Ghoſt, who led them into all truth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I may offer to the ſame purpoſe, or as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of the inſpiration of Scripture, that effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, power and authority, it has on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earts and conſciences of men. Indeed this may be thought an effect of the Scripture, and accounted extrinſic; and conſequently, not here in its proper place. But it muſt be conſidered, that the efficacy I am arguing from, is owing to the internal conſtitution of the Bible, and to the divine ſpirit that breathes in it. Now take this in conjunction with the other arguments, and I look upon it a great confirmation of our faith, that it is the word of God. I ſhall beg leave to enlarge a little here. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I obſerve, that the Scripture is attended with a penetrating light; has a great deal of efficacy and power in this reſpect. It ſhines into the mind, and lays open the moſt ſecret, concealed treaſures of it; the good or evil treaſure of the heart. Thus the apoſtle ſpeaks of it, as many underſtand that text, <hi>the word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> God that made the heart, is perfectly well acquainted with all its workings, deſires and motions, <hi>he knows our thoughts afar off;</hi> he knows all that is in man, and has in his word, as
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028262_0167_0FD7F57BC93A84B0"/>in a map or glaſs, delineated and repreſented the various movements of his ſoul, what is formed in his heart, and lodges at any time there. Thus St. Paul, ſpeaking of prophecy, or the opening of the Scripture by virtue of that afflatus or gift of the ſpirit which ſome had at that time, tells us, that by the means thereof, <hi>the unlearned and unbeliever is convinced of all, and judged of all.</hi> It follows, <hi>and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alling down on his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi> The word of God often finds the ſinner out, and when it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played before him, God co-operating therewith by his ſpirit, there is a diſcovery made of the heart and conſcience, and of the thoughts and purpoſes lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, that often aſtoniſhes and amazes. What the king of Syria's ſervant told his maſter, <hi>viz.</hi> that the prophet Eliſha made known to the king of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael even the <hi>words that he ſpake in his bed-chamber,</hi> may be ſaid of the Scripture, it makes known to men the language ſpoken in the ſecret chambers of their hearts; their moſt retired thoughts and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It diſcloſes the hidden things of diſhoneſty, anatomiſes and diſſects the conſcience, brings into open and full light, what the ſinner before was not aware of. This thouſands can witneſs that have been ſeriouſly converſant with the holy Scriptures, and eſpecially ſuch that have ſat under a lively ſearching miniſtry. They find their ſins, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, ſet in a clear light, find themſelves ſtruck at, and deſcribed in the word of God with great exactneſs, as if the writer or preacher had known their hearts, and been ſome way privy to what paſſes there. The reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which is, that the Scripture, proceeding from God, the author of the human mind, that is acquainted with its moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſprings, and inmoſt receſſes, is able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into it, and lay all open.</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="unknown:028262_0168_0FD7F57BCB729678"/>
            <p>I might obſerve that the light thereof equally reaches the hearts and caſes of good men. It ſhews them what they are, what they want, what they ſuffer; deſcribes their graces, their conflicts, and fears. In ſhort, it is a glaſs in which both good and bad may view themſelves, and ſee what manner of perſons they are. Now had it been a mere human writing, a contrivance of men, though of never ſuch great and wiſe men, it could not I think have had this property in it. It would not have been a ſearcher of hearts, as it every where pretends to be, and we find it to be, had it not proceeded from him that framed the heart and knows it perfectly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture has a wonderful power and efficacy to convince and awaken conſcience. A great deal might be ſaid here, agreeable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of thouſands and myriads among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The world hath had a real and ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of this property thereof for many gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. It has been gloriouſly inſtrumental to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the fig leaves, and detect the deluſion of blinded ſinners, and to demoliſh thoſe refuges of lies wherein they truſted. How many mountains hath it thrown down? how many ſons of pride hath it abaſed? how many obdurate and hard hearts hath it broken? many a ſoul hath the Scripture covered with the ſhadow of death, even of thoſe who thought themſelves full of light, and while they have exalted themſelves to heaven, it hath brought them down even to hell. Thus the Scripture hath often been to the ſecure ſinner, as the hand writing on the wall to Belſhazzar, <hi>it hath made his countenance change, and his thoughts trouble him, the joints of his loins to be looſed, and his knees to ſmite one againſt another.</hi> Something of this it is ſuppoſed the apoſtle intimates, when he ſays, <hi>I was alive without the law, but when the commandment came, ſin revived, and I died. Then the commandment which was ordained to
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:028262_0169_0FD7F57D6568F338"/>life, I found to be unto death;</hi> that is, when the law was ſent home to my conſcience in its ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, purity and authority. When God carried it to my heart, and removed the ignorance, prejudice, and blindneſs which kept the law from reaching me; when it was thus I died, I was filled with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and horror at the view of myſelf upon this diſcovery the law made of my heart, ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and I became as a dead man. Now this the Scripture has done in innumerable inſtances, with a ſtrange ſovereignty and authority, ranſacking the hearts of men, caſting them down from their high towers, and laying their pride in the duſt. And is there nothing of God in this? is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly his finger? can any human writings pretend to ſuch a force? muſt not a word armed with ſo much power be the word of God? It is obſervable the Hebrews call thunder the voice of God, <hi>the voice of the Lord is powerful, the voice of the Lord is full of majeſty, the voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lobanon.</hi> And the reaſon why it is termed his voice ſeems to be, becauſe of the majeſty and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that ſometimes attends it. <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God,</hi> ſaith he himſelf to Job, <hi>or canſt thou thunder with a voice like him.</hi> Now certainly to thunder in the minds and conſciences of men, and to make ſuch terrible commotions and concuſſions there, as the Scripture doth, cannot but argue ſomething of divinity, and import that it is the voice of God.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, men may have terror from other cauſes, and without the miniſtry of the Scripture, I grant it; God can ſtrike the conſcience of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinner immediately, or by what means he pleaſes. But I believe I may juſtly obſerve, that trouble of mind, of a ſpiritual nature, and about another world and the concerns of it, is ſeldom the exerciſe of any but ſuch as are converſant with the Bible: and it is moſtly the exerciſe of thoſe
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028262_0170_0FD7F58A1E15A900"/>that have the word of God brought cloſeſt to them under a lively miniſtry. Whilſt Peter preached, his hearers were <hi>pricked in their hearts, and cried out, men and brethren what ſhall we do.</hi> It is the Scripture read or preached, laid open and applied, that gives the compunction and makes ſinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive what they muſt do to be ſaved. Such as live in ignorance of the Bible, and enjoy no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preaching, ſeldom know any thing of this: No, their <hi>goods are in peace, they are alive without the law;</hi> but when he <hi>that commands light to ſhine out of darkneſs, ſhines into</hi> their <hi>hearts:</hi> when the word of God which is <hi>quick and powerful</hi> pierces the conſcience, former deluſions vaniſh. former ſtrong holds are broken down; and there is an inward awakening, and inward light, and often a terror that may be called divine. And as this is a known pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Scripture, what it claims, and what the church of God has all along more or leſs found in it, it is an argument of its inſpiration. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſhews a mighty efficacy in quickening and comforting good men. Read the hundred and nineteenth Pſalm, and you will ſee how much of this David experienced in the Scriptures that were extant in his time. Hereby God quickened him, and hereby God ſupported him, as he abundantly declares, particularly, <hi>ver.</hi> 92. <hi>Unleſs thy law had been my delight, I ſhould then have periſhed in mine affliction.</hi> And thouſands can ſay the ſame thing. They have felt theſe powers of the world to come, have found a divine power breaking out of the Scripture in the ſerious peruſal, or in the faithful miniſtry of it, like lightning out of a cloud, by which their hearts have been revived and raiſed, as it were, from the dead. Sometimes they have been ſtrangely eaſed in their minds; freed from their darkneſs, burthens and fears: at another time gloriouſly ſtrengthened in the inward man:
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028262_0171_0FD7F58C133F5E40"/>ſometimes, when they have been in ſackcloth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darkneſs and terror, the Scripture has cheared their drooping ſpirits, girded them with gladneſs, and filled them with joy in believing. If this be fact, and I am perſuaded ſome of you can riſe up and give teſtimony to it, if the Scripture has been of this efficacy to you; if you have found it to be a word of power, of life, peace and conſolation; you will not eaſily doubt whether it be the word of God or not. When John the Baptiſt ſent ſome to Chriſt with this queſtion; <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Go, and ſhew John the things you hear and ſee, the blind receive their ſight, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor have the goſpel preached to them.</hi> Intimating that ſuch things as theſe were a ſufficient atteſtation to him, that he was the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="7 letters">

               </gap>. The things were too glorious, and of too gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> reputation, to attend an impoſtor. So if the queſtion be, whether the Scripture be the word of God, it might be a ſufficient anſwer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, if we are able to ſay, that by them the ſouls of men are enlightened, comforted, the dead ſpirits of men are raiſed up, and made to live again, that many who were in chains and fetters are ſet free by them, and by them the world filled with joy and gladneſs. A tree that bears ſuch fruit muſt have been planted by God's right hand. I will only add,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That this efficacy is ſtill the ſame. The Scripture has the ſame quickening, reviving, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting power that ever it had. The church has lived upon it ſome thouſand years; and it has the ſame light, life, and conſolation in it that it had at firſt. What the ſtatutes of the Lord were to David, ſo long ago, they are ſtill to all the faithful; <hi>a lamp to their feet, and a light to their paths,</hi> their rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and their heritage forever. Nay, the more we know of the Bible, the more we meditate in the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028262_0172_0FD7F58D97E54770"/>law of God, the more we ſhall delight in it, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſtill new and rich mines; being like its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor an inexhauſted ſtore-houſe of all ſupplies.</p>
            <p>Well, theſe are the internal marks and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Scripture's divinity. How far they may be depended upon, and what argument they afford for the eſtabliſhing this doctrine, I deſigned at this time to have enquired; but that would lead me farther than your patience and attention may be prepared to follow; and therefore I ſhall defer it to another opportunity.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it is eaſy to obſerve, that good men have a mighty advantage above others for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and believing divine revelation. They can diſcern its innate excellencies and beauties. They have <hi>the witneſs in themſelves,</hi> an inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the glories of the Scripture; they have felt its power, taſted its ſweetneſs, and therefore can ſay a thouſand things on its behalf that others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and conſequently will not be ſtaggered with every little ſophiſtical cavil; but when attacked by gainſayers, will be ready to reply, as the man born blind did to thoſe that were wrangling with him concerning Chriſt, <hi>It is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is; and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</hi> Endeavor that you may find the power and efficacy of the Scripture on your hearts, and it will very much aſſiſt your faith, and confirm you in it, you will never queſtion whence it is, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of God, ſince it hath opened your eyes. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts,</hi> ſays David, <hi>for with them thou haſt quickened me.</hi> The more we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the power and uſefulneſs of the word of God, the more we ſhall value and love it, and the more ſteadily we ſhall adhere to it: we ſhall not forget it, nor be drawn off from our regard to it, becauſe thereby God hath quickened us, thereby he hath comforted us, reſtored and eſtabliſhed us,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028262_0173_0FD7F590467486E0"/>and many ways ſaved us. And if this be the caſe, if the word of God has got this hold of us, of our hearts and affections; and recommends itſelf to our experience, we ſhall not be moved with every flirt of wit and little jeſt that the author may think briſk and lively. God's teſtimony to the Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in his works and providence, has a glorious evidence in it, as you will afterwards hear. But his teſtimony within comes nearer and cloſer to the conſcience, and is of mighty uſe to thoſe that have it. Endeavor for this, and for more of it; and if you do the will of Chriſt, and feel the authority of the Scripture in your hearts, you ſhall know of his doctrine, whether it be of God.</p>

            <p>IN my laſt diſcourſe on theſe words, I laid before you the internal marks and characters of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration of the holy Scriptures. Some call them, the ſelf-evidencing light thereof, and lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon them, that they not only think all other arguments inſufficient without this, but that this is ſufficient without them, and excluſive of them all. There are, they think, thoſe characters and impreſſions of divinity upon the Scriptures that it manifeſts itſelf by its own light, to be from God. <q>The authority of God, the ſupreme Lord of all, ſaith a learned divine<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s ſelf-evidencing light of the Scripture.</note> ſpeaking in and by the penmen of Scripture, evidenced ſingly in, and by Scripture itſelf, is the ſole bottom and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or formal reaſon of our aſſenting to theſe Scriptures as his word, and ſubmitting our hearts and conſciences to them. He adds, God's voice to the penmen of Scripture was accompanied with its own evidence, which gave aſſurance to
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028262_0175_0FD7F592D41CC9D8"/>them; and God ſpeaking by them, or their writing to us; his word is accompanied with its own evidence, and gives aſſurance to us, his authority and veracity did, and do, in the one and the other ſufficiently manifeſt themſelves. And again, as God in the creation of the world, and all things, hath ſo made and framed them, hath left ſuch characters of his eternal power and wiſdom on them, filled with ſuch evidence of their author, that without any other teſtimony from himſelf or any elſe, under the naked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what they are, they declare their Creator. So in the giving out his word, he hath by his ſpirit implanted in it, and impreſſed on it ſuch characters of his goodneſs, power, wiſdom and holineſs, of his love to mankind, truth and faithfulneſs, with all the reſt of his glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and perfections, that at all times, and in all places, where the expanſion of Scripture is ſtretched out over men by his providence; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other witneſs or teſtimony given there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it declareth itſelf to be his, and makes good its authority from him. So that the refuſal of it upon its own evidence, brings unavoidable condemnation on the ſouls of men. This is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teſtimony, accompanying the true voice of God, evidencing itſelf, and aſcertaining the ſoul beyond all poſſibility of miſtake. Wherever the Scripture is truly received, as the word of God, it is received upon the evidence of that light it hath in itſelf; it is all one by what means, by what hands, whether of a child, or of a church, by tradition, accident, or ſpecial providence, the Scripture comes to us; come how it will it hath its authority in itſelf by being the word of God, and hath its power of manifeſting itſelf ſo to be from its own innate light.</q> A great deal more in the like ſtrain occurs in the ſame learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028262_0176_0FD7F598931813A8"/>He particularly hints wherein the power and authority of the Scripture conſiſts, by which it proves itſelf to be divine. As its diving into the hearts, conſciences, and ſecret receſſes of the minds of men; its judging and ſentencing them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; its convictions, terrors, conqueſts, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of men; its converting, building, making wiſe, holy and obedient; its adminiſtring conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in every condition, and the like. Theſe he accounts ſuch an impreſs of God on the Scripture, that they may be looked upon as ſo many infallible ſigns, diſtinguiſhing it from the product of any creature. To the ſame purpoſe another ingenious writer, <q>the Scripture, ſays he<note n="*" place="bottom">Polhill's Precious Faith, p. 35.</note>, appears in divine and heavenly characters, and by theſe it bears witneſs to itſelf that it is the word of God.</q> So Calvin putting the queſtion how we ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it comes from God? anſwers, it is the ſame thing as to aſk, how we can diſtinguiſh light from darkneſs. And adds, another author of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name, I mean biſhop Leighton,<note n="†" place="bottom">Sermons, p. 85.</note> 
               <q>They are little verſed in the holy Scripture that know not that it is frequently called light, and they are ſenſeleſs that know not that light is ſeen and known by itſelf. <hi>If our goſpel be hid,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>it is hid to them that periſh;</hi> the God of the world having blinded their minds againſt the <hi>light of the glorious goſpel.</hi> No wonder if ſuch ſtand in need of a teſtimony. A blind man knows not that it is light at noon day, but by report; but to thoſe that have eyes, light is ſeen by itſelf.</q> I mention theſe paſſages more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that I may give you the argument they lay ſo great weight upon in its full ſtrength, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in their own words. Theſe learned men
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028262_0177_0FD7F59B2A2F60A0"/>you ſee ſuppoſe the Scripture to bring with it its own proof; and its internal characters, that impreſs it has upon it of the majeſty and authority, purity, wiſdom and holineſs of God, they ſuppoſe a ſort of a divine light, and requires only open eyes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it. Now before I diſmiſs this argument I ſhall make a few remarks upon it; in which I mean not to ſet aſide or weaken it, but guard it. No doubt there is a great deal in the doctrine of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to recommend it to us, as a revelation from God. It has internal characters, that ſhew its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and imply divinity. But whether the notion of ſelf-evidencing light, as you have heard it ſtated, be not carried too far may be queſtioned. I ſhall briefly propoſe my thoughts concerning it in the following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt not be aſſerted, that the Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to all men with this ſelf-evidencing light. They, that inſiſt moſt upon it, grant that the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial illumination of the ſpirit is neceſſary to our diſcerning the evidence. The eyes of our minds muſt be opened or we ſhall not ſee this light, how clear and ſtrong ſoever. So that the argument from hence is rather for the confirmation of good men, than the conviction of all. Though the ſun ſhines with the utmoſt brightneſs, it cannot enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thoſe that want eyes. And the caſe is allowed to be the ſame, with reference to the Scripture's internal light and evidence. Conſequently, this argument cannot be of general uſe. And yet I queſtion not the Scripture may be proved, not only to be true, but to be inſpired even to the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of carnal men, that have only uſe of their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faculties, without ſpecial grace and illumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Not that they can receive it, or indeed any other point or particular doctrine of religion with a divine faith; but it may be demonſtrated by ſtrong arguments, the force of which they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028262_0178_0FD7F59D561C1478"/>even before they receive the ſpirit of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. How far they may diſcern the internal marks of its divinity, I cannot digreſs to enquire. No doubt they may diſcover much of the beauty and excellency of the Scripture, and own it. It would be preſumptuous, I am afraid, to affirm, that all who have wrote with great learning in defence of the Bible, and particularly have with great ſkill diſplayed the internal excellency of its doctrine were ſanctified and good men. However, whether this be granted, or not, as the ſelf-evidencing light, in the judgment of thoſe authors I have mentioned, ſhines only to them that have the illumination of the ſpirit, and no queſtion it ſhines moſt eminently to them, it muſt not be looked upon as an argument proper to convince every one. Whatever light there is in the Scripture, or how much ſoever it partakes of the nature of light, it cannot enlighten them that have not eyes, or want the faculty of diſcerning. And yet even theſe are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Scripture, and are capable of apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient reaſon and evidence upon which they ought to believe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When it is ſaid the Scripture is ſelf-evident, it muſt not be underſtood, that the evidence is as eaſy and obvious as in the caſe of thoſe propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we call ſelf evident; as that two and three make five, or that the whole is greater than a part. Even good men, notwithſtanding their illumination from above, need a great deal of reaſoning, and conſideration, and the help of much and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience before they can ſatisfactorily diſcern the internal light of the Scripture; ſo diſcern it as to make it an argument of the divinity thereof. We muſt not therefore apply the metaphor of light, to which the Scripture is compared, too ſtrictly; as if every ſpiritual and good man, that opens the Bible, might ſee characters of divine inſpiration there, as
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028262_0179_0FD7F5A016CDEFB8"/>plainly as he can ſee when the ſun ſhines. Thoſe expreſſions, that import any thing of this kind, I cannot think ſufficiently guarded.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I apprehend this ſelf-evidencing light doth not run through the whole Bible, and appear in every part alike. And I know not but I might ſay it doth not ſufficiently appear at all in ſome parts of it. If the light and evidence be placed in the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture, that it is from God, this cannot be admitted as evidence enough that it is ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other books not inſpired, as the Alcoran for inſtance, aſſert the ſame. And beſides there are ſome parts of Scripture that do not aſſert this. If the impreſs of God thereon be made the ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing light, I am afraid it will be difficult to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this in every book and chapter of the Bible, as in the Kings and Chronicles; and it will be no leſs difficult for any one, by this impreſs appearing in the book itſelf, to pronounce that the Proverbs is the word of God, and not the book of wiſdom, that Eccleſiaſtes is divinely inſpired, and not Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus. I ſubjoin,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That this internal evidence of the inſpiration of Scripture reſults from the conſtitution and frame of the Bible in general; from the doctrines and hiſtory of it, the excellency of its matter and ſtyle. Take the Bible together, conſider it in its whole plan and deſign; and it has glorious characters of divinity upon it. Its doctrines, laws and hiſtories, have ſomething ſo great, ſo pure and ſpiritual in them; it has ſuch marks of wiſdom and goodneſs; it is ſo wonderfully ſuited to the neceſſities and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſinful men, and ſo well fitted every way to ſubſerve the profeſſed end of ſuch a revelation, that one may conclude it to be a revelation from God, and above human contrivance. And this will appear with greater force and conviction to thoſe that have lived under the impreſſion of it, and
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028262_0180_0FD7F5A0442C5FE8"/>have long experienced its power, and taſted its comforts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Though this be a good confirming argument of the divinity of the Bible, we ought not, I think to lay the main ſtreſs here, much leſs to make it the only argument. We find our Lord appeals to other evidence, namely, that of his miraculous works; <hi>I have greater witneſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>than that of John; for the works, which my father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works that I do, bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> And again, <hi>the works I do in my Father's name, they bear witneſs of me.</hi> And, <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not: but if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works.</hi> You ſee he doth not demand their aſſent and faith upon his own teſtimony, or the teſtimony of John, but produces his works as his credentials. The Scripture is a doctrine worthy of God, and appears in its own innate light and excellency worthy of our acceptation. But, as God has been pleaſed to recommend it by many other arguments beſides his own image and impreſs thereupon, theſe ought not to be neglected. Chriſt brings in his works among the evidences of his divine miſſion: and certainly whatever tends to prove, that God ſent the writers of the <hi>Bible,</hi> ſhould be admitted on their behalf, and as a plea for their inſpiration. Nor can I think it any ſervice to the cauſe, to lay all the weight upon a ſingle argument, rejecting others that may have equal, if not ſuperior force. Once more,</p>
            <p n="6">6. It muſt however be allowed, that the internal excellency, or what ſome call it, ſelf evidencing light, is at leaſt a ſtrong motive of its credibility. I do not ſay, it is no more, for I think the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Revelation, conſidered in the whole of it, is too ſublime and divine, has too many characters of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, holineſs, &amp;c. to own any author, but God. So that it is more than a motive of credibility.
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028262_0181_0FD7F5A232F1F248"/>In the mean time, it is that in a very high degree. Indeed no external arguments of the divinity of the Bible could conclude and determine any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature's belief of it, as from God, was it not a revelation every way worthy of him. It is a pertinent paſſage to our purpoſe of the great Chillingworth <q>I profeſs, ſays he, if the doctrine of Scripture did not appear as good, and as fit to come from God, the fountain of goodneſs, as the miracles by which it was confirmed were great, I ſhould want one main pillar of my faith, and for want of it, I fear, I ſhould be much ſtaggered.</q> In ſhort, there is nothing a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian can reſt in with more ſatisfaction, touching the divine inſpiration of the Bible, than this, that he finds it ſpeaks to him in a way becoming God, commands with an authority becoming God, ſearches the heart and conſcience with light and force becoming God, directs with a wiſdom and knowledge God-like, ſupports, quickens, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in a manner that plainly ſhews a divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence attends it.</p>
            <p>But thus much for the third general argument, the internal characters of the Scripture's divinity; which I have ſtayed the longer upon, becauſe I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended ſome difficulty in it; whether I have cleared it or not, I ſhall not fay. I have however offered what occurred, at preſent, moſt proper for that purpoſe. I proceed now to another argument.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The divine inſpiration of the Scripture may be argued from ſome external marks and characters, ſome outward circumſtances, and from the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God eminently intereſting itſelf in behalf thereof: as the antiquity of it, the preſervation of it through ſo many ages, its ſurpriſing accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the parts of it, and the like.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The antiquity of it. I am far from thinking this, one of the beſt of our arguments. But as it
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028262_0182_0FD7F5AE4E553850"/>is generally produced in favor of this cauſe, I do not think fit wholly to neglect it; though I ſhall but touch it briefly. It is agreed, I think however I am ſatisfied nothing tolerable can be offered againſt it, that the Scriptures, I mean part of them, are the moſt ancient writings of any in the world. Juſtin Martyr, a learned father, who lived in the ſecond century, within about one hundred and thirty years after Chriſt, as ſome compute, in his exhortation to the Greeks, proves by comparing the times of all human writers, poets, philoſophers, hiſtorians, and lawgivers, the moſt celebrated for their antiquity, that the laws of Moſes and his writings were long before any of them. And at the ſame time ſhews, that whatever is excellent in any of them, as Orpheus, Homer, Solon, Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, or Plato, they derived from Moſes, lighting their candles at his lamp. Euſebius, another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive writer, evidences at large the ſuperior an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of Moſes, and concludes, that Moſes is found to be more ancient, even than all the gods and heroes of the Greeks. To the ſame purpoſe Tertullian and others. And indeed, there are none of the heathen authors that can vie with Moſes in this reſpect. He begins his hiſtory and account of things, from the creation, and continues it through the firſt two thouſand years of the world, and more. And though we have no written re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the affairs of the patriarchs before the time that Moſes wrote, yet it is certain his book is of earlier date than any other. His Pentateuch was extant before Thales, Hermes, Sanchoniatho, Homer, or any of the famous pagan antiquaries were heard of, indeed before they had a being; which Tertullian<note n="*" place="bottom">The whole paſſage of Tertullian being ſo very remarkable and full to the purpoſe it cannot be amiſs to inſert it here; <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of your public monuments and Inſcriptions, ſays he, before any of your forms of government, before the oldeſt of your books, the original of many nations, the foundation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny famous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ces, were the writings of one of our prophets extant, which are the treafury of the Jewiſh religion, and by conſequence of the Chriſtian. If you have heard of Moſes the prophet, I will tell you his age, he was co-temporary with Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus the firſt king of the Argives, older by three hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three years than Danaus the oldeſt in your hiſtories. About a thouſand years before the deſtruction of Troy, or, as others reckon, about five hundred years before Homer; the reſt of the prophets, though later than Moſes, yet the lateſt of them fall in with ſome of your Sages, lawgivers and hiſtorians.</q>— Nor did he ſay ſo without reaſon, ſince Iſaiah, Hoſea, and other of the prophets lived at the time when the Greeks firſt began their Olympiads, before Rome was built; and the very lateſt of the Old Teſtament writers flouriſhed before Socrates. To which I may add, that as the other two fathers here mentioned, Juſtin Martyr and Euſebius, to ſay nothing of Clemens Alexandrinus, Cyril, St. Auſtin, &amp;c. who urge the ſame argument, inſiſt more at large upon the ſubject, ſo they fully prove Moſes of much greater an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity than the moſt ancient pagan authors. And indeed, this is univerſally owned not only by Jews and Chriſtians, but alſo by heathens themſelves. Even Porphyry, one of the moſt learned and ſhrewd adverſaries chriſtianity ever had, was forced to allow him older than his favorite Sanchoniatho, whom yet he places before the Trojan war.</note> enlarges upon, and thereby
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028262_0183_0FD7F5AF8D11B7E8"/>triumphs over the gentiles; ſhewing them their religion was but a novel upſtart thing compared with that of the chriſtians. Moſes, he tells them, lived ſome hundred of years before the ruins of Troy; that all the reſt of the prophets ſucceeded Moſes, and yet ſome of the laſt of them were of the ſame age with their firſt wife men, lawgivers, and hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>If it be aſked, what evidence doth this afford of the divinity, or inſpiration of the Bible? I anſwer, as mankind needed a revelation from God, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon his apoſtacy, and had reaſon to hope
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028262_0184_0FD7F5B0E7B21818"/>for ſuch a favor, from the divine mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and as the Bible is the moſt ancient revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beginning with man's neceſſities, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a ſuitable remedy for them, it is moſt likely to be from God. Not to ſay, that antiquity has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways claimed a ſort of veneration, men agree by common conſent, to riſe up before the hoary head thereof. Hence Tertullian pleads with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that as it was matter of religion and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to give credit to things according to their age and antiquity; therefore the Chriſtian religion, having marks of the higheſt antiquity, deſerved their greateſt honor, and they ought accordingly to reverence it. But what I think of the greateſt weight here, is, that the Bible being the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent book in the world, has gone through a courſe of the longeſt examinations. It has, ſome of it, bore the teſt of many thouſand years, and has ſtood its ground, after the ſevereſt and moſt critical trial.</p>
            <p>Now had it been falſe, it is not to be imagined it would have eſcaped without diſcovery. After it has undergone the ſcrutiny of ſo many ages, of ſo many thouſands and millions of perſons, both of friends and enemies, from one generation to another, one cannot reaſonably ſuſpect it; nor can we think it conſiſtent with the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, his love of truth and hatred of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and his regard to mankind, to ſuffer a cheat to reign and triumph ſo long in full glory and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. No, had it been a cunningly deviſed fable, he would ſurely have interpoſed in his providence and have defeated it. As time is a conſumer of things, ſo it is a touchſtone to diſcover what they are. A cheat may paſs for a while, but it was never known that a cheat, ſuch a one as the Bible muſt be, if it be a cheat, ever paſſed long without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. So that it is really a probable argument, and I carry it no farther, whatever others have
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028262_0185_0FD7F5B266064890"/>done, that as the Bible is the moſt ancient book, it is a divine book.</p>
            <p>If any object, this only ſpeaks for the writings of Moſes. I anſwer, it is granted. But then it muſt be conſidered that Moſes' books contain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the reſt. The apoſtle tells us, the goſpel was preached to Abraham. It had an edition then. We find in the Pentateuch the lineaments, and a more imperfect draught of the whole Bible. And beſides, it has been ſhewn before, that the ſeveral parts of the Scriptures give teſtimony to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that what confirms and proves one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, derives a ſort of an Authority to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll the reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The preſervation of the Bible through ſo many ages is another circumſtance, that may be urged to prove the ſame thing. If it had not been of God, we cannot think he would have concerned himſelf ſo much about it, and employed his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for its ſecurity all along, as we are aſſured he has done. That we have the ſeveral inſpired books brought down to us ſafe and entire, in the main, I ſhall hereafter ſhew. At preſent, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this to be fact, and may, I think, ground an argument upon it in favor of the Bible.</p>
            <p>Several things might be offered to illuſtrate this; as, that it is the moſt ancient book, and ſo has had the more time to decay and periſh in. It has gone through a longer ſtate of trial, as I may ſay, and has ſtood expoſed to all caſualties and hazards for more ages than any book beſides.</p>
            <p>Farther, the ſubject of it would create it more enemies. Some books ſo little concern mankind, they treat about ſuch mere amuſements, matters of no importance, or at beſt little ſpeculations; that they are not like to raiſe the enmity of the world againſt them. Indeed mens careleſneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things that deſerve no care, may ſuffer them to periſh; but their ſuppoſed intereſts, or real en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028262_0186_0FD7F5B45B5BC8C0"/>will never riſe up againſt them to deſtroy them. Whereas the <hi>Bible</hi> is of a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. It treats of higher important things, to which the paſſions and corruptions of men ſtand in a direct oppoſition. It is a ſtanding record for God, and againſt Satan and his kingdom; a conſtant curb and check to vicious men in their purſuits, and ſometimes a terror to them. And conſequently, ſuch a book would have many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that would be glad to get rid of it; to ruin its reputation, and deſtroy its very being, if they could.</p>
            <p>I add, this has actually been the caſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cripture. Not only bad men have always hated it, but ſome of its enemies have appeared againſt it with a power equal to their malice. The attempts of <hi>Antiochus Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phanes</hi> under the Old Teſtament, and of Diocleſian under the New, to this purpoſe, are known. The former, when he had ſacked Jeruſalem, profaned their temple, and made the daily ſacrifice to ceaſe, as Daniel propheſied of him; made diligent ſearch for the law; burnt all the copies of it he could find, and threatened the ſevereſt torments to thoſe who ſhould conceal it. And the very ſame thing did Diocleſian, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, or rather infamous, for his rage againſt chriſtians, and who triumphed in his ſuppoſed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. After the moſt barbarous havoc of them, he put forth an edict commanding the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to bring in their <hi>Bibles</hi> to be burnt and deſtroyed: which multitudes out of fear complied with, and thence had the reproachful name of Traditores, thoſe that delivered up their <hi>Bibles,</hi> and in caſe of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, he threatened all ſorts of tortures and death. Well, notwithſtanding theſe and all other aſſaults, notwithſtanding the enmity and malice of wicked men and devils againſt the Scripture, it has been preſerved pure and uncorrupt, in the main, to this
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028262_0187_0FD7F5B60970F248"/>day. We have the ſame law God delivered to Moſes on mount Sinai, the ſame ſtatutes and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he gave to Iſrael, we have the true hiſtory left by the immediate followers of the Lord Jeſus, and thoſe ſacred books that contain the genuine records of their doctrine. Theſe God has preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, and lodged in our hands, by a care and ſovereignty of providence, that one need not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to call divine. They have been often in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note n="*" place="bottom">The greateſt danger they were ever in of being loſt, was in the days of king Joſiah, if thoſe learned men are in the right who think there was only one copy of the law of Moſes then left, which Hilkiah the prieſt caſually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>d in the temple, 2 Kings xxii. 8. But there are others to when it ſeems much more probable, that the book there ſpoken of, was either the Autograph of Moſes, that authentic copy that was expreſsly ordered to be laid up and kept by the ſide of the ark in the moſt holy place, Deut. xxxi. 26. or elſe ſome other ſacred copy uſed in the ſervice of the temple and preſerved there, like as was afterwards done in the ſecond temple, where we are told that copy was kept, which Titus carried in triumph to Rome. Joſeph. de Bell. Judaic. L. vii. cap 24.</note> and ſometimes almoſt bundled up and brought to the funeral pile. The implacable and avowed enemies of religion, who at once had all human power and terror in their hands, have decreed their extirpation, and accordingly ſet themſelves to accompliſh it. But God has defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their deſigns; ſtill the Bible exiſts and is triumphant, and, I doubt not, will as long as there is a church in the world, that is, till the end of time, and conſummation of all things.</p>
            <p>Now hence, I think, one might form an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that amounts to a demonſtration of a moral kind. God's providence in preſerving the Bible is a public ſignification that he owns it. Such have been its hazards, that it could never have been preſerved, had not God undertaken its defence. And ſuch is the juſtice, truth, holineſs, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that he would never have eſpouſed
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028262_0188_0FD7F5B6DB7F5A38"/>it in the manner he has done, had it been a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and not from himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another particular, under the general head of external marks and characters of the divinity of Scripture, is the wonderful accompliſhment of it in all the circumſtances thereof. I ſay, in all the circumſtances of it; which I queſtion not is true, though we may not be able fully to make this out. We may want capacities ſometimes to underſtand the text, and often to expound the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that is an exact accompliſhment of it; and ſo cannot diſcern the harmony between the one and the other: which yet is real and certain, and reaches even to very minute and little things, had we penetration enough to diſcover it. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, notwithſtanding our defects here, ſo much is evident to a diligent obſerver, as is ſufficient to give this argument its due force. The Bible has been fulfilled in all ages, from the beginning of the world to this day. It has been ſo in many inſtances as muſt appear to the ſatisfaction of all, that will allow themſelves ſeriouſly to conſider theſe matters, and we have reaſon to conclude, it is ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally.</p>
            <p>I ſhall a little expatiate on this head; and let you ſee wherein the Scripture is fulfilled, and then make a few remarks, ſhewing you how the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof proves its divinity. Now the Scripture has been fulfilled,
<list>
                  <item>1. In the natural and material world. And,</item>
                  <item>2. In the moral world or world of mankind.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It has been fulfilled in the natural or material world. The account the Bible gives us of the heavens and the earth, ſo far as they fall under our obſervation, has been anſwered in providence through all generations hitherto. I ſhall mention a few particulars out of many.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We find, according to Scripture, the ground
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028262_0189_0FD7F5BAA4629B10"/>laid under a curſe upon man's apoſtacy, <hi>And unto Adam he ſaid, becauſe thou haſt harkened unto the voice of thy wiſe, and haſt eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, ſaying, thou ſhalt not eat of it: curſed is the ground for thy ſake; in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns alſo and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth unto thee: in the ſweat of thy face ſhall thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground.</hi> This the Scripture tells us ſhould be the future ſtate of the earth, and we have the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſeveral thouſand years atteſting the truth of it. Had not mankind ſinned, we may juſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the earth would have been more fertile, and would have yielded the conveniencies of life with leſs labour and pains. But as a puniſhment of his tranſgreſſion it was doomed to a ſort of ſterility, or barrenneſs. Thorns and thiſtles are its ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous production. It brings forth theſe of its own accord. But if man will enjoy its more uſeful fruits, it muſt be with greater expence than was neceſſary heretofore. He muſt labor in cultivating it, and eat thereof in the ſweat of his face. Thus the Bible intimates it ſhould be, that the earth would undergo a change for the worſe in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; being curſed for man's ſake. And thus all have found it through every age ſince.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When mankind had lived upon the earth for fifteen or ſixteen hundred years, and their ſins had provoked the wrath and vengeance of heaven againſt them, the Scripture foretells the amazing judgment of an univerſal deluge, or flood, which God would bring upon them for their wickedneſs. The denunciation of this judgment you have, Gen, vi. 5, 6, 7, 13, 17. That it was fulfilled, and how, you read in the next chapter. I will only obſerve, that the fact that there was a general deluge, at the time aſſigned by Moſes, is not only affirmed in the Bible, and referred to over and over again there,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028262_0190_0FD7F5BB511CDFE8"/>both in the Old and New Teſtament, but we have the concurrence of the moſt ancient heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the ſame truth. One of them, of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, tells us, that Oſiris, or Noah, went into the ark on the ſeventeenth day of the Egyptian month Athyr, when the ſun paſſes the ſign Scorpio, which is the very ſame day mentioned by Moſes, the ſeventeenth day of the ſecond month, as ſome have ſhewn from aſtronomical calculations. Nor have we only full teſtimony for the fact; but a kind of demonſtration of it from the numerous ſhells of fiſhes, from plants, trees, and other remains of the antideluvian world; which are to this day found buried in the bowels of the earth; and, I do not think, can be ſo rationally accounted for, as upon the ſuppoſition of a general deluge.</p>
            <p>Now if it be conſidered, that this was threatened above a hundred years before it came to paſs, when there were no tokens and intimations of it in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: that Noah, that preacher of righteouſneſs, was employed to give warning of it all that while, and that the judgment was executed in the very manner, and at the very time foretold; we may, I think, place this among thoſe remarkable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that confirm the truth and divinity of the Scripture. None but the great Author of nature could bring about ſuch an event, and none but he could predict and inſure it. He alone could do the thing, and he only could foretell it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. After this dreadful and amazing judgment had taken place, God was pleaſed to give a ſolemn aſſurance to mankind, that he would not again deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy them in ſuch a manner, and inflict the like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of an univerſal deluge; and as a token and pledge of his promiſe he tells them he would ſet his bow in the heavens. <hi>I will remember,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my convenant which is between me, and you, and every
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028262_0191_0FD7F5C548745268"/>living creature of all fleſh: and the waters ſhall no more become a flood to deſtroy all fleſh. And the how ſhall be in the could; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlaſting covenant between God, and every living creature that is upon the earth.</hi> This was God's promiſe to the world after the flood, and one may obſerve it carries an air of ſovereignty and authority in it, that ſeems to intimate it could come from none but God; could not be the fiction of Moſes, or any impoſtor, inſerted as an embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment in his hiſtory. For who but the great Sovereign and Lord of nature, that had ſpared a very ſinful world for above ſixteen hundred years, and juſt now deſtroyed it, could paſs an act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, and grant a ſecurity againſt the like judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all future time; and not only ſo, but place the rain-bow in the clouds, as a pledge of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in this inſtance: a token, a federal token between God and man, that the world ſhould never more periſh by water.</p>
            <p>This is the record of Scripture, and every ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſince, for more than four thouſand years, has ſeen the accompliſhment of it in both the parts, <hi>viz.</hi> a freedom from an univerſal flood, and the frequent appearance of the rain-bow: if it be ſaid, the rain-bow is no new thing, it appeared as much before the flood, as ſince, and could not but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if they had rain, it proceeding from natural cauſes, and being the neceſſary reſult of them. I anſwer, that at leaſt it was appointed for a new ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and purpoſe after the flood. If it appeared in the clouds before, it was not as a ſign of God's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and promiſe till afterwards. But, I anſwer further, that it does not appear probable to me, there ever was a rain-bow before the flood. The manner of introducing it, <hi>behold I do ſet my bow in the clouds,</hi> and the end it was to ſerve for, <hi>it ſhall be for a token of the covenant between me and the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028262_0192_0FD7F5C77076EBE0"/>earth.</hi> This I think implies, it had not been ſeen in the clouds before, and that it was then firſt, and ever after upon occaſion, to appear as a pledge to mankind, that God would make good his promiſe. Nor are the late diſcoveries in philoſophy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rainbow, any ſufficient objection againſt this. We need only ſuppoſe, that the ſtate of the air before the flood was different from what it is at preſent, and then the objection is removed. And that it might be ſo, is not at all improbable; and that it actually was ſo, I have the authority of ſome modern philoſophers of no little reputation for ſkill in theſe matters. One<note n="*" place="bottom">Whiſton's Scripture Prophecies, p. 103.</note> of them ſpeaking of the ſubject, has theſe words. <q>Who, but the great governor and diſpoſer of all the works of nature, could ſo alter the conſtitution of the air after the deluge, that whereas all the former generations had never ſeen nor heard of ſuch a thing as the rain-bow, the future ſhould never be without that glorious ſignal of divine goodneſs, and inſtance of the divine power.</q> He ſuppoſes, that the rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow is a new appearance, that it is a ſpecial work of the divine power and providence, and that to produce it God changed the ſtate of the air. And if this be the caſe, as I reckon probable enough, that the bow is a new phaenomenon, never ſeen before the flood, it was the fitter when it appeared, to be a ſign of God's covenant, and a confirmation of his promiſe. And the conſtant appearance of it now, is a glorious inſtance of the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We ſhould accordingly improve it, and when we behold the bow in the clouds; ſuch a reflection as this cannot be impertinent. How faithful is God in all his promiſes! How certain, how divine the record he has given of himſelf in his word! This God promiſed before any ſuch thing was
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028262_0193_0FD7F5C8ECFEC4B0"/>known in the world; and every age has ſeen the performance. Thus true is the word of God, and thus ſure are his promiſes. I may ſubjoin, as what is nearly connected with this head.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The aſſurance the Scripture gives us of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſucceſſion of day and night, and of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeaſons of the year. This was promiſed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Noah came out of the ark, and had offered ſacrifice to his great preſerver, <hi>while the earth remaineth, ſeed-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ime and harveſt, cold and heat, ſummer and winter, and day and night ſhall not ceaſe,</hi> that is, there ſhall be no ſuch confuſion of things as during the late cataſtrophe and deſolation oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, by the deluge, but he will preſerve nature in its regular courſe to the end of time. This I take to be the import of that promiſe or prophecy, and every age ſince has had the comfortable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the accompliſhment of it to the preſent day, and we may depend upon it, it ſhall always be accompliſhed, even till that period the apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>when the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements melt with fervent heat, the earth alſo and the works therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This account and repreſentation that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives of the natural world, ſome great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant phaenomena and events therein: To which much more might be added to the like purpoſe did I apprehend the diſcourſe would be acceptable and uſeful to the auditory; this account, I ſay, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confirms the truth of Scripture, and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it muſt have a divine original. Had the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof invented their own materials, they would not have drawn ſuch a ſcheme of things, and ſo boldly have pronounced concerning future events of providence, wholly out of their power and proſpect, about which they could have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty themſelves, nor give ſecurity to others. In the next place,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:028262_0194_0FD7F5CA56D2ED10"/>
2. The Scripture has been fulfilled in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral world, or the world of mankind. The account it has given of men and their affairs, has been veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and anſwered with great exactneſs through every age, ſo as to make a beautiful harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the word of God and providence. It would be no ſmall pleaſure to contemplate and view this, as far as our knowledge and obſervation can carry us. But I ſhall reſtrain myſelf, and only offer a few hints. The Scripture has been and is fulfilled in ſeveral inſtances, that concern mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. It has been fulfilled in ſome ſpecial inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards particular families, nations, and people, towards particular perſons, and towards the two different ſorts, in the grand diviſion of mankind, bad men and good men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It has been, and continues to be fulfilled in ſeveral inſtances that concern mankind in general; as the univerſal taint and defilement of nature. This the Bible mentions as fact. <hi>God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but he found out many inventions.</hi> And it gives an account of the occaſion and riſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the apoſtacy of our firſt parents; by which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature was corrupted in the fountain of it. That this has been fulfilled, every man in the world has had experience, more or leſs, according to his time in the world, and his ſenſe and underſtanding of theſe matters. <hi>This only have I found,</hi> ſays So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon in the place I now refer to, that <hi>God made man upright; but they have ſought out many inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> He was a perſon of eminent wiſdom, of great obſervation, and very inquiſitive; and he could find nothing more certain, than the degeneracy and depravation of mankind. And this every one finds in himſelf, and may obſerve in others. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens found it and complained of it, though they could not find out the cauſe of it; which the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028262_0195_0FD7F5D04ACE9618"/>Scripture acquaints us with, and herein is fulfilled in the experience of the whole world.</p>
            <p>I might inſtance in the labor, toil and ſorrow, mankind was doomed to upon his ſin and apoſtacy, which every one taſtes of in one degree or other. As alſo, in the vanity and diſappointment that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends every undertaking and ſtate. Nothing can be attained without labor and ſorrow, nothing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed without vanity: a ſort of curſe flows down upon it, and mixes with the enjoyment. This is implied in the ſentence pronounced, Gen. iii. 16, 17, 18, 19. Witneſſed to abundantly in other Scriptures, particularly in the book of Eccleſiaſtes, and confirmed by the experience of the whole world. Nor is it impertinent to mention here with reſpect to one ſex, her pains in child-bearing, which are greater than thoſe of any other females in the world, and were appointed as a peculiar puniſhment for the part the woman had in the tranſgreſſion; together with her more uneaſy ſubjection to her huſband. This the Scripture ſpeaks of with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and certainty, at the very beginning of the world: and it has had a conſtant confirmation du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſucceſſion of many thouſand years.</p>
            <p>I may add, the ſentence of death paſſed on all mankind. And let it be obſerved, that according to the Scripture account, this was pronounced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was one example of death in the world; and before it could be known by any, but the great Lord of life, or thoſe to whom he would reveal it, whether any of the human race ſhould die or not. And yet, this has been fulfilled univerſally, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two inſtances, where the great lawgiver interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and where the perſons underwent ſome kind of an equivalent, a tranſlation inſtead of death. It has been fulfilled, I ſay, in every age and place, and continues to be ſo, at this day. And it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that as the life of man, was prolonged for
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028262_0196_0FD7F5DA1EC2AA10"/>ſeveral hundred years, in the firſt ages, the better to ſerve the purpoſes of he wiſe providence, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the world, and was at laſt reduced to three ſcore years and ten, as being the common ſtandard, that is, the time of a full age, when nature ſhould appear decayed and ſpent; ſo that if men do not die then, they will however, be languiſhing and dying: as, I ſay, the ſtandard was thus fixed, it has been found the common meaſure of life ever ſince, and men have died, as I may expreſs, according to the word of the world. The Scripture has pawned its truth and veracity upon this point, and that when there was no example of dying, as you have heard, that all men ſhould die, ſhould return to the duſt, and that in the revolution of ſeventy years, they ſhould at leaſt be ready to fall into it.</p>
            <p>Now, could men, any men, by their own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and foreſight, not let into the ſecrets and purpoſes of the great governor of the world, could they draw ſuch a ſcheme of things? could they have recorded ſuch matters? have given ſuch an hiſtory of providence, for many ages and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come, which is ſo fully and punctually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the event? was it poſſible they ſhould have done this, if they had not had intercourſe with the divinity, and had not ſpoke from God, who ſaw the end, from the beginning?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture has been fulfilled in ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial inſtances, towards particular families, nations, and people. The ſubject here is too large for me to trace through the particulars, that are known and certain: or, it would afford an ample confirmation of the divinity of the Bible; and not having room for it in this diſcourſe, I muſt leave it to another head, where it may be urged not leſs pertinently. In the mean time, I ſhall obſerve in general, that the ſtate of Abraham's family, the ſurpriſing increaſe of it, when as yet he had no child, and according to
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028262_0197_0FD7F6F820CED978"/>the courſe of nature, was likely to have none. The ſojourning of his poſterity in Egypt, for four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, their deliverance thence and ſettlement in the promiſed land, with a great many amazing circumſtances, concerning their ſettlement, their apoſtacies, and puniſhments, their ſeveral captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and reſtorations, with a multitude of things relating thereto; even till the coming of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and their final deſtruction: all theſe are ſet forth and deſcribed in the Scripture, with ſo much poſitiveneſs, ſo diſtinctly, and with ſuch an air of ſovereignty, as leaves no room to queſtion, by whoſe authority the Bible was written. And, as it deſcribes the ſtate of the Jews, in all their revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo it paints the various ſcenes of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an church, that have been, and that ſhall be; I preſume to the end of the world. Theſe we have in the books of Daniel, Ezekiel, and the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of John; to ſay nothing of the ſate of the ſeveral kingdoms of the Gentiles, againſt whom the prophets denounced judgments, the burthens of the Lord, as they expreſs it, againſt Idumea, Tyre, Sydon, &amp;c. all which prophecies, have been fulfilled, even in the moſt minute cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as we are aſſured, in regard of the main branches of them; and in a manner, that gives the Scripture a triumph over all the cavils of infidel objectors, and will warrant, I think, this concluſion, that either the Bible is true, or God doth not govern the world. For, I cannot ſee but providence and the Bible, are in ſuch connexion, that they ſtand or fall together: and that whoever denies the one, muſt give up the other alſo. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Bible has been fulfilled towards particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, in ſome very memorable inſtances, as towards Abraham, inſtanced in before, whoſe concerns reach through many generations; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028262_0198_0FD7DADEB08B0080"/>there are ſuch marks of divine providence, as plainly imply, the perſons who wrote the accounts, were under a divine conduct. To this, I may add, that denunciation of wrath againſt Eli's houſe, which was to this effect, that God would certainly reject his family from the honor and dignity of the high prieſthood, for their profanation of ſacred things, and ſubſtitute another family in their room; that he himſelf ſhould live to ſee the ark of God, that glory of Iſrael, depart from them, and fall into the hands of the Philiſtines; that all the branches of his houſe ſhould die in the flower of their age, and that there ſhould not be an old man among them, and that inſtead of the plenty they now lived in, and which they ſo much abuſed, they ſhould be reduced to a piece of bread, and be forced to beg ſome mean employment of the high prieſts, his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors about the ſanctuary, to keep them from ſtarving; and that as a confirmation of all this, his two wicked ſons, Hophni and Phineas, ſhould both die in one day. This is the threatning, the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid down in Scripture of a future event; as you have it, 1 Sam. ii. 31, 32, &amp;c. and chap. iii. 11, 12, 13, 14. How it was fulfilled in all the parts of it, the Scripture hiſtory of Eli's houſe lets us ſee, though neither my time nor your patience, will allow me to conſider it. I ſhall only take notice of one paſſage, very remarkable, related by a grave author, that a certain family among the Jews being obſerved to be ſhort lived in an unuſual manner, all of them dying about eighte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they conſulted a learned rabbi about the occaſion of ſuch a judgment. He adviſed them to enquire into their genealogy, and ſee if they were not of the poſterity of Eli, to whom ſuch a puniſhment was threatened of old; which they found to be their caſe, and thence learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of that ſevere diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="unknown:028262_0199_0FD7DAE436C3A740"/>
Of the ſame nature is what Joſhua denounces againſt the builder of Jericho, that his eldeſt ſon ſhould die when he attempted the work and laid the foundation of the city; that the reſt of his ſons ſhould periſh during the progreſs of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his youngeſt at the ſitting up the gates. The threatning is recorded, Joſh. vi. 26. and the accompliſhment, 1 Kings xvi. 34. So exactly all along has divine providence commented upon the Bible, and verified its predictions.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only mention farther under this head, the threatning of the prophet againſt his ſervant Gahazi and his poſterity, viz. That the leproſy of Naaman ſhould cleave to him and to his ſeed forever, 2 Kings, v. 27. The inflicting of which judgment, as we have reaſon to expect it would be certain from the authority of him that denounced it, ſo we have an intimation of it in a ſtory, not unlike that I mentioned before, concerning the ſhort lives of Eli's houſe, viz. That a family of conſiderable note being leprous one after another in a long ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, enquiry was made into their deſcent, and it was found that they were of the poſterity of Gahazi. Thus true and infallible is the holy Scripture. What it predicts, it inſures. An argument it could not be of human contrivance, but muſt proceed from an all-comprehending mind, that had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to foreſee and diſcern what would be, and right and authority to determine what ſhould be. In a word, the Scripture is the diſcloſure of the divine purpoſes, and contains the model and plan of the divine government. It points out future events, and is a ſort of a prophetic regiſter, as I may ſay, of all the viciſſitudes and changes there are in human affairs, and of the proceedings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, whether in a way of rebuke and judgment, or mercy and deliverance, towards the world, towards the church, and towards particular
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028262_0200_0FD7DAE77242DDF8"/>perſons. And, as it has been hitherto verified, we may conclude, it ſhall be ſo ſtill, not one word ſhall fail, nor one iota paſs, till the whole be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>The laſt particular under this head remains, which I muſt be forced hereafter to reſume. As it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains matter of ſo much inſtruction and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to chriſtians, I cannot ſatisfy myſelf to paſs it over lightly. I ſhall therefore in another diſcourſe ſhew that the Scripture has been fulfilled, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be fulfilled in numerous inſtances in the two different ſorts of men, good and bad. It gives the character, lays open the heart, principles, ſtates and frames of both. Wicked men are exactly ſuch as they are there repreſented to be. Their inward thoughts, deſires, affections are ſuch as the word of God deſcribes them, And as for good men they find the Scripture a bright mirror wherein they view themſelves in all the varieties of their caſe; at leaſt, they might do ſo, and would do it more fully, did they ſtudy the Scripture more, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand themſelves better. So that the ſenſible, ſerious chriſtian has a witneſs in himſelf that the Bible is the word of God. He finds it fulfilled in his own heart every day in ſome meaſure; fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the conſtant experience of his life; whence he is aſſured it is true, and thence infers that it is divine.</p>

               <pb n="200" facs="unknown:028262_0202_0FD7DAF5E2BDA188"/>
1. The Scripture is fulfilled in the account it gives of their inward principles and frame, with reſpect to God and Religion. As, that they know not God; that their carnal minds are enmity to him; that they are of this world, have the ſpirit of the world, their portion in this life, and mind earthly things. That they are ſenſual, not having the ſpirit; that they live without God in the world; that he is not in all their thoughts; they call not upon him. It repreſents them as void of the fear and love of God, deſtitute of all divine graces; having dark minds, hard hearts, ſeared conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and being reprobate to every good work; and in conſequence of this, wanting the great diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ornaments of the new and divine nature, their hearts are ſaid to be little worth, and they are compared to the chaff which the wind driveth away, and that ſhall be burnt up with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire. Now how evidently is all this verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a large body of mankind. It is granted, the character being taken from the heart, it is not ſo legible to us; but it is true of all the ungodly; they exactly anſwer this deſcription, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity hereto is in part obvious to the obſervation of others; their carnal minds and earthly frame are in ſome meaſure manifeſt in their practice. And every one that has had the experience of both ſtates, has the confirmation hereof in his own breaſt. He knows what that darkneſs, ignorance, enmity, and carnality is, the Scripture makes the character of the wicked and unſanctified. What he ſees ſuch woeful ſymptoms and indications of in others, once he experienced in himſelf. He was once alienated from the life of God; dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; once darkneſs, though now he be light in the Lord; and though he has not war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant to ſay preciſely of ſuch and ſuch perſons, that they have the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ungodly; yet he can be aſſured he was
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028262_0203_0FD7DAFE0BB373F0"/>once one himſelf; and comparing what he obſerves in others about him with what formerly he found within him, he remains convinced that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture account of this matter is true, and that were the hearts of wicked men laid open, as they will be at the great day, it would be evident they are there painted to the life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture is fulfilled in the deſcription it gives of their antipathy to good men; their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of them, and oppoſition to them, that Enmity God put between the ſeed of the ſerpent and that of the woman, has been working ever ſince. It ſhewed itſelf carly in Cain, and has appeared in all following ages. There has all along been a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of men, that may properly be called a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine ſeed; full of enmity againſt the ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of God, and followers of the Lamb: and though their enmity has been, and is diſguiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der various pretences, it is really levelled at the religion of the principles of piety and virtue in good men. This the apoſtle remarks concerning Cain, <hi>he was of that wicked one, and ſlew his brother; and wherefore ſlew he him, becauſe his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</hi> This was then the ground of the quarrel, and it remains ſo to the preſent day. <hi>As he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit, even ſo it is now,</hi> ſays St. Paul. So it was in the apoſtle's days, indeed, always was, and always will be. Thus the Scripture has told us of one ſort, at leaſt of wicked men; and I appeal to the obſervation and experience of every age, whether it is not fulfilled. <hi>The wicked in his pride doth perſecute the poor.</hi> Sometimes they perſecute with the tongue only, calling names, inventing invidious diſtinctions and terms of reproach; and ſometimes they proceed to more open methods of violence. But the enmity ſtill reigns in the heart, which way ſoever it breaks forth.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="202" facs="unknown:028262_0204_0FD7F5DE51F0DD70"/>
3. The Scripture is fulfilled in the character it gives of this body of men, as to their outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; placing them on higher ground, and repreſenting them as the great men of this world. This character they have often in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but more commonly in the New. <hi>Ye ſee your calling, brethren, how that not many wiſe men, after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called.</hi> Where you will obſerve, the perſons of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the rich, the mighty, are left out of the church. So elſewhere, <hi>do not rich men oppreſs you? do not they blaſpheme that worthy name by which you are called?</hi> And again, <hi>go to, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you. Ye have lived in pleaſure on the earth, and been wanton. Ye have nouriſhed your hearts, as in a day of ſlaughter.</hi> Thus the Bible ſpeaks of that body of mankind, which it diſtinguiſhes from the church. And no man, I think, can read the hiſtory of former times, or obſerve the occurrences of his own, but muſt ſee an exact accompliſhment thereof herein. Not that all rich men are bad men, or all bad men rich. But in that diviſion I am ſpeaking of into two claſſes or kinds, bad and good, the church and the world; it is evident according to Scripture, that bad men will have the greateſt portion of this world. In ſhort, the Scripture ſets forth the danger of riches, in the moſt lively terms; tells us, a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſuch as often abandoned to ſenſuality, pride, oppreſſion, to forgetfulneſs of God and religion. All which we have ſeen ſo punctually fulfilled hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, as may convince us there are no random gueſſes in Scripture; that it is a divine revelation, makes known what ſhall be; containing the dictates of an infinitely wiſe, foreſeeing, I may add, of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign mind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſame may be ſaid of their inward diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028262_0205_0FD7F5DF6870A558"/>want of proper tranquility and reſt of mind. The Scripture tells us, <hi>There is no peace to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that they <hi>are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</hi> For the accompliſhment of this, I appeal to thoſe that once were in ſuch a ſtate, and are happily got out of it. I appeal to the perſons themſelves, whether they do not find a thirſt and craving that cannot be ſatisfied among the creatures: whether they have not many a time been weary of purſuing vanities and graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhadows? whether their inward luſts do not vex and diſturb them; their outward enjoyments diſappoint them? and in a word, whether they be not utter ſtrangers to the ſolid reſt and ſatisfaction of pious, devout ſouls? They may indeed endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to quiet conſcience, divert and amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by little arts, and cheat themſelves into a falſe peace; but after all, they find it will not do: their peace is a dream, their joy a flaſh. Nor can they reſt till they return to God, and reſt in him.</p>
            <p>Thus the Scripture is fulfilled in regard of bad men: it is fulfilled in their moral character, in their outward ſtate and circumſtances, in their enmity towards the church, in their diſorder and uneaſineſs of mind.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is fulfilled likewiſe towards good men. I have here a large field, but muſt ſatisfy myſelf with the bare mention of ſuch heads of diſcourſes, as would admit of great enlargement. It is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled towards good men in general, and towards particular believers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scripture is fulfilled towards good men in general, the whole church of chriſtians. I ſhall illuſtrate this in a few inſtances.</p>
            <p>It repreſents the church of Chriſt, as conſiſting of perſons mean and low, as to their circumſtances in the world. <hi>Not many wiſe men after the fleſh,</hi> ſays
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:028262_0206_0FD7F5E0EA036AB8"/>the apoſtle in the text I have quoted before, <hi>not many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi> And <hi>hath not God choſen the poor of this world, rich in ſaith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promiſed to them that love him.</hi> This is the conſtant language of Scripture. It every where intimates, that the followers of Chriſt would be of the meaner ſort. Indeed, every thing was at firſt ſo contrived, and the ſcene ſo laid, as plainly imported and ſignified this. Thus, when the Lord and head of the church came into the world, it was in circumſtances of great outward meanneſs. He did not appear with any of the pomp and grandeur of a temporal prince, but aſſumed the character of an ordinary mechanic; was called the carpenter's ſon, and the carpenter. The prime miniſters of his kingdom were choſen from among fiſhermen. And it is remarked, at the beginning of his religion, that the <hi>poor had the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached to them,</hi> that is, were goſpellized, or brought to receive the goſpel. All which was a ſort of a type, as I may call it, or intimation of what he himſelf expreſsly declares, that his <hi>kingdom was not of this world.</hi> He did not intend to ſet up a worldly kingdom, nor would the men of this world, that were fond of its diſtinctions and enjoyments be among the ſubjects of his kingdom. And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle obſervation, I think, may convince any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judges, that in this inſtance the Scripture has not wanted its accompliſhment. Not that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the chriſtian church are the abject and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably poor; but generally they are of the meaner ſort. Nor is it to be underſtood, as I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that none of the great men of this world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long thereto; but that not many of them do ſo. This is what the Scripture affirms, and the event agrees to the account it gives. It may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, indeed, before the end of the world, when the kings of the earth ſhall bring their glory into
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028262_0207_0FD7F5E28261AE20"/>the new Jeruſalem, which is but according to the Scripture prediction, and will be the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. But, at preſent, the church of Chriſt is the congregation of the poor, as they are called, I mean the inviſible church, the true genuine mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof. For, as for mere profeſſors and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, that uſurp the chriſtian name without the chriſtian nature, by whatever title they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, whether catholic, chriſtian, or moſt chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, it is no objection againſt this; <hi>he is not a Jew, that is one outwardly,</hi> nor are all chriſtians, that bear that character.</p>
            <p>The Scripture repreſents the church alſo as the leſs, as well as the lower part of mankind. <hi>Fear not little flock,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdon.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>many are called, and few are choſen.</hi> If it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the church compared with the world, the true church of Chriſt, the inviſible church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the reſt of mankind, the great body of hypocrites and ſalſe profeſſors; there can be no queſtion of its accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>Again, the Scripture repreſents the church, the real genuine members of it, as generally in a ſtate of conflict, exerciſe and ſorrow; whilſt the men of the world are in circumſtances of great freedom and eaſe, that appear more plauſible and agreeable to common judges. Thus, <hi>ye ſhall lament and weep, but the world ſhall rejoice.</hi> And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtrain of Scripture; <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> They that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and <hi>through much tribulation we muſt enter into the kingdom of neaven.</hi> And even when we are told, that they who <hi>forſake father or mother, &amp;c. ſhall receive a hundred fold in the preſent life, and in the world to come eternal life:</hi> it is added, with perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, Mark x. 30. intimating, that the church
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028262_0208_0FD7F5E40E7C05E8"/>in this world would be in a ſtate of ſuffering, and will be ſo, more or leſs, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

But notwithſtanding theſe, they have their exerciſes, burthens, fears, their hours of weeping and humiliation, their deep abaſements and ſelf-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilations, as I may call them, ſuch as the world knows nothing of. In all which the Scripture is gloriouſly fulfilled. We ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> two ſorts of men in the world; ſome bearing the croſs and following Chriſt, denying themſelves, crucifying the fleſh, ſowing in tears: others ſecure, thoughtleſs, living in pleaſure, putting far from them the evil day, without care, thought, burthen or fear; which is juſt the ſcene deſcribed in Scripture, agreeable to the plan and ſtate there laid down.</p>
            <p>Further, the Scripture repreſents the church of God, as immoveably ſecure and lafe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the dangers that threaten it whether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or from within. The <hi>gates of hell,</hi> we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>buſh has been in flames, but not conſumed.</hi> The
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:028262_0209_0FD7F5E798AF7928"/>church has been preſerved in the midſt of all its adverſaries. Two things add a luſtre and glory to this providence. It has met with the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful oppoſition. Never had any body ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enemies, and yet it has ſurvived all. And further, other kingdoms have ſunk under a far leſs weight. The four famous monarchies, the Aſſyrian, Medo-Perſian, Greek, and Roman, that thought themſelves invincible, and had all external advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to render them ſo, are periſhed and come to nothing. And yet the church deſtitute of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man help, headed by a carpenter, as he was called and appeared in the world, and by a few poor fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen, has ſtood its ground and weathered the point to this day. The billows have raged and the mountains been caſt into the midſt of the ſea; but God has always been in the midſt of his church, <hi>a river has made glad the city of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture repreſents the Church of God as mixed with hypocrites, a company of pretenders, joining in profeſſion with the upright followers of the Lord Jeſus; that have the Lamb's mark on their foreheads. This we have in various parables as well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>in other texts; as in the parable of the <hi>net caſt into the ſea, the tares ſown among the wheat, the wiſe and fooliſh virgins.</hi> And I need not ſtand to ſhew you, that it has had its accompliſhment hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, that the church has herein exactly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſcription of the word, and appeared in the form, or according to the model drawn by the great Lord and founder of it.</p>
            <p>I add, The Scripture repreſents the church in a great variety of ſtates; as undergoing ſundry chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and appearing in different ſhapes. At firſt it was like a grain of muſtard-ſeed, little and obſcure, and then was to grow up to a great tree, and in different periods to put on different fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be oppreſſed, its witneſſes lying in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028262_0210_0FD7F5E79F7BA1A0"/>and propheſying in ſable; and then to be enlarged: ſometimes to apoſtatiſe and grow luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, ſecure, and careleſs; and then again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and appear in its luſtre and glory. This we have deſcribed in ſeveral prophecies and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Revelations, under the type of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Aſian churches. And the providence of God has been fulfilling the ſame in every age ſince the going forth of the word of prophecy; part of which we have ſeen, and the reſt we wait for. You read when the church was only a grain of muſtard-ſeed, you have ſeen it a great tree. You have heard of its general defection, and have ſeen its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in ſome meaſure. And we have reaſon to expect it will appear in greater glory than it has ever yet done, But what I offer, is, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture points at all theſe revolutions, viciſſitudes, and changes; and that the Sovereign Ruler of the world has ordered events anſwerable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and characters given of things therein. Thus it has been with reference to the church in general. And I am now to remark,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Scripture has been fulfilled towards particular believers; and that with reference to their call into the church, their character and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, their in firmities, the promiſes made to them, and the threatenings denounced againſt them for their chaſtiſement and correction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scripture has been fulfilled in their call into the church. And here I may take notice that the Bible repreſents the different characters of the perſons called, ſome as notoriouſly wicked, ſinners before the Lord exceedingly; as the prodigal ſon, Mary Magdalene; ſome among the Corinthians, as the apoſtle tells us, 1 Cor, vi. 9, 10, 11. Some as leſs infamous and ſcandalous, as the apoſtles of Chriſt, Nicodemus, Joſeph of Arimathea, Philip, and Lydia, who are not mentioned with any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028262_0211_0FD7F5F4E82F52B0"/>blot upon them, or mark of infamy: ſome as perſons of purer morality, walking with greater caution, according to the light of their own minds, which was the caſe of the apoſtle Paul, and it is likely of other of the converts from among the Jews.</p>
            <p>The Scripture alſo repreſents the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their call; ſome with more terror and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, as Peter's converts that were pricked at their hearts, the gaoler who cried out, <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Theſe were recovered and brought home to God in a more awful manner. He prefaced the work with the voice of thunder. Others were called with a ſmall ſtill voice, feeling little of the terrors of the Lord, as Philip, Zacheus, Lydia, and it may be, moſt of the apoſtles. Now as theſe things happened for examples, they muſt he conſidered as a kind of Scripture type of future converſions in the different manner and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them. And I dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t not but herein the Scripture has from time to time been fulfilled; as the experience of chriſtians can witneſs; whilſt ſome are able to ſay, this was my caſe, another that was mine. And no queſtion, if we take in the whole body of the faithful, every caſe will be found touched and deſcribed in Scripture. Nor is there a true convert in the world, but the word of God points to him; ſhews him in the various poſtures of his mind, and in all his tendencies towards God. A glorious argument of the divinity of the Bible, though all do not underſtand it, and it may be ſome will laugh at, and deſpiſe it; glorious will it app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> when the church is complete, and the ſaints come to compare notes in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture has been fulfilled in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and principles of believers. A chriſtian has the <hi>law of God written in his heart,</hi> and is a ſort of living Bib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. Time will not allow me to enlarge
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028262_0212_0FD7F5FBB9DEC608"/>much. But let me remark, that the Scripture eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſpeaks of a generation of perſons diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt of the world, by an inward ſanctification. It calls them ſaints, believers, the righteous children of light, the ſons of God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of the earth, and the like. And as bad as the world is, there ſtill are, and always have been ſome that appear to belong to this body, and ſhall be to the end of time. Farther, the Scripture deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes them by ſuch characters as are a ſufficient diſtinction between them and the reſt of mankind, by which they may be known certainly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and probably to others: as that they <hi>are not of the world,</hi> that they <hi>do not commit ſin,</hi> that they <hi>have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> that they <hi>ſet their affections on things above, and not on things on the earth,</hi> that they <hi>hunger and thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter righteouſneſs,</hi> that they are ſenſible of preſent infirmities, and <hi>forgetting things behind, and reaching forth unto things before, they preſs towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> It repreſents them as asſpiring after God, making him their centre, breathing after him, and reſting in him, and as cloathed with all divine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all glorious within. Nor are theſe accidental ſtrokes that belong to ſome rare ſaints, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per character of all believers; though indeed with much variety; ſome having the ſeveral graces in greater eminency and luſtre, others more faintly and with greater alloys, according to the diſtinction the Scripture itſelf mentions of babes, little children and fathers.</p>
            <p>Well, thus the Scripture ſpeaks of the church, and thus the church has been from the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it to this day. There is not one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, but appears with the characters the word of God has provided for him; he has the
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028262_0213_0FD7F5FC9E5E6618"/>heart, the frame, the principles, there appointed and ſet forth as the ornament of believers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scripture is fulfilled in their infirmities alſo. Though they be ſaints, that ſpeaks of them, as imperfect ſaints; repreſents them as having a <hi>body of ſin, a law in their members, waring againſt the law of</hi> their <hi>minds; the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpirit; as not having yet attained nor being already perfect.</hi> It repreſents the heart deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked, which is true of good men in ſome meaſure, as well as others. <hi>The ſpirit that is in them luſteth to envy,</hi> and other vices. Whence they have their inward conflicts, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſtruggles with their corruptions.</p>
            <p>It repreſents them in a great variety of frames: ſometimes their hearts following hard after God, triumphing in his favor, and exulting in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; at other times, overſpread with clouds and darkneſs, filled with fear, and wholly indiſpoſed for ſpiritual converſe and acts of devotion. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the beſt of them as weak and defectible, as ſometimes off their guard, ſecure and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and thereupon falling into ſin. To which purpoſe the miſcarriages of the ſaints are left upon record in Scripture; not merely to tell us what they have done, but what others would be like to do in the ſame circumſtances, when for their pride and ſelf-confidence, God leaves them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and they are written for the admonition and caution of the church in future ages. In the mean time, they ſhew the frailty of believers, in their preſent imperfect ſtate. In ſhort, the Scripture repreſents them as falling out by the way, running into parties and ſchiſms; uncharitably cenſuring one another, and indulging mutual paſſions to the diſgrace and ſcandal of their profeſſion. A great deal of this is hinted concerning them in the New
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028262_0214_0FD7F5FE709145F8"/>Teſtament. And that theſe particulars are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, is matter of conſtant and univerſal expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; I appeal to every heart and conſcience among the generation of God's children, and am ſatisfied there are too many witneſſes of the truth to need any further confirmation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Scripture is fulfilled in the promiſes thereof towards believers. And here I have a ſubject that I could with pleaſure employ an hour upon. But I muſt be forced to paſs it over in a good meaſure, and leave every chriſtian to ſupply the defect out of his own experience. All the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, <hi>the exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> are in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>yea and amen.</hi> All are true, faithful and ſure; as every one has found that has tried them, every believer from the beginning of the world to this day. Let me obſerve very briefly, that there are ſome general promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fulfilled towards all believers; as that God <hi>will never leave them nor for ſake them;</hi> that he <hi>will not ſuffer</hi> them <hi>to be tempted above what</hi> they can <hi>bear, but will, with the temptation, make a way for their eſcape;</hi> that <hi>all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God,</hi> that he will give them his <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> that he will <hi>manifeſt</hi> himſelf to them, <hi>be their God,</hi> and they ſhall be his <hi>people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, there are occaſional promiſes, as I may call them, adapted to the circumſtances of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, and which they, in thoſe circumſtances, happily experience the accompliſhment of; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under burthens, direction and conduct in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, when ſenſible of our own weakneſs, we truſt in the Lord with all our hearts, and lean not to our own underſtanding, help in prayer, anſwers of prayer, comfort in tribulation, and the like. A multitude of promiſes there are in the Scripture, wonderfully ſuited to all the caſes of chriſtians that I muſt not ſtand now to collect: all which have
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028262_0215_0FD7F5FFCF3572A8"/>been accompliſhed in every age of the church. Every chriſtian can ſet to his ſeal in this matter, though with more or leſs clearneſs, according as he is more or leſs exerciſed and experienced in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I might ſhew, that the Scripture is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the threatnings of it towards good men, in the corrections and chaſtiſements frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in caſe of backſliding, the omiſſion of duty, careleſneſs in the performance, reſtraining prayer, want of watchfulneſs, attention and ſeriouſneſs in their walk and conduct. In theſe caſes, God threatens he <hi>will viſit their tranſgreſſions with the rod and their iniquities with ſtripes.</hi> Nor have we only general, but even particular threatnings, deſigned as a rebuke to particular failings and tranſgreſſions. All which, in their time, ſeaſon and manner, are fulfilled in God's diſcipline, towards his children and ſervants. In ſhort, this is a general experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and it is a perfect accompliſhment of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine word; that if the chriſtian grows ſecure and careleſs, leſs prayerful and watchful, God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws and hides his face; the ſpirit is grieved and ſtands at a diſtance: in conſequence whereof the chriſtian finds his chariot wheels taken off, he has neither light nor comfort, little ſtrength for duty, and little enjoyment in it.</p>
            <p>Thus the Scripture is fulfilled in all the parts of it: fulfilled towards the world, towards the church, towards particular believers, in the characters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threatnings of it.</p>
            <p>I promiſed to make ſome remarks upon theſe particulars, in order to ſhew the force of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for proving the divinity of the Scripture. Had it been a human writing, proceeded from men, without any intelligence from above, it could never have deſcribed the ſtate of the natural and moral world ſo accurately as it has done, and ſo agreeably
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028262_0216_0FD7F6038E0A1208"/>to the even<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and iſſues of things. The Scripture exhibits and gives us a plan and ſcheme of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine government of the world; of the different ſtates of the world and church; of the church in general; and of the ſeveral members of it; of good men and bad men. It repreſents them in their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious frames, principles, and diſpoſitions; in their various outward circumſtances and conditions; in their various ſpiritual ſtates, their conflicts, trials, temptations, ſufferings and comforts. This it doth in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch a perfect agreement and correſpondence to the providence of God in the conſtant courſe thereof, making ſuch beautiful harmony between the divine providence and the holy Scripture, as is a full evidence that the Bible is from God, and that he who governs the world indited it. Now that this argument may appear in its proper light and force, I ſhall ſubjoin a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations without dwelling long upon them. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the great author of nature and governor of the world had in his own mind a full view and comprehenſion of his works. A perfect ſcheme, idea, or model thereof, as I may call it. This, I think, we may conclude from the exact wiſdom, regularity, and order with which he proceeds in all of them; and the Scripture gives intimations of it. Thus in the hiſtory of the creation, after the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral claſſes and parcels of his creatures, it is ſaid of each, <hi>God ſaw that it was good;</hi> and at the cloſe of all, when the great Creator came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view his work, it is ſaid, <hi>he ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good,</hi> that is, was juſt what God deſigned it, proportioned and fitted to its place and ſtation among the creatures, and to the end of its maker. And we are told by the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that God <hi>worketh all things according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>nſel of his own will.</hi> When he purpoſed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ed that there ſhould be a world, there was a
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028262_0217_0FD7F6052D9E40D0"/>counſel of his will, a wiſe plan and ſcheme, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which he determined all things ſhould be made, and all things ſhould be governed. Now he governeth all things in nature, providence and grace, according to this <hi>counſel of his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The counſel of God, this plan of the divine works and government, is in part laid down in Scripture. I ſay in part, for I know not that I have warrant to affirm, that the Bible contains all God's purpoſes, and the whole ſcheme of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and decrees. But it contains what concerns our world, the great maxims of his government, the different ſtates of his ſubjects here, and the chief events of his providence towards them from time to time. In the Scripture the Book of the divine decrees is opened, as it were. We are there told of his creating a world according to his purpoſe; in what manner he proceeded in that work; and how he would proceed in the government of it. And I reckon the courſe of his providence in the main revolutions and changes there would be in the world, and in the ſeveral grand diſpenſations of it, at leaſt, are there deſcribed as they have been, and will be, from the beginning of the world to the end thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the Scripture was written chieſly for the uſe of the church: and it may be, I might add, the world continued and governed with regard to the intereſt and concerns of the church; ſo the ſcheme of divine providence exhibited and laid down there chieſly reſpects it. Not that the reſt of mankind are paſſed over wholly. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture frequently takes notice of the affairs of the world in general, and of particular kingdoms and nations without the pale. Nor do I ſuppoſe all the affairs of the church, nor of the ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, are repreſented in Scripture and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in its map. But the general ſtate thereof, its
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028262_0218_0FD7F60900FA88B8"/>viciſſitudes and changes, the main inſtances of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and grace towards it, and the particular members of it; theſe things the Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. It tells us, what the ſtate of it has been, and what it ſhall be in the ſucceſſive ages; what the ſeveral members of it always have been, and will be; what they fear and ſuffer, and what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; what their warfare would be; what their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlicts, toils, and victories: and in ſhort, in what way they ſhould be diſciplined and prepared for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every thing contained in the Scripture, as part of the divine counſel for the government of the world; ſuppoſing the Scripture is God's word, and really contains ſuch a ſcheme, will be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly accompliſhed. The purpoſes of God mall ſtand. His words will not, cannot, fall to the ground. Hence we read, that ſuch or ſuch a thing was done, or came to paſs, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. It is as neceſſary, according to the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, or ſuppoſition, I am now upon, that the Scripture ſhould be fulfilled, as that the world ſhould be made. For as the creation of the world was an accompliſhment of God's purpoſe and counſel in that particular; the ſame may be ſaid of every event in the government of it; eſpecially as it is enſured to us in the Scripture. Not one iota, or tittle, ſhall paſs till the whole be fulfilled. The reaſon is, it proceeds from God, the God of truth and wiſdom; and nothing can fall out to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint an infinite underſtanding. I add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſlfilling of the Scripture is a gradual thing, not done all at once, but ſucceſſively. For it contains God's ſcheme of providence and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for many generations. Some of it is fulfilled in one age; ſuch parts of it as refer to particular events, that were to take place at this or that time: as, the deſtruction of the old world by
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028262_0219_0FD7F61AF4A1BD58"/>water; the ſlavery of Abraham's poſterity in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; their ſettlement in Canaan; their captivity and deliverance; the coming of the Meſſiah; and the like. Some of it is conſtantly fulfilled; as, what concerns the ſtate of the natural world in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral; and the world of mankind, of good men, and bad men; who always were, and will be, ſuch as the Scripture deſcribes them, anſwering the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters there laid down of their reſpective ſtates, principles, and manner of acting. Some of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great deal of it, as it points out particular events, has been fulfilled; and ſome remains to be fulfilled, and will have its accompliſhment in its proper time, in the ſeveral ſucceſſive ages of the church and periods yet to come: as, the fall of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt; the laſt great ſtruggle of the followers of the Lamb with the followers of the beaſt: the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium; the reſurrection of the body; and the final judgment. The Scripture is an entire Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſis, or general view of the whole courſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, towards the church eſpecially; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently will not all be fulfilled till the laſt ſcene is acted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When the whole work of God in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of providence is finiſhed, and the entire ſcheme or wiſe council of God, as laid down in Scripture, is perfected; and all has taken place in regular and orderly events, the argument from hence, that the Scripture is from God, or given by divine inſpiration, will appear with greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; partly as it will be more full and ſtrong, being grounded upon the accompliſhment of all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; partly as it will ſtand in a fuller light, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being obſcured by that darkneſs, prejudice, and want of experience, which now attend perſons and hinder them from diſcerning the evidence of this matter. I doubt not, but in that more amiable ſtate of things which we expect in this world, as
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028262_0220_0FD7F61DE173DBA8"/>the church will ſee more of the accompliſhment of the Scripture, ſo it will ſee it more clearly. But, when the end cometh, when the whole myſtery of providence is compleated, and the <hi>Son ſhall give up the Kingdom to God, even the Father,</hi> this argument will appear triumphant, the whole Bible ſtand in a glorious light, and a perſect harmony between Scripture and providence be ſeen to the conviction of all. The contemplation of which will probably be ſome of the buſineſs of heaven, and among the entertainments of the ſaints there. In the mean time,</p>
            <p n="7">7. So much of the Scripture is already accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and evidently appears to be ſo; as is ſufficient at preſent to give this argument great weight. There is a ſurpriſing concurrence between the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and providence. They have hitherto run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. The world has been ſuch as the Bible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it ſhould be. It has been governed in the manner that deſcribes, and a multitude of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful events have taken place in the very time and way the Scripture ſets forth. Now it ought to be confidered, that theſe things were foretold, ſpoken of there as what ſhould be, certainly be, and be in ſuch a manner, long before the things themſelves came to paſs. What David ſays with referrence to divine providence in his formation, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to this prupoſe, <hi>thine eyes did ſee my ſubſtance yet being imperfiect, and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them:</hi> the ſame may, in a ſenſe, be ſaid of the writers of the Scripture, they ſaw, as it were, the ſubſtance of all future things, all the great tranſactions of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the theatre of the world in the various ſtates and changes of human affairs, and they wrote down all the members and particulars thereof, which in time come to be finiſhed, and receive their
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:028262_0221_0FD7F61F20165EE8"/>being while yet there was none of them. Now who could do this but God? or, which is the ſame thing, thoſe that ſaw with his light. In ſhort, the Scripture holds before our view the various faces of the world: the various ſtates and poſtures of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs therein, and the various tempers of mens hearts. And the experience of ſeveral thouſand years, the conſtant daily experience of all good men perfectly accords therewith. And this, I think, to be in its kind, next to a demonſtration, that the writers of the Bible did not ſpeak of themſelves, from private impulſe, like weak and ſhort ſighted creatures, as all men are, not knowing certainly what ſhall be on the morrow; but they ſpake from God, and as they were moved and taught by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſet before you the fourth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I propoſed, to prove the Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, viz. the external marks and characters that attend it: and have inſiſted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what copiouſly on one branch of it, the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scripture. The uſefulneſs and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of which argument, I reckon to be ſuch, that it well deſerves a volume by itſelf. Nor do I think any one could better employ his time, and with more ſervice to the church of God, than by ſetting it forth in its ſtrength. Which muſt be my excuſe that I have ſaid ſo much upon it; as a regard to your patience is the beſt excuſe, that I can make, that I have ſaid no more.</p>

            <p>I HAVE already offered ſeveral arguments to prove the divine original or inſpiration of the Scriptures, and having gone through thoſe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to another.</p>
            <p n="5">V. This truth may be argued from the teſtimony that God gave to the penmen of the Scriptures, as by miracles, prophecy, the ſpreading of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and the glorious effects of it upon the hearts of men in their ſanctification. Hereby he has ſet to his ſeal that the Scripture is true, is divine, and is his word. I ſhall go over the particulars in their order, beginning with the firſt of them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. God has borne teſtimony to the writers of the Scripture, and to the things there written, by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. I have ſtood too long on former arguments to inſiſt largely on this. I ſhall briefly repreſent the matter of fact; ſhew that the penmen of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wrought miracles, and what miracles they wrought. And then conſider the argument from hence, how this proves they were inſpired.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall briefly repreſent the matter of fact,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028262_0223_0FD7F622E108AE28"/>ſhew that the penmen of the Scripture wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and what miracles they wrought.</p>
            <p>What a miracle is, what are the proper diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing characters of thoſe works that we admit as miraculous, it muſt be owned, is a matter of ſome difficulty to determine. The common difi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a miracle, is an extraordinary operation, contrary to the ſettled laws of nature, wrought by the infinite power of God. "It is," ſaith a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man,<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Kidder.</note> 
               <q>a work above the power of nature, and above the reach of any creature whatſoever</q> And another ſays,<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir Charles Wolſeley.</note> 
               <q>it is that which properly can have no ſecond cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <q>a production of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of nothing, either in the thing itſelf or manner of producing it;</q> which he affirms can be effected by no leſs than an omnipotent arm. And on this account ſome critics remark, miracles are termed in Scripture, powers, being works of a divine and infinite power. And this is the more generally received account of the matter. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is thought to be ſomething above the ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary power of nature, as it is contrary to the laws of it. And whenever it is wrought, or by whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inſtrument, it is the work of God and proclaims omnipotence.</p>
            <p>It muſt be granted, that ſome others are willing to come lower. The ingenious Mr. Lock defines a miracle thus: <q>It is, ſays he, a ſenſible opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which being above the comprehenſion of the ſpectator, and in his opinion contrary to the eſtabliſhed laws of nature, is by him taken to be divine.</q> But acknowledging there is a real difficulty in ſtating this point, ariſing from our not
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028262_0224_0FD7F623240F4ED8"/>underſtanding fully the laws of nature, and the power of ſecond cauſes; and, conſequently, what things are contrary to thoſe laws, and above the capacity of created beings; I do not think this much affects the preſent argument, for certainly many of the facts we have to alledge, as performed by the authors of the Scripture Revelation, and thoſe that were employed in it, muſt be admitted to be ſuch as could proceed from none but God. Either they are divine works, extraordinary mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operations, or never any ſuch were laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mankind, and offered to the teſt of human judgment. So that, with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t philoſophiſing over nicely here, and fixing the exact bounds between created and uncreated power, determining the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that a creature, a man or an angel can do, and what God only can do, I think it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the facts recorded in Scripture, and that we place to the head of miracles, muſt paſs for mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or I cannot ſee that there ever were, or can be, any miracle in the world, or that any uſe can be made of thoſe extraordinary phaenomena and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays of divine providence that have always in the accounts of mankind been eſteemed miraculous.<note n="*" place="bottom">Since theſe diſcourſes were compoſed, the notion and nature of miracles has been much better ſtated, than ever before by the Reverend Mr. Samuel Chandler, in his ingenious vindication of the chriſtian religion. Who defines a miracle in genneral, <q>an action done, or an operation viſibly performed, by any being, that is really and truly above the reach, power and capacity of that being who doth it, to perform of himſelf, and without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſome ſuperior agent.</q> And a miracle when done by a man in confirmation of a divine miſſion, is, according to him, <q>ſomewhat viſibly performed by him in order to prove himſelf to be ſent of God, which is ſtrictly and truly above all his natural powers and capacities, and which he could not of himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form without the influence and aſſiſtance of ſome ſuperior a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</q> So that what is or is not a miracle is to be determined by the agreement and proportion between the action performed, and the capacities and powers of the agent. If the action done be certainly above all the powers of the agent, of himſelf, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted to perform it, is a true and proper miracle, and proves the co-operation and aſſiſtance of ſome inviſible and ſuperior being. That may therefore be a miracle in regard of one agent that is not ſo with regard to another of greater ability and power; that may be a miracle when done by a man, that would be none if done by an angel. For ſince no beings can poſſibly of themſelves perform any thing beyond their natural powers and capacities, whenever they are inſtrumental in doing any thing of this kind, it muſt argue the concurrence and aſſiſtance of ſome other and higher being. If a man doth what is above the reach of, human abilities, he performs a real miracle, and muſt neceſſarily be aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome ſuperior agent. Now this is manifeſtly the caſe of that wonderful works here urged in behalf of chriſtianity and the Bible.</note>

Having promiſed thus much for ſtating the point and obviating cavils, I ſhall briefly touch the facts themſelves, thoſe things which the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords as miraculous operations. And here I would obſerve, that all whom God employed to make known any new laws, or reveal any new doctrines to the world, came with the power of miracles, which were their credentials, or the certain tokens that he ſent them. Thus did Moſes, thus did Chriſt, and thus did the apoſtles. Moſes delivered a body of laws to the Jews, which he profeſſed to receive from God; to prove which, he wrought miracles among them.</p>
            <p>Let me obſerve again, that the miracles, which theſe perſons wrought, were numerous, open, and manifect in the face of the world; and had the higheſt characters of divinity in them that any facts ever had, that have been propoſed to the world, under the character of miracles. I ſhall not give you the liſt of them. They are known to ſuch as are converſant with the Bible. Moſes offers a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of his power immediately upon his call to his office; his rod is turned into a ſerpent, and then turned into a rod again. The ten miraculous judgments inflicted on Pharaoh and his people,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028262_0226_0FD7F63209618510"/>every body has heard of. You have them record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Exod. vii. 8, 9, 10, 11. He afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides by his rod the waters of the Red Sea. In the wilderneſs he appears glorious, as the miniſter of heaven, by a power of miracles that conſtantly attended him, and which he exerted on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus he cured the bitter waters at Marah, by caſting a tree into them, Exod. xv. 24, 25. brought waters out of the rock by ſmiting it with his rod, Exod. xvii. 6. ſubſiſted forty days on the mount without food, when by his heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, his face acquired an angelical luſtre. And you find when his authority was diſputed, and his pre-eminence unreaſonably cavilled at, God was pleaſed to interpoſe, and by a miracle, make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in his favor, puniſhing Miriam with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy, Numb. xii. and afterwards upon occaſion of another inſtance of the contempt of his authority, and of an affront to his miſſion, the earth opens and ſwallows up the contenders; and Aaron's rod is made to bloſſom as a public ſignal of God's elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and appointment of him and Moſes, Numb. xvi. 17. Thus you ſee Moſes the firſt lawgiver to the church, and firſt writer of Scripture, was a worker of miracles. God hereby bore teſtimony to him, owned his miniſtry, and ſealed his miſſion.</p>
            <p>And what miracles Chriſt wrought, who came to eſtabliſh a new law, and deliver a new ſyſtem of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to the world, I need not tell you. <hi>Go and ſhew John,</hi> ſaith he, to one of his diſciples, <hi>thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee, the blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the leapers are cleanſed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor have the goſpel preached to them,</hi> Matt. xi. 4, 5. In ſhort, he ſhewed a power over univerſal nature, wrought all ſorts of miracles, and that in the moſt ſurpriſing manner. He did the works that never man did; and yet tells his diſciples, the ſame, and greater
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:028262_0227_0FD7F63386120038"/>works they ſhould do in his name, which their hiſtory confirms.</p>
            <p>It is further obſervable, that this power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles was continued with the church, and was exerted by thoſe that profeſſed the chriſtian religion for ſome ages. Many inſtances I might give of this, but muſt forbear.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only take notice of a bold challenge which the chriſtians ſometimes made to the greateſt empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that if they were brought before the ſeats of their gods, if they did not force them to depart and make them confeſs themſelves to be devils and wicked ſpirits, they would ſuffer all ſorts of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments. They pretended to caſt out devils in the name of Chriſt, to triumph over the heathen oracles; and ſo confident were they of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er herein, that in their diſputes with their heathen adverſaries, they offered to put the credit of their cauſe upon their ſucceſs in this matter.</p>
            <p>I add, the moſt conſiderable miracle of all was the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead. This he himſelf foretold before it came to paſs, even when his diſciples themſelves neither underſtood it, nor believed it. He bid them <hi>deſtroy</hi> that <hi>temple,</hi> viz. his body, and he would <hi>build it up again in three days.</hi> And he did ſo accordingly: which ſingle fact is a ſufficient confirmation of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It doth not indeed directly prove, that the Scripture is inſpired, that the prophets and apoſtles, and the ſeveral books that go under their names were inſpired; but it proves Chriſt was what he profeſſed himſelf to be, the ſon of God: that the doctrine he preached was true; and that he had authority from heaven for all he did.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſtand to prove the certainty of this fact that Chriſt roſe from the dead. It has all the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that a thing of this nature is capable of. And I am conſident, no reaſonable perſon can lay any
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:028262_0228_0FD7F634DC69E530"/>weight upon the ſorry pretence of his enemies, the aſſidavit they hired the watch to make, viz. that <hi>while they ſlept his diſciples came and ſtole him away.</hi> It was utterly unlikely, that the diſciples ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſuch a thing. Next to impoſſible that they ſhould ſucceed in it: and beſides the very pretence is ſenſeleſs. Men aſleep, are as men abſent and at a diſtance, or even men ſo far and ſo long dead; and what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>edit is to be given to their teſtimony? how cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ey tell what was done when they were aſleep?</p>
            <p>Theſe, and the like, were the miracles by which the doctrines of the Bible were ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. Moſes, Chriſt, the apoſtles, and primitive chriſtians for ſome ages wrought miracles. I am now,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the force of the argument from hence, and to ſhew how miracles prove the inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or divine miſſion of thoſe that wrote the Scriptures. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We find that miracles were wrought for this purpoſe, as an evidence of a divine commiſſion, and accordingly appealed to. Thus when God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Moſes to work miracles, he tells him it was that the Iſraelites might believe the God of their fathers had appeared to him. And accordingly we ſee the miracles he wrought in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderneſs, were the great means, not only of eſtabliſhing his authority, but of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it when called in queſtion. When Corah, Dathan, and Abiram mutinied againſt him, he has recourſe to miracles, as his credentials, and puts the deciſion of the diſpute between himſelf and his competitors thereupon. <hi>Hereby,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ye ſhall know that the Lord hath ſent me: if theſe men die the common death of all men, or if they be viſited after the viſitation of all men, then the Lord hath not ſent me
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028262_0229_0FD7F6374229B600"/>But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and ſwallow them up, with all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto them, and they go down quick in the pit; then ſhall ye under ſtand that thoſe men have provoked the Lord.</hi> In the following verſes you have this new thing, a wonder of providence, as God atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his ſervant Moſes. <hi>And it came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> inſtances concerning Chriſt and his apoſtles. They appeal to miracles as God's witneſs to them. <hi>Believe me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>for the work's ſake.</hi> And again, <hi>if I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin.</hi> The apoſtle Paul pleads for himſelf and in behalf of his miſſion, that the <hi>ſigns of an apoſtle were wrought</hi> by him. And the evangeliſt remarks with reference to all the apoſtles, that <hi>they went forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with ſigns following.</hi> They preached in the name of the Lord, and he owned them by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of miracles that attended them.</p>
            <p>I might here obſerve that the famous impoſtor Mahomet, as he was defective in all other proofs of a divine miſſion, ſo particularly in this. When ſome of his country-men that were aware of the vile deſigns he was carrying on, under the ſpecious pretence of a call and revelation from heaven, ſet themſelves to oppoſe him, the more effectually to try and gravel him, they demanded he would ſhew them ſome miracle. <q>Moſes, ſay they, and Jeſus, and the reſt of the prophets, according to your own doctrine, wrought miracles to prove their miſſion from God. And therefore, if you be a prophet, and greater than any that were ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, as you boaſt yourſelf, make the dead

Sometimes he inſinuated, that their predeceſſors contemned the miracles of Salek, and the other prophets, and that for this reaſon God would work no more among them. At other times he told them, that thoſe God had ordained to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſhould believe without miracles, and that thoſe whom he had not ordained to believe, ſhould not be convinced, though all the miracles they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired were wrought in their ſight. And when he found this would not ſatisfy, he goes to work ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; takes up the ſword and reſolves to make uſe of that as his only argument for the future.</p>
            <p>But the writers of the Scripture, and thoſe that were employed in delivering to us the doctrines thereof, do not put us off with ſuch flames and ſorry pretences as theſe are. They do not deſire we ſhould believe them upon their bare word, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to their works, the power of miracles they were intruſted with, and exerciſed as there was occaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me obſerve, that the miracles theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wrought, are certain evidences of a divine power concurring with them. It was the juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of Nichodemus, <hi>Rabbi, we know thou art a

            <p n="3">3. I think the argument hence fully concluſive, that theſe perſons were undoubtedly ſent of God. They wrought miracles, and that by a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and we may be ſure God would not lend his power, as I may expreſs it, to confirm an impoſture. Had the perſons we are ſpeaking of been cheats, forged the doctrine which they delivered to the world in the name of God, can we imagine that he would have concurred with them in the manner he did? have enabled them to ſpeak all ſorts of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages they had never learned, and that on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they might propagate and ſpread the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they had contrived and forged; enabled them to heal all ſorts of diſeaſes, and raiſe the dead, as we know they frequently did? would God have been thus preſent with cheats and impoſtors, that came to abuſe mankind in the groſſeſt manner? would he have ſupplied them with power for ſuch a horrid purpoſe? we cannot ſuppoſe this, without changing our ideas and notions of God, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying his eſſential characters of wiſdom, holineſs, and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the miracles wrought by Moſes, the prophets, Chriſt and his apoſtles, are the ſtrongeſt proof and evidence that can be given, ſo far as we know, of a divine miſſion. None ever did ſuch works as they. And I reckon, when any come in
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028262_0232_0FD7F6479FDA9A20"/>the name of God, with ſuch a power accompanying them, mankind not only may receive them, but are under a neceſſity of doing it; otherwiſe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the teſtimony of God, and oppoſe his authority.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay, for inſtance, of that great confirmation of the chriſtian religion, the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt? had he not roſe from the dead, his religion had died with him. Whereas the miracle of his reſurrection is ſuch a proof of his commiſſion, as one would think the moſt ſtubborn infidel could not withſtand. Had he been an impoſtor, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he could not have raiſed himſelf. And can we ſuppoſe, that God would have raiſed him, that is, have employed his power, the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power, to eſtabliſh a lie, and give credit to a cheat: no, all the notions we have of God oblige us to believe, that if Chriſt had not been the faithful witneſs, ſent and approved by him, he would never have given ſo high a teſtimony to him: but rather have withdrawn from him, and left the temple of his body, when it was deſtroyed, to have lain in its ruins forever. I remember a paſſage, which may ſerve for the illuſtration of this argument, of an impoſtor, called El-David, that gave out he was the Chriſt, and drew many followers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.

               </gap>illes. His pretences making a noiſe in that part of the world, he was brought before an Arabian prince, who aſked him, <q>what miracle he ſhewed, that they might believe in him?</q> He anſwered, "cut off my head, and I will live again." To which the prince replied, <q>thou canſt not give us a greater ſign, and if it ſo fall out, that thou doſt riſe again to life after I have cut off thy head, I and all my people, nay, all the world ſure, will believe what thou ſayeſt is true.</q> And preſently the experiment was made. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maned him to be beheaded, and there was an end
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:028262_0233_0FD7F64915BE5478"/>of the cheat. But it was not thus with our bleſſed Lord. He put the credit of all upon this one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle event, and came off with glorious ſucceſs. He told them often he would riſe again on the third day. Accordingly, he did ſo at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; triumphed over the grave, and was declared to be the Son of God with power thereby.</p>
            <p>Now this miracle, and the others ſo wonderfully ſhewn in the miniſtry of Moſes and the prophets, of Chriſt and the apoſtles, are ſuch public autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative vouchers for the perſons concerned, that God acknowledged them, owned them, and ſent them; that their doctrine was true and divine; that nothing can be greater. It may be affirmed of all the reſt, what was ſaid of Jeſus of Nazareth, namely, that <hi>he was a man approved of God by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, wonders, and ſigns, which God did by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible many objections may be and have been raiſed againſt this doctrine; and it is granted, it is not without its difficulties. But as I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to haſten through this ſubject as faſt as poſſible, I muſt not enter upon the conſideration of theſe things, which would not only require more time than I have for them; but it may be, more attention and judgment, than I can promiſe myſelf from the generality of the auditory. In the mean time, I hope none will think this is an evaſion, and that I am willing to paſs over objections, becauſe I know not what to ſay to them. I can truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, I know no difficulty, that may not eaſily be removed; no objection againſt miracles, that doth in the leaſt invalidate, and diſable the argument from them. As an inſtance of this, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now ſtay to examine all the objections, or cavils that are brought in upon this account, I ſhall how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mention the chief and ſtrongeſt of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is objected, that we do not underſtand the extent of created powers; do not ſo well compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028262_0234_0FD7F64A9FD79C80"/>the philoſophy of nature, as to determine what is a miracle, according to the common defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, that is, what is contrary to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe and laws of nature, what can or cannot be done by any finite being, men or angels. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſhould it be granted, that God only can work a miracle, yet if a cheat can do ſuch things, as no ſkill of ours is ſufficient to diſtinguiſh from a real miracle, we are left under the ſame difficulty; a miracle can be no ſatisfactory proof of a divine miſſion: ſince an impoſtor can perform things ſo like miracles, that we know them not from miracles.</p>
            <p>This is the ſtrongeſt objection, that I know, againſt the doctrine, and I have given it in the ſtrongeſt terms. In anſwer to it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I grant, that created beings, evil ſpirits for inſtance, may do a great many ſtrange and ſurpriſing things. We find juglers among men, can by mere legerdemain, perform feats that puzzle the niceſt obſervers. And no queſtion, the devil can do far greater things. He underſtands more ſecrets in nature, than the moſt ſkilful philoſophers or phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians do, the virtues of natural means, and knows when and how to apply them with more advantage; and conſequently may be allowed to perform, what may be to us utterly unaccountable; what we may think above the powers of nature, though it may not be ſo. But then we muſt conſider for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe things are done, in what manner they are done, and what other evidences of divinity go along with them. We are to attend to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of ſuch ſigns and wonders, that we are now ſuppoſing may poſſibly be done by wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and thence make a judgment of them, which we may not be qualified to make, upon the mere contemplation of the facts themſelves. But I add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That no powers but thoſe that were divine, ever performed ſuch things as we have recorded in
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:028262_0235_0FD7F64E8795AE50"/>Scripture. Neither men nor devils ever wrought wonders any thing parallel to the miracles there related, or that deſerve to be compared with them. Suppoſe any could give the color of wine to water, make it look like wine: did ever any turn a great quantity of water into real wine, into the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſort thereof, as our Lord did at the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Cana in Galilee. <hi>Thou haſt kept the good wine till now,</hi> ſaith the governor of the feaſt, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wine to which Chriſt had miraculouſly converted the water. Suppoſing any could by magic, or the devil by his own power, could calm the ſea; yet, who ever knew this done by a word ſpeaking? Suppoſing a perſon of ſkill could open the eyes of the blind; yet to do this as Chriſt did, by clay and ſpittle, is a thing unknown in the world. Who ever attempted to ſpeak a dead man into life, or call him out of his grave? What virtue has a <hi>Lazarus come forth!</hi> to commend back a departed ſpirit, and re-unite it to its b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y? Life cannot be reſtored, but by the author of life; at leaſt we have no inſtances of any power effectual for this purpoſe, but the divine power: nor do we find it was ever delegated to impoſtors, or put forth by evil ſpirits, on any occaſion. Diſeaſes may be cured by natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means, and the proper uſe of medicines. But our Lord cured all ſorts of diſeaſes, and ſome have obſerved, ſuch as were naturally incurable. A learned Phyſician has wrote a book to prove this. And he cured them without medicines, or waiting the leiſure of nature; only by ſpeaking a word: and ſometimes when the patient was at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. How ſurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>zing that, <hi>he ſtood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately ſhe aroſe and miniſtred to them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, how do we know but ſpirits, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels may do as much? I anſwer by aſking another queſtion, whether God deſigned to preſcribe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:028262_0236_0FD7F64F37B46040"/>between created and uncreated power? between his own power and that of his creatures? if not, how ſhould he govern the world? at leaſt, how ſhould he make himſelf known in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, ſince we cannot diſcern his works from thoſe of his creatures? In a word, though I will not take upon me to ſay, how far the power of this or that creature, of angels, good or bad, may go; and to fix the preciſe bounds between the divine power, and that of ſecond cauſes: yet I think it no preſumption to affirm, there are many things creatures cannot do; and that the miracles we have an account of in Scripture, both in the Old and New Teſtament, are of this ſort. They cannot by a rod, or ſtick, ſtop ſtreams of water, and make them ſtand up like a wall. They cannot command water out of a rock; make the ground open and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up a company of men; rebuke fevers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtempers, and make them depart immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They cannot make a man that has been dead four days riſe out of his grave by only calling upon him, and bidding him come forth. They cannot ſay to a cripple, that has been lame from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's womb, riſe and walk, and thereby reſtore him, as Peter did. Theſe and the like works are ſuch inſtances of power, ſuch inroads upon the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed laws and courſe of nature, and ſo much above any capacity that ſecond cauſes are poſſeſſed of, ſo far as we know; that we can aſcribe them to none, but the author of nature, and great Lord of the world. I anſwer once more,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever may be poſſible to created beings, it is certain, they can do nothing without God: and I think it demonſtrable from the divine perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; his wiſdom, truth, goodneſs; that he will never ſuffer them to delude mankind by ſuch works of power, as thoſe recorded in Scripture, employed
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028262_0237_0FD7F65947458AB0"/>to confirm falſehood and lies. Suppoſe Satan and his accomplices could heal the fick, and raiſe the dead; which yet, I am perſuaded, none will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove they can, in the manner that theſe things were performed by Chriſt and his apoſtles. I aſk, for what purpoſe they did this? If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be true, and they hereby meant to eſtabliſh it, it makes them take part againſt themſelves, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Satan as divided againſt Satan, and ruining his own kingdom. If the Scripture be falſe, and they concurred with the writers of it to give credit to their fictions; this muſt be done, at leaſt, by divine permiſſion. It ſuppoſes the great and wiſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the world ſtanding by, and not only ſo, but I think, aſſiſting, every one muſt own permitting; while the devil and wicked men, his inſtruments, abuſed the name of God, and impoſed on mankind in the groſſeſt manner; performing ſuch things as none in the world can diſtinguiſh from the works of God; and yet all is let paſs without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of providence to diſcover the cheat. This I think not conſiſtent with an acknowledgment, that God governs the world, and with thoſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and perfections of his that are inſeparable from his nature and government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is farther objected that impoſtors have wrought miracles, Appollonius Tyanoeus particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and the magicians in Egypt that withſtood Moſes.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, as to the firſt, we have no good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth by the facts alledged. What is related by Philoſtratus is manifeſtly of very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful credit. Beſides, thoſe pretended miracles were few, obſcure, and in no reſpect to be compared with thoſe we have in the Scripture. As to the magicians in Egypt, ſuppoſing they were real mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which yet it is not neceſſary to grant, nor, ſo far as I know, is it neceſſary to deny that they were.
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:028262_0238_0FD7F65CE68A2E30"/>But ſuppoſing they were, they are no diſparagement to the miracles of Moſes, and others in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The caſe I take to be this: there was a trial of ſkill, as I may ſay, between Moſes and theſe men, Moſes works ſeveral miracles before them. God is pleaſed for the proving of Pharaoh, or for other purpoſes and ends known to himſelf, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to do the like: but then, exerts a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power, by his ſervant Moſes, and ſo triumphs over them. He firſt ſent them his power and then withdrew from them, leaving them to manifeſt their weakneſs and fraud. For after the ſpecimens they gave, they were nonpluſſed, and could proceed no farther. So that the iſſue of this conteſt was the defeat of theſe pretenders; their conviction of a divine power with Moſes, and I may add, the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of Moſes's authority. God left the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, ſuppoſing they acted before by his power, continued to aſſiſt and own Moſes; and thereby declared whom he had choſen. And as Moſes was hereby confirmed in his office, and had his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſealed from heaven, ſo it was with the reſt of the writers of Scripture: God bore teſtimony to them by miracles. But I haſten to another point.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God bore teſtimony to the penmen of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to thoſe that were the inſtruments and means of the revelation it contains, by prophecy. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been offered on this head, when I ſpoke of the accompliſhment of Scripture; and I have at preſent only room for ſhort hints. The ſubject is copious and important; but I ſhall confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Any one that converſes with his Bible will ſee how much it runs in a prophetic ſtrain, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with prophecies; and divine providence has ſhewn us the accompliſhment of them: there by proving, I think, the inſpiration I am pleading for. Give me leave to mention a few inſtances out of many.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="unknown:028262_0239_0FD7F65E29CF4AF8"/>
It was propheſied and foretold, that Abraham ſhould become a great nation; that God would multiply his ſeed, even as the <hi>ſtars of heaven,</hi> and as the <hi>duſt of the earth;</hi> as it is expreſſed. And it is to be obſerved, at the time of this aſſurance given him, Abraham had no child, nor had reaſon in an ordinary way to expect any. He being old, and Sarah naturally paſt child-bearing. And yet the word of God took effect, and the prophecy proved a <hi>ſure word of prophecy.</hi> God built him up into a nation, and increaſed his poſterity above any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world, as we are often informed in their hiſtory. The apoſtle gives us this ſummary account of it, Heb. xi. 12. <hi>Therefore ſprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, ſo many as the ſtars of the ſky in multitude, and as the ſand which is by the ſea ſhore, innumerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was propheſied, that the deſcendants of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſhould be ſojourners in a ſtrange land for four hundred years; ſhould live in a ſtate of great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and ſlavery; and that, at the end of that term, God would puniſh their oppreſſors, and work deliverance for them. This was foretold, Gen. xv. and in other places. How it was accompliſhed, you read in the book of Exodus. I will only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that God not only viſited his people, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited their enemies with his judgments, according to his word; but kept day with them: <hi>it came to paſs,</hi> ſays Moſes, <hi>at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the ſelf-ſame day it came to paſs, that all the hoſts of Iſrael went out from the land of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was foretold, that great body of men, the people of Iſrael, whom God had delivered out of Egypt in ſo wonderful a manner, ſhould all of them that were above twenty years old, die in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and none of them, ſave Joſhua and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb, enter the promiſed land; that they ſhould wander in the deſart forty years, and there periſh
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028262_0240_0FD7F65F999F9DB8"/>for their frequent murmurings and rebellions. This was foretold, Num. xiv. the accompliſhment of which you have, chap. xxvi. of the ſame book.</p>
            <p>Jacob foretold the ſettlement of the tribes in the promiſed land, and in a prophetic map, as I may call it, repreſented their ſeveral conditions there; where they ſhould be fixed; what their ſtate ſhould be; and what changes they ſhould undergo. This you have, Gen. xlix. and the accompliſhment of it in their after hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the children of Iſrael in Canaan, their ſucceſs, and all manner of proſperity, whilſt they continued obedient; their puniſhment, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent captivities and final deſtruction, upon their apoſtacy. This was foretold in the moſt exact manner, and was accompliſhed with the like exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as might be ſhewn had I time to enquire into theſe things. You have the prediction, Lev. xxvi. Deut. xxviii. and other places: and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it in the conſtant courſe of Providence towards that people afterwards.</p>
            <p>As their captivity, ſo their return from captivity, with the time and circumſtances thereof, was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told: that God would deliver them up into the hands of their enemies for their ſins, and afterwards bring them back and reſtore them. All this was propheſied of, over and over again, and every word of it fulfilled.</p>
            <p>The riſe, continuance and fall of the four fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous monarchies, the Aſſyrian, Medo-Perſian, Grecian and Roman, was exactly foretold by Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; the heads of theſe monarchies deſcribed, and the great events and revolutions under them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, as if the prophet had been an hiſtorian, and had written after the things were come to paſs.</p>
            <p>A great many things were foretold concerning particular perſons, which were verified in the even. Thus Joſiah was propheſied of by name
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:028262_0241_0FD7F66115BD00A0"/>above three hundred years before he was born, that he ſhould execute the judgment of God upon the altar at Bethel, which Jeroboam had ſet up, and upon the prieſts that officiated there, 1 Kings xiii. 2. This was fulfilled, as you ſee, 2 Kings xxiii. 15. Cyrus was propheſied of by name above a hundred years before he was born, as the perſon that ſhould reſtore the Jews and rebuild the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Iſa. xliv. 28. There are a great many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and unlikely things in this prophecy; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all the reſt, could I here enquire into them: as, that his birth ſhould be foretold ſo long before; his name given him; that he ſhould conquer ſo potent a monarchy as that of Babylon; and that though an heathen, he ſhould favor and reſtore a religion his predeceſſors had ſet themſelves to cruſh and ruin. This could proceed only from him that knows all things, and to whom future things are preſent.</p>
            <p>We have a glorious collection of prophecies concerning the Meſſiah; the illuſtrating of which would more than require a diſcourſe by itſelf, and fully prove what is ſaid, that the <hi>teſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of prophecy.</hi> It was foretold of him, that he ſhould be the ſeed of a woman, born of a virgin, which was accordingly fulfilled: that he ſhould be the ſeed of Abraham and of David, born at Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem, and brought out of Egypt. In ſhort, moſt of the circumſtances of his life, his ſufferings, his death and reſurrection, the oppoſition he would meet with, the ſucceſs of his doctrine, and the like, were foretold: every iota and tittle of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions was accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>I add, Chriſt and his apoſtles were diſtinguiſhed with the ſame ſpirit of prophecy, and foretold a great many wonderful events, which the chriſtian church has ſeen take place in the way and manner deſcribed. Thus Chriſt foretold his own death
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:028262_0242_0FD7F665A7C3D328"/>with the circumſtances thereof; that all his diſciples ſhould forſake him; that one of them ſhould betray him: and this he ſignified when none of them had any ſuſpicion concerning the traitor; nor the traitor, it is likely, any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion concerning himſelf. He foretold the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his death, and his reſurrection, with the time of it. He foretold that thoſe who believed in his name, ſhould work miracles, ſpeak with tongues, heal diſeaſes, and caſt out devils. How punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this was accompliſhed, the hiſtory of the New-Teſtament, and the moſt primitive writings of the church inform us. Nor were theſe extraordinary gifts confined to the apoſtolical ages; but were common in the ages next ſucceeding. <q>To reſtore to health, ſays Irenaeus,* by impoſition of hands, to cure the weak, the lame and paralitic, and thoſe that labor under any other malady, is a thing frequent in the church.</q> To the ſame purpoſe Origen.† <q>We have ſeen, ſaith he, people freed from a thouſand dreadful ſymptoms and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, from which neither men nor devils could recover them, by the invocation of Chriſt's name.</q> And for the caſting out of devils, the fathers over and over again mention it in their apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, as a thing confeſſed by their adverſaries. They appeal to their conſciences and knowledge, and tell them that many hundreds were ſtill living of their own ſuperſtition as well as chriſtian proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, who by their perſonal experience could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it.</p>
            <p>Chriſt foretold the preaching of his doctrine through the world, that there ſhould ariſe falſe prophets, and falſe Chriſts, that ſhould come in his name and deceive many, which accordingly was fulfilled. He foretold the deſtruction of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028262_0243_0FD7F66F518C7A38"/>and the temple; the ſigns and prodigies that ſhould go before it, the calamities that ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it; and that the deſtruction ſhould be total and final; that there ſhould not be leſt one ſtone upon another that ſhould not be thrown down; that Jeruſalem ſhould be trodden down, and the Jews led captives into all nations. How this has been fulfilled the world has ſeen. And was I not now in haſte to get through the ſubject, it would be no ſmall pleaſure to ſhew you the exact parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the prophecy and providence, the prediction and the event. I ſhall only obſerve, that the Jews have often attempted to rebuild their temple, though in vain. The laſt attempt was by Julian the apoſtate, who out of ſpite to Chriſt, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the prediction, gave orders for rebuilding it; but was baffled by the immediate hand of heaven. The ſtory is related by ſeveral, particularly by Ammianus Marcellinus, an heathen who lived at that time. He tells us, that Julian endeavored to rebuild the temple at Jeruſalem, and gave it in charge to one Aliprius of Antioch, aſſiſted by the governor of the province, and a vaſt treaſure by the Emperor to haſten and promote the work. But, he adds, they were ſoon forced to deſiſt from the enterpriſe, by balls of fire iſſuing from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which terrified and deſtroyed the perſons employed therein. So much authority was there in theſe prophecies, that God would not ſuffer men or devils to interpoſe and ſlur them, or by any acts and powers of theirs, hinder their accompliſhment. And how ſtrong an argument is this of the divine miſſion and inſpiration of the perſons by whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry we have the Scripture doctrine and revelation. They had the ſeal of miracles as you have heard, and the ſeal of prophecy, a demonſtration that God was with them, and had ſent them. In the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he lent them his power, in the other his
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:028262_0244_0FD7F671DA349288"/>knowledge: neither of which he would have hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored impoſtors and cheats with.</p>
            <p>Let me farther remark, that the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy that runs through the Scripture concerns generally ſuch things, ſuch events, as depended wholly upon the will of God, and the will of free agents, which could not be known at that diſtance by any but God himſelf, and thoſe to whom he was pleaſed to reveal them. Who could foretel, for inſtance, that there ſhould be a man born called Cyrus, ſo long beforehand? that he ſhould conquer Babylon, that he ſhould have it in his heart to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore the Jews and rebuild their city? There were no natural cauſes then exiſting of ſuch an event: nor could any foreſee it but the infinite all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending mind, who has the whole tract of time and ſeries of events under his eye at once, and to whom all his works are known from the beginning to the end. In ſhort, to foretel future events is the prerogative of God. Hence we find him triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over idols upon this account; <hi>Let them ſhew us what ſhall happen,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhew the former things what they be, and ſhew the things that are to come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that we may know that ye are Gods.</hi> Intimating, that to be able to foreſee and poſitively declare events and occurrences of things merely contingent, that depend on the will of man, or the pleaſure of God; to declare theſe at a great diſtance of time before they come to paſs, argues divinity, or at leaſt, ſpecial communion with and inſtruction from the divine mind, who from his throne views and takes a proſpect of all time, and has all events placed in order before him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not now conſider the objections that may be offered from diviners, the heathen oracles, and the like. It is known there was ſo much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in their anſwers, as very much diſgraced them
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:028262_0245_0FD7F67382AB78C0"/>even with their votaries, and occaſioned the giving the nickname of "crooked ſpeaker," unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils that preſided in their oracles. It is true the devil and his prophets endeavoured to imitate God and his prophets. But the whole hiſtory of their management ſhews, they kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> no ſecrets, but what he was pleaſed to inſtruct them with, for the trial and puniſhment of mankind. And after all their pretences, the events frequently blaſted their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. I think I may therefore with great ſafety and aſſurance conclude, that <hi>the teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> and indeed the proof of the Scripture's divinity and inſpiration, is the <hi>ſpirit of prophecy.</hi>

            <p>I AM arguing the divinity or inſpiration of the Scripture from the teſtimony that God gave to the penmen thereof. I have already conſidered the two remarkable inſtances of miracles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and now go on to another particular.</p>
            <p n="3">III. God bore teſtimony to the writers of the Bible by the ſpreading of their doctrine, and the mighty ſucceſs it had in the world. I muſt here premiſe, that it is the chriſtian religion, or doctrine of the New Teſtament, that this argument chiefly reſpects. The revelation God made to the Jews was very much confined to themſelves. Not that others were wholly excluded. They admitted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, and taught their religion to them. But there was not that general communication made to the world, as after the coming of Chriſt. When the partition-wall was broken down, and the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure God ſet about his ancient people was laid open. The apoſtles had a commiſſion in the largeſt terms to go and preach the goſpel to every creature, and proſelyte all nations. God deſigned the revelation, he made to the world by the miniſtry of Chriſt and
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:028262_0247_0FD7F676D80A24F0"/>the apoſtles, ſhould be univerſal for the uſe of all mankind that would receive it. And it is this part of the divine revelation that my preſent argument peculiarly relates to, the ſucceſs and ſpreading of the goſpel, the doctrine and religion of the New-Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Though I may further premiſe, that if the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from hence be good with reſpect to one part, it doth by conſequence prove the whole Scripture to be divine. For the New Teſtament confirms the Old, as I obſerved before. If Chriſt and his apoſtles were ſent of God, it is certain Moſes and the prophets were ſo too; for the former bear teſtimony to the latter. Let me add, I do not lay the ſtreſs of the argument upon the mere ſpreading of their doctrine, but on the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it. Having premiſed theſe things, I ſhall ſet the argument before you in a few particulars without enlargement.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a certain and known thing that the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion had the moſt ſurpriſing ſucceſs when firſt preached, and was ſpread through a great part of the world in a little time. This appears from the ancient mounuments of the church; from the teſtimony of friends, and acknowledgment of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Tertullian tells the Roman ſenate, that though the chriſtians were but of yeſterday, yet they had filled all places and offices, that they were ſtrong enough to maſter the Roman empire; nay, that ſo great were their numbers, that if they ſhould but agree to retire out of it, the world would wonder at its own ſolitude. And in his book againſt the Jews, he ſays, <q>the chriſtian religion had enlarged its conqueſts beyond thoſe of the Roman empire, and had ſubdued thoſe places that were inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their armies.</q> Pliny takes notice in his letter to the emperor concerning the chriſtians, that <q>there were ſuch multitudes of them, that the
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:028262_0248_0FD7F67B259F4960"/>temples and ſacrifices of the gods were almoſt forſaken.</q> Tacitus ſpeaks of an immenſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, even in Nero's time, the very firſt age of chriſtianity. In ſhort, the prevalency of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion was ſuch, that it gave occaſion to the heathens to call it, "the powerful and prevailing ſect." Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Did it prevail among the vulgar only, but among the moſt inquiſitive and learned. All ſorts of perſons, Jews, Gentiles, the ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught, and even the greateſt philoſophers, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced chriſtianity. Indeed, its ſucceſs then, and ever after, has been moſtly with perſons of a lower ſtation in the world. But there have always been ſome of the greateſt name that have owned and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed it. It was ſo, particularly, at the firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. I might give a large catalogue of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and men of ſame for learning that came into the church, and employed all their abilities in the ſervice of the chriſtian cauſe. Juſtin Martyr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he became a diſciple of Chriſt, was converſant with all the ſects of the philoſophers, and was at laſt a zealous Platoniſt; but left all to follow Jeſus, and upon his acquaintance with the doctrine of Chriſt, profeſſes, that he ſound that to be the only ſure and profitable philoſophy. Origen, another father in the chriſtian church, was in ſo great fame for his learning, that even after he profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a chriſtian, many of the philoſophers attended his lectures at Alexandria, and ſome of them dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated their books to him. It is ſaid of Flotinus, a famous Platoniſt, that while he was reading lectures, diſcovering Origen among his auditors, he bluſhed and was daſhed with ſo great a preſence, ſo as to break off abruptly. I might inſtance in a great many more of conſiderable reputation for their learning; but I forbear. All that I mention theſe things for, is to obſerve to you, that as the chriſtian
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:028262_0249_0FD7F67C565EB328"/>religion was propagated through the world in a little time, ſo ſome of the greateſt men, perſons of the higheſt name for wiſdom and knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came proſelytes to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſucceſs that attended the goſpel in its firſt publication was the more remarkable and glorious, I might ſay, divine, on the account of the mighty difficulties it had to encounter, and which it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted. Had I time to purſue this argument, and to illuſtrate it with ſuch particulars, as might be inſiſted upon, it would amount to a ſort of a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that the chriſtian religion is of God. For inſtance, to give a few hints, it had the ſtrongeſt prejudices of mankind, of Jews and Gentiles, to overcome.</p>
            <p>Among other prejudices among the Jews, there were three that ſtood directly in the way of the goſpel, and that were ſo deeply rooted that I cannot ſee any power, leſs than divine, could ever have conquered them.</p>
            <p>One of them was, that the Meſſiah ſhould appear with the character of a ſovereign earthly prince, whoſe buſineſs it was to deliver them from their enemies, reſtore the kingdom of David at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and there reign in great ſplendor and power over the houſe of Iſrael; the reſt of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a great meaſure ſubject to their nation. This was the notion they had formed to themſelves of their Meſſiah and it ſtill poſſeſſes their minds, as Maimonides, one of their own rabbies, informs us.</p>
            <p>It was another of their prejudices, that their law ſhould abide for ever; that the Meſſiah ſhould be ſo far from abrogating, that he ſhould eſtabliſh it; and that the glory of his kingdom ſhould chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt in the exact performance of the legal worſhip. The forementioned Maimonides, tells us this ſhall belong to his office, whenever he comes; to rebuild the temple, and gather the diſperſed of
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:028262_0250_0FD7DADD31475B40"/>Iſrael; to re-eſtabliſh the legal rites and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to reſtore ſacrifices, the ſabbatical years and jubilees, according to every precept delivered in the law.</p>
            <p>It was alſo an opinion among them, that had got hold of every mind, that the Jews only ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the bleſſings of the Meſſiah's kingdom. The Gentiles they accounted as dogs, unholy and unclean; and we find in a multitude of places in the New Teſtament, they could not bear the thoughts of their calling and admiſſion to an equal ſtate and equal priviledges with themſelves.</p>
            <p>As for the heathens, they had prejudices too many to be here enumerated; and which were like mountains in the way of the chriſtian religion. The gods they worſhipped in this or that country, the rites with which they worſhipped them, and all the forms of their religion were become venerable with them by a pretended antiquity. And ſo much were they inſlaved to antiquity and tradition, that even the famous Tully<note n="*" place="bottom">Do Natura Deorum; l. 3.</note> introduces Cotta as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plea thereof ſufficient to ſupply the want of all other arguments, and to give a ſanction to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that had obtained among them; <hi>this alone will be ſufficient for me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that our fore-fathers have thus handed it down to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will only obſerve, beſides the influence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation and cuſtom, and the ſlaviſh ſubjection, that hereby they were brought into, to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; there were two things in it, that gave it a full poſſeſſion of their hearts. It was pompous, and had a glorious exterior, and was calculated to gratify their fleſhly inclinations.</p>
            <p>Now let it be conſidered that before chriſtianity could get any footing in the world, all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices muſt be removed. The Jews muſt quit
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:028262_0251_0FD7F684D8223130"/>their darling notions of a temporal Meſſiah, and believe in a crucified Saviour: the pagans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the gods of their countries, the eſtabliſhed rites of their religion; the maxims they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by tradition from their fathers; and which was a further difficulty, renounce their beloved luſts. Upon theſe terms chriſtianity was preached to the world, and with all theſe diſadvantages did it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail and triumph.</p>
            <p>I might ſhew, that it had, not only the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mankind againſt it, but human laws, and all the power and learning of the world. The <hi>kings of the earth and rulers</hi> of the people <hi>ſet themſelves againſt the Lord and againſt his Anointed.</hi> The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then philoſophers, the Jewiſh doctors, with all the authority of the greateſt emperors, were united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and chriſtianity, and yet it prevails, thouſands and myriads bow the knee to the holy Jeſus, and profeſs themſelves the diſciples of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified maſter. I am perſuaded you will not put me upon proving there muſt be the finger of God in this ſucceſs. Let me obſerve again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The doctrine of the goſpel in itſelf had a great deal in it to incumber it, and obſtruct its ſucceſs. It was built upon the utter ruin of the heathen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; declared the Jewiſh religion void and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated, and decently laid it in its grave. It o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturns all the forms of idolatry and ſuperſtition the world was ſo fond of; calls from pageantry to ſimplicity; and from looſeneſs and fleſhly indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the greateſt ſtrictneſs and purity. Some of its doctrines were not a little ſhocking to the reaſon of mankind, as it was at that time trained up, and blinded by inveterate prejudices. As for inſtance, ſalvation by a crucified chriſt; this was the great fundamental point of the goſpel, and we know what entertainment it met with in the world: it was <hi>to the Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> a ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>bling-block, and to the Greeks
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:028262_0252_0FD7F6894C741858"/>fooliſhneſs.</hi> Pardon of ſin, juſtification and life, by the death and righteouſneſs of another perſon, the reſurrection of the body, &amp;c. To ſay nothing of the duties preſcribed in the chriſtian religion, as humility, meekneſs, ſelf-denial, forgiving and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemies, and the like: theſe were things that lay croſs in the minds of men, moſt oppoſite to the great maxims of wiſdom eſtabliſhed among the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and promiſed no kind reception to the goſpel.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be remarked here, that inſtead of honors, preferment, and temporal advantages; it ever ſpeaks of contempt, ſufferings and perſecution, as the lot and portion of them that embrace it. Now, that ſuch a doctrine as this ſhould obtain in the world, bear down all oppoſition, gain proſelytes without number among both Jews and Gentiles, is an event that, I think, it is impoſſible to account for without having recourſe to a divine hand. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if I add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the inſtruments of this great work were low, mean, and contemptible perſons. You know the character of the apoſtles, and I need not inſiſt upon it. The founder of our religion ſent forth not twelve princes or philoſophers, but twelve fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen; men deſtitute of all human advantages, void of learning, arts, language, reputation, power, and authority: theſe receive a commiſſion from him. And what was it to do? why, to teach all nations and convert the world. Now you will pleaſe to remember what your Bible tells you, and what is confirmed by the moſt authentic records of the church, that theſe perſons went forth, twelve poor fiſhermen, preaching the goſpel in the name of Chriſt. And in a few years they overturn Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's empire, ſilence his oracles, baffle all the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of the heathens, and cavils of the Jews;
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:028262_0253_0FD7F68AEA73A148"/>and ſubdue a great part of the world to their Lord and maſter. I leave every one to make the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from hence which I deſign, viz. that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, that it was his doctrine they publiſhed, that he ſent them, and was with them. The whole hiſtory of their proceedings, I think, demonſtrates this.</p>
            <p>Two things are evident concerning them, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more, viz. that they had a ſupernatural cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, otherwiſe they would not have undertaken the work. Suppoſe twelve mechanics, among us, ſhould now be ſent by any to go into Turky or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and convert the Mahometans, can we imagine that men in their ſenſes would engage in ſuch an enterpriſe? they might object they wanted ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they wanted a guard to ſecure them from danger; they could not ſpeak the language of the country; nor was it likely they ſhould have any other reception, but to be inſulted and ſacrificed for their impertinency. The like objections might riſe in the minds of the firſt preachers of the goſpel, had they not known they were called of God; had they not received power and courage from on high. Nor would they have perſiſted in their enterpriſe, as they did, through all ſorts of terrors and deaths, had not God been with them, and ſtood by them, ſtrengthening them <hi>by his ſpirit, with might in the inner man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, it is evident, had not God ſent them, and owned them, they could never have ſucceeded in the manner they did, and under the difficulties they met with. So that I reckon I may conclude with good authority, that the ſucceſs of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion is a ſtrong argument, that it is divine. And if ſo, the Scriptures muſt have a divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible it may be objected, that the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mahomet has ſpread over a great part of
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:028262_0254_0FD7F68BF066B388"/>the world. But I ſhall eaſily ſhew this does not at all weaken the force of my argument. The caſe of the one is no way parallel with the other. Though, as I determine now to conclude the proofs I deſign to mention of the inſpiration of the Bible, I ſhall defer the conſideration of this objection taken from the ſpreading of Mahometaniſm, till I ſpeak to the objections in general; and haſten to another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. God bore teſtimony to the writers of the Scripture, by the glorious effects thereof upon the hearts of men, in their conſtant ſanctification. This is a ſtanding proof of the truth of chriſtianity, and indeed of the truth and divinity of the Bible. And as it is an argument that every chriſtian, ho un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful and unlearned ſoever he may be, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and which he carries in his own breaſt, it well deſerves to be diſtinctly conſidered. I ſhall only at preſent take notice, that the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wherever it came and was heartily embraced, wrought a very glorious change. As it teaches to deny ungodlineſs, and wordly luſts, and to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly and godly in the world; preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt exact rules of holy living. So it was attended with an inward power and efficacy; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the minds of men to a conformity to thoſe rules. This was eminently ſeen in the firſt ages of the goſpel <q>ſhew me a drunkard, ſays one of the fathers, ſhew me a paſſionate man, one that is luſtful; and with a few words of God, I will make him ſober, calm, temperate, chaſte, &amp;c.</q> Such was the divine energy and virtue that generally went along with the goſpel at that time. And though we have reaſon to lament it, that the word of God has not ſo ſenſible, and viſible an effect upon thoſe that profeſs chriſtianity now, as it ſeems then it had; yet ſtill the goſpel of Chriſt is the <hi>power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth.</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="unknown:028262_0255_0FD7F68DA98D67C8"/>God ſtill owns it as his inſtrument in renewing the minds of men; and thereby gives teſtimony to his word. But as this is a teſtimony of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and what tends not a little to confirm chriſtians of every ſort in the behalf of their Bible, I ſhall reſume it upon another occaſion; and therefore now diſmiſs it without any farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more I ſhall ſubjoin, as the laſt argument I intend to offer of the inſpiration of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That all this evidence is ſtrengthened and confirmed by the groſs abſurdities that attend the ſcheme of unbelievers, who deny the truth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Bible. They alledge and object difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in believing the Scripture; and yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves believe againſt Scripture with far more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in their way. This might be ſhewn in a great many inſtances. I ſhall mention and touch upon a few. As,</p>
            <p>That God notwithſtanding, the confeſſed bounty and goodneſs of his nature, and his gracious and merciful inclinations towards mankind; ſhould yet ſuffer them to remain under their preſent darkneſs, ignorance, and prejudices, without affording them any ſupernatural revelation. That mankind need a revelation from heaven, I have at large proved. I have proved, that if the Bible be not that revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is no ſuch thing in the world. So that this is one abſurdity that attends their ſcheme, who reject the authority of the Scriptures, that God has given no revelation of himſelf to the world.</p>
            <p>Another is, that a book ſhould be offered to mankind, atteſted in ſuch a manner as the Bible is, ſo full of ſtrong evidence, and yet be falſe.</p>
            <p>Again, That ſo great a part of the world, the wiſeſt and beſt part of the world, ſhould he under a deluſion for ſo many ages; embracing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:028262_0256_0FD7F69020740B60"/>as a revelation from God, when it is a mere impoſture, and yet the cheat never be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>That the perſons concerned in delivering to us the doctrines of the Bible, ſhould impoſe upon us by known deſigned juggle and impoſture; and that without any proſpect of advantage to themſelves. This is to make them guilty of the greateſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, the vileſt iniquity upon no motive, but to be undone in this world, as they found would be their caſe, and undone in the next, ſuppoſing they believed any thing of another world.</p>
            <p>Farther, that ſo many impoſtors and cheats ſhould unite in the ſame black and horried deſigns; invent lies and impoſe them upon the world in the name of God; and that none of them ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and diſcover the fraud, that neither the love of life, nor the terrors of a violent death, which was the lot of many of them, even on the account of their religion, ſhould have any influence upon them to make them confeſs the truth; but that they ſhould perſiſt in their teſtimony concerning their doctrine, and their miſſion to the laſt.</p>
            <p>And that ſuch wicked men as the perſons I am now ſpeaking of, the unbelievers, muſt ſuppoſe them to be, ſhould with ſuch an evil conſcience ſet themſelves to do the greateſt good; I mean, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the moſt excellent doctrine to the world, that has the higheſt tendency to promote the honour of God, and the happineſs of mankind. Certainly had they been knaves, they would have dealt in other matters, and have appeared in a different form; have flattered mankind, and have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to recommend themſelves to their favour. In ſhort, according to the fancy of our unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, here are a company of the worſt of men in the world, doing the greateſt good in the world; and that with a certain proſpect of bringing upon
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028262_0257_0FD7F69114E503A8"/>themſelves the greateſt preſent evils and ſufferings. Can any believe this without infatuation?</p>
            <p>Again, That theſe deceivers and cheats ſhould be able without any human advantages of learning, ſubtilty or ſecular power to perſuade ſo great a part of mankind to believe their fables; and upon terms of ſelf-denial and ſufferings, embrace the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and ſtories they had invented on their own heads.</p>
            <p>That all the experience that thouſands and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſober, grave, and wiſe men have had of the truth and divinity of the Scripture; of its power to convince, reform, and change mankind; to comfort in their greateſt diſtreſſes, to direct and guide in doubts and difficulties, &amp;c. ſhould all be mere deluſion.</p>
            <p>That there ſhould be a ſovereign, wiſe, and good God, the conſtant governor of this world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector of human affairs; and that he ſhould ſtand by and ſee ſo great, ſo plauſible an impoſture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail among mankind, and never interpoſe for its defeat; but inſtead thereof, by ſtrange, ſurpriſing providences, give open countenance to it.</p>
            <p>I add, That the Bible ſhould be falſe, and yet the diſcovery of this remain the ſpecial, peculiar attainment and priviledge of perſons of our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers character. This, I think unaccountable, and know not why I may not number it among the abſurdities that affect their ſcheme. I would not aggravate matters here. But I think it evident, they do not reject the Bible becauſe they approve of an higher and more excellent ſcheme of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe they have ſomething better to advance in the room of the Bible. It is generally ſuſpected concerning them, they had beſt ſee upon what principles they go that they quarrel with the Bible, becauſe it quarrels with them, would diſturb their pleaſures, and abridge them of their liberties.
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028262_0258_0FD7F69D9C1EF598"/>And that theſe ſhould be the only men favoured with the judgment and taſte to diſtinguiſh things, or that have the greateſt ſhare of honeſty to profeſs and own the truth, is ſome what ſtrange, and the belief of it, I perfume, not a little abſurd.</p>
            <p>Well, theſe are ſome of the difficulties that clogg the unbeliever's ſcheme. Whether they do not amount to abſurdides, I leave it to be conſidered. If they do, it will be allowed, they ſerve the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I mention them for, confirm the authority of the Bible, and aſſiſt and ſtrengthen the concluſion I have been drawing from ſundry topics and heads of argument, namely, that <hi>the Scripture is given by inſpiration of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have not only ſhewn that the Scripture is true; but that it is inſpired, and of divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; which are two of the points I undertook to prove. It remains,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That I vindicate the cannon of Scripture, or prove, that the preſent books of our Bible are the originally inſpired books of Scripture. And for the clearer proceeding in this matter, I ſhall,
<list>
                  <item>1. Premiſe a few things for ſtating the point about the canon of Scripture.</item>
                  <item>2. Prove that we have the original inſpired books in our canon, or catalogue of ſacred books of Scripture: and then,</item>
                  <item>3. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſome queſtions, or objections, with reference hereto.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall premiſe a few things for ſtating the point about the canon of Scripture, and to give you ſome clear notions of the matter. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When I ſay the books of our preſent Bible are the original inſpired books of Scripture, I do not mean they are the autographs, or the very books in the hand writing of the inſpired authors. It may indeed be queſtioned, whether there were any great number of them together in this ſenſe? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moſes at firſt wrote the five books, that were
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028262_0259_0FD7F69FD84CA460"/>delivered to the Jews, with his own hand? or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prophets and apoſtles wrote, with their own hands, all the ſacred volumes, the church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them, and in their name. They might employ amanuenſes, ſome to write from their mouths. This ſeems particularly to have been the caſe of the apoſtle Paul, and it might be ſo of others; as appears from 2 Theſſ. iii. 17. <hi>The ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epiſtle, ſo I write:</hi> intimating, that he uſed to employ others to write the epiſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ordinarily, at leaſt, that he ſent to the churches: he dictated, and they wrote: and then he added with his own hand the ſalutation, which was a token and ſign that the epiſtle was from him, and that he owned it. And this, I ſay, might be the caſe of the other ſacred penmen. But however that be, whether they wrote themſelves, or others from them, we do not now pretend to have the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral firſt original volumes, or any of them. The individual ink and parchment, with, and on which they wrote, could not be preſerved to our time without a miracle. As to the original book of Moſes, or the Pentatcuch, we find it was, by the ſpecial appointment of God, laid up by the ſide of the ark, Deut. xxxi. 25, 26. The text adds, <hi>that it may be there for a witneſs againſt thee.</hi> It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited there as a public authentic record, that if any ſhould attempt to corrupt the law, this divine copy might be produced againſt them. Some think it remained by the ark till the deſtruction of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, but after that, it is in vain to enquire further about it. As to the reſt of the inſpired books, I mean, in their firſt and original manuſcripts, we know leſs of them; how long they were preſerved, or when they periſhed. What we pretend to is, that they were wrote out for the uſe of the church in their reſpective ages, and communicated in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:028262_0260_0FD7F6A0D9C0DD70"/>copies from one generation to another. But as to the original or firſt books, they are long ſince periſhed and loſt. Nor could it be otherwiſe, as I ſaid, without a miracle. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would premiſe, that I do not ſuppoſe the copies we have of the firſt original books are ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect that there is not the leaſt error therein. This is what can be ſaid of no ancient book in the world. Tully complains of the Latin authors, that they were publiſhed with many blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and miſtakes in his time: and the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint has been made of all others, whether Latin or Greek hiſtorians, poets, and philoſophers. And though more may be ſaid in behalf of the ſacred books, than of any of the reſt; yet it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant to aſſert, they are brought down to us free of all miſtakes. It is but about three hundred years ſince printing was ſound out: and before that time they were tranſcribed, I may ſay, almoſt an infinite number of times. And I think it not poſſible in an ordinary way, and without inſpiration, that there ſhould be no errors in the ſeveral copies. The ignorance, haſte, careleſneſs, &amp;c. of tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers would probably betray them into miſtakes. And we find in fact, that there is ſome difference, there are ſome various readings, even among the moſt ancient and authentic copies. But then I have two things to add, viz. that we have reaſon to conclude, that the miſtakes would not be many, and that they would not be great. They would not be many. The high importance of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would excite more than common care. The church in every age received thoſe writings as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and had a mighty veneration for the contents of them: and, conſequently would be watchful over them that they might not be corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved. And as God deſigned them for the uſe
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:028262_0261_0FD7F6A257199AD0"/>of the church in all ages, one cannot but expect a ſpecial ſuperintendency of providence over them. So that we have reaſon, I ſay, to think the errors would not be many. And I ſubjoin, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they would not be great. It is certain, they are not in matters of any great importance. All ancient copies agree in every article and doctrine of religion. And what various readings there are, are only in things of leſs weight, in which the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith and religion is not much concerned. And even here the ſkilful critic is able, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the ſeveral copies, to diſcover which is the true and genuine reading. Often it may be done; and where it is otherwiſe, and it yet remains uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which copy is the true reading, which is moſt likely to be the original inſpired text, it is in ſuch minute matters that religion runs no hazards, ſuffers no damage: all copies agreeing not only in the eſſentials, but even in the ſubſtance and all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant circumſtances of divine doctrines and hiſtories of fact.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I do not know that it is neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all that was ever written by inſpired men, is preſerved and contained in our Bible. This, I am ſenſible, is a controverſy of ſome difficulty. But as I do not think it proper for the auditory, I ſhall not trouble you with it. Some have thought the Bible mentions ſeveral ſacred pieces, which we have not, as the <hi>three thouſand</hi> parables or proverbs of Solomon, and the <hi>thouſand and five ſongs;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his books of natural philoſophy; for we are told, that he <hi>ſpake of trees, from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyſſop that ſpringeth out of the wall. He ſpake alſo of beaſts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fiſhes.</hi> Theſe they think might be inſpired books, but now are loſt. As alſo the books of Nathan the prophet, and of Gad the ſeer, mentioned 1 Chron. xxix. 29. The
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:028262_0262_0FD7F6A67A3F9B18"/>prophecies of Ahijah the ſhalonite, the viſions of Iddo the ſeer, 2 Chron. ix. 29. The book of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher, Joſh. x. 13. To which ſome have added ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral goſpels whoſe names occur in the primitive writers: and the epiſtle to the Laodiceans, ſpoken of Col. iv. 16. as they would underſtand the text. Theſe they think were the works of inſpired men; but by ſome means or other now loſt.</p>
            <p>But others are of a different mind, and think none of theſe writings were inſpired. However, I ſhall paſs over this debate, and the arguments produced on the one ſide, or the other, for the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing their different opinions. In the mean while, I do not think it any prejudice to religion to ſuppoſe, though we have no ſufficient evidence of the fact, that there might be ſome divine writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſome narrations, or goſpels, for inſtance, and ſome epiſtles, drawn up by inſpired men that are not included in our canon, or catalogue of ſacred books. The apoſtles had their diſtinct provinces, were diſperſed through a great part of the world to ſpread the chriſtian religion, they could not ſtay long in a place, and it is not improbable they might all of them, or moſt of them, leave abſtracts of their doctrine behind them in the places where they had been; and when they took leave of the churches they had gathered, being called elſewhere. Now ſhould it be granted, there might have been more of theſe than are now come to us, this is neither an argument againſt the authority of the books we have, nor againſt their ſufficiency. There were many more things that Jeſus did, than thoſe the evangeliſts have written, as St. John tells us. And no doubt there were many diſcourſes he delivered, many ſermons of his apoſtles, which they delivered by inſpiration, that were not recorded. And ſome that were occaſionally written, which anſwered the end for which they were publiſhed; and yet not
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:028262_0263_0FD7F6B2AE5724D8"/>being intended for general and univerſal uſe, are not preſerved and continued in the church. This may be granted without any diſadvantage to the authority, or ſufficiency of our Bible. Though, as I ſaid, we have no certainty of it, and it is more than can be proved. Hereupon,</p>
            <p n="4">4. What I intend, when I ſay, that the books of our Bible are the original inſpired books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is in ſhort this; that the books we now have and embrace as inſpired, are thoſe that the church of Chriſt has all along owned as ſuch, and received into the canon, or catalogue of ſacred Scriptures. It has received all theſe books as inſpired, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived none elſe. And further, that they have come down to us in the main uncorrupt. None of thoſe that were once admitted into the canon are loſt; and none of them corrupted in any points of conſequence, or importance. Let me add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſacred canon, 'or catalogue of inſpired books, was not compoſed and finiſhed at once; but gradually, and at different times. This may be affirmed with reſpect both to the Old Teſtament and the New. The books of the Old Teſtament were delivered to the church at diverſe times; firſt the decalogue, or ten commandments; the two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles wrote by the finger of God, with the other laws revealed on mount Sinai; and afterwards the whole pentateuch, or five books of Moſes. When and where Moſes wrote theſe, with other queſtions of the like nature I paſs over, and ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the firſt and original book of the law was laid up in a cheſt or coffer, as is ſuppoſed, by the ſide of the ark, and kept there as the ſacred ſtandard of their religion under that diſpenſation: copies of it being diſperſed among the people. And this was the firſt part of the ſcripture canon. The other books of the Old Teſtament were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded afterwards, as they were occaſionally written;
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:028262_0264_0FD7F6B46CA67350"/>the perſons that tendered them to the church having firſt given ſatisfaction concerning their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. How this was done, is a queſtion of too great nicety, now to be conſidered and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Sometimes, it is likely, they came with the power of miracles; ſometimes the perſons, that offered any revelation to be received by the church, were eſtabliſhed and known prophets; or they had the teſtimony of allowed and approved prophets. They ſpake in the name of God, and brought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient credentials with them: God giving teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to them in a ſupernatural way that he ſent them, and that their meſſage was divine. Let me only obſerve farther, with reference to the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is probable the canon of it was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled: all the books of it reduced into one volume, and delivered to the church after the captivity. This is the common opinion of learned men, and they make it the work of the great ſynagogue, as it is called, in which were preſent Ezra, Haggai, Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary, Malachi, Nehemiah, and Zerubbabel. Theſe collected all the inſpired books, ſuch as were written during the captivity, as well as before, and committed them to the care of the church.</p>
            <p>The like obſervations might be made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the canon of the New Teſtament. It was at firſt publiſhed to the world, by Chriſt and the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in their ſermons, before any part of it was committed to writing. Nor was it written all at once, but gradually ſome at one time, and ſome at another; in what order, and way. I am not now to enquire. I would only ſuggeſt, that as ſeveral perſons were extraordinarily called to preach the goſpel and publiſh the doctrines of it to the world; ſo ſome of thoſe were ſtirred up to write for the uſe and ſervice of the church, at different times, as it pleaſed God by his ſpirit to direct them. It is ſuppoſed the goſpels were written firſt, and that in
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:028262_0265_0FD7F6B5E3B2BF88"/>the order in which they now ſtand in our Bible: and the epiſtles occaſionally, as the affairs of the church required, and the inſpiring Spirit conducted. At laſt, before the age of inſpiration ceaſed, and towards the cloſe of it all the writings of the New Teſtament were collected into a volume, and left as a ſacred truſt to the church in future ages. This is ſuppoſed to have been done by St. John, who out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived all the other apoſtles.</p>
            <p>I have given theſe hints in an haſty, ſuperficial manner, the illuſtrating and confirming of which would require more time and diſcourſe, than I doubt would be agreeable to ſome of my hearers, upon a ſubject ſo much out of their way. They may however, afford you an imperfect view of a very important ſubject. And ſo I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To prove, that the preſent books of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are the originally inſpired Scriptures, that is, the books are the ſame that were at firſt given by inſpiration of God. We have the ſame pentateuch that Moſes delivered to the Jews. We have all the reſt of the books both of the Old and New Teſtament, that the inſpired writers left with the church. We have the ſame in number and kind, and they are not corrupted or depraved in matters of moment, much leſs, in points fundamental. I will evidence this with reſpect to both the Old and New Teſtament: yet very briefly, that I may not too long try your patience. Though methinks, if you would conſider the matter, I might expect your attention, our faith and hope, our eternal all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the truth and divinity of the Bible, and to prove the books of it genuine, is the ſame thing with regard to your ſpiritual intereſts, as it is with regard to your temporal concerns, to prove your deeds and conveyances are genuine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I will begin with the Old Teſtament, and prove that could not be changed, or corrupted;
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:028262_0266_0FD7F6B7AD246968"/>but that we have the ſame original books, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the prophets delivered to the Jews.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe let it be conſidered, that it was morally impoſſible, that the books of the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament ſhould be changed or corrupted. The law was publiſhed and revealed in a very ſolemn and awful manner, at mount Sinai. The original book was laid up, as you have heard, in the ſanctuary, to which they might have recourſe upon occaſion. Copies were delivered out for the uſe of the people, and diſperſed among them, with a ſpecial charge that they ſhould not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it, Deut. iv. 2. and again, xii. 32. <hi>What things ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I command you obſerve to do it. Thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> And as they had the law in their hands, ſo they were obliged to have it <hi>in their hearts,</hi> to teach it <hi>diligently to</hi> their <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and <hi>talk of it when they ſat in their houſes,</hi> when they <hi>walked</hi> by the <hi>way,</hi> when they <hi>lay down,</hi> and <hi>when</hi> they <hi>roſe up; to write it upon the doer-poſts of</hi> their <hi>houſes</hi> and <hi>upon their gates,</hi> Deut. vi. 6, 7, 9. And Chap. xi. 18, 19, 20. And ſo converſant were they, and ſo expert in their law, that Joſephus tells us they had it conſtantly in their mouths, and knew every thing in it as well as their own names.</p>
            <p>And as the law was matter of every one's ſtudy, ſo the public reading of it was a conſtant part of their worſhip. We are told, <hi>Moſes had in old time them that preached him, being read in their ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues every Sabbath day.</hi> Add to this, that in the year of the releaſe, at the end of every ſeventh year, the book of the law was produced, and ſolemnly read before all the people. They read their law every week by diſtinct portions in their ſynagogues, or places of religious worſhip. And on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the whole volume was brought forth, and read before the people. Now theſe circumſtances, and many more might be taken notice of, make it next
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:028262_0267_0FD7F6B9ECA229A8"/>to impoſſible, that the law ſhould be changed, or corrupted. They had authentic copies of it among them. Some of the Jews tell us, Moſes wrote thirteen copies thereof with his own hand, that he delivered one to the prieſts to be preſerved in the holy place, and one to each of the twelve tribes to be kept by the elders of each tribe. The deſign of which, it is likely, was that the people of each tribe might have an authentic copy to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, if any thing was thought to be amiſs in the more private copies; as the whole nation upon the like occaſion might reſort to the copy in the ſanctuary. This being the caſe, it is, I ſay, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible that a law thus promulgated, in which a whole nation had ſo great an intereſt, their government, polity, civil as well as religious inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt depending upon it; a law ſo conſtantly read, ſo univerſally ſtudied and known ſhould be altered. None could attempt to do it without being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; nor would they eſcape the puniſhment due by the law to ſuch a wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Again, as a farther argument, it is conſiderable, that they had the utmoſt veneration for their law. They reverenced it even to ſuperſtition, as might be ſhewn in many inſtances. Some have told us, that they thought every private man, that could, was obliged to write a copy of the law with his own hand. And they were ſtrangely ſuperſtitious in the manner of their writing, which however let us ſee in what high eſteem their law was with them, and that they thought they could not pay it reverence enough. But to omit other particulars, I will only take notice that they had an order of men among them, their Maſorites, whoſe buſineſs it was to watch over the ſacred text, and take care that not the leaſt change ſhould be made in it. And the pains they took to this purpoſe were very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. They numbered not only all the verſes,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:028262_0268_0FD7F6BC96ADE0B0"/>but words and letters of the law; took an account how often any word occurred therein; criticiſed upon the form of every letter, how differently it was written; and employed an induſtry and art that was almoſt incredible. Now was it likely, was it even poſſible, that a book thus guarded ſhould be corrupted?</p>
            <p>I might farther urge to the ſame purpoſe, that our Saviour, who ſo freely upon many occaſions cenſures the Jews, particularly the Scribes and Phariſees for their faults, never once accuſes them of corrupting their Scriptures, or of any deſigns of that kind. He tells them of their hypocriſy, their oppreſſion and pride; of their making void the law by their traditions; but never charges them with changing it, or corrupting any of the books of it. But rather bears teſtimony to them in this particular, whilſt he directs to the ſearching the Scripture, that is, the writings of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for theſe were all the Scriptures extant at that time, and ſaith, that therein they had eternal life; which he would not have ſaid, had they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther changed or corrupted it. And we find the apoſtle mentions the Jews, as having the ſacred truſt of the Scripture leſt in their hands, without hinting one word of their unfaithfulneſs, <hi>unto them were committed the oracles of God.</hi> Now as this crime, the corrupting the ſacred oracles, would have been the greateſt of all crimes, we cannot imagine our Saviour and his apoſtles would have paſſed it over in ſilence, had they been guilty of it.</p>
            <p>Farther, the New Teſtament frequently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that the text of the Old Teſtament was not corrupted. This is implied in that our Lord and his apoſtles ſo often confirm their doctrine thereby, and appeal to the authority of Moſes and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The apoſtle in the text declares, <hi>all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <pb n="268" facs="unknown:028262_0269_0FD7F6C7B01207C0"/>meaning the Scripture of the Old Teſtament, <hi>was given by inſpiration of God.</hi> And ſpeaking of Timothy's knowing the Scripture from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he ſays, they were <hi>able to make wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> An argument that they were entire and not depraved. I might ſubjoin the teſtimony of their own writers, as Joſephus, for inſtance, who, notwithſtanding he upbraids them for their many crying iniquities, and imputes the dreadful judgments that came upon them to their ſins and apoſtaſies, yet clears them of any guilt in corrupting their law; and indeed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds their zeal in and about it. And, which is very much to our purpoſe, he gives us a catalogue of the divine books they had preſerved; the very ſame that now we have. Philo, another of their learned writers, bears teſtimony concerning them; that from the going forth of the children of Iſrael out of Egypt, from the giving of the law, until his days, which was about two thouſand years, there was not ſo much as a word changed or altered therein: and adds, that there was not any Jew but would rather die an hundred times over, than ſuffer his law to be changed in the leaſt. And this I think ſufficient to prove that the Old Teſtament is not changed; but that the ſame original inſpired books are communicated to the chriſtian church, that the church of the Jews received from Moſes and the prophets. I muſt haſten through the other claſs of argument, viz.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To prove, that the books of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remain the ſame and uncorrupted. I ſhall only mention the heads that might be inſiſted upon more fully.</p>
            <p>It is a good argument that the books left by the evangeliſts and apoſtles were the very ſame we now have, in that we find in the moſt early writers of the chriſtian church quotations out of them, in which
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:028262_0270_0FD7F6CCBA460B88"/>the very ſame words are produced we now find in them. We have ſeveral of theſe quotations in the very firſt writers; which ſhews that the books, the chriſtian church then made uſe of, and received as the writings of the inſpired apoſtles, were the ſame and not different books, from thoſe we have in our hands and receive as ſuch. We have teſtimonies to this purpoſe above one thouſand five hundred years old.</p>
            <p>And then it is obſervable, that we have in the writers of the primitive church, even in the very firſt ages, liſts of the sacred books of the New-Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. They not only quote them, but number them; mention the four evangeliſts, Paul's epiſtles, and the reſt as the works of ſuch and ſuch perſons, whoſe names they bear. I cannot here produce the evidence of this; but dare be accountable for it at any time.</p>
            <p>Again, Tertullian, one of the firſt of the fathers, who lived within a little more than an hundred years after the apoſtle John, takes notice of the original writings under the hands of the apoſtles; as what remained in ſome churches in his day. Now if this was ſo, the church at that time had a full op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſatisfying themſelves concerning any book, or paſſage, by appealing to thoſe churches as to ſuch particular books, or paſſages.</p>
            <p>Further, we have the canon of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment owned and declared by an early council in the primitive church, which hath left it as it now is. They place the ſame books, and no more in it than what are now received in the proteſtant churches.</p>
            <p>Some of the keeneſt enemies of the chriſtian faith owned many of the books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, that they were written by ſuch and ſuch perſons in whoſe names they appear. Thus Julian the apoſtate mentions the goſpels of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and Mark, of Luke and John. And others
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:028262_0271_0FD7F6CF64CE5530"/>mention other books; an argument that nothing could be objected againſt the fact, that theſe books were wrote by ſuch perſons. They herein grant, that the chriſtians did not forge their books, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from ſuch authors.</p>
            <p>I might add, that ſome of the fathers argue againſt the here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es they oppoſe, that their doctrines did not agree with the unqueſtionable writings of the apoſtles.</p>
            <p>In a word, it is not probable, nor indeed poſſible that theſe books ſhould be forged, be changed or corrupted in any material points. For,
<list>
                  <item>1. they could not be corrupted during the lives of the apoſtles, while the church was under the conduct of an infallible ſpirit, and under the authority of the prime miniſters of Chriſt's kingdom. Should any then have attempted to impoſe ſpurious writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the church, there was an eaſy remedy at hand. We cannot ſuppoſe any books would then be admitted, but what were approved by the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and apoſtolic men. And conſequently, for the firſt age the canon of Scripture muſt, I think, be allowed to be ſecure.</item>
                  <item>2. When the divine books were communicated to the church, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great reverence and veneration, and eſteemed as their glory and treaſure. They look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them as a revelation from heaven, and charter for heaven; the rule of their life, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their hope. And we find that generally they would ſubmit to any tortures and deaths rather than renounce or part with them. And can we imagine they would corrupt them themſelves, or willingly ſuffer others to do it? No more than you would allow knaviſh men to tamper with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings by which you hold your eſtates.</item>
                  <item>3. There were great numbers of copies ſpread abroad through the ſeveral churches of Chriſt, and in ſeveral nations. Now it cannot be thought all ſhould agree in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:028262_0272_0FD7F6D0E9E9BC80"/>of changing or corrupting the original books. And if ſome only ſhould endeavor it, the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted copies would remain to detect them.</item>
                  <item>4. They were very early and ſoon tranſlated into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent languages, and a multitude of learned men made it their buſineſs to teach, explain, and write comments upon them. Now ſuppoſing there was ſomething wrong in one verſion, or in this or that copy, ſomething changed, added, or taken away; there were many other copies, and other verſions by help of which the neglect or fraud might be and would be corrected.</item>
                  <item>5. They were conſtantly read in their public aſſemblies. As the primitive chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians uſed to be very converſant with them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſo the reading of them was always a part of their ſolemn and joint worſhip. By which means, they could not but be well acquainted with them, and have them fixed in their minds and memories, which would be a ſecurity againſt any remarkable corruption of them.</item>
                  <item>6. Chriſtians were ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily divided into different parties and opinions, had many diſputes among themſelves about ſome articles of their faith; in all which they appealed to the holy Scripture as the ſtandard of their faith, and the judge of their queſtions: and conſequently no one party could corrupt the ſame, but the reſt would complain of them, and expoſe them for it.</item>
                  <item>7. Add to all this, the watchfulneſs of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which we have reaſon to be ſatisfied would intereſt itſelf in this matter, and not ſuffer the word of God to be altered or corrupted in things of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that concern the ſalvation of mankind, or that would affect and deſtroy the deſign of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording ſuch a revelation to the world. In ſhort, it is as reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that a crafty lawyer could forge a new ſtatute book, and a new body of laws for the people of England, and bring them into our courts, as that any men, whatever their deſigns
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:028262_0273_0FD7F6D4C99093F0"/>were, could change or corrupt the books of the New Teſtament, which were received by all ſorts of chriſtians, as the rule of their religion, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their happineſs.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, I hope, I have cleared in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the queſtion relating to the canon of Scripture; have ſhewn you that the books of our preſent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are the original inſpired books thereof. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to take notice of ſome objections: but muſt leave them to another diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, what has been ſaid, is matter of no ſmall ſatisfaction and comfort to the judicious and inquiſitive chriſtian. The Bible is his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; its teſtimonies the rejoicing of his heart; and it cannot but give him a pleaſure, the greateſt pleaſure, to ſee this well eſtabliſhed, and its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity vindicated. And ſhould we not value, ſtudy, and endeavor to improve our Bible, and the ſeveral books of it; when we have ſo good aſſurance that they are divine. The high importance of the things contained therein ſhould recommend it. The bleſſed tendency of its doctrines, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it. And methinks it ſhould exceedingly raiſe our eſteem of it, that it is a book ſent from God. O learn to receive it, and reverence it as ſuch; and to anſwer the apoſtles character of the Theſſalonians, in which he ſo much rejoices, and with which I ſhall conclude, <hi>For this cauſe thank we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God.</hi>

            <p>I HAVE endeavored to clear and vindicate the canon of Scripture, have proved that the books of our Bible, are the Scriptures that were given by inſpiration of God. I am ſenſible that ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections have been made to the account I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But as I am in haſte to come to a concluſion, and cannot ſuppoſe many of my hearers ſo well acquainted with theſe matters, as to deſire a full diſcuſſion and examination of them, or likely to receive it with advantage; I ſhall in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure paſs them by, and only mention a few of the moſt conſiderable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is objected, that we know not when or by whom the canon of the Old or New Teſtament was ſettled and eſtabliſhed. I anſwer, we have very probable evidence that the canon of the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament was ſuperviſed and ſettled by Ezra after the return of the Jews from captivity: and that of the New Teſtament by the apoſtle John, as I obſerved before. However, it is ſufficient if we can prove both were ſettled whilſt the church was under the conduct of inſpired men; who, we may be ſure,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:028262_0275_0FD7F6E25ABE11C0"/>would admit no books into the canon, but ſuch as were authentic and divine. Let us lay the ſcene among ourſelves, and in our own nation: ſuppoſe we had had a ſucceſſion of prophets, and ſeveral books of religion had been written among us, ſome in one age, ſome in another; and offered to the church as inſpired, at leaſt, before all the prophets, or other inſpired perſons, were gone from among us, and that extraordinary order ceaſed, all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine books were gathered into a volume, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the church, as the rule of religion. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this the caſe: I cannot ſee we could reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably doubt of our canon, though we knew not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly when it was received in the church whilſt it had inſpired guides. And this is really the caſe with reference to the canon of Scripture. There were ſeveral prophets in the Jewiſh church, as Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai, Zachary and Malachi, after the canon was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as we now have it. And we may conclude, that theſe men would neither ſuffer inſpired books to be rejected, nor ſpurious ones to be obtruded on the church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is objected, that there are ſome books both of the Old and New Teſtament that we know not the writers of; and had they been inſpired, ſurely we ſhould have them under the names of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired authors. To omit other inſtances, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, ſay our objectors, by whom the epiſtle to the Hebrews was written, neither by the apoſtle Paul, by Luke, his conſtant companion, or by Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens his fellow laborer, as he is called; or by Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas. Some of the ancients aſcribe it to one of theſe, and ſome to another. I anſwer, that though the writer of this or that book might for reaſons, which then had their weight, be ſuppreſſed for a time; yet at laſt it was generally known. Thus, for example, almoſt all antiquity agreed that the epiſtle to the Hebrews was wrote by the apoſtle
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:028262_0276_0FD7F6E3B1A2E8C0"/>Paul. But I anſwer further, the character of the book itſelf is of far greater moment, than the name of the writer. If it brought evidence that it was a divine book, the queſtion, who wrote it? is not very material. And if it was received as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired book in the age when it was wrote, and whilſt the church was governed by inſpired men, as I ſaid before, this would be ſufficient to ſatisfy the church in any after age concerning it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is pretended, there were many other books beſides theſe we retain in our canon, that went abroad in the primitive church under the name of inſpired authors; and how come thoſe in our can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only to be admitted, and the reſt rejected; when they claimed equal authority? I anſwer to this, I grant there was in the firſt ages of chriſtianity a great number of apocryphal writings. It may well be ſuppoſed, that when ſo admirable an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as that of the chriſtian religion firſt took place in the world, its profeſſors would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon it in a great variety of books, which they did under different titles, as acts, epiſtles, goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, intineraries, recognitions, martyrdoms, and the like. And as theſe would be read by all ſorts, ſo it is not improbable, but ſome of them might for a time paſs for divine and inſpired. But I add, when the church came to examine and try them, they were rejected, as being different from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, ſpirit, and manner of the apoſtles, as Euſebius gives the reaſon; they were not ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, were not approved by any apoſtle or apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic men; were found deſtitute of internal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, in ſome things contrary to the unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able writings of the apoſtles, &amp;c. And therefore whatever eſteem they might once have, they were upon good reaſon afterwards ſet aſide, and of no authority, and became neglected.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="276" facs="unknown:028262_0277_0FD7F6E527678A28"/>
4. It is farther objected, that ſome of the books in our canon, were not owned and received in the firſt age of the church. I anſwer, this may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any prejudice to the authority of theſe books. The canon was not compleated at once, as I have already obſerved, but was a gradual thing. The books of the New Teſtament were written ſome at one time, ſome at another, upon different occaſions. The apoſtles, you know, were ſent forth to diſciple all nations, to <hi>preach the goſpel to every creature,</hi> and in their journies up and down, they wrote many of their epiſtles. And as the church was under perſecution, and one part lay at a great diſtance from another, we need not wonder that ſome churches had inſpired writings, which others at firſt knew nothing of; and hence might proceed the ſcruples that thoſe had with reference to particular books. They were but lately come to their hands; they had not ſufficient opportunity of examining them, and of receiving the teſtimony of their brethren concerning them. But then I add, after due examination, the books referred to in the objection, were univerſally received. So that in reality, this is ſo far from being an objection againſt the canon, that it is an argument in favor of it. The church firſt queſtioned ſome books, and doubted of them; which ſhews they were not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous. But afterwards they admitted them as divine; which ſhews they had ſatisfaction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. In a word, the firſt chriſtians engaged in the profeſſion of their religion, not with the looſeneſs, indifference, and treachery of our times; but with an extraordinary warmth, zeal, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial. Religion was the greateſt thing in the world with them. They would not betray the chriſtian church, part with any doctrine, or any rule of practice in the New Teſtament, much leſs any book of it, for all the world. The ſacred vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:028262_0278_0FD7F6E695AB7858"/>were dearer to them than their lives. No inducement, promiſes or threatnings, rewards or terrors, could prevail with them to give them up, or ſuffer them to be depraved. I might ſubjoin, that all the books of the New Teſtament ſeem very much of a piece; all written with the ſame ſpirit, and worthy of the ſame divine author. Not one of them has any internal character that diſgraces it, or brings it under ſuſpicion. So that as the books we at preſent have, are the ſame the firſt chriſtians owned, after great caution, ſerious and ſtrict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, when there was any room for queſtion, owned as divine, and gloried in as a treaſure from heaven, we have abundant reaſon to own them as ſuch too. Our Scripture is the ſame with theirs, both given by inſpiration of God, both have that goſpel, which, as the apoſtle expreſſes it, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have finiſhed the third thing propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the head of vindicating the canon of Scripture. What remains in the courſe of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral method, is to anſwer objections againſt the inſpiration thereof. A great deal has been offered to prove that the Scripture is given by inſpiration of God. Many volumes formerly, and of late, have been filled with the argument. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that has been ſaid, or can be ſaid, there are ſome that it ſeems are not, will not be ſatisfied. And I ſhall now conſider what theſe perſons have to alledge as the reaſon of their infidelity; if one may ſuppoſe they have any thing for it that deſerves the name of reaſon. Was I here to defend the cauſe of religion at large, I ſhould divide the objectors into different claſſes; for they ſeem to be of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent thoughts, and act upon different principles in their oppoſition to the Bible. Some inſinuate, that ſupernatural revelation is needleſs, and that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral religion, as they call it, is not only ſufficient, but
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:028262_0279_0FD7F6EB55A30C18"/>really preferable to that of the Scripture, which they repreſent as dull, abſurd, involved in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and unintelligible.</p>
            <p>Others ſpeak a little more modeſtly. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Bible has its excellencies: but then they think it wants evidence of its divinity. They would be willing, they pretend, to ſee it well prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but there are difficulties in their way that they cannot get over.</p>
            <p>And ſome of thoſe that would be thought more in earneſt, have collected from ancient and modern writers all the exceptions and cavils they can meet with againſt particular paſſages of the Bible. Theſe they ſet off with ſuch ornaments of language and oratory, as they are maſters of, and ſend them abroad into the world as reaſons againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Others attack our arguments by which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the authority of the Bible, and endeavor to raiſe difficulties, and ſhew the weakneſs of them; ſuch as are taken from miracles, prophecy, the ſpreading of the chriſtian religion, and the like.</p>
            <p>But the main body of the antiſcripturiſts act a different, and even a meaner part. All their ſtrength lies in a few quirks of wit, that they have picked up in common converſation, or in the clubs of their companions. They neither read, ſtudy, nor underſtand any part of the Bible, nor do they concern themſelves with the reaſons that are offered in its behalf. They have received prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and theſe they run away with without ever examining matters. They get hold of a few topics of raillery, ſingle out a few texts and phraſes, which they have learned in their manner to repreſent as ridiculous; and from the abuſe of theſe, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the whole, and even think they have gained a victory.</p>
            <p>I am perſuaded, you do not expect that I ſhould
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:028262_0280_0FD7F6F1F6246D88"/>examine all their pleas, and lay open the cavils that each claſs of them bring againſt the authority of the Scripture. This would take up more time than I deſign to employ in the remaining part of the ſubject. And, as I would hope, I am not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſpeaking to any of this unhappay character, it is leſs neceſſary to inſiſt largely on theſe things. I ſhall however for the confirming your faith, take notice of, and endeavor to remove, ſome of the more plauſible objections. I ſhall run through them briefly, and ſo paſs on to what may be thought more uſeful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some of theſe perſons take offence at the ſtyle of the Scripture: they pretend it is low, flat, and dull; has none of that vivacity and ſpirit that might be expected in an inſpired book. I anſwer, this objection is not true with reſpect to the whole Bible. There is as true rhetoric, as ſtrong figures, as much pomp and grandeur of ſtyle, in ſome parts of the holy Scripture, as in any book in the world. Job is thought to be not only the firſt, but the fineſt ſpecimen of poetry that has yet been produced by any, either ancients or moderns. Several of the prophets deliver themſelves in the ſublimeſt ſtrains of oratory. And it has been obſerved of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Paul, that there is often not only a great purity in his language, but much art in his ſtyle; and that in his defence before Felix and Agrippa, he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoars the higheſt flights of Cicero and Demoſthenes.</p>
            <p>But I grant, the main of the Bible doth not run in this ſtrain of an orator. But then this is ſo far from being an objection againſt it, that it is rather an argument of its divinity. It ſpeaks from God, teaches, commands, enacts, promiſes, and threatens in the name of the great Sovereign of the world. The importance of its matter, and the authority of its author, are its oratory. And indeed, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, human oratory would be an abatement to
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:028262_0281_0FD7F6F4A7746B08"/>it. When a prince ſpeaks from the throne, he doth not aſſume the ſtyle of a common declaimer, nor uſe arts of perſuaſion; his authority ſuperſedes all the neceſſity of theſe things. And ſo it is in the caſe before us.</p>
            <p>Others farther object, the difficulty and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture. They think had it been a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from heaven, it would have been plain to all, and upon a level with every man's underſtanding; as every one is ſo much concerned in it. To this I anſwer, that what is abſolutely neceſſary, is eaſy and obvious. None can miſunderſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the great eſſential points of religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wilful and wicked neglect. In the mean time, I acknowledge there are difficulties, conſiderable difficulties in the Bible; and as it deſerves, ſo it requires a good degree of pains and diligence rightly to underſtand it. So it has pleaſed God to order and ſtate his revelation. Some things are exceeding plain and eaſy; ſome things profound, intricate and difficult; which demand the cloſeſt attention, and are fit to employ the ſtrength of the greateſt genius's and ſtrongeſt capacities: a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that, I doubt not, has a great deal of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God in it. But this is a matter that needs farther explaining; and it would be for many reaſons proper more fully to conſider it. But I have not room here to make the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary enlargement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an objection againſt the Bible, that ſome who are fond of ſo unhappy, and one would think uncomfortable a cauſe, as that of infidelity, ſeem to triumph in that it contains doctrines, and relates facts, that are not only abſurd and unreaſonable, but downright impoſſible. And conſequently, cannot be inſpired, or a revelation from God. Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are given us under this head; as, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal deluge, the preſervation of ſuch a number
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:028262_0282_0FD7F6F5B609A228"/>of creatures, with proper food, in ſo ſmall a veſſel as the ark; that an aſs ſhould ſpeak; that the ſun ſhould ſtand ſtill, and yet the frame of nature not thrown into confuſion; that Jonah ſhould live in a whale's belly ſo long without reſpiration, and not be digeſted in the ſtomach of the fiſh, &amp;c. And what difficulties they find in ſome doctrines of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is well known; as, the trinity, the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a virgin bringing forth a ſon, God and man united in one perſon, the reſurrection of the dead, and the like. Theſe, ſay they, are not only above our comprehenſion, but impoſſible; from whence they conclude, they are ſufficient to ſink and ruin the credit of any book that delivers them as true. To which I reply,
<list>
                  <item>1. That many things appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and impoſſible for a time, that afterwards are well enough underſtood; appear impoſſible to ſome, yet are certain and eaſy to others. A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of inſtances may be produced to illuſtrate this from the diſcoveries that have been made in natural philoſophy. It was once thought impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there ſhould be antipodes; and yet now no body queſtions it. The king of Siam, it is ſaid, thought himſelf affronted by the Dutch ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, when he told him that in Holland the water would become ſo hard in cold weather, that men or elephants might walk upon it.</item>
                  <item>2. We believe a great many things we do not underſtand, cannot account for, and have reaſon to think as impoſſible as any of the things the objection refers to in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. What notion have we of the infinite diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of matter, the union of ſoul and body, a vital union between ſpirit and matter. This every one believes, and yet no wiſe man will undertake to explain. Nothing is more univerſally agreed upon, as abſolutely neceſſary, than the eternity of God; and yet the very notion is amazing, ſhocks the faculties, and almoſt overwhelms the mind; that
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028262_0283_0FD7DADBF55916D8"/>any thing ſhould exiſt without a cauſe of its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as God doth, is utterly inconceivable, and were we not conſtrained to ſay, it muſt be ſo; we ſhould be ready to ſay, it is impoſſible. And the like difficulty might be obſerved of the divine om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence, or infinite extenſion. The thing itſelf is demonſtrable, and yet the mode inexplicable. In ſhort, we live in a world of myſteries: A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of things we ſee and believe are ſo; that they are, is plain and certain; yet how they are, we know not; and ſhould be apt boldly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce they could not be, but that we are ſure they are. How unreaſonable is it then to object againſt the Bible, becauſe it delivers to us ſome things we do not underſtand; eſpecially if they refer to the incomprehenſible, unſearchable nature of God, or the extraordinary acts of infinite power. But</item>
                  <item>3. I would aſk the objector, whether he believes God made the world? If ſo; all his cavils upon this head muſt be abſurd. For nothing can ſeem more impoſſible, and can be more hard to be believed, than the doctrine of the creation; that ſomething ſhould be made out of nothing. The famous phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher Ariſtotle laid it down as a maxim, againſt which there was no conteſting, that nothing can be produced from nothing. Nor indeed can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, without having recourſe to infinite power. Now ſince it is granted by many, at leaſt, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject revelation, that God made all things out of nothing; or more properly, when there was nothing, did, by his ſovereign word and command, bring all things into being. Since this is not thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; nothing elſe certainly ought to be ſo; nothing, I am ſure, related in the Bible. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another objection.</item>

            <p n="3">3. Some alledge contradictions in Scripture, and thence infer it cannot be inſpired. I anſwer, the contradictions objected are only ſeeming, but not
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:028262_0284_0FD7F6F95A719F70"/>real. Nor do I know one particular that is not capable of a rational ſolution. A little ſkill in criticiſm, in the Hebrew and Greek languages, their idioms and properties, and the antiquities and cuſtoms of thoſe countries, where the ſcenes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture lay, and the affairs were acted, will clear the main difficulties. A diſtinction of the different ſenſes of words, of the different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and times, will often do it. Thus when it is ſaid, <hi>it is appointed for all men once to die.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>if a man keep Chriſt's ſaying, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee death.</hi> There is no contradiction. The one place ſpeaking of natural, the other of ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual or eternal death. So when Moſes ſays, <hi>God reſted on the ſeventh day from all his work.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>my Father worketh hitherto.</hi> There is no oppoſition or contradiction: Moſes ſpeaking of the works of creation, and Chriſt of the works of providence. Chriſt ſays, <hi>John the baptiſt was Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that was to come.</hi> And yet John the baptiſt when he was aſked, whether he was Elias? anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I am not.</hi> He was not Elias in perſon, but was Elias in office and ſpirit, as I may ſay, and conſequently, here is no contradiction. Samuel tells us, God <hi>will not repent.</hi> And yet elſewhere we read, that he did repent, that <hi>he made man on the earth. That he made Saul king.</hi> But here is no contradiction: repentence ſignifies in the one place a change of mind and council, from want of foreſight of what would come to paſs. And thus God cannot repent. But then he changes his courſe, as men do when they change their minds; and ſo he may be ſaid to repent. And in the like method moſt of the reſt of theſe appearing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions may be reconciled, viz. by diſtinguiſhing ambiguous words, diſtinguiſhing different times and reſpects, &amp;c. Let me add, that conſidering
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:028262_0285_0FD7F6FB98661030"/>the nature and quality of the Bible, that part of it is the moſt ancient book in the world; that it is written in a language but very imperfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; that it contains a great variety of matters; treats of ſubjects of exceeding difficulty as well as importance, it is not to be wondered at, if ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages occur not eaſy to be underſtood, and that may appear at firſt ſight inconſiſtent. In the mean time it muſt argue a baſe humour of cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and a ſtrong prejudice againſt the cauſe of the Bible to reject it on this account; when it comes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us with ſuch a torrent of Evidence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It may be objected, that if the Bible be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired, and the ſubjects of it of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to mankind as is pretended; matters would not ſure have been left under ſo much uncertainty, and ſo much in the dark: but a revelation inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the good of all would have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an evidence convincing to all. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the evidence is ſufficient. Had it been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering, there had been no virtue, no excellency in believing. God deſigned to try the tempers of men; that as is ſaid in another caſe, <hi>they that were approved might be made manifeſt.</hi> But I anſwer further, this objection rudely arraigns the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God, and preſcribes to infinite wiſdom. It is like the clay riſing up againſt the potter, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why haſt thou formed me thus? indeed ſuch cavils would be endleſs, ſhould we indulge the vile temper. We might as decently aſk, why did God make mankind liable to ſin? why did he ſuffer him to ſin? why did he not make every man an angel, and every angel a ſeraph? but as ſuch a humour as this is utterly inconſiſtent with the ſubjection and reverence due from a creature to the author of his being, ſo it would undo him even in heaven could it find a place there. Preſently caſt him down, as the like it may be did the apoſtate angels, and lay
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:028262_0286_0FD7F7062DC58B68"/>him in <hi>chains of darkneſs.</hi> We have abundant ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence of Scripture revelation, all that God ſaw fit to grant, and all that is neceſſary. He requires in order to believing, an humble, teachable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If inſtead of this, we allow ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably to carp and find fault, the guilt of our Infidelity will lie at our own door, and our blood will be upon our own head.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is objected, that notwithſtanding all that is ſaid in behalf of the Bible, and of chriſtianity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometaniſm pretends to as glorious things, and has ſpread as much in the world, and yet is a vile im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture. But it would be eaſy to ſhew, that there is nothing in this objection, could I allow myſelf to ſtay upon it, and to ſhew that the caſe of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity and the religion of Mahomet vaſtly differ. The one has all the marks of impoſture imaginable in it, and the other none at all. Let me ſuggeſt a few things here.</p>
            <p>Mahomet accommodated his religion to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Arabians, and therefore retained therein ſuch rites and ceremonies as they were fond of, and had been accuſtomed to, and indulged them in ſuch ſins as he found them moſt addicted to. But nothing of this can be charged on chriſtianity. Chriſt and his apoſtles ſtrictly forbid all ſin, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all without exception the mortification of their moſt beloved luſts, cancelled the ancient cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Jews, and all the fooliſh ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Heathens. Our Saviour made no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, granted no indulgence here. And yet his religion prevails againſt the ſtrongeſt corruptions and moſt inveterate prejudices.</p>
            <p>Mahomet changed his religion, altered his laws and ceremonies; as he found the humours of the people required. He ſometimes eſtabliſhed one law and manner of worſhip, and then ſuperſeded it; pretending divine revelation for both; though
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:028262_0287_0FD7F708A4628F58"/>they were inconſiſtent. But Chriſt was always the ſame and his laws invariable.</p>
            <p>Mahomet introduced his religion among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the moſt ſtupid ignorance, and conſequently prepared to receive any deluſions that ſhould be artfully carried on. It is ſaid, there was but one perſon in Mecca, where he began his forgeries, that could write or read. Whereas, on the other hand, Chriſt appeared among the moſt learned people in the world, and when learning was at the greateſt height.</p>
            <p>Mahomet never durſt venture either upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy or miracle; though urged and ſtrongly preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that head; being conſcious of his own inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But you know how much of both theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the miniſtry, and eſtabliſhed the authority of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Further, Mahomet forbad under pain of death all diſputes about his religion. Whereas Chriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his to a free examination and enquiry.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the religion of Mahomet owed its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the power of the ſword, and was by that means propagated. Whereas Chriſt and his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles neither had, nor would accept of any ſuch aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries and helps. <hi>The weapons</hi> of their <hi>warfare</hi> were <hi>not carnal, but ſpiritual, and mighty through God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that though it muſt be granted, that maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metaniſm has prevailed in a great part of the world, God having in his juſt judgment given up a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtrong deluſions, that had the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion among them, but wofully perverted, and grew weary of it. Though this muſt be acknowledged, it can be no diminution of the honor of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, or argument againſt its divinity, ſince it is ſo evidently of a different nature, and made its way through the world in a very different manner. Several nations believe and receive mahometan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:028262_0288_0FD7F709D804D590"/>but ſuch are ſubdued, and the conqueror may impoſe what laws he pleaſes upon the conquered. Once more,</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is objected, if the Bible be the word of God, if the chriſtian religion be divine, if the Son of God came from heaven, as is related therein, and introduced and eſtabliſhed his religion in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as is there pretended, it is ſtrange it has had no greater and better effects in the world. If it be ſo excellent an inſtitution; how come they that profeſs it to live no better than other people? To this I anſwer in a word or two, and I have done with the objections.
<list>
                  <item>(1.) Multitudes profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves chriſtians that are not ſo. And we muſt not judge of chriſtianity from the conduct of ſuch that only uſurp the name. Suppoſe a company of men ſhould enter themſelves among the ſtricteſt ſect of philoſophers. Yet if they never acquainted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their doctrines; never enquired into the precepts, nor regarded the rules of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; how excellent ſoever the inſtitution was, it could have no influence upon ſuch votaries. And this is the caſe of large numbers that are called chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. They profeſs the Bible, but they know little or nothing of it. They bear the name of Chriſt, and pretend to be his followers; but they never received his doctrine, nor his ſpirit. And, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by meaſures ought to be taken from them in judging of the chriſtian religion. I anſwer,</item>
                  <item>(2.) Chriſtianity has wrought a glorious reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world. That body of men, that receive the Bible, differ as much from the reſt of the world, as Jeruſalem from Kedar. The church though it has great corruptions, yet has great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies; The Scripture, wherever it has come, ever has, in one degree or other, and with reſpect to ſome at leaſt, brought a bleſſing along with it. But</item>
                  <item>(3.) I confeſs, the chriſtian religion has not
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:028262_0289_0FD7F70C2E60A288"/>had that effect which might be expected; and I muſt own this is one of thoſe providences, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me dark and ſurpriſing; and, as much as any thing, inclines me to believe there will be a more glorious ſtate of the church, than we have yet ſeen; when chriſtianity will look more like it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſhine forth in the lives of thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it with greater luſtre. In the mean time the objection doth not conclude. The world is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly the better for the Bible. I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve moſt of the virtue and religion, that remains in a corrupt degenerate world, is owing to it; and is to be found among thoſe that embrace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it: and, I doubt not, a time will come when the beauty and power of the chriſtian religion will appear more illuſtrious, than it has yet done; at leaſt than now it doth.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Our duty, in the mean time, is to retrieve the credit of our profeſſion by the purity, integrity, and holineſs of our lives. The chriſtian apologiſts in the primitive church (O that we could do it more univerſally now!) uſed to appeal to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of their religion for the excellency of it; intimating, that their enemies might there behold a beautiful idea of chriſtianity. This argument is too much obſcured and loſt among us. Let us ſtudy every one of us to do our part towards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it, waiting for a more abundant effuſion of the divine ſpirit to revive decayed religion, in our hearts and in our lives; <hi>that others ſeeing</hi> our <hi>good works, may glorify</hi> our <hi>Father which is in heaven.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The Scripture is profitable for doctrine. And here I ſhall hint what doctrines the Scripture teaches, and with what advantage it teaches ſuch doctrines.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What doctrines the Scripture teaches. In general, I would ſuggeſt, that the Scripture being
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:028262_0291_0FD7F70FF0218498"/>
               <hi>inſpired of God,</hi> muſt be a ſufficient rule of faith, and contain all the neceſſary points of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief. We cannot ſuppoſe that a God of infinite wiſdom and goodneſs ſhould indite a book on purpoſe to direct us in the way to heaven, and yet that book be defective in any neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of religion. No; <hi>the Scripture is profitable for doctrine,</hi> for all doctrine. How this is to be underſtood, I will let you ſee in a few propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; therein compriſing what I deſign upon the head.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I do not affert, that the Scripture teaches us arts, ſciences, and philoſophy. There is indeed a great deal of philoſophy in Scripture, a great deal of rhetoric, and oratory; and many ſpecimens of curious ſpeculation and learning interſperſed. But there is no ſyſtem of any of theſe; much leſs a ſyſtem of all of them. The Scripture was wrote or the uſe of all ſorts of perſons; the vulgar and ignorant as well as higher genious's; wrote to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in the way to heaven, and not in the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of human learning. It is profitable for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine <hi>that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed to all good words;</hi> that the chriſtian may be inſtructed in every thing that concerns religion, and may be a perfect chriſtian; not the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher inſtructed in his theorems, at leaſt, not in all of them, or in every problem, that may fall under his examination. Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do I ſuppoſe the Scripture teaches the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of politics. I remark this, becauſe I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it a miſtake in ſome that treat on this ſubject, and that it is attended with ill conſequences, to found their doctrine of politics on the Bible. I grant it lays down general rules concerning civil government, and concerning the duty both of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and ſubjects. As, that they, that rule over men, muſt be <hi>juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi>
               <pb n="291" facs="unknown:028262_0292_0FD7F71763B2C370"/>magiſtrates are the <hi>miniſters of God for good, a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to them that do evil, and a praiſe to them that do well.</hi> Such are the magiſtrates which God appoints and approves. And as thoſe that are under them, enjoy the protection and many advantages of their adminiſtration, they are to be <hi>ſubject not for wrath,</hi> or merely through fear of puniſhment; <hi>but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake.</hi> This the Scripture enjoins, and the obligation hereunto is evidently founded upon the nature and reaſon of things, and reſults from the very end of ſociety. But it doth not determine the neceſſary form of civil polity, much leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe one and the ſame for all ſtates, and all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in every age of the world.</p>
            <p>Different forms of government are lawful in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, or in the ſame place at different times. And, I apprehend, any form of government may be lawful, though not found in Scripture; provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it be fitted to anſwer the general ends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and be managed conſiſtently with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rules. In ſhort, as God has in nature, and by the miniſtry and help of human reaſon afforded ſufficient means for human learning, ſo far as it is neceſſary in the world; the ſame may be ſaid of civil government. It is included in the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the reaſon of mankind directs to it, furniſhes rules for its management; and it is left to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence of every nation or community to chooſe the form, to ſpecify and model it as they pleaſe. All that the Scripture doth here is only to ſuperintend it, as I may ſay, and preſcribe the duties of the ſeveral parts of ſociety in general.</p>
            <p>I will not affirm our text poſitively excludes the uſefulneſs of Scripture in things of this kind. But I think, it directs us to expect and attend its teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in things of a different kind. It is uſeful for doctrine, <hi>that the man of God may be perfect,</hi> not the
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:028262_0293_0FD7F718E24E2290"/>politician; at leaſt, that he may be perfect as a chriſtian, not as a politician. The Scripture deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes God's church, gives us the plan and form of that, and lays down rules for the management of it; teaches how to govern our hearts, and order our lives and converſations; that we may be fitted for the heavenly hierarchy, the city above. But it doth not meddle ſo much with the affairs of this world, as to lay down a ſyſtem of politics. Here human wiſdom, and human laws, have the chief intereſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When it is ſaid the Scripture is profitable for doctrine, we muſt not underſtand it, that it teaches us every thing about the doctrines of religion, that our curioſity may lead us to enquire after, There are a great many doctrines that men have brought into religion, which the Scripture ſaith nothing of. They are mere human figments, and framed out of their own heads. But as the Scripture is not profitable for theſe doctrines, I think we may with clearneſs and authority infer, the doctrines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not profitable. Of this ſort are a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the doctrines the church of Rome would obtrude upon us under the notion of traditions. I may add, of this ſort are many ſpeculations, upon which no ſmall ſtreſs has been laid, in proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant churches, and which they borrowed from the ſchools.</p>
            <p>Let me obſerve, that in the doctrines the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth reveal, even in the moſt important of them, there is a reſerve. It teaches us ſomething of them, but not every thing that belongs to this or that ſubject. It acquaints us with all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ground our faith, and direct our practice; but not all we may deſire to gratify our curioſity. It gives us, for inſtance, the moſt excellent notion of the divine being. But as his nature is unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, there are an hundred queſtions men indulge
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:028262_0294_0FD7F71ADA0E8070"/>themſelves in with reference to it, wherein it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us no light and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>It teaches us the doctrine of the trinity, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and diſtinguiſhing doctrine of the chriſtian religion. But then it doth not deſcend to all the particulars, the nice queſtions, and bold deciſions, with which we have, if I miſtake not, perplexed and obſcured it. The Scripture is profitable for this doctrine. And the doctrine is a very profitable and comfortable one, if we will be content with what it teaches. But if we leave our guide here, and pretend to be wiſe above what is written, we ſhall ſoon find ourſelves out of our depth, and to our own and others prejudices, <hi>darken council with words without knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaid of many other doctrines of the Bible; as the doctrine of God's decrees, the ſtate of future happineſs, the reſurrection, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, quality, and circumſtances of the reſurrection body, the condition of angels, their order, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, officers, and the like. God has in great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs afforded us a revelation, in which he inſtructs us in all things he thought proper and convenient for us, and ſo far as they are ſo. He conſiders our occaſions, neceſſities, and capacities; and accommodates himſelf thereunto. The beſt here, <hi>know but in part, prophecy but in part;</hi> and, indeed, how ſhould it be otherwiſe, when God hath revealed things to us but in part. Let us therefore confine ourſelves within the limits God hath ſet us, be thankful he has revealed ſo much; be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that he has revealed no more. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture revelation is ſufficient to employ our moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent enquiries, at the ſame time that it muſt bound them. The apoſtle cenſures ſome for <hi>intruding into things they had not ſeen;</hi> referring to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of angels, into which it ſeems they pried and ſearched, as the word ſignifies; pretending to know
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:028262_0295_0FD7F7E24C6923A8"/>what the Scripture has not taught concerning them. Let us be cautions and modeſt here; receive the doctrines the Scripture has delivered, and as they are delivered there; believe what the Scripture has told us of this or that doctrine; but not take upon us to know what it has not told us; proceeding in our aſſertions and deciſions, where the Scripture does not go before us, with its light and inſtruction. This humor has occaſioned no ſmall miſchief to the church; and indeed is the ſource of the moſt of thoſe contentions that have diſturbed its peace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When it is ſaid, the Scripture is profitable for doctrine, the leaſt it can intend, is, that it contains all neceſſary doctrine for us to know and believe, in order to ſalvation. This may be concluded from its being inſpired. Certainly if it be given by inſpiration of God, and delivered to the church as a divine rule, it is not a defective and imperfect rule. Nor are we left to infer this, and make it out by reaſoning. We find the Scripture often aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own ſufficiency. Our apoſtle in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, referring to the Scripture of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at leaſt chiefly, ſays, they are <hi>able to make wiſe to ſalvation.</hi> And if ſo, they muſt include every neceſſary article of faith. And when in the text he affirms, <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. He adds, <hi>that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed to all good works.</hi> This, as I obſerved, is aſſerted of the Old Teſtament. And we have the ſame abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved, with reſpect to the New. Chriſt told his diſciples, that he had <hi>made known all things,</hi> he had <hi>heard of the Father.</hi> And when he was about to leave them, he aſſures them, he would <hi>ſend</hi> the <hi>ſpirit, who</hi> ſhould <hi>teach</hi> them <hi>all things, and bring all things to</hi> their <hi>remembrance, whatſoever</hi> he had <hi>ſaid to</hi> them. That the <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſhould <hi>guide</hi> them <hi>into all truth.</hi> Now it muſt be conſidered, that as
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:028262_0296_0FD7DAEC399C6DA8"/>the apoſtles had a commiſſion, being thus furniſhed and inſtructed to go, and proſelyte <hi>all nations,</hi> and <hi>teach them all things whatſoever</hi> their maſter had <hi>commanded</hi> them; ſo they committed theſe things to writing, for the future uſe and ſervice of the church. So that in the holy Scripture we have all neceſſary doctrines of religion. What Chriſt heard of the Father, that is, concerning the way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of man's ſalvation, this he communicated to his apoſtles. This the ſpirit in them, revived, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and commented upon. This they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world. The apoſtle Paul tells the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, he had <hi>not ſhunned to deciare unto</hi> them <hi>all the council of God.</hi> And this doctrine, the whole and entire doctrine, they communicated to the world in inſpired writings, which I have proved are the very ſame, that we, by the good providence of God, have in our poſſeſſion. The Scripture we enjoy is profitable for doctrine, and ſufficient for all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and ſaving doctrine. He that ſtudies, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, and believes his Bible, and lives according to it, is <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Scripture is profitable not only for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary doctrines, but it teaches us many other things for our greater improvement and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in religion, there is no book, no chapter, no doctrine of the Bible, but what is uſeful in its place, and for its proper end and purpoſe. But we muſt not ſay, that it is all neceſſary; that if we had wanted any, we could not have been chriſtians; the conſequence of which would be, that if we are ignorant of any, we cannot be chriſtians. And then how few would be approved? For who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with every part of the Bible; knows and underſtands it all. As in the natural body, there are ſome parts more eſſential, neceſſary, and vital; others that have their proper office in the body, and highly uſeful, but not of equal neceſſity with
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:028262_0297_0FD7DAF12285D078"/>the more noble parts. A man would be maimed, imperfect, and uncomfortable without them; but yet might live without them. Thus it is in the body of Scripture doctrines and revelations. It has its vital and eſſential points; and theſe are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inculcated, delivered over and over again, in one place and another; and indeed in a multitude of places: that as all are concerned in them, none that are competently attentive and inquiſitive, may miſs them, and overlook them. Beſide theſe, there are a great many doctrines in the Bible that ſerve to enlarge and confirm our faith, to enrich our minds with a treaſure of divine truths; to excite and employ our devotion. It delivers many doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of eminent uſe, which yet cannot be ſaid to be abſolutely neceſſary; that tend to adorn and perfect the chriſtian's faith, to aſſiſt and conduct him in all the parts of the divine and ſpiritual life, and it highly concerns us to attend to theſe.</p>
            <p>Some people, I have obſerved, notwithſtanding the veneration they profeſs for the Bible; content themſelves with a very ſcanty knowledge of it. They learn a ſhort creed, or ſome of the general abridgments of duty contained in the Scripture; as, that it is required of us that we <hi>do juſtice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God:</hi> Or that of our Saviour, <hi>Whatſoever</hi> we <hi>would that men ſhould do to</hi> us, we muſt <hi>do</hi> even <hi>ſo to them;</hi> that <hi>he who believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> and the like. Theſe and ſuch like maxims and general propoſitions they receive; and it is the ſtock of Scripture knowledge they ſet up with. All that is neceſſary, ſay they, lies in a little compaſs; is eaſy and plain; and as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves they have ſufficiently learned that, they enquire no farther. But theſe perſons ſhould conſider that a little knowledge of the doctrines of the Bible is not ſufficient, and all that is neceſſary to thoſe that are capable and have opportunity for
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:028262_0298_0FD7DAF36AD55CD0"/>underſtanding more. Fundamentals are different according to the different ſtate of perſons. That ignorance which is excuſable in one, I queſtion not is deſtructive in another.</p>
            <p>And then, a good meaſure of diligence and care is requiſite to the underſtanding aright even thoſe few plain and important doctrines of religion that theſe perſons think ſufficient. A man, it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may ſoon learn the propoſitions that contain the eſſential doctrines of faith. But the doctrines themſelves are not ſo eaſily learned as they may imagine. To inſtance in one of the propoſitions I mentioned before: <hi>he that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Before we can underſtand that, we muſt know what faith is; and in order to this we muſt be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the great objects thereof, as God, Chriſt, the Holy Spirit, the inſpired Scriptures: we muſt know God in his nature, attributes, and relations to us; Chriſt in his mediation and offices; the Spirit in his work and office; the revelation that God has made of himſelf in his word. Faith reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects all theſe; and no man can be ſaid to believe that doth not in ſome degree know what he is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; I might add, and upon what grounds. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we muſt underſtand the ſeveral acts of faith, its properties, and effects; the ſalvation promiſed to it; what it is, what it includes: and here is a large field, great ſcope for our enquiry and ſtudy, and which will neceſſarily lead the chriſtian to a frequent, diligent converſation with his Bible. So that however eaſy, how few ſoever, the eſſential, neceſſary doctrines of religion are, it is certain they cannot be learned without the Bible, nor without a faithful, and diligent uſe of it. They do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire indeed a great capacity, and ſtrength of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius in every one to underſtand them; but they require an humble, teachable diſpoſition, an honeſt
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:028262_0299_0FD7DAF4691ED718"/>heart, and a diligent ſerious ſearch, according to every one's ability.</p>
            <p>Again, according to the principle the perſons, I am now concerned with, act upon, I cannot ſee but the greateſt part of Scripture is rendered uſeleſs. If no more be neceſſary than a few ſhort, general propoſitions; why did God indict a book ſo copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and full of divine matter? Commit it as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and truſt to the care of his church? if a few ſhort ſentences and propoſitions, be all that are needful and uſeful, what ſerves the reſt of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for? why was it given? and how will theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reconcile their notion with the reverence they pretend to of the holy Scripture and its author.</p>
            <p>However, if but a little of the Bible be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary; the reſt is highly uſeful and valuable, and therefore ſhould not be neglected. And it muſt argue a vile contempt of ſacred truths to deſpiſe any of them under a pretence they are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that we may be chriſtians without them; be ſaved without them. We do not act at this rate in ſecular concerns, are not content with juſt ſo much food as is neceſſary to ſupport life; with ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire as is barely neceſſary to anſwer the end of cloathing; nor with ſo much eſtate as is abſolutely neceſſary to ſubſiſt us. And why ſhould we act ſo in the affairs of religion? I am afraid this modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth dot proceed from a nicer head in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing what is moſt important in ſacred things; but from a diſtemper of heart that leads us to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe them. David no doubt underſtood, as well as moſt others, the eſſential and neceſſary doctrines of religion; had well digeſted them, and was in full poſſeſſion of them; and yet how vigorous was his deſire after divine knowledge? how diligently did he purſue the ſtudy of divine ſubjects? that part of ſacred revelation, which God had then favored the church with, was his conſtant meditation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:028262_0300_0FD7F71BD3802830"/>Read cxix Pſal, and you will ſee the temper of that great and good man with reſpect to the law of God, or that ſyſtem of revelation the church then had. And if you rightly compare his ſpirit and your own, I am perſuaded you muſt either cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure David or yourſelves; and I leave you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider which is moſt reaſonable. I have ſtaid the longer upon this matter, though it may look like a digreſſion, becauſe I apprehend the diſcourſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſome, and that there may be occaſion for admonition and caution here.</p>
            <p>But to return, the Bible, I ſay, teaches us not only all that is neceſſary, abſolutely neceſſary, but many other things for our greater improvement and comfort. It gives us an entire ſyſtem of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths. You cannot expect I ſhould enumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them; though it may be proper to offer a few general hints.</p>
            <p>The Scripture delivers to us the great doctrines concerning God; his nature and attributes; his relations to us, and government over us; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trinity of perſons in the godhead; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence and the properties of it; that it is conſtant, ſovereign, univerſal, reaches to all perſons and things, and circumſtances of things. It deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to us, the doctrine of the creation: that the world was made, by whom, when, in what time, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the like: the ſtate and circumſtances of man in innocence; his fall, ſentence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. It acquaints us with the proviſion God made for the relief of apoſtate man, by the promiſed ſeed. It teaches us the great doctrines of morality; which we have abridged in the deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louge, commented upon in the Old Teſtament, and more fully in the New. It acquaints us with the great and glorious tranſactions of the Mediator; lays before us the plan and ſcheme of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:028262_0301_0FD7F7220E08AE90"/>as it was accompliſhed by him; gives us an account of his incarnation, life, doctrine and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, his death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, and ſitting at the right hand of God; with the beneficial offices he ſuſtains and executes. It acquaints us with the new covenant in the laſt edition of it; its duties and privileges; the office of the Spirit; his gifts, graces, and conſolations, with all the ſublime and excellent rules and laws delivered to the church by the Son of God incarnate; and by his miniſters. It makes known a future heaven, and in ſome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unvails the glories of it. Thus the Scripture is profitable for doctrine. It delivers all the great important doctrines of religion; and that ſo fully and particularly, that if we receive its inſtruction; we cannot be ignorant of any thing neceſſary for us to know.</p>
            <p>I would here obſerve, that theſe things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſereral parts of the Bible, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated there. The Old Teſtament has the fame doctrines with the New; that more obſcurely, this with greater clearneſs and explication. Moſes ſpeaks of Chriſt though with a vail on his face The one was a preparatory diſpenſation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded very much the ſame things with our goſpel, but under types, and ſymbolical repreſentations. In ſhort both had the ſame religion. But we have it in a more perfect ſtate, and in a clearer light.</p>
            <p>I might farther take notice that whatever ſome may object to the contrary; there is a great deal of method and order in Scripture. It begins with an account of the original of all things; with the ſtate of innocency, the fall of man, the early diſcovery of God's purpoſe of grace. It proceeds to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us how the world was peopled; with its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy; with the choice of a family, that of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, which God incloſed as his church; and the progenitors of the Meſſials. It gives an account
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:028262_0302_0FD7F7239763B778"/>of the particular revelations God made to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from time to time, gradually; and of the laws and ordinances eſtabliſhed among them, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny additionnal hints concerning the Meſſiah; the types and prophecies that inſured him till the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time</hi> came, and <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of of woman.</hi> The New Teſtament begins with his pedigree, genealogy and birth; carries us through at the circumſtances of his life, his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; gives us the hiſtory of the church in the firſt age of it; its conſtitution, laws, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; and foretells the ſtate thereof in after ages.</p>
            <p>In a word, though the doctrine of Scripture be not delivered in the method of our ſyſtems, there is a great deal of beauty even in the method of it. And I dare ſay, whoever will ſtudy it with compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent helps, and with humility, diligence, and a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reverence of God; with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> deference a worm owes to infinite wiſdom; will find himſelf not a little inſtructed and entertained, and his faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and eſtabliſhed: will ſee cauſe to admire even the method of Scripture doctrines, which the proud and cenſorious ſo much carp at.</p>
            <p>You will allow me to make a remark or two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other head, and I have done, viz.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With what advantage the Scripture teaches us theſe things; it is <hi>profitable for doctrine:</hi> and it is in a ſpecial manner ſo; more ſo than any other book, exceeds all other revelations; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when it is <hi>given by inſpiration of God.</hi> It may be expected a book from heaven ſhould appear with bright and diſtinguiſhing characters upon it; and that it ſhould teach in a way worthy of its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. And thus doth the holy Scripture. This has been ſhewn in part already in the foregoing diſcourſes. I ſhall only touch a few things here juſt to let you into my meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="unknown:028262_0303_0FD7F72C6FDD3C20"/>
The Scripture teaches us many doctrine that we could not otherwiſe have known: as the fall of man, the original of ſin, the trinity of divine perſons in the godhead, the incarnation, and whole doctrine of the mediator, the offices of Chriſt, and of the ſpirit, and indeed every thing that is properly goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: the entire method of our intercourſe with God through a redeemer. All this, with all its particulars, we owe to Scripture revelation. And then,</p>
            <p>The things that we might otherwiſe have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſomething of, the Scripture teaches more fully and certainly. I might inſtance in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and whole ſcheme of providence. It is known and I took notice of it before; how darkly and confuſedly the greateſt philoſophers talked upon theſe ſubjects. Some thought the world was made by chance; others thought it was not made at all, but was eternal. Some denied all providence; others confined it to the heavens, leaving this lower world to its own care and government. And all of them ſo diſtinguiſhed providence and limited it, as to make it a very uſeleſs and uncomfortable doctrine at beſt, if indeed it imported any thing. I might carry the like remark through a great many other inſtances; as the attributes of God, the immortality of the ſoul, and a future ſtate of rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments. Theſe ſubjects the philoſophers, who cultivated natural religion, talked of; but plainly diſcovered they knew very little of them. They talked backward and forward, as men in the dark, that could not tell what to ſay, or what to believe.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture is profitable for doctrine. It comes in here for our relief, and in a few texts ſcatters all theſe miſts, and gives a ſatisfaction in theſe great points, that in vain we ſeek for in all the books of the philoſophers. One of the ancient fathers triumphs on this head in behalf of the Bible.
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:028262_0304_0FD7F72F063E7320"/>
               <q>By virtue, <hi>ſays he,</hi> of faith, and the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, ruſtics and mechanics exceed the deepeſt philoſophers. Aſk a boy educated in the chriſtian religion, who made him? he will tell you God, which is more than Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or Democritus would have told. Demand of him, why he was made? he will anſwer to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy God. And hardly would Plato or Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras have replied ſo wiſely. Aſk him concerning his ſoul, he will tell you, it is immortal, muſt be judged according to the deeds done in the body, and be happy or miſerable forever. About which points ſuch great men as Socrates and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca could ſay nothing poſitively. So much are we beholden to the Bible, and ſo great the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we receive by it. It clears difficulties in ſuch doctrines, that the greateſt men in the world, deſtitute of its light, were puzzled with, and delivers the great things of religion to us with extraordinary clearneſs and certainty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I might add, it teaches with great eaſe. The philoſophers ſcheme of natural religion, as it was very imperfect, and uncertain to themſelves gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; ſo it was hammered out with much pains and labor. But divine doctrine diſtills as the dew; and the Scripture comment makes all the rules and principles, they diſputed ſo much, plain and eaſy.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, it teaches with authority. God's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is promiſed to accompany the Scripture revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It did ſo, in ſome degree, under the former part of it, the Old Teſtament: It does ſo more eminently under the New; which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the diſpenſation of the Spirit.</hi> And his office is not only to reveal the object, but to aſſiſt the eye, to remove prejudices, open the heart, enlighten the mind, and carry home divine truths to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men. And indeed the more glorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Scripture, are owing to the concurrence
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:028262_0305_0FD7F7312B050FC0"/>and influence of the Holy Spirit. The Bible is his book and allow me to ſay, he continues to be the teacher of it. O let us wait for, and depend on his inſtruction. You have heard how much you owe to the Bible, and what uſe you are to make of it. Be thankful for it, improve it for the purpoſes it was given; read it often, and diligently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint yourſelves with all its doctrines; and while you do ſo, beg for divine inſtruction, that the Holy Spirit may unvail your eyes, that you <hi>may behold wondrous things out of God's law.</hi>

            <p>TWO things I obſerved in theſe words, namely, the divine inſpiration, and great uſefulneſs of the Scriptures; and having treated ſomewhat largely concerning the firſt of theſe, I proceeded to conſider the other, which I entered upon in my laſt diſcourſe. The propoſition I laid down, is, <hi>that the holy Scriptures, or the inſpired wrilings of the Old and New Teſtament, are of great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſe to the church.</hi> Where I propoſed to ſpeak of the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſeveral parts thereof. In conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former point, I told you, I would confine myſelf to the particulars ſpecified in the text, and make it appear that it is <hi>profitable,</hi> or uſeful, <hi>for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Scripture is <hi>profitable for doctrine.</hi> This I have already ſhewn you, ſuggeſting what doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines the Scripture teaches, and with what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it teaches ſuch doctrines. And now I go on to the next particular.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Scripture is <hi>profitable for reproof,</hi> for
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:028262_0307_0FD7F733671D4E40"/>conviction of errors, as I before took notice. The word is underſtood by many in this place. And, indeed, this does not ſeem ſo much a new and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther property of the Scripture, as a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the former. As the Scripture is the rule and meaſure of truth, teaches us all neceſſary truth; what we are to believe and know in order to ſalvation; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>So that here I have a fit occaſion to diſcourſe upon the ſufficiency and perfection of the holy Scriptures. But as I have detained you too long in ſpeculation already, I ſhall not handle the ſubject in a controverſial way, nor trouble you with the arguments or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>avils of the church of Rome upon this head, who, as they ſet up another rule beſides, and contrary to the Scriptures; ſo they advance a great many things highly derogatory and diſhonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereto. But that I may diſpatch what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in a diſcourſe or two, as is my intention, I ſhall not enter upon a debate with them; only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a few remarks for clearing the propoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. The Scripture <hi>is profitable for reproof,</hi> or uſeful to detect and diſcover errors, doctrinal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me obſerve, that we muſt not extend it too far. It is not profitable for reproof and conviction of error in all caſes, as in philoſophy, polities, and the like. It is no argument that this or that problem in philoſophy, this or that theorem in mathematics, is falſe, becauſe not taught in Scripture; or that this or that ſyſtem of politics is wrong, becauſe we do not find it there. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, the Scripture was not wrote to inſtruct us in theſe things, nor doth it deliver all the doctrines that concern them. The uſefulneſs of Scripture
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:028262_0308_0FD7F733DB782290"/>for reproof, is parallel to its uſefulneſs for doctrine. It extends as far in the one caſe as in the other: but no further. In ſhort, it teaches the doctrines of religion, and convinces of errors in religion, but not in human ſciences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Scripture is a divine rule given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, all thoſe doctrines that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereto, or inconſiſtent therewith, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by it, they fall under its reproof and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. We muſt have recourſe <hi>to the law and to the teſtimony, whoever ſpeaketh not according to this rule, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> The Scripture is the ſtandard of divine doctrines, and whatever is advanced in religion, by whomſoever, or by what authority ſoever, if it doth not conſiſt therewith, it is to be rejected; it is an error, the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves and convicts it as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Thus the doctrine of Polytheiſm, or of many gods, with the worſhip and ſervice paid them, which overſpread the heathen world, is reproved in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which teaches us that there is but one God. The doctrine of the unitarians, that deny three divine perſons in the godhead, is reproved there alſo. The ſame may be ſaid of the doctrine of the Pelagians, that deny original ſin, contrary to that of the apoſtle, <hi>by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> And again, <hi>by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation.</hi> And <hi>by one man's diſobedience, many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> The Scripture is profitable for reproof here. If any ſhall (as many have both formerly, and at this day) queſtion this doctrine on account of the difficul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s of it, they ſtand convicted and reproved by the holy Scripture. Thus God has taught in his word, and we are not to oppoſe our reaſoning to our rule. The doctrine of the Antinomians,
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:028262_0309_0FD7F7379D423818"/>that diſcharge men from any obligation to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law, making it void as a rule of life, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting, what they call faith, inſtead of obedience; this alſo is reproved in Scripture, not only in a few texs, but it is indeed contrary to the ſcope and deſign of the whole of it. The doctrine of the Semi-Pelagians, or more rigid Arminians, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecial grace, the immediate concurrence, oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and influence of the Holy Spirit, is reproved there likewiſe. The apoſtle, I think, underſtood nothing of their doctrine, if he underſtood his own motto, as I may call it, <hi>by the grace of God I am what I am.</hi> He adds, <hi>I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> And again, <hi>it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> If it be ſuggeſted, that we are reaſoning creatures, capable of judging what is right, and chuſing what is beſt. I grant all this: but then, I ſay, we are ſinful, depraved creatures, and ſtand in need of the grace of God, of ſupernatural help and influences; this the Scripture teaches, and this, I think, every good man's experience confirms.</p>
            <p>I might inſtance in a multitude of doctrines, that the Romaniſts brought into the church, and by which they have in the groſſeſt manner corrupted the chriſtian religion; as the doctrine of tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, expreſsly confuted by our Saviour, who calls the bread in the ſacrament bread ſeveral times, even after conſecration. They ſay, no bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that it is turned into the body of Chriſt. Now if the Scripture be true, this doctrine is falſe. So their doctrine concerning worſhipping ſaints and angels, concerning many mediators, to whom they make application for ſuccour and relief, the Scripture reproves, when it commands us to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord our God;</hi> telling us, that <hi>him only</hi> muſt we <hi>ſerve.</hi> And aſſures us, there is but <hi>one mediator
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:028262_0310_0FD7F739E54123D0"/>between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I might mention ſeveral other doctrines, as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the maſs, their doctrine of merit, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, communion in one kind, denying the cup to the laity, and the like. All which are contrary to Scripture, and cannot be received without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>enching upon, and indeed deſtroying its authority is a rule of faith and practice. And, to mention no more, what ſhall we ſay of their Latin ſervice, or praying in an unknown tongue, which is a direct contradiction to what the apoſtle teaches and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, 1. Cor. xiv. If the apoſtle was herein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, we may be ſure theſe new teachers are far from infallible, whatever they pretend, and that their doctrine is falſe and erroneous.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Scripture being given by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, is a ſacred rule, a divine ſtandard and meaſure of doctrines; and whoever would impoſe upon us any articles of faith, or rules of worſhip, that cannot bear an examination thereby, or that contradicts our rule, are to be rejected.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the Scripture is a complete and perfect rule, ſo all doctrines that are beſides this rule, and not included in it, come under reproof. It is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument enough againſt them that they are not taught there. Of this nature are many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of divine doctrines, in which we are apt to add to the word of God, under a pretence of explaining it. I might inſtance in the free and too bold, as I apprehend it, explications of the doctrine of the trinity, the incarnation, the perſonal union of the word, with the man Chriſt Jeſus, the reaſons and ends of infinite wiſdom in the mediation of Chriſt and attonement made by him, the manner of the ſpirit's operations upon the ſouls of men, the nature and ſeveral ingredients of future bleſſedneſs, the manner and quality of the reſurrection of the body. I am miſtaken if the Scripture be not profitable for
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:028262_0311_0FD7F73C8B9558E8"/>reproof here, if we would harken to it. It reveals theſe doctrines, but it doth not reveal all we may be inqiſitive to know about them, and if we inſert in our explications what the Scripture doth not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, inſert as neceſſary parts of theſe doctrines, we are expoſed to the reproof and cenſure thereof. For if that be a perfect rule, it needs not our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and when we go beyond it in our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines we offend as well as when we go contrary to it.</p>
            <p>I add, as ſome tranſgreſs by ſupplying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of divine doctrines, ſo others by inventing new doctrines, about which the Scripture ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. In which reſpect the Romaniſts are notoriouſly guilty. They <hi>teach for doctrines the commandments of men.</hi> As in their doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the headſhip and ſovereignty of the Pope, infallibility, the ſeven ſacraments, and the reſt of the twelve additional articles of their Trent creed. The Scripture reproves theſe doctrines and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces them of error. They aſk ſometimes, where doth the Scripture condemn them? but ſuppoſing we could not ſhew them where they are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as often we can; it is ſufficient that it doth not command them, hath not revealed them. <hi>The Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for doctrine, for reproof, &amp;c.</hi> The apoſtle adds, <hi>that the man of God might be perfect, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed to all good works,</hi> Now, how ſhould <hi>the man of God be perfect</hi> by the help of Scripture, if any thing neceſſary for his knowledge and belief, was wanting therein. It cannot be a rule to us, nor can we conclude it given by inſpiration of God, if it doth not teach us all that is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As the Scripture is a divine and perfect rule, ſo it is a neceſſary rule. We are not to receive doctrines contrary to it, nor ingraft doctrines upon
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:028262_0312_0FD7F73F6AC6A348"/>it, and add them thereto; no more muſt we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the doctrines it teaches. <hi>Go forth,</hi> ſays Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his apoſtles in their commiſſion, <hi>and diſciple all nations, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> We muſt not make any thing neceſſary, which the Scripture has not taught and made neceſſary; neither muſt we overlook and diſpenſe with any thing it has taught and made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. A great many are reproved here by the authority of the Scripture, as well as in the other particulars mentioned before. We have groſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this with reference to the ſacraments. Some, you know, deny both of them, water-baptiſm as they call it, and the Lord's ſupper? though we have the inſtitution of both in Scripture, and that in moſt expreſs terms; and have both recommended to us by the conſtant practice of the apoſtles and primitive church. Others, though they own the ſacraments, yet take a liberty with them to change and model them at pleaſure. Thus, when Chriſt in the inſtitution of his ſupper delivered the cup as well as the bread, and ſaid, <hi>drink ye all of it,</hi> they with a ſtrange preſumption interpoſe here, and forbid the cup to the laity. Theſe errors the Scripture condemns and reproves. Nor can I ſee it is conſiſtent with the veneration we owe to it as an inſpired writing to aſſume this liberty to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of diſpenſing with its rules. If it be a divine revelation we muſt neither add to it, nor take from it. I may add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Scripture is profitable for reproof and confutation of practical errors, as well as ſuch as are doctrinal, as we call them, and ſuch as are more ſpeculative. It delivers a great many divine maxims for the government of the hearts and lives of men, and conſequently lays open ſuch errors as are contrary thereto. Thus that fatal error of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, or dividing our affections between God
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:028262_0313_0FD7F73FD2DE3728"/>and the creature, is condemned by that paſſage, <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, with all thy might, and with all thy mind;</hi> by that of the apoſtle, <hi>love not the world nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things that are in the world; for if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> an indifference and coolneſs in religion, preferring any preſent little intereſt to that of our ſouls, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by that Scripture, that bids us, <hi>ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all other things ſhall be added to us,</hi> by that which bids us, <hi>labor not for the meat which periſhes, but for that which endures to everlaſting life.</hi> And by that which cenſures the unreaſonable ſolicitude of Martha, even when ſhe was miniſtering to the Lord Jeſus himſelf, <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about many things, but one thing is needful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are certain divine principles of wiſdom and religion recommended in the word of God, by which it not only directs us in our choice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but reproves and cenſures us when we act contrary thereto. O endeavor to attend to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and reproof of the Scripture, bring your hearts under the authority of God's word: believe, chooſe, and act according to the precepts and rules of it. Admit nothing contrary to it as a doctrine of religion, nothing beſides it, nor neglect any thing in it. We are to receive it as a divine, perfect and neceſſary rule; and ſubmit to its reproof in all things as we ſtand obnoxious thereto. It follows,</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Scripture is <hi>profitable for correction.</hi> This, as I obſerved before, refers to manners: it corrects the diſorders in the converſation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which let me obſerve a few things briefly.</p>
            <p>It condemns all ſin without exception, and grants no indulgence to any iniquity. <hi>The law of God is perfect, converting the ſoul,</hi> Pſal. xix. 7. It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect in this reſpect, as it ſearches out all iniquity,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:028262_0314_0FD7F74040F262C8"/>points it out and cenſures it, and if we harken to its admonitions and teachings, converts the ſoul from it. Hence it follows, ver. 11. that the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, ſpeaking of the judgments or ſtatutes of the Lord, adds: <hi>Moreover by them is thy ſervant warned;</hi> warned of ſin, and warned of danger. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is often aſcribed to the holy Scripture, or word of God, particularly in Pſ. cxix. <hi>Thy word,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee,</hi> ver. 11. And again, ver. 9. <hi>Wherewith ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</hi> The word of God is a ſovereign remedy againſt ſin, when it is received with faith and treaſured up in the heart, as a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning principle there. It helps to cleanſe the way and courſe both of young and old. The rules and maxims of the moral philoſophers were in ſome things <hi>profitable for correction.</hi> They laid down many excellent rules for the government of the paſſions; but with ſuch a mixture and alloy of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tolerations, that their beſt ſyſtems were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſufficient to accompliſh a thorough reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Pride and vanity were virtues with them: revenge allowed, when a provocation was given and an injury received; and ſome very groſs vices were pleaded for by many of them, as I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to obſerve before. But the correction, the holy Scripture is profitable for, is more entire and complete. It extends to every corruption, and is levelled againſt every ſin, againſt the whole old man. It teaches to <hi>deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> Tit. ii. 12.</p>
            <p>Farther, it ſtrikes at the root of ſin in the heart and affections. Never did any inſtitution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion proceed with ſo much purity and divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as the Scripture does in this reſpect. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,</hi> ſays the law of God, Deut. xv. 9. It lays reſtraints
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:028262_0315_0FD7F7415EB4EA88"/>upon the inward deſires, the firſt motions of the heart, diſcerns and condemns ſin there. Hence, according to the doctrine of our Saviour, raſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is murder, and a wanton glance adultery, Matt. v. 22, 28. It purifies the fountain, and mends the principles from whence our actions flow.</p>
            <p>Again, it furniſhes the ſtrongeſt motives againſt ſin, oppoſes it with all the force of argument and perſuaſion. It repreſents, how much it is againſt our preſent intereſt, our peace and comfort, our honor, and even our profit in moſt caſes; and how utterly inconſiſtent with our future and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt God wrongeth his own ſoul. The wages of ſin is death,</hi> everlaſting death. In ſhort, <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven</hi> in Scripture <hi>againſt all ungodlineſs of men.</hi> It ſets a flaming ſword, as it were, to diſcourage ſinners, and throws terrors and deaths in their way. No book in the world doth or can appear againſt ſin with ſo much authority as the Bible doth. Did we believe its reports and conſider its threatnings in their utmoſt extent, view ſin in its connection with death and hell, according to the Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter, we ſhould not make ſo light a thing of it, as we are many times too apt to do: the very appearance of it would give us a ſort of horror. In a word, the account the Scripture gives of ſin, of its original, nature, tendency, preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and torments, and future puniſhments is a very proper means to keep us from it. Herein it is <hi>profitable for correction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will only add, that the Scripture <hi>is profitable for correction,</hi> as it is attended with an inward effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and force. <hi>The word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> It not only
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:028262_0316_0FD7F74C85C449B0"/>ſpeaks againſt ſin and condemns it, but ranſacks the heart, penetrates the conſcience, and riſes againſt it with a majeſty and authority that is peculiar to itſelf. Good men find this divine efficacy in the word. A text of Scripture will have more force to check and controul an unruly paſſion, than an hundred ſmooth harrangues of human compoſure. David experienced this ſovereignty and mark of divinity in the Scriptures, and celebrates it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pſalm cxix, and in other places. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it pleaſes God to give it the like efficacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners. <hi>The weapons of our warfare,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>are not carnal, but mighty through God.</hi> The word of God diſcovers vice and dethrones it, It has done ſo in a thouſand inſtances. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at the firſt preaching of the goſpel, which made one of the fathers glory of it in this reſpect. Shew me a paſſionate man, <hi>ſays he,</hi> and with a few words of God I will render him mild as a lamb, and the like with reſpect to the unclean, &amp;c. Thus <hi>profitable</hi> is the Scripture for correction and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. the only head that remains to be touched is, that it is <hi>profitable for inſtruction in righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, for inſtruction in all the parts of our duty towards God, towards our neighbor, and towards ourſelves. It teaches us, as is ſaid more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the goſpel, <hi>to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> We have there rules of perfect holineſs ſet before us, directing how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our appetites, ſenſes, deſires, affections, and paſſions; rules of temperance and chaſtity in thought, ſpeech, and behaviour; of meekneſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and the like: rules of juſtice towards men, in all our commerce or intercourſe with them. Our Saviour compriſes the ſubſtance of all in two maxims, that we <hi>love our neighbor as ourſelves,</hi> and
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:028262_0317_0FD7F74E20DEDF08"/>that <hi>whatever</hi> we <hi>would that men ſhould do unto</hi> us, we <hi>ſhould do even ſo unto them.</hi> Theſe are enlarged and commented upon in a variety of particulars, all tending to exclude injuries, oppreſſion, and every thing that is hurtful, and to eſtabliſh an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act decorum and equity in our mutual correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And with equal beauty and perſection, it preſcribes to us the ſcheme and method of converſe with God. It directs us to <hi>love</hi> him <hi>with all</hi> our <hi>hearts,</hi> to <hi>fear</hi> him, to <hi>truſt</hi> him, to <hi>delight</hi> in him, to <hi>worſhip</hi> him, to devote ourſelves to him, to chooſe him and reſt in him, as the only felicity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our ſouls, to make him the Alpha and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega, the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the end of our actions, and indeed the all in all.</p>
            <p>This is the general uſe of the holy Scripture. It was <hi>given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable</hi> for theſe high and noble purpoſes, <hi>for doctrine, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A reflection or two upon what has been ſaid ſhall conclude this point. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may ſee hence the vanity of that plea the church of Rome advances in behalf of oral tradition. They own with us, that the Scripture is given by inſpiration of God; but they pretend, that there are ſeveral divine doctrines, neceſſary truths not contained in the Scripture, which the apoſtles delivered to the churches by word of mouth. To this we have to anſwer, that it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed God ſhould indite a book, for the uſe of his church, and that book ſhould be defective in any neceſſary point. That the Scripture every where witneſſes to its own perfection. The text tells us, it <hi>is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, &amp;c. that the man of God may be perfect, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> And in the foregoing verſe, it is ſaid, that the holy <hi>Scriptures are able to make wiſe to ſalvation.</hi> Farther, we have
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:028262_0318_0FD7F74FED03C5F0"/>expreſs caution againſt theſe unwritten traditions. Thus in the Old Teſtament, <hi>You ſhall not add to the word that I command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh from it.</hi> And we find the whole Bible has a ſeal ſet to it, in ſhut up with this awful ſaying, that <hi>if any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the plagues written in this book. And if any man ſhall take away from the words of this book, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life.</hi> It is an inſpired book, <hi>is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,</hi> and for all the purpoſes of religion, is able to make the man of God, the miniſter, the chriſtian, perfect: perfect in faith, and perfect in all duties and offices. God has not left it to the caprice and humor of men to add to it, and change it at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If he had, it would be no complete rule, and would ſoon ceaſe to be any rule at all. I might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join a multitude of arguments againſt this ſorry pretence of the Romaniſts, was this a place to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate that matter. I ſhall only take notice farther, that the tradition they boaſt of has always diſgraced itſelf, and proved itſelf an impoſture. Their moſt early traditions have the moſt palpable marks of fable in them. As that of Papias concerning the Millennium; that of the primitive church, which occaſioned ſo ſcandalous a diviſion among them, relating to the time of keeping Eaſter. Had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition been any good rule, ſurely we might have expected it would have run clear, and not been ſo muddy at the very fountain head, as we find it was.</p>
            <p>Nor has their tradition only failed them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them into a direct oppoſition to the holy Scripture. For upon this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ock they have grafted ſeveral doctrines contrary to the inſpired writings, as purgatory, indulgences, their Latin ſervice, the ſacrifice of the maſs, &amp;c. Not to ſay, that they have among them traditions inconſiſtent one with another. In one age they eſtabliſh doctrines, as
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:028262_0319_0FD7F7543A2E64D8"/>ſacred and divine, by virtue of a pretended tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in another age are condemned as hereſy and loaded with an anathema: as, the eating of things ſtrangled, and blood, the immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the virgin Mary, and the like.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not enlarge on theſe things. You have your Bible, chriſtians, and there you have a perfect rule of faith and practice. Study that, and you will find it profitable for you in all reſpects. It will <hi>make the man of God perfect.</hi> If you neglect that, you will loſe yourſelf in the labyrinth of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fictions, and neither know what to believe, nor what to practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is the <hi>Scripture given by inſpiration of God, and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for inſtruction in righteouſneſs;</hi> let us uſe it for all theſe purpoſes, receive its doctrines, receive all its doctrines, acquaint yourſelves with what it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and reſign to its authority therein. This is a matter of no ſmall importance, and will require no ſmall induſtry and humility. Do not object againſt any of the doctrines of the Bible, becauſe they do not ſeem to ſtand upon a level with your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Whatever God teaches is true; and it is enough, ſhould be enough to us, that he teaches it, whatever difficulties there may ſeem to be in it. We ſhould learn to reverence infinite wiſdom, and ſubmit our narrow faculties to the conduct thereof. And then endeavor to receive all the doctrines of Scripture. It <hi>is profitable for doctrine,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ere is no doctrine of the Scripture that we ſhould eſteem unprofitable. Such a temper is profane, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it a ſort of blaſphemy againſt the divine wiſdom. God knows better than we do what is neceſſary and good for us, and wherein he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to be a teacher, we ſhould be cheerful and humble learners. Study therefore your Bible, and endeavor to be complete in all the will of God.
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:028262_0320_0FD7F755AC96D350"/>Whatever God ſpeaks, we ſhould be ready to hear. All <hi>Scripture is profitable for doctrine,</hi> and it very ill becomes us to neglect the greateſt part of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence that it is not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Farther, uſe it <hi>for reproof.</hi> Reject every doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine contrary to it, and that is againſt what it doth reveal, and every thing that is beſides and above what it doth reveal. Let it be the meaſure and boundary of your faith. Endeavor to come up to it, and not go beyond it.</p>
            <p>Uſe it <hi>for correction.</hi> Mind its admonitions, and allow yourſelves in no thoughts, deſires, words or acts the Scripture ſets a mark upon as ſinful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. This is to be chriſtians indeed. And according to our care and exactneſs herein, we are more or leſs chriſtians. Hearken to it, and let it correct every ſinful motion and diſorder in the ſoul, and every wry ſtep in your courſe of life.</p>
            <p>Once more, uſe it for your <hi>inſtruction in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> As it preſcribes to you in every part of your converſation, teaches you how to conduct yourſelves in your whole converſe in the world. To which purpoſe, it will be of exceeding advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to you, if you collected and wrote down the principal rules that refer thereto both under this and the former head. For inſtance, the Scripture rules for correcting the iniquity of our thoughts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires affections and actions, and the rules for the conduct of all theſe, write down the moſt pertinent Scriptures that refer thereto. Frequently peruſe them, commit them to your memories. Set them before you as matter of daily duty. Look upon it as your great buſineſs to practice according to theſe rules. Endeavor to be good proficients herein. And in proportion to your attainments in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo is your ſtature in religion. O that I could prevail with you to do this. Nothing in the world would be more your intereſt. And indeed without
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:028262_0321_0FD7F7623B68C938"/>ſome attention and care this way, you loſe the main advantage of the Bible; you only profeſs religion in a general confuſed manner; all you hear, and all you read in the Scripture will turn to little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Take this method, chriſtians. God has given you a book full of glorious excellencies. Uſe it for its proper end. And conſider for your encouragement, that if you believe it, ſtudy it, live it, it will be in every reſpect profitable to you: it will be <hi>a light to your feel, and a lamp to your paths;</hi> will ſupport you under your difficulties, fortify you againſt temptations, guide you in your duties, and carry you ſafe to heaven. Therefore make the holy, inſpired Scripture your rule, live under its conduct and influence, and you ſhall die with its comforts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come now to conſider the uſefulneſs of the ſeveral parts of Scripture. It is <hi>all profitable,</hi> ſays the text, every book and part of the Bible has its uſe, and is of ſervice to the church. What its uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is, I am now to enquire. The ſubject is copious, and of no ſmall importance; and yet I muſt very much paſs it over. Though I own it was one thing I had principally in view in the choice of my text. If nothing prevent, I may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor the ſatisfaction of thoſe that deſire it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and upon other occaſions. What I have before me, is, to ſhew the uſefulneſs of the ſeveral parts of the Bible. Concerning which I ſhall, firſt premiſe a few things, and then ſpeak to the ſubject more directly in another diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall at preſent only premiſe a few things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we have great reaſon to conclude that all Scripture is profitable and uſeful, in that it is given by inſpiration of God. Since he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, we may ſuppoſe it is uſeful and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, even though there were ſome parts and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:028262_0322_0FD7F762AE47CB28"/>of it that we could not underſtand. A wiſe man will not write a book of no uſe and value; much leſs, the only wiſe God. We find the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet celebrating God in his common providence, as inſtructing the huſbandman in the management of his affairs, and inferring, that there muſt be wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the management ſince it was from God. <hi>This cometh forth from the Lord of Hoſts, who is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in council, and excellent in working.</hi> What cometh forth from God, who is wonderful in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and excellent in working, cannot be worthleſs and inſignificant. And thus doth the Scripture, all Scripture, every part of it. And yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though all Scripture is profitable, it is not alike ſo, nor all uſeful for the ſame purpoſes. Some part of Scripture was written for one, other parts for a different end. It is not all uſeful for one and the ſame end: but all excellent and uſeful for its proper end. As in the work of creation God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all things good, very good: not that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature or ſpecies of creatures have the ſame degree of excellency, or anſwer the ſame purpoſe: but all are good in their place, and anſwer the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular end God deſigned them to ſerve. There is a mighty difference between a man and a brute, a ſeraph or an inſect; and yet both are good. So it is with reſpect to the holy Scripture, it is all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, excellent, and good; but it is not all alike important and excellent, nor doth every part of it afford the like inſtruction. I cannot therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the humor of ſome devout men, that when they have read a chapter of the Bible, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to enquire what they can find of Chriſt there. We have a great deal of Chriſt in the Bible, but not in every chapter of it. And we ſhould not look for him where he is not to be found. The Scripture is uſeful for many purpoſes. Some parts for one, ſome for another purpoſe. And we
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:028262_0323_0FD7F76498389F60"/>then make the trueſt and beſt uſe of it when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer every part to its proper purpoſe, what God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let me obſerve, that the Bible was not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at once, as a complete ſyſtem of divinity, and body of religion, but contains various, ſucceſſive revelations, gradually made, as ſeemed good to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom. <hi>God, who at ſundry times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe manners, ſpake to the fathers by the prophets,</hi> at laſt <hi>ſpake to us by his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was I to illuſtrate this, I ſhould give you a ſhort view of the different diſpenſations of religion, the different ſtates of revelation in the ſeveral ages and periods thereof; as, under Adam, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Moſes, and the Son of God incarnate. Adam had a revelation from God b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>h before his fall and after, a plan of religion delivered to him, upon which his intercourſe and acceptance with God was founded. This was continued among the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs with enlargements at ſeveral times; as under Noah and Abraham. And under Moſes a new pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar diſpenſation, a theocracy was introduced; not to ſet aſide any former revelations, laws, and methods of religion; but to ſerve the wiſe deſign of providence at that time, and to prepare for a fuller and more glorious ſtate of religion under Chriſt. Theſe ſeveral diſpenſations make up the Bible, and the ſurvey of them would ſhew you the progreſs of divine revelation, the uſefulneſs thereof, and, I reckon, would direct to the beſt method of explaining it. But this is what I muſt not now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every revelation God made to the world was deſigned for the uſe of the church, not only in the age when it was given, but in all future ages. The apoſtle tells us, that the <hi>things which happened</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> Indeed the church of
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:028262_0324_0FD7F7679D9F38B0"/>God, ſtrictly ſpeaking, is but one body, ſubſiſting at different times, and in different forms. Firſt in its infancy, then in a more improved ſtate, till it was brought to a ſtate of maturity under the goſpel, and at laſt ſhall be brought to a ſtate of full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in heaven. Now the revelation vouchſafed to the church, at any time, was for the ſervice of the whole body at all times. When any new reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was given forth, it did not make void any thing that went before, but ſuppoſed it was built upon it, and was ſupplemental to it, except in the caſe of the goſpels vacating the typical and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary diſpenſation of Moſes. And conſequently thoſe that live under the laſt diſpenſation of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when revelation is finiſhed and compleated are diſtinguiſhed by ſpecial advantages, which is our caſe that enjoy the goſpel. We have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all foregoing revelations, the light, inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, admonition, and examples of former ages, the whole treaſure of the holy inſpired Scripture, all the glories and excellencies of the Bible are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us and lodged in our hands. Let us be thankful for our privileges, and endeavor to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. If every part of Scripture be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and uſeful, to be ſure the entire Scripture muſt be ſo. But I muſt leave what remains on this ſubject to another opportunity.</p>

                  <p>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I PROCEED now to enquire into the particular uſefulneſs of the ſeveral parts of Scripture. It cannot be expected, that I ſhould examine the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of every book. That would require a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume rather than a ſermon. Nor can I go through the ſeveral diſpenſations of religion and diſtinct pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of revelation, and give an account of thoſe parts of the Bible that fall under each. How much advantages ſoever there might be in ſuch a method, I muſt here decline it. All I can do, is to make ſome obſervations upon the Bible, as divided into the ſeveral ſubjects of it. And I ſhall conſider it under the following heads, as containing hiſtories, prophecies, ceremonies, matters of morality, and doctrines.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the hiſtorical part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This is highly uſeful to the church. A great deal of it you know is wrote by way of hiſtory, and there is ſcarce any hiſtory in the Scripture but what affords abundance of divine inſtruction. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect a little on the firſt book in the Bible, Geneſis. A few chapters of that ſacred hiſtory are of greater
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:028262_0326_0FD7F7691DA6D5E8"/>uſe to the church than any large volumes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon writers. I will only take notice of three or four things of which we have an account in this book, and, I may add, in no other book in the world, but what borrows from it. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. The creation of the world. The philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that wanted the conduct of revelation, were utterly at a loſs and in confuſion about this matter, and run into wild and abſurd hypotheſes, as I had occaſion to obſerve before. Some of the beſt of them, that believed and acknowledged one God, ſupreme and eternal, and that he was infinitely good, thought his goodneſs muſt neceſſarily communicate itſelf, and thereupon concluded it did ſo from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and conſequently that the world muſt be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Now this hiſtory removes all ſcruples here, and ſatisfies all queſtions in a few words, tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> the world was made, made in time, and made by God, by a free, and yet powerful act of his will. <hi>Let there be,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and there was.</hi> His <hi>fiat</hi> or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign word brought all things into being. This clears all difficulties, and at the ſame time has ſuch a grandeur and majeſty in it, that Longinus allows it to be an inſtance of the true ſublime. <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning God created the heaven and the earth, and God ſaid, let there be light, and there was light. Let there be a firmament, &amp;c. and it was ſo.</hi> With how much majeſty is this ſpoken, and how fit to convey to the mind an idea of God's greatneſs, his infinite great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſts thereof by the breath of his mouth.</hi> How glorious a being is the author of this amazing work? how juſtly may we ſay of him as Job does, <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have here alſo an account of the degeneracy of the human nature, that lapſe or fall of mankind: a point about which all the philoſophers were puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled and nonpluſed. They found in themſelves, and
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:028262_0327_0FD7F76EF5AC3818"/>obſerved in the world, a ſtrange diſorder in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, that the paſſions and affections were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come headſtrong and impetuous, and that reaſon was not ſtrong enough to curb and maſter them. And hence ſome of the wiſeſt of them inferred, that reaſon had been ſome how weakened and hurt, and thereby loſt the dominion they ſuppoſed it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally had; though how to account for it they knew not. But this the Scripture hiſtory clears up. It tells us that man fell, and how he came to fall. In which it repreſents two things among others that ſuggeſt matter of admiration and caution to us, viz. The danger of pride and ſenſuality, the devil mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of the body of a ſeraph, or bright ſhining ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, inſinuated to the woman, that if they eat they ſhould be advanced to an higher ſtation, be as God in wiſdom and independency, and thus flattered their ambition and took with them, and then the fruit appeared pleaſant to the eye, as well as deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make wiſe; both their rational and ſenſitive appetites were flattered at once, and this hurried them into the tranſgreſſion, and occaſioned their fall. See here the danger of pride, and of pleaſing the ſenſes. It undid man in paradiſe, man in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and continues the great danger of mankind to this day. Another thing ſuggeſted in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the fall is, the ſhame and cowardiſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon ſin. No ſooner had Adam ſinned, but he hid himſelf among the trees of the garden. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preſence of God was his life and his joy, but now he runs away from it. <hi>I heard thy voice,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and hid myſelf, for I was afraid becauſe I was naked.</hi> Sin had ſtripped him of his innocency and his ornaments, and now the preſence and voice of his maker fills him with terror. And this is the natural fruit of ſin. However it appears during the temptation, when the pleaſure is over and the maſk is thrown off, it iſſues in bitterneſs, ſhame and
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:028262_0328_0FD7F770E6D4E330"/>horror. It is ſaid of our firſt parents, that <hi>the eyes of them both were opened and they ſaw that they were naked,</hi> they ſaw their guilt and were filled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion upon it. And thus it ſtill is with ſinners when conſcience is awakened.</p>
            <p>I might take notice of the inſtitution of marriage between one man and one woman, in oppoſition to polygamy. That practice which generally obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world, and is attended with ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, ſtands here condemned by the original ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God. And of the inſtitution of the ſabbath, or a ſeventh day of ſacred reſt and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after ſix days of labor. This was ſet apart by the example, benediction, and command of God immediately upon finiſhing the creation. It was inſtituted before the ceremonial law was in being, and conſequently, is of a moral nature, and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual obligation.</p>
            <p>I might add the original of the ſoul. It was not created with the body, and out of the duſt, as the body was, but created immediately by God, <hi>He breathed into him the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul.</hi> Plainly intimating, that it is diſtinct from the body, and conſequently can ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>Now theſe are points of ſuch high importance, that the little order and religion there is among mankind very much depends on them; and they are wholly owing to the hiſtory of the Bible. The three firſt chapters of it give more ſatisfaction in theſe, and the like great principles and doctrines of religion, than all the philoſophers in the world, that are deſtitute of Scripture light.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe things, not only as an argument of the great worth and uſefulneſs of the Scripture; but with deſign they may recommend and endear the Bible to you. Read the firſt, ſecond, and third of Geneſis, and there you may learn, what you may
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:028262_0329_0FD7F77C27129FE0"/>travel the world round in queſt of, and never learn unleſs you find a Bible, or converſe with thoſe that have lighted their lamps at this torch.</p>
            <p>And how valuable an hint is that, Gen. iii. 15. concerning the promiſed ſeed. When God was proceeding againſt the ſeveral criminals, in the midſt of that more awful ſcene he diſcovers the purpoſes of his grace, <hi>The ſeed of the woman,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head.</hi> The purport of which is, that an eminent and extraordinary perſon, who ſhould be the ſeed of the woman alone, ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the world, deſtroy Satan's kingdom, reſcue and deliver fallen man. This the apoſtle four thouſand years after refers to and owns the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of; <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> A glorious ſentence! of more conſequence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind than all the victories and triumphs recorded by the Greek and Roman hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>I might take notice of the univerſal deluge, the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, with many particulars relating to the patriarchs and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in which we have not only ſeveral wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and important events deſcribed, with a certainty and clearneſs, that in vain we ſeek for in other hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; but the divine providence ſet forth in the government of the world, the divine attributes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, his knowledge, wiſdom, juſtice, holineſs, and hatred of ſin manifeſted in ſuch a manner as is moſt fit to ſtrike the minds of men and beget in them a fear and reverence of God, and lay the foundation of divine worſhip and religion.</p>
            <p>You ſee I can only give you a taſte of things, and of the great uſefulneſs of the Scripture under this head. Should I purſue the ſubject, even in this ſuperficial manner, it would require many ſermons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="330" facs="unknown:028262_0330_0FD7F77E30162A58"/>
I will therefore only obſerve farther, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the inſtruction the ſacred hiſtory affords from the matter of it, its ſeveral narratives are generally ſo many confirmations of its predictions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. The hiſtory of Abraham and his poſterity, for inſtance, their ſojourning in Egypt, their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from thence, their ſettling in Goſhen, their apoſtacies, captivities, and reſtoration afterwards, are the fulfilling of the promiſe made to Abraham, of the prophecies uttered by Jacob when he was leaving the world, and the predictions of Moſes. So that this part of the Bible, which indeed is a conſiderable part of the Old Teſtament, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſeful to the church; it ſhews the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence governing the world in a ſovereign man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhews the divine knowledge in all events, and the truth of all his promiſes, and confirms our faith in the belief of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>As to the New Teſtament hiſtory, it is full of glorious events; your own knowledge will furniſh you with the particulars, and a little reflection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of the uſefulneſs of them. It relates the incarnation, life, miracles, ſufferings, crucifixion, reſurrection and aſcenſion of the Son of God; the pouring out of the ſpirit, the miniſtry of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and the ſurpriſing ſucceſs that attended it, and herein lays the foundation of the chriſtian faith and religion, ſtrictly ſuch, and at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms and eſtabliſhes a great part of the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not enlarge, you ſee by theſe hints, that the hiſtory of Scripture is profitable. Was it not beſides my preſent purpoſe, I might ſhew it was <hi>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> But I rather chooſe to take notice of its uſefulneſs more in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the hiſtorical, ſo the prophetical part of
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:028262_0331_0FD7F7809E8DFDB0"/>the Bible is profitable and uſeful. You muſt not expect, and I dare ſay, do not deſire, I ſhould make a collection of the prophecies, and go through every one of them, to ſhew their meaning and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs But as you have a good deal of the Bible in this ſtrain, it cannot be improper, I am ſure not impertinent to the ſubject, to touch upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſes of the prophecies.</p>
            <p>And it may be affirmed of them, as is ſaid of all Scripture in the text, that they are <hi>profitable for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> The prophets though they inſiſted much upon predictions, donouncing judgments, foretelling deliverances, ſalvations and the like; yet they did not confine themſelves to theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. They were a ſort of divine and extraordinary preachers to the people; one deſign of whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry was to preſerve a ſenſe of providence and religion among them; accordingly, we find their ſermons full of inſtruction, admonition and reproof.</p>
            <p>They give us noble ideas of God and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and call upon thoſe to whom they were ſent, to conſider their ways, to repent and reform. The Jews had a large body of ceremonial laws, in which they were very much employed, and we find they were apt wholly to place their religion therein. This the prophets take notice of, and frequently cenſure, calling them to mind the weightier matters of the moral law, juſtice, mercy, and the love of God, letting them know all their ritual ſervices would ſignify nothing, whilſt they neglected the great moral duties of religion. We have a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of inſtances to this purpoſe in the diſcourſes of the prophets; particularly, Iſa. xiii. 14. <hi>Bring no more vain oblations,</hi> ſaith he, in the name of God, <hi>incenſe is an abomination to me, the new moons and ſabbaths, the calling of aſſemblies I cannot away with:
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:028262_0332_0FD7F780B6E8DAB0"/>it is iniquity even the ſolemn meeting; your new moons and your appointed feaſts my ſoul hateth, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them.</hi> He adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Waſh you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the like ſtrain many of their diſcourſes run. Their office, in ſhort, was to guard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form religion, to teach juſt notions of God and providence, and to inculcate the important duties of the moral law. And for this purpoſe their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are of laſting and conſtant uſe. The ſermons of the prophets concern us, as well as the people to whom they were immediately ſent, and we ſhall find no ſmall advantage in a diligent peruſal of them. Here we meet with the moſt lively repreſentations of God in his nature, attributes, providence, and government. What an awful deſcription is that of the Supreme Being, Iſa. xl. 12, 15, 16. <hi>Who hath meaſured the waters in the hollow of his hand? meted out the heaven with the ſpan, comprehended the duſt of the earth in a meaſure, weighed the mountains in ſcales, and the hills in a balance? behold the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the balance: behold, he taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing. Lebanon itſelf is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to burn, nor the beaſts thereof ſufficient for a burnt offering. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him as leſs than nothing and vanity.</hi> And how majeſtic and yet comfortable is that repreſentation of him, Iſa. lvii. 15. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place; with him alſo, that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the hearts of the contrite ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we are furniſhed with ſuitable apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:028262_0333_0FD7F781F2720C18"/>of God, ſo we are inſtructed in our duty in an admirable manner; our duty towards God, our neighbor, and ourſelves. Micha ſums up all in a few words, chap. vi. 8. <hi>What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Theſe great branches of our religion are here enlarged upon, the contrary ſins pointed out in a way that is very proper to awe the conſciences and ſtrike the paſſions. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is the advantage of the prophetic writings in this reſpect. Nor, it may be, can the man of God, the believer, the chriſtian be better furniſhed any where for every good work than from hence. This part of Scripture is profitable, and it is well worth our while to ſtudy it diligently, to acquaint ourſelves with the doctrine, the language, ſtyle and phraſe of the prophets, hereby our minds will be enriched with excellent divine notions, armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and not a little aſſiſted in devotion.</p>
            <p>Again, the prophetic part of Scripture, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in predictions, is of mighty uſe, particularly, as it manifeſts the infinite knowledge of God, and his ſovereign providence over the world. We find there a multitude of ſurpriſing events at a vaſt diſtance foretold, which accordingly took place in the very time and manner ſignified in the prophecy. Now this ſhews, that all things, even future, as well as preſent <hi>are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do;</hi> that known unto the Lord are all his works from the beginning unto the end; that his eyes run to and fro throughout the earth, conducting with a ſteady ſovereign hand all things to ſuch iſſues, as he has foreſeen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. With what ſovereignty, how becoming is that ſpoken, Iſa. xlvi. 9, 10. <hi>I am God, and there is none like me; declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, ſaying my council ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:028262_0334_0FD7F788E31A0DB0"/>pleaſure.</hi> And when we ſee this done in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of numerous prophecies, it ſerves to give us high and exalted thoughts of the Deity, a reverence of his providence, and ſhould teach us to commit all affairs with faith, dependance and full reſignation into his hands, the affair of the church, and our own particular affairs.</p>
            <p>Farther, the prophetic part of Scripture is uſeful as it affords a ſtrong argument againſt ſin, and unto obedience. Some of the prophecies are declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's free and gracious purpoſes towards his people in this or that event; many of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of judgments againſt tranſgreſſors; or aſſurances of deliverance and ſalvation to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or obedient. Now, if we conſider theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies aright, conſider the deſign of them and their accompliſhment, we cannot but look upon them as ſo many ſtanding teſtimonies againſt ſin; of the evil and danger of it, of the good of obedience, and the like. He has deſtroyed kingdoms, families, perſons, for their iniquities, he has publiſhed his purpoſe before hand, and at laſt accompliſhed it in terrible vengeance. Stand in awe, O my ſoul, and ſin not, ſays the believer. This uſe we ſhould make of the prophecies of Scripture, and ſhall make of them, if we read them with attention, underſtanding and faith.</p>
            <p>I might add. though I cannot ſtay to enlarge upon it, that the prophecies were to thoſe that firſt received them, inſurances of future events. They brought diſtant things as it were before their eyes, and into preſent view. And conſequently, were a trial and exerciſe of their faith, their hope and truſt, and a direction in many particulars of duty.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the prophecies accompliſhed, and ſo viewed by the church in after-ages, are a glorious confirmation of faith. They ſhew us not only that the Lord is God, <hi>Elohim,</hi> governor of the world,
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:028262_0335_0FD7F7892318B208"/>that he rules in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; but they ſhew us alſo the truth of his word, the inſpiration and authority of thoſe that were employed to deliver it. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a greater evidence of the divine commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the penmen of Scripture than the ſpirit of prophecy that attended them; eſpecially when we ſee their predictions come to paſs. No man could ſay and declare ſuch things ſo long before hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God was with him. So that when we are read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prophecies we are reading the credentials of thoſe divine miniſters from whom we receive our religion, who have ſpoken to us by the word of the Lord, and in the name of the Lord. On which account, as well as others, we ſhould exceedingly value them, and delight in them.</p>
            <p>Once more, the prophecies are highly uſeful as they are a pledge and earneſt of the accompliſhment of ſuch events as are yet future and waited for. <hi>There failed not ought of any good thing,</hi> ſays Joſhua, <hi>which the Lord had ſpoken to the houſe of Iſrael, all came to paſs.</hi> Now when we ſee all come to paſs which God hath ſpoken, in ſo many inſtances here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, we may reſt ſecure that all which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be fulfilled, ſhall come to paſs alſo. God ſpeaks of our deliverance by Chriſt four thouſand years before the event, and this wonderful thing was accordingly made good. He has ſpoken of the revolutions of kingdoms and nations, their riſe and fall long before they were in the world, and all has come to paſs. Hence our faith may argue and conclude, even with a fort of triumph, that all God's promiſes and predictions in behalf of his church, ſhall have their accompliſhment in the time and manner he has appointed. For inſtance, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall be deſtroyed, all rule, authority, and power be put down under the feet of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt's little flock ſhall be preſerved
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:028262_0336_0FD7F78A283292B8"/>receive a kingdom; the dead ſhall be raiſed incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and the living ſaints changed. This a chriſtian may look for, and conclude upon with as much aſſurance as if he had heard the voice of the archangel, the trump of God, and ſaw the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus deſcend from heaven in his Schekina and glory. So many wonderful things foretold in Scripture have been already wonderfully accompliſhed, that we cannot reaſonably queſtion any thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be accompliſhed. No, heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but not one iota of the divine word ſhall fail. O be thankful for every part of Scripture, particularly for the prophetic part of it, and when you peruſe theſe glorious teſtimonies of God's wiſdom, knowledge, power and providence, endeavour to make a uſeful improvement thereof: celebrating and adoring God in what is paſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon him for what is future; remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the apoſtle, <hi>Whatſoever things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The ceremonial or ritual part of the Bible, is of uſe to the church. The Old Teſtament religion was much concerned in theſe things, in ſacrifices, waſhings, meats, drinks, the obſervation of days, &amp;c. and ſo large a portion of the Bible is employed about them, that it cannot but be worth while for a man that hath a reverence for it, to enquire into the meaning of ſuch inſtitutions, <hi>All Scripture is profitable,</hi> and ſurely this. Otherwiſe it had not been given <hi>by inſpiration of God.</hi> What the uſe and profit of it is, I am briefly to repreſent. You cannot expect I ſhould deſcend to particulars, and conſider the ſeveral rites of the Levitical law. All that comes within the compaſs of my deſign, is, to offer a few general remarks upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>The ceremonial or ritual part of Scripture, was
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:028262_0337_0FD7F79885F11A58"/>of uſe to the church, when the particulars thereof were in force, as they were the matter of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; tokens of God's ſovereignty and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over them, and expreſſions of their ſubjection. Though neither we, nor they that received the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial ſervices, ſhould be able to account for all of them, the will and appointment of God was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to determine the obedience of thoſe that were enjoined to obſerve them. The church was then in its non-age and infancy. And as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſometimes preſcribe to their children ſuch and ſuch ſervices, the deſign and end of which they do not underſtand, why might not God deal thus with his people at that time: and as the compliance of children in this caſe is acceptable and pleaſing, and of uſe to train them up to ſubjection, ſo, no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was in theſe inſtitutions of religion. Though the Jews knew not what God intended by ſome of the ordinances eſtabliſhed among them, they knew they were the laws and preſcriptions of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and wiſe creator and governor, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that their obedience would be acceptable to him and profitable to themſelves. And if we conſider the ceremonial law in this view, it is ſtill uſeful even to us, as it affords us an important ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and inſtruction, viz. to be ſubject to the will of God in all things, even when we do not clearly apprehend his particular deſign therein. There was a great deal of this in Abraham's ſaith and obedience; for which he is ſo juſtly celebrated, and mentioned with ſo much honor in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in the church of God to this day. <hi>Take now thy ſon,</hi> ſays God to him, <hi>thy only ſon, Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering, upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</hi> Strange! what can this mean? was he not the ſon of his hopes? the root of that glorious ſeed in whom all
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:028262_0338_0FD7F7988A5DA020"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed? and muſt he now be cut off by the hands of his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? what then would become of the promiſe? and yet Abraham makes no objection, but addreſſes himſelf to this difficult amazing duty; and for this he had an honor put upon him, by which he has been diſtinguiſhed ever ſince. God has a right to command, and it is our place to obey. And though his laws carry with them generally ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their reaſonableneſs, and we are convinced of their benificial, comfortable tendency; yet when it is otherwiſe, as it might be often in the caſe of the Jews, his will is reaſon enough. And indeed the more we are diſpoſed even to an implicit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the will of God, the more excellency there is in our faith and obedience. And when we find a people ſo long trained up in ſuch a courſe of obedience, it ſhould teach us to bow our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and wills to the divine revelation and will, even when we have not a clear underſtanding of the intention of the lawgiver.</p>
            <p>Again, the ceremonies and ritual ſervices of the law were uſeful to the church, as they were a means of abſolution, and of obtaining pardon of ſin. There were indeed ſome exceptions; preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinners had not the indulgence of a ſacrifice, were not allowed to bring their offerings, but were to be cut off. Nor could the blood of bulls and goats take away ſin, purge the conſcience, and make the comers thereunto perfect. They were not in themſelves of ſufficient efficacy for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But, as they were of divine appointment, and had a reſpect to the atonement of the Son of God, they were tokens and aſſurances of God's pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy and grace to them, and to the penitent and ſincere available, no doubt, for their real ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
            <p>Farther, they were uſeful as types of the Meſſiah;
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:028262_0339_0FD7F79A26F46598"/>as ſo many ſenſible aſſurances of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſes concerning redemption by Chriſt; <hi>The feed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head.</hi> This was the foundation of all that friendly intercourſe between God and man after the apoſtacy. Now every ſacrifice they brought and flew, was a ſort of a repreſentation of this great and glorious event. And hence, it may be, he is called the <hi>Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</hi> He died, as it were, in a figure, and hung upon the croſs as often as the ſacrifice died and was laid upon the altar. So that here was a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtitution to exhibit Chriſt. And when we look back upon theſe ancient records, as we ſee the venerable monuments of divine wiſdom; ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with the event, we have our faith not a little confirmed and eſtabliſhed. Chriſt was to come, to die, to juſtify us by his blood. The Jews had the earneſt of this in their hands, in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and other ſervices: and many hundred years after we have the thing itſelf; have ſeen the ſalvation of God. The ſame rites and ſhadows that directed their faith to Chriſt, confirm our faith in him.</p>
            <p>And then, theſe rites and ceremonies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as a diſtinction of that nation, to which they were given, from the reſt of the world. God choſe Abraham, and called him from among idolators to be the head of a peculiar people. His family was to be the ſeat of God's worſhip in a ſpecial manner: of them the Meſſiah was to be born, and that his birth and deſcent might certainly be known, it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to incloſe this family and people, and by peculiar laws and rites to divide between them and the reſt of mankind. They were not to intermix with the world about them, intermarry with other nations, worſhip, of freely converſe with them.
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:028262_0340_0FD7F79BC9E16F28"/>And to keep up this diſtinction, the law of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies was <hi>a wall of partition,</hi> as the apoſtle calls it, Epheſ. ii. 14. which was broken down when Chriſt came, the end, one end, of the incloſure being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. So that whilſt we peruſe this part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we may entertain ourſelves with the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of this great deſign of divine wiſdom and grace towards the church. God ſet apart that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſet a mark upon them from whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer was to deſcend. He was to be the ſon of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, of the family of David; and thus the Scripture aſſure us he was. <hi>It is evident,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>our Lord ſprung out of Judah.</hi> It was a matter of the laſt importance to know the Meſſiah when he appeared, that this was he that was to come, and that we muſt not look for another. Now that this might be manifeſt to the church, God thus ſeparated the family and nation from whence he ſprung.</p>
            <p>Again, this part of Scripture revelation is uſeful, as it tends to give us high notions and an auguſt idea of Chriſt and the chriſtian religion. All this glorious apparatus, and the laws and ſervices of that diſpenſation, which were the ſtudy and employment of the church for ſo many hundred years, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to introduce the goſpel ſtate. And with what ſolemnity do they introduce it! the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, his ſacrifice, and our redemption by him, are among the chief of the works of God; the greateſt myſteries of his grace. And methinks, when it is conſidered that the glory of the Jewiſh temple, and all the ſervices thereof, all the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and rites of a law revealed from heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to this, and were to iſſue and terminate in it; and indeed were contrived on purpoſe to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the goſpel, to proclaim Chriſt, and to uſher him into the world; when we conſider this, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly reflect upon the providence of God therein,
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:028262_0341_0FD7F79D4B2D0DB0"/>we cannot but infer the glory of the goſpel ſtate. Let us make this uſe of that part of the Bible, that to many appears uſeleſs. We may judge of a building in ſome meaſure, by the greatneſs of the ſcaffolding. Certainly ſuch a vaſt preparation was never deſigned to introduce a thing of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I add, this part of revelation and ſtate of religion is of uſe, as it may adminiſter cauſe of thankfulneſs to us, that we are under an higher and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpenſation. The apoſtle often ſpeaks of the Jewiſh law in terms of great diminution. He calls the ceremonies thereof, the <hi>elements of this world, beggarly elements,</hi> ſpeaks of the law as <hi>a ſchool-maſter to bring us to Chriſt;</hi> as inſufficient; <hi>a ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> and repreſents the ſervices and laborious performances of it, as a yoke, that neither the Jews of that age, nor their <hi>fathers were able to bear.</hi> Now among other advantages we have by the levitical law, this is one, the exciting our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for the more manly, ſpiritual, rational reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the goſpel. Not but that there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in their religion, and a reverence due to it, as it was the appointment of God. No doubt, ſerious upright perſons enjoyed acceptance with God, and intercourſe with him in it. But that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was nothing, compared with the glory of the goſpel which excells. Now when we find in what low ſervices, comparitively, their religion conſiſted, we ſhould rejoice and be thankful that we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to more noble and divine work.</p>
            <p>Once more, the ceremonies and rites of Moſes were uſeful to the church at that time, and are ſtill uſeful to us, as they contain many moral documents and inſtructions. I might go through a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of particulars, and at large illuſtrate this; but can only him at things in a general way. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion refers to the inward mortification of ſin, and
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:028262_0342_0FD7F79E6369EEE8"/>was deſigned to teach the neceſſity of it. <hi>Circum-caſe,</hi> ſays Moſes, <hi>the foreſkin of your hearts, and be no more ſtiff-necked.</hi> And the apoſtle plainly intimates the ſame, when he makes the true <hi>circumciſion of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</hi> Their various waſhings and purgations preached to them their defilement by ſin, and the neceſſity of inward and outward ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Their thank offerings were an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their dependance on God, teaching them and us how reaſonable it is we ſhould daily own our daily benefactor. Every offering for ſin repreſented the evil and demerit of it, and was a ſignal that the ſinner deſerved to die, that his life was forfeited to the juſtice of God. Accordingly, there was a confeſſion of ſin conſtantly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied ſuch ſacrifices, by which the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reformation was urged upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and was owned by them. In ſhort, the law was an emblem of the goſpel and the religion thereof. It held forth in a figure the death and ſacrifice of Chriſt, the purity, holineſs, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of chriſtians, their ſeparation from the world, and from all uncleanneſs. All the ſacrifices that referred to ſin, all the laws about uncleanneſs, and means appointed for purifying, were public ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the neceſſity of holineſs and purity both in heart and life. And we ſhould now read them as ſo many admonitions thereto, and cannot better improve them, than by a thorough compliance with the rules of the goſpel, which are the moral of thoſe inſtitutions. In this ſenſe, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that even this part of Scripture, which may be looked upon of leaſt value and uſe, and that ſome have very rudely objected againſt as abſurd, and unworthy of a divine lawgiver; that this is profitable to the church. It anſwered wiſe
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:028262_0343_0FD7F7A11CEDD688"/>and great purpoſe at the time it was given, and was in force, and continues ſtill highly uſeful. Let me add,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The moral parts of Scripture are profitable. By which, I mean, thoſe books that concern the direction of our faith, the furniſhing us with good principles, and eſpecially that concern the conduct of our lives.</p>
            <p>The book of Job repreſents a ſurpriſing ſcene of providence, full of great and excellent inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Particularly it repreſents the malice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of Satan in proſecuting his deſigns againſt us; how watchful he is to gain and improve occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to our hurt. This appears in his management againſt Job. He waits and ſeeks for a commiſſion againſt him, which he no ſooner obtains, than he improves it to its utmoſt extent, and as far as he could go. Here we are taught what the apoſtle long after takes notice of, that <hi>we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This book alſo repreſents the ſafety of good men under the divine protection. <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him,</hi> ſays Satan concerning Job, <hi>and about his houſe, and about all that he has on every ſide?</hi> Our families, perſons, I may add, our names, reputations, our bodies, and ſouls, all are in the hands of God; neither men nor devils can hurt us without permiſſion from heaven. This we learn from that ancient book, it may be, the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the world, written many thouſand years ago. And how comfortable is it to find it there,? Good men are ſtill encircled by the ſame divine arm. God makes <hi>an hedge about them, and about all that they have. Lord, how are they increaſed that trouble me?</hi> ſays <hi>David, many there be which ſay of my ſoul, there is no help for him in God.</hi> He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ds, <hi>But thou,
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:028262_0344_0FD7F7AD7B5262D8"/>O Lord, art a ſhield for me, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.</hi> And ſays our Saviour, <hi>fear not, the hairs of your head are all numbered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, It repreſents the ſovereignty of divine providence in the government of the world, and in the diſpoſal of the affairs of particular perſons. The devil could do nothing againſt Job without a commiſſion from heaven. And that which I would here more eſpecially obſerve, is, that his upright, good, and perfect Man, as he is called, is by the providence of God brought under a courſe of exerciſes and trials, a ſeverity of diſcipline, the greateſt that, it may be, any ever met with. God is righteous in all his works, but he is ſovereign in all his providences; and we ſhould learn by this inſtance, to ſubmit to him an any, in all his rebukes how heavy ſoever. He has wiſe ends in all he doth; will be faithful to his word, and take care of his upright, ſincere ſervants. But this does not exempt them from trials and ſufferings. When you ſee Job, ſo eminent and holy a man, paſs through ſuch a ſeries of afflictions, amazing afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; learn to reverence the divine ſovereignty. Do not think much at any of the trials that may be your lot and whatever God doth, own his authority; <hi>Be ſtill, and know that he is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father, this book repreſents to us an example of patience truly glorious, not without flaws and imperfections, but yet truly excellent and glorious. God ſmote Job, lies in the duſt, and when he was ſtripped of all, ſubmits and adores. <hi>The Lord hath given,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> And even after a moſt diſmal train of calamities, it is remarked of him, that <hi>in all this Job finned n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> We have heard of the patience of Job, as the apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it. We here read the hiſtory of it, and we

            <p>And then, this divine book repreſents God in his ſovereignty, majeſty and greatneſs, and that with more life and advantage than perhaps any other book in the world. It gives us ſuch a view of him in his works and providence, and his excellencies, and ſhould awe and impreſs our minds, and ſilence our complaints. Even Job forgot himſelf, and was too bold, till God came forth and diſplayed his glory; and this reduced and humbled him. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor myſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is repreſented the weakneſs and infirmity of good men, even the beſt of men. It was one deſign of God in this diſpenſation towards Job, to exerciſe and manifeſt the integrity, and uprightneſs of his ſervant, to confute Satan, and ſhew that Job was not an hypocrite, as he inſinuated. But though Job ſhewed his integrity he ſhewed alſo his infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; though Satan was baffled, Job was humbled. And, it may be, had he ſtood his ground under ſuch ſhocking trials, without diſcovering any frailties, it might have been more dangerous to him than his miſcarriages. God hereby humbled him, taught him dependance, let him ſee his meanneſs and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency. Good men, the greateſt men in this life can go through no difficult work, no difficult trials, but it will many ways appear they are men, but men, ſinful, frail creatures. And though they are owned, accepted and honored of God, it is ſtill upon terms of humility and repentance, and in ſuch a way as leaves the ſucceſs of all, and the glory of all, to God, and to the praiſe of his grace.</p>
            <p>I add, here is repreſented the care of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wards his faithful ſervants, and the comfortable iſſue of all their trials and conflicts. We do not,
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:028262_0346_0FD7F7B11C4CB488"/>I grant, always ſee this at preſent, and in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as in Job's caſe: But <hi>it ſhall be well with the righteous;</hi> God will not forſake the ſoul that ſeeks him. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright man, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> God will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port perſons of this character under all their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, dangers and fears; and in due time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deliver them. <hi>No temptation ſhall befall them but what is common to men,</hi> and God <hi>will with the temptation make a way to eſcape, that they may be able to bear it.</hi> They may be obſcured for a ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, not deſtroyed.</hi> No, their <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> ſhall <hi>go forth as brightneſs, and</hi> their <hi>ſalvation as a lamp that burneth.</hi> Job was conducted through a ſcene of ſorrows and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that even his three pious and wiſe friends, thought it would have been his ruin. But God meant not ſo. He had deſigns of kindneſs towards him, and he knew how to deliver the righteous out of temptation, and to ſave him in it, and under it. All good men may expect the like ſuperintendency of divine providence, and ſupply of divine grace. If your hearts be upright with God, as Job's was, God will be your defence as he was his. He will reſtrain your enemies, pardon your infirmities, though it is fit he ſhould ſhew you them, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you for them, and at laſt be your ſalvation.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, there are many glorious leſſons in this book, a ſcence of providence that one may peruſe and contemplate with exceeding great advantage. O learn to underſtand the uſe of your Bible, and of the ſeveral parts thereof, and I am confident, you will never think meanly of it.</p>
            <p>I might illuſtrate my point by the like reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the book of Pſalms, and the reſt, but have not time. One great advantage of that book is, that it deſcribes the various ſtates, poſtures and frames of devout ſouls. It ſometimes ſhows you
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:028262_0347_0FD7F7B326626698"/>the good man low and down, full of fears and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency, lying in ſackcloth, and watering his couch with his tears. And then riſing out of this ſtate, putting off his ſable, and girded with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is indeed a glorious treaſure of devotion, as well as a directory for life. And I am ſatisfied it would be well worth our while, not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to read it, but to commit as much as we can of it to our memories. This is what many of the primitive chriſtians have done, and others ſince, with great advantage. If this does not turn to better account than furniſhing, I might ſay debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your minds with ſuch ſorry traſh as plays and romances generally, at leaſt, are, I am utterly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. The one is the food, ſolace, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of divine minds; what ſhall I ſay of the other? but that they are huſks for ſwine to feed upon.</p>
            <p>The book of Solomon's Proverbs and Eccleſiaſtes have a great deal of excellency in them, and are highly uſeful. The one is a lively deſcription of the vanity of preſent enjoyments, and the other affords the moſt admirable maxims of wiſdom. Many of the diſcourſes of the moral philoſophers, as Plutarch, Seneca, Epictetus, and Antonine, are juſtly celebrated in the world. And indeed they want not their excellencies, great excellencies. But here we have not only higher ſtrains of wiſdom, but the precepts of it delivered with more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and authority. The philoſophers were, many of them, wiſe obſervers of human nature. They knew its infirmities in ſome meaſure, and knew how to preſcribe for a cure. But the writers of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine books were conducted by the author of nature, that perfectly underſtands man, knows what there is in him; and therefore their maxims are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us, not only by the intrinſic excellency
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:028262_0348_0FD7F7B46356C4A8"/>of them, but by this diſtinguiſhing circumſtance, that they are all true, infallibly true. And we may be ſure, as they are true, ſo they are pertinent to the caſes they refer to, and by the bleſſing of God ſhall be effectual to thoſe that receive and apply them.</p>
            <p>Let theſe hints recommend the Bible to you, and the ſeveral parts thereof. If there be ſome things in it, we do not well underſtand, we ſhould not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil againſt the whole on that account, but ſay as the philoſopher did when he had read the writings of a man of fame, <hi>what I underſtand is excellent,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and I preſume what I underſtand not is ſo too.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this reverence is due to God, whoſe book the Bible is, due to infinte wiſdom. Acquaint your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſeveral parts of Scripture, though you ſhould be moſt converſant in thoſe parts that are moſt uſeful. Beſides the knowledge we ſhall thereby gain, we may expect the divine preſence and bleſſing with us when thus employed. When we are diligently and ſeriouſly reading our Bible, we are on holy ground, as I may ſay, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, may hope, God will be with us, ſhining in upon our minds, drawing our affections to himſelf, ſhedding abroad his love in our hearts, pouring out his ſpirit upon us, more and more ſanctifying us by his word. O endeavour that the <hi>word of God</hi> may <hi>dwell richly in you,</hi> remembering the character of the bleſſed man, that <hi>his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and night.</hi>

                  </bibl>
                  <p>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I COME now to the application of the many diſcourſes I have given you, and ſhall diſpatch what I further deſign in a ſingle ſhort diſcourſe, and ſo conclude the ſubject. And here I ſhall only offer a few practical reflections. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Scripture be given by inſpiration of God, it ought certainly to be treated with great eſteem and reverence among men. As it is the word of God, indited by the Holy Spirit, a book ſent from heaven; it challenges a peculiar regard, and ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from all human wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. This every one muſt allow that believes it to be inſpired. Let us therefore be careful to treat this holy book in a ſuitable manner. The apoſtle expreſſes his great ſatisfaction concerning the Theſſalonians, that they received the goſpel preached to them, <hi>not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God.</hi> Let it appear that we thus receive the Bible, receive it as a divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, particularly by our reverence of it. If it be aſked, how muſt we ſhew our reverence? I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a diligent attentive ſtudy of it. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:028262_0350_0FD7F7BB59C07010"/>and uſefulneſs of the matter of Scripture demands this of us. But what I now inſiſt upon, is the conſideration of the author. It is from God, and therefore a ſpecial reverence and eſteem is due to it; which we ſhould manifeſt by our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto, and careful peruſal of it.</p>
            <p>All writings are commonly received or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the qualifications or characters of their authors. Nothing is expected from books publiſhed by ignorant, trifling, or mercenary wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and therefore ſuch are generally deſpiſed by men of ſenſe; while the productions of authors of a different character, of better learning, capacity, and more integrity, are proportionably better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and eſteemed, and more pains is taken to find out their deſigns, to take in their ſchemes, and to underſtand their arguments and way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They are read with application, and not only once, but often, it may be, according to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the author, or the opinion of the book it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And in the writings of thoſe great men, that hold the firſt rank, every ſentence and line, and almoſt every word, is thought to have its weight, and not to be ſet down careleſsly, without a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or neceſſary uſe. With what pains and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence have men weighed the particular words, and even the ſituation of them, in the compoſures of Plato, Tully, Homer, Virgil, Horace, Terence, and others. Now if the reputation of wiſdom and ſkill in human books, thus commands our reverence and attention; what is due to the book of God? I am not comparing the contents of theſe writings, the important deſign and tendency of them; but merely conſidering the authors, and I know you will allow me to ſay, that if we reverence this or that piece of antiquity for the name of its author, no book challenges ſo much reverence from us as the Bible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="unknown:028262_0351_0FD7F7C3B03D4228"/>
Well then, let us ſhew our regard to it by the pains we take in it. Many have ſpent their time, and the greateſt part of their lives in criticiſms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of the heathen authors, ſettling the reading and marking the beauties thereof. How will this diligence reproach us, if we neglect a book that can claim the only Wiſe God for its author?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhould ſhew our eſteem and reverence for the Bible, by a ready and univerſal ſubmiſtion to its authority, even in ſuch things as we cannot fully underſtand, nor are able to account for. We are apt to pay a ſort of implicit veneration to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of great men. Much more ſhould we do it to the word of God. As he is infinitely wiſe, holy, juſt, and good; we may be ſure he is neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf, nor can deceive us; that nothing comes from him that is falſe, nothing that is weak, nothing that is imperfect; that all he has revealed is true, pertinent, wiſe, and beneficial; proper to anſwer the end he had in it. And accordingly we ſhould entertain every part of his revelation with reverence, knowing from whence it proceeds. The want of this principle has ruined the faith and religion of multitudes. They object againſt this or that in the Bible, becauſe it does not agree with their reaſon, that is, with their prejudices and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; as if infinite wiſdom muſt be meaſured and governed by our narrow and ſhort views. Thus ſome find fault with the rites and ceremonies of the Moſaical law. They cannot underſtand the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onale of them and are ready to call them abſurd; thus meaſuring God by themſelves. Others object to the great doctrine of atonement by the ſacrifice of the Son of God and ſaving ſinners through his mediation. This they cannot underſtand and therefore will not believe. Some from the ſame vanity neglect the ſacraments of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They cannot ſee of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> advantage it is to
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:028262_0352_0FD7F7C6A7D3BD60"/>eat a bit of bread and drink a little wine; what this can contribute to the improvement of the mind. And it is well if ſome do not encourage themſelves in groſs ſins to the like conſideration. Surely, ſay they, God will not damn a man for taking a little pleaſure out of the way. What harm can there be in gratifying the inclinations God has given us in inſtances agreeable thereto? they cannot ſee any injury to the Supreme Being herein, nor believe he will ever puniſh offences of this kind ſo ſeverely as is pretended. But this is not to reverence the Bible and treat it as a revelation from God, but to ſet up our own fooliſh fancies in oppoſition thereto, to make ourſelves God's counſellors, and even correctors. And indeed the ſame principle would carry us to cenſure any of the works of nature, and find fault with them as not reaſonable, not well contrived, not well placed. And thus vain men profanely change place with God, get upon his throne and bring him to the bar. Infinite patience! that bears with ſuch worms, and does not frown them into hell in a moment. If the Scripture is given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, what we have to do, is to make all our reaſonings ſubmit to it. Though we do not underſtand ſome of its preſcriptions, it is enough they are from heaven. That ſhould determine our faith, and ſilence all cavils. We know not what it is to be creatures till it is thus with us, much leſs chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Shew your reverence and eſteem of the Bible by a firm adherence to it, and to the religion it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, whatever temptation you may have to the contrary. It is the moſt valuable treaſure God has entruſted us with, and we ſhould reſolve by his grace, that no terrors, nor death, ſhall wreſt it out of our hands. The zeal of the primitive chriſtians in this reſpect, is well known. They would rather ſubmit to any tortures, than give up their Bibles
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:028262_0353_0FD7F7C97B79FB90"/>at the demand of their enemies. And thoſe among them that through fear complied, and would quit their Bibles to ſave their lives, were looked upon as infamous, and rejected as unworthy of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the chriſtian church. They were called <hi>traditores,</hi> ſuch as delivered up their Bibles, a name of the utmoſt reproach and ſcandal among them. Euſebius mentions one Marinus, a military man, who being diſcovered to be a chriſtian, was ordered to determine in three hours, whether he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his office, or his profeſſion. In the mean time, Theobectus, biſhop of Caeſaria, comes to him and ſhewed him a ſword, the badge of his office, and a Bible, the repoſitory of the chriſtian faith, and bid him chuſe which of the two he would have, for he muſt not keep both; upon which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently choſe the Bible, and was crowned with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. Should we ever meet with the like trial, we ſhould make the like choice. We do not treat the Bible worthy its original, if it be not dearer to us than our lives. Nor ſhould we part with the religion of the Bible, and give it up in complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to the faſhions of the age, or humors of thoſe we converſe with. The Bible is from heaven: believe it, live by it, whatever meaſures others are pleaſed to walk by. Let this preſcribe the rules of your converſation, your religious worſhip, and of all your actions, and be not aſhamed of the religion of the Bible, becauſe it may be not agreeable to the cuſtoms and modes that may obtain in the world. A chriſtian muſt herein be reſolute. The holy Scriptures are his rule, and the reverence he has for them, muſt carry him through all diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and oppoſition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Shew your eſteem and reverence of the Bible by the manner in which you read it and converſe with it. Even an outward reverence is due. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould put their bodies into a decent poſture
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:028262_0354_0FD7F7C984024A78"/>when they read the word of God, and eſpecially ſhould be careful to poſſeſs their minds with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and devotion. Conſider it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> divine book, that God is ſpeaking to you, and that you are converſing with him in it, and accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have yourſelves becoming ſuch a preſence, with a due deference and reſpect to ſo high an authority. Again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whenever you mention any part of Scripture, let it be with ſuitable reverence and eſteem. Do not make the Bible a common-place book of jeſts, as the manner of ſome is, quoting a text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to divert their company, which favours not a little of profaneneſs, and indeed is like Belſhazzar's carouſing in the conſecrating veſſels of the templ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> Guard againſt all libertiniſm of this kind. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Bible is a ſacred book, and do not proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it to ſo low a purpoſe as ſerving a jeſt, borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its phraſes to adorn a piece of wit, or promote mirth and laughter. Farther,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Shew your eſteem of the Bible, by your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it. David was famous for this, as is known to all that know any thing of his character: <hi>O how I love thy law,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it is my meditation all the day.</hi> And he himſelf makes it the character of the pious man, that <hi>he delights in the law of the Lord, and</hi> therein <hi>doth he meditate day and night.</hi> And as this is due from us, in conſideration that God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this book, ſo it is due on the account of the excellency and uſefulneſs of it, the tendency it has to improve and enrich the mind. It is obſervable, that after the juſt now mentioned character of the good man, That <hi>his delight is in the law of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> it follows, <hi>He ſhall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; his leaf alſo ſhall not wither, and whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper.</hi> He is ordinarily the beſt chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian that is moſt converſant in his Bible, and that takes moſt pains in the ſurvey of it. He is moſt
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:028262_0355_0FD7F7C988FE3348"/>likely to be fruitful, thoroughly furniſhed to all good works. When the word of God dwells richly in you, you will be able to admoniſh one another, and to abound in the fruits of righteouſneſs. Once more,</p>
            <p n="7">7. Show your eſteem of the Bible, by propagating the knowledge of it, and eſpecially in your families and among your children. This has been the way of good people in all ages. <hi>Timothy from a child knew the holy Scriptures,</hi> as the apoſtle obſerves in the verſe before my text. The Jews were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to teach the words of their law to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> to teach them <hi>diligently unto them, and talk of them when they ſat in their houſes, when they walked by the way, when they lay down, and when they roſe up.</hi> And however defective they were in many other things, they expreſſed an extraordinary zeal in this matter. Their children were trained up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their law, even from their infancy; and were ſo expert therein, that Joſephus tells us, they knew every thing in it as fully as their own names. And the like care was ſhewn by the primitive chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Nor indeed can it be ſaid, that we treat the Bible as the word of God, and pay a veneration to it as ſuch, if we neglect to teach it to our children. The humor of the age, as it runs counter to almoſt every thing that favors of true religion, ſo it has given an odd turn to the education of young perſons. One of the early fathers of the church gives direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in one of his epiſtles for the education of a young lady of a noble chriſtian family, he adviſes, that as ſoon as ſhe was capable ſhe ſhould learn the Pſalms, Proverbs and Eccleſiaſtes; next he taught the four goſpels, to have them always in her hands; then get the Acts and Epiſtles by heart, and after that paſs to the reading of the Prophets. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle there is of this in the preſent diſcipline of moſt families, I am aſhamed to ſay. Muſic, dancing,
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:028262_0356_0FD7F7CAF6B07530"/>play-books, and ſome light and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are the main things attended to now in edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; which no doubt is one great cauſe of that degeneracy we ſo much complain of in the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chriſtian religion. Certainly, we ſhould either diſown this book or make another uſe of it than commonly we do.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nlarge farther on this point. We ſhould treat the Bible with reverence, and ſhew our regard to it in the ways I have mentioned. This is my firſt rellection.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Is the <hi>Scripture given by inſpiration of God, and profitable</hi> to the church, as you have heard; what reaſon have we to be thankful for ſo great a favor and privilege as the holy Bible, and that we have it in our poſſeſſion. I ſhall briefly mention a few circumſtances, as ſo many motives to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the good providence of God on the account of this enjoyment.</p>
            <p>You ſhould be thankful not only that you have a divine revelation, but have it entire. It is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the diſtinguiſhing privileges of the Jews, that they had <hi>the oracles of God committed</hi> to them. How much greater muſt our advantages be who have not only their Scripture, but a great addition thereto; have a fuller and clearer light, have the darkneſs and difficulties of that diſpenſation they were under removed, and enjoy the entire ſyſtem of divine doctrines and laws. Certainly if they were ſo highly favored, the members of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an church are much more favored; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, under greater engagements to gratitude and adoration. We ſhould be thankful that this glorious book has been preſerved and brought down to us ſafe and uncorrupt. I before took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the rage of enemies againſt it, and what at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts have been made to deſtroy it, by Antiochus Epiphanes under the Old Teſtament, by Diocle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>an,
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:028262_0357_0FD7F7CC32C36C20"/>and Julian, perſecuting heathen emperors after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And yet God has watched over this inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable treaſure, and lodged it ſafe in our hands. O rejoice in his providence, and give him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his own work.</p>
            <p>Again, we ſhould be thankful that we have it in our own tongue: a privilege, you know, our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did not enjoy. Some that pretended to be the keepers of this treaſure, locked it up from the people, and took away the key of knowledge. This glorious light was by this means put under a buſhel. Whereas now it ſhines among us in all its luſtre. The heavenly manne falls about our tent door, and how much are we indebted to God for this. The churches of Germany in the beginning of the reformation had an anniverſary thankſgiving, which they called, <hi>the feaſt of the tranſlation of the Bible.</hi> We ſhould be often devoutly acknowledging the goodneſs of God herein, and celebrating the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his providence in this inſtance of it.</p>
            <p>I might add, that we have reaſon to be thankful we have the Bible not only tranſlated, but printed. About three hundred years ago when printing was firſt found out, a copy thereof, tolerably written in vellum, would coſt at leaſt a hundred pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whereas by the invention of printing, the Scriptures are put into every one's hand; the pooreſt chriſtian needs not want a Bible, if he has but an heart to make uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Again, we ſhould be thankful that we have ſo many helps to underſtand the Bible; as by conſtant miniſtry of the word, a variety of uſeful commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, and other good books written upon the Scripture and the particular doctrines thereof.</p>
            <p>Once more, we ought to conſider, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in all theſe inſtances, has diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed us from others. To us are <hi>committed the oracles of God.</hi> Theſe are the peculiar glory of the
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:028262_0358_0FD7F7CFA1D56C38"/>chriſtian church. <hi>He hath ſhewn his word unto Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, his ſtatutes and his judgments unto Iſrael; he hoth not dealt ſo with any nation; as for his judgments they have not known them.</hi> This may be ſaid of us chriſtians, we have the Bible, which the greateſt part of the world are utter ſtrangers to. Let us mind the admonition of the Pſalmiſt hereupon, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord,</hi> ſays he. Surely we ought to praiſe him on this account, to ſpeak and live his praiſes. I may add, if we do not praiſe him in higher ſtrains, and live in a better manner than thoſe that know not God, than the unhappy <hi>people that ſit in darkneſs, and in the region and ſhadow of death,</hi> great will be our guilt, and great our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. If the Bible be the word of God, and <hi>all Scripture is given by divine inſpiration,</hi> how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous muſt it be to reject it? it is not only great folly, as it deprives us of the light, inſtruction, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Scripture, and all the glorious advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſo excellent a revelation; but it is a flagrant inſtance of preſumption and ſin, a high contempt of the goodneſs of God, and of his wiſdom and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. On which account the caſe of our deiſts muſt be exceedingly deplorable. Indeed they ſeem to put themſelves out of the way of ſalvation. <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the prophets,</hi> ſays the parable, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be perſuaded though one roſe from the dead:</hi> Intimating, that ſuch as will not receive the inſtruction the Scripture affords, and comply with the way of ſalvation therein propoſed, will yield to no other means of conviction, though never ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and glaring, and conſequently muſt remain in their obſtinacy, and periſh in their ſin. Natural reaſon, the light and conduct of conſcience, and any other methods theſe perſons may pretend to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and prefer, will, I am afraid, be ſound inſufficient. <hi>If they will not believe Moſes and the prophets,</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:028262_0359_0FD7F7D0A96486F0"/>and his apoſtles; it would ſeem there is no help for them.</p>
            <p>And there is this aggravation in the unbelief of our modern deiſts, who live in a chriſtian nation, which the mere negative faith of the heathens has not; that the one never had the Bible laid before them: the other reject it, and all the ſtrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with which it comes atteſted, and with which it offers itſelf unto them. I leave them to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgment of God. But to me their caſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears exceedingly hazardous; and, it may be, their guilt approaches the neareſt to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt of any, men now adays are capable of committing. O let us not <hi>refuſe him that ſpeaketh from heaven. If he that deſpiſed Moſes's law, died without mercy, under two or three witneſſes: of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite unto the ſpirit of grace. If the word ſpoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation; which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by them that heard him, God alſo bearing them witneſs with ſigns and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> To have the Bible among us, and yet contemn and deſpiſe it, is ſo great a ſin, that, I think, I may ſay, how ſtrange ſoever the expreſſion may look, a wiſe man would rather chooſe to be annihilated, than live and die under the guilt of it. Hereupon I add,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As the Scripture is the word of God, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from heaven, and of ſuch eminent uſe to the church, as you have heard, let us endeavor to make a right uſe of it; to read it, ſtudy it, and converſe with it, in a ſuitable ſerious manner. And here ſeveral directions might be offered. But I
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:028262_0360_0FD7F7DE0A92A270"/>ſhall only ſtay to mention a few very briefly: and indeed it is leſs neceſſary to enlarge, it being a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I have often touched upon and ſpoke to.</p>
            <p>Endeavour to underſtand the holy Scripture. It is to no purpoſe that <hi>God has wrote to us the great things of his law,</hi> if they have been and are, <hi>ſtrange things</hi> to us. Ignorance will ſeal up the Bible from us as effectually, as if it was in an unknown Tongue. Take care therefore to underſtand your Bibles. To which purpoſe ſermons and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries are uſeful, a diligent peruſal of the Bible, a comparing one Scripture with another is uſeful, the laying aſide prejudices, and preconceived opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, being willing any thing ſhould be true, and receiving every thing as true, that you have reaſon to think is taught there; this is uſeful and neceſſary. Prayer and dependence on God, and his Spirit for illumination is alſo highly uſeful; in the uſe of theſe and ſuch like means, ſtudy the Bible; often put the queſtion to yourſelves, that Philip did to the Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian Eunuch, <hi>Underſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> Acts viii. 30. and never think you read to purpoſe, unleſs in ſome meaſure you underſtand what you read.</p>
            <p>Read it with faith. <hi>The word preached,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,</hi> Heb. iv. 2. Unbelief will ſtrip the word of all its power and efficacy, and leave it a dead letter, and altogether uſeleſs. The apoſtle rejoices in behalf of the Theſſalonians, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved they <hi>mixed the word with faith. For this cauſe,</hi> ſays he, in the place I have already cited, <hi>we thank God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</hi> It works effectually in them that believe, and in them only. O endeavor for faith, a divine faith. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:028262_0361_0FD7F7E21E02F7D8"/>the Scripture as the word of God; give a firm aſſent to it; look upon its rules as divine, its promiſes and threatnings as faithful and true; and entertain it with the ſame regard, as if God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelf in a viſible manner, or ſpake to you with an audible voice. And remember that your faith, if it be of the right kind, will always produce obedience. He that believes the wages of ſin is death, will be afraid of ſin, and if he is not, it is a ſufficient argument he doth not believe. I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply here what is ſaid of the ſervants of Pharaoh, when the plague of hail was threatned, <hi>That thoſe of them who feared the word of the Lord, made his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and his cattle ſlee into the houſes; but he that regarded not the word of the Lord, left his ſervants and cattle in the field.</hi> If we regard and believe the word of God, we ſhall comply with its advice, avoid the paths it marks out as leading to deſtruction; attend to the duties it preſcribes, and walk in the way it directs to, as the way of life and ſalvation. And if we do not do this, it is certain we do not believe. And conſequently, like Pharaoh's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhall fall under the judgment God has threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. O beg for faith, and that God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your faith. Look upon every thing in the Bible as true, certain and infallible, being aſſured, that not one iota thereof ſhall fall to the ground till all be fulfilled. If we did this it would have a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effect upon us. What manner of perſons ſhould we then be in all holy converſation and Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Read and ſtudy with humility, as modeſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, prepare to receive all the inſtruction there of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Have a care of a proud, carping, cavilling humor; and if you meet with any thing that ſeems to you uncouth, do not cenſure and deſpiſe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you do not underſtand it. Inſtead of that, maintain a reverence of God upon your minds, and
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:028262_0362_0FD7DAE9F0CBC688"/>wait for his illumination, praying with David, <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law,</hi> Pſal. cxix. 18. Nothing is more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary than this. <hi>He reſiſts the proud, but gives grace, yea more grace, to the humble. The meek will he guide in judgment, the meek will he teach his way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then apply what you read; bring it home to yourſelves, compare yourſelves with the rules of the word, and endeavor to conform yourſelves thereto. The Scripture is profitable for correction, correct yourſelves by it; for inſtance, ſuch Scriptures as concern the government of the tongue, the thoughts, deſires and affections; ſuch Scriptures as preſcribe to you in your reſpective relations; and for the management of your callings and converſe. Your doctrines whether ſecret, private, or public; lay them before you, meaſure, and correct yourſelves by them. And I am ſatisfied it would be well worth while to have a liſt of ſuch Scriptures drawn up by you for conſtant uſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, beg the aſſiſtance of God's holy Spirit in order to the ſtudying and improving your Bibles. The Bible is the book of the Spirit, over which he preſides, and which he teaches. Many have thought they have got the beſt of their knowledge of religion and of the Scriptures upon their knees. And I do not think there is any enthuſiaſm in that method of ſtudy, accompanied with the uſe of other proper means. But I leave theſe things to your ſerious retired thoughts, without further enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and leave you to the divine conduct and bleſſing.</p>
