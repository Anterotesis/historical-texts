            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Preface,</head>
            <p>IN Managing Controverſies in Religion, there be two uſual Artifices that frequently prove traps to catch the Injudicious Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and ſway more with unthinking Men than a Demonſtration; one is to inſinuate that the impleaded Opinion is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Purity and Holineſs; a way to corrupt the Churches and uſher in degeneracy: hereby many men of tender Conſciences are ſtartled, as if there were a Snake in the Graſs; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a magnifying of ſuch Authors, as do diſcountenance, or ſeem to diſcountenance that Opinion, as if they were but one degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Apoſtles, <hi>they have mens Perſons in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration becauſe of Advantage,</hi> which proves like a Charm to many Readers, being ready to ſwallow all with an implicit Faith. How far Mr. <hi>M.</hi> hath acted his part in theſe two Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, is obvious to any that obſerve: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them eſpecially is his proper Element. But theſe are but flouriſhes, that may raiſe mens Spirits, but convey no light into their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: they may ſerve to garniſh &amp; adorn either Truth or Errour, but ſtrengthen neither of them. Let him but prove his Doctrine to be true, and we will believe it to be a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
<pb facs="unknown:001433_0004_0FB2F013F00D3948"/>of the Purity of the Church; let him but confirm his Doctrine from Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and we will receive it, whether his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, do deſerve their high Character or not.</p>
            <p>It is no offence to me that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to anſwer me; if he could have proved my Aſſertion to be a miſtake, it would have been a kindneſs to me. I heartily deſire to be led into the knowledge of the Truth; and would be as forward as any to bear a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt that doctrine, could I be convinced of any error in it. But I hope his inſufficiency to accompliſh his deſign, will prove an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the cauſe of God, and be a means fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Eſtabliſh ſuch as were wavering: his Arguments though propounded in a plauſible manner, and ſet off with fair gloſſes, are too weak to bear a touch, and will appear upon Examination to have in them more of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than of Evidence.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> all along intermingles Paſſionate Lamentations with his Arguments; if his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been ſtronger, they would have been a Vindication of thoſe complaints; and he had done his buſineſs effectually, if there had been more reaſon and leſs affection in his Book. Thoſe Lamentations ſerve to ſwell the Book, and make it more in bulk, but not in weight.</p>
            <p>It is my endeavour to keep my heart as far from prejudice and bias as I can, that I may be prepared to give entertainment to the Truth: which is indeed worthy of entertainment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our intereſts be croſſed thereby, we are
<pb facs="unknown:001433_0005_0FB2F0162FF48128"/>directed to buy the Truth though ſometimes it coſts us dear. On the one hand, I conſider that it would be a doleful thing to Propagate an Errour, and lay a Foundation of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Land; to ſpread and diffuſe Poiſon that may have a malignant influence from Generation to Generation, it were better to make Retractation upon Retractation, than to be obſtinate in ſuch a way. On the other hand, I conſider that it is a Service to God and his People, to clear up a Truth that has not been received, whereby a door is opened for the revival of Religion, and light held forth to deliver the People of God from ſuch miſtakes, as are a means to turn many away from fearing the Lord, and it would be very blame-worthy to ſuffer my ſelf to be baſled, with trivial Arguments, great Words &amp; angry Faces; it will quit coſt to ſuffer reproach in the cauſe of God. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to anſwer reflections or to retort them, but to apply my ſelf to remove ſuch things as are offered to darken the Truth, accounting that the Vindication of the Truth is a Vindication of my ſelf.</p>
            <p>He ſeems to intimate as if I pretended to be a Prophet. I am far from pretending to any Prophetical Revelations; I am no <hi>Enthuſiaſt:</hi> I neither pretend to Revelations my ſelf, nor depend on the Sentiments of other men, as if they were Oracles: but this I profeſs before the World, that God has taught me the Doctrine that I have laid down; partly by giving me a great
<pb facs="unknown:001433_0006_0FB2F019EA0EEFF0"/>diſcovery of his Wiſdom, in bringing Nations into a Church Eſtate, and in that way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Saving Grace to his Elect; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by opening my Eyes to underſtand the Scriptures, whereby I am abundantly ſatisfyed that it is the cauſe of God that I have pleaded, and accordingly, I am bound in Spirit to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it, and am contented to Sacrifice my own Name for his ſake, knowing that though my Aſſertion be Offenſive to ſome beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet it is acceptable to God and Jeſus Chriſt, and pleaſing to Angels and Saints in Heaven.</p>

            <head>The Firſt BOOK. <hi>The Queſtion Stated, and Mr.</hi> Mather's <hi>Arguments anſwered.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Laws of diſputation do require a fair &amp; exact Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the controverſy, that nothing be made mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diſpute, that is not plainly affirmed, or by genuine conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence deduced from the Aſſertions of the adverſary: when men do otherwiſe, they are guilty of caſting unjuſt imputations, on thoſe whom they oppoſe, they labour in vain, abuſe their Readers, and manifeſt an affectation of vain glory, from a victory,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001433_0008_0FB2F02195D16F18"/>where there was no conteſt. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> has greatly failed in this particular. He ſays, p. 3. <hi>The Queſtion is whether God requires Unſanctified Perſons, while ſuch, to come to his Table, and conſequently whether the Church may admit into their holy Communion in ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance ſuch as are not in the judgment of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Charity true Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Queſtions is not fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down, my Poſition is, That Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace is not neceſſary to the lawful attending the Ordinance of the Lords Supper. He ſays the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether God requires Unſanctifyed Perſons, while ſuch, to come to his Table.</hi> Inſinuating as if I did affirm, that God required all Unſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons to come to his Table. We uſe to ſay in diſputations, <hi>Adde Signum.</hi> He ſhould have added the ſign, and either ſaid ſome unſanctifyed perſons, which I own, or all unſanctifyed perſons which (as he knows) I utterly deny.</p>
            <p>He adds, that conſequently, <hi>the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether the Church may admit to their holy Communion in ſpecial Ordinances, ſuch as are net in the judgment of rational Charity true Believers.</hi> But I have no controverſy with him upon that account. My buſineſs was to anſwer a caſe of Conſcience, and direct
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001433_0009_0FB2F023455F32C8"/>thoſe that might have Scruples about Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Lords-Supper, becauſe they had not a work of Saving Converſion, not at all to direct the Churches, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any that were not to rational Charity true Believers; ſo that he blots a great deal of Paper to no Purpoſe, beats the air, and fights againſt a ſhadow of his own making.</p>

                  <hi>ASſertions that are contrary to many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ought not to be received by the Churches; but the impleaded Aſſertions are contrary to many Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Scripture alledged is Matt. 22.11, 12. <hi>And when the King come in to ſee the Gueſt, he ſaw there a man that had not on a wedding Garment; &amp; he ſaith unto him, friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment? And he was ſpeechleſs.</hi> He ſays upon it, <hi>That it is evident, that they who come to the Lords Table without a Wedding Garment are Gueſts more hold than welcome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The thing to be enquired into is. What is this Feaſt that the gueſts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to? Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſuppoſes it to be the Lords Supper: that is eaſier a great deal then to prove it. It is abundantly manifeſt that Chriſt Jeſus, and Pardon &amp; Salvation are
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001433_0010_0FB2F0246A0D7508"/>the Feaſt, that they were invited to, &amp; not the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: the Meſſengers of God are ſent to invite men to this Feaſt: and I think he will not ſay, that the great errand of the Miniſtry is to invite men to the Lords Supper: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this is a Feaſt that the Jews were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to from Generation to Generation, long before the Lords-Supper was Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Jews were thoſe <hi>that were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> v. 3. <hi>He ſent forth his Servants to thoſe that were bidden, to the Wedding, and they would not come:</hi> One ſet of Servants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another were ſent unto them: <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Again he ſent other Servants:</hi> Firſt he ſent the Prophets and then the Apoſtles, after this the Gentiles were invited to the ſame Feaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Go ye into the high ways, &amp; as many as ye ſhall find, bid unto the Marriage.</hi> Beſides this man that had not the Wedding Garment was not ſuffered to partake of this Feaſt, but ſuch perſons are ſuffered to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lords Supper; beſides this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was objected againſt for not having a Wedding Garment, was a Reprobate, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> but Mr. <hi>M.</hi> dont think that every one that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to partake of the Lords Supper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, is a Reprobate. By this it does appear that here is a repreſentation of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001433_0011_0FB2F0284B5FF8D8"/>Day of Judgment, and that ſuch Perſons as come for Salvation without a Wedding Garment ſhall be rejected in that day. So that here being nothing ſpoken about the Lords Supper, all arguing from this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture falls to the ground. <hi>See Pools Anot. in Locum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Scripture that he urges is, 1 Cor. 11.27, 29. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall, eat this bread &amp; drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body &amp; blood of the Lord. He that eats &amp; drinks unworthily eats &amp; drinks Damnation,</hi> (or Judgment) <hi>to himſelf:</hi> Hence he argues, <hi>That if the unworthineſs of a particular act in reſpect of the manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, may make a man guilty: how much more the unworthineſs of his perſon.</hi> This is as if he ſhould argue that an unworthy manner of Hearing, makes a man guilty, therefore much more the unworthineſs of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; therefore graceleſs perſons ſhould refrain from hearing.</p>
               <p>But this Scripture being a ſtumbling-block to many, it is meet it ſhould be more fully conſidered. Mind therefore.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth not follow that if they eat &amp; drink Judgment to themſelves that they ſhould forbear. Natural men Sin when they Pray, when they Hear, ſo they did

               <p n="2">2. That true Believers may eat &amp; drink unworthily. The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of unworthy Communicants, but unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Communicating. He ſuppoſes the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to conſiſt of ſuch as were Believers, yet he ſuppoſeth that ſome of them did eat &amp; drink unworthily: <hi>v.</hi> 30. He ſays, <hi>For this cauſe many among you are weak &amp; ſickly:</hi> yet it doth not follow that they muſt forbear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Natural men may eat &amp; drink with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that unworthineſs or unmeetneſs that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of (1) Becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth expreſs this unworthineſs to lye in not diſcerning the Lords body. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>He that eateth &amp; drinketh unworthily, eateth &amp; drinketh Damnation to himſelf: not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

(1) Becauſe the worthineſs or unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here intended is that which may be known before hand. Therefore he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them, <hi>to Examine themſelves, v.</hi> 28. But no man can tell by any previous Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether he ſhall eat &amp; drink in ſaith
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001433_0013_0FB2F02B4F342A88"/>or not. A Godly man if he find the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of faith the night before, or that Morning, may yet in his attending on the Lords-Supper be left unto a Spirit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; and a Natural man if he finds the Night before that he never had faith, may yet partake in faith. I knew one recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to our Communion from another Church, as an eminent Saint, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fully convinced of being in a State of Nature, and at the Sacrament wought on, &amp; enabled to believe in Chriſt. (3) Becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks theſe words, not to reſtrain any of the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> from coming to the Lords-Supper, but to direct them to come in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not in that rude &amp; unchriſtian way that they were wont to come: which he had told them of; <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Author adds, that the Apoſtles words, 1 Cor. 11.28. <hi>Let a man Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, &amp; drink of that cup: are contrary to my new doctrine.</hi> Two things he inſiſts upon from this Scripture: the firſt is, that the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation here required is, whether he has grace in his Soul; and would prove it thus. <hi>Saith he, Doth not the Apoſtle himſelf plainly tell us, what he means by this ſelf-Examination:</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001433_0014_0FB2F02DAAB067E0"/>2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the faith, prove your own ſelves, know you not your own ſelves, how that Chriſt is in you, except you be reprobates; that is perſons nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi> But what force is there in this Argument, doth it follow, becauſe by ſelf Examination, in one place he intends their Examining whether they be in a State of grace, that therefore when ever he ſpeaks of Self Examination, the thing to be Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is the truth of grace: it is granted on all hands, that the truth of grace is to be Examined, but this doth not prove that that is the thing called for and intended, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. Yea it is moſt evident, that this is not the Examination that they are ſtirred up unto: if we look to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes where he blames them for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in a rude manner, or if we look to the <hi>ſubſequent words,</hi> where he finds fault with thoſe that don't diſcern the <hi>Lords body,</hi> it plainly appears that the Examination he called for is, whether they underſtood the nature of the Ordinance, that ſo they may ſolemly conſider what they have to do when they wait upon God in it. The thing to be Examined is not the worthineſs of their perſons, but the worthineſs of their participation. A ſecond thing that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon, tho' not in this Book, yet in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001433_0015_0FB2F02F42854F38"/>that he put forth ſome years ſince, upon the like occaſion, is, that the Greek word rendred <hi>Examine,</hi> does import an <hi>Examination to Approbation:</hi> ſurely he is too critical therein, for though the Word does ſometimes import ſo, yet not always: the ſame word is uſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. &amp; rendred <hi>Prove:</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaid <hi>Prove your own ſelves.</hi> For that was not the duty of all of them to prove themſelves to Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. It was in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> as in other Churches, ſome were ſincere, and ſome were hypocrites, and it is as much the duty of hypocrites to diſcover their hypocriſy, as of Saints to diſcover their Sincerity: it is their duty to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves to diſapprobation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if Communicants muſt Examine their ſaith to approbation, I would inquire whether by that approbation, he means Aſſurance or a probable hope. If he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Aſſurance, then none but thoſe that have Aſſurance may come to the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Table. If he intends a probable hope: then ſuch perſons may come as are not ſincere, and then Sanctifying grace is not neceſſary in order to a lawful attending the Lords-Supper.</p>
               <p>A third Scripture that he brings to make good his Argument is, Ezek. 44.7, 9. <hi>You
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001433_0016_0FB2F03125845AD8"/>have brought into my Sanctuary ſtrangers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed in heart, &amp; uncircumciſed in fleſh, to be in my Sanctuary to pallute it, even my houſe: when you offer my Bread, the Fat, and the Blood, and they have broken my Covenant. — Thus ſaith the Lord, no ſtranger uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in beart, ſhall enter into my Sanctuary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, 1. That this Scripture has no particular reference to the Lords-Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. If he had blamed them for ſuffering ſuch perſons as were uncircumciſed in heart and fleſh to come to the Paſsover, which was a Sacrament of confirmation as the Lords Supper is, he might have pleaded that it had a particular reference to the Lords Supper, but the fault was that they brought ſtrangers into the Sanctuary: but the Paſsover was eaten in their own houſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fault is charged on the Prieſts, that they brought in ſuch as were uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in fleſh &amp; in heart: therefore it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of ſuch as were viſibly uncircumciſed in heart; for the Prieſts were not to blame for letting in ſuch as were viſibly circumciſed in heart, though not really ſo: for they were bound by Gods Ordinance to do it. Yea Mr. <hi>M.</hi> goes a great deal further than I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001433_0017_0FB2F038F64032E8"/>dare go, for he ſays, That Adulterers, Thieves, Liars, Slanderers &amp; Perjured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might celebrate the Paſsover, <hi>p.</hi> 75, 76. How to reconcile ſuch practices with heart circumciſion is quite beyond me.</p>
               <p>Here our Reverend Author informs us, <hi>That the Jewiſh Maſters tell us, that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were very ſtrict in admitting of Proſelytes, they ſay they admitted no Proſelytes in Davids time, leaſt they ſhould join themſelves to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of fear; nor in Solomons time, leaſt they ſhould come becauſe of the great Proſperity that Iſrael then had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I may Anſwer in the Apoſtles words, 1 Tim. 1.4. <hi>Neither give beed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> If it were really ſo it was utterly croſs to the inſtitution of God: <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.47, 48. but undoubtedly the thing is utterly falſe: <hi>David</hi> mentions the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes in his time, as a great body of People: Pſal. 115.12, 13. <hi>He will bleſs the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, he will bleſs the houſe of Aaron, be will bleſs them that fear the Lord.</hi> By them that fear the Lord, we are to underſtand the Proſelytes. So Pſal. 135.19, 20. <hi>Bleſs the Lord O houſe of Iſrael, bleſs the Lord O houſe of Aaron, bleſs the Lord O houſe of Levi: Ye that fear the Lord, bleſs the Lord.</hi> Proſelytes in the Old Teſtament are called <hi>Fearers of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001433_0018_0FB2F03C03032610"/>God,</hi> in the New-Teſtament, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Worſhippers of God:</hi> Act. 16.14. And Solomon in his Prayer, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.41, 42. Saith, That <hi>the ſtranger ſhall come from afar Country, for Gods Name ſake, hearing of his Great Name, and his Strong Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Scripture that he urges is, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.20. <hi>The ſoul that eats of the fleſh of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Peace-offerings that partain unto the Lord, having his uncleanneſs upon him, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his People. To which he adds, That ſuch as were unclean might not eat the Paſsover: and ſaith, Doth not this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie, that they who are unclean, either in courſe of Life, or in State ſhould not come to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>The major is granted. There is no need to take notice of his diſcourſe upon it, becauſe it is a digreſſion, and concerns not the matter in controverſy.</p>
               <p>But the minor is utterly denyed: Some Unſanctifyed perſons are fit to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Members in particular Churches, they that are fit matter for Church Memberſhip, are to be admitted: but viſible Saints tho' they are hypocrites, are fit matter for Church Memberſhip: they that are to be admitted according to the Ordinance of God are fit to be admitted. Such as muſt be admitted or elſe God will be greatly offended, are fit to be admitted: Such as being admitted may not be caſt out, are fit to be admitted. But thus it is with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Saints: though they have not a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row work of Converſion; ſuch perſons as God himſelf did admit into the Church of Iſrael, are fit to be admitted into Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001433_0022_0FB2F0467B96A380"/>Churches: ſuch perſons as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did admit into Goſpel Churches are fit to be admitted into them, but they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many that had not a thorow work of Regeneration. Indeed by the rule that God has given for admiſſions, if it be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended, more Unconverted perſons will be admitted than Converted. <hi>Mr.</hi> Cotton <hi>ſaith, let Miniſters uſe as much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence &amp; vigilancy as well they may, yet ſuch is the dimneſs of diſcerning in humane frailty, and ſuch is the ſubtilty of many hypocrites, that it may be Ninety nine hypocrites may creep into the Church to one ſimple ſheep of Chriſt.</hi> Hol. of Ch. M. p. 67. and Preached it in <hi>Boſton, That it would be well if at the day of judgment ten men in a Church were ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> that he may ſtrengthen his Opinion heaps up many Scriptures to ſhow, that Church Members ſhould be viſible Saints; he has no need to trouble himſelf to prove that which I never deny'd, all the titles that are given them don't make them more, and I never deſired to make them leſs than viſible Saints, the members of the Chriſtian Church are viſible Saints, &amp; the members of the Jewiſh Church were viſible Saints, as they are called, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Yea he loved the people, all his Saint's are in thy hand.</hi> It was needleſs for him
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001433_0023_0FB2F047B13EC7F0"/>to prove it, &amp; unfair by taking ſo much pains to prove it, to leave a jealouſy upon ſome ignorant people, as if I did deny it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaith, Hypocrites were brought in una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wars, and that they crept in unawares:</hi> but neither of theſe places that he refers to do intimate that all hypocrites do come in unaware: that <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4. Speaks of ſome Jews that pretended themſelves to be Chriſtians but were not, but came in upon a wicked deſign. Surely he does not think ſo hardly of all that fall ſhort of a work of Regeneration. Thoſe words <hi>Jude</hi> 4. are ſpoken of heretical perſons: if they did take any in, that they feared had not Saving Faith, yet ſurely none that they judged to be Heriticks. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with me for ſaying, that Saints by Calling are to be accepted of the Church, whether they be Converted or no: ſpeaks of it as a <hi>Strange expreſſion and a contradiction in adjecto:</hi> but what need is there of ſo much anger. Viſible Saints are Saints by Calling. The Members of the Church of Corinth, <hi>were called to be Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. There is an external Call and an external Anſwer, as well as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Call and an internal Anſwer: If viſible Saints may be Saints by Calling,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001433_0024_0FB2F04973A4C788"/>and viſible Saints may be Unconverted, then ſome that are Saints by Calling may be Unconverted.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, That when their hypocriſy is diſcovered by any fundamental Error in judgment, or ſcandal, or in Converſation, they ought to be caſt out of the Church. But he miſtakes the matter very much: the diſcovery of their hypocriſy is not the reaſon of their being caſt out: When men are caſt out of the Church we don't know that they are hypocrites or not: the reaſon of their rejection is becauſe they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in Scandal. And Godly men are to be rejected in that caſe, as well as hypocrites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaith, That Mr.</hi> Cotton <hi>argues, that ſuch as are deſtructive to the State of the Church, are not fit Materials for the building of the Church. And adds, That this is true of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> poſition is good, but Mr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s addition will not ſtand: For hypocrites ſo long as they carry well, are not deſtructive to the State of the Church: but on the contrary do great Service to the Church, they help to maintain the Church and Ordinances of God, they do deſend the Church, they do incourage the Church, they are Serviceable by their gifts, by their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001433_0025_0FB2F04AB8CAECD8"/>authority, by their prudence &amp; zeal, by their Eſtates; and it would be exceeding difficult for the Church to ſubſiſt without them. When he ſaith that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the State of the Church, does it not reflect on the Wiſdom of God in binding and commanding his Church to admit ſuch Members? That conſtitution of the Church that God has appointed, is ſuch as makes for the ſafety and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church: and God has appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that viſible Saints ſhall be accepted as Members of the Church, though they be not Regenerate; and the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accepted ſuch.</p>

The blood of Chriſt has obtained for you the remiſſion of your Sins: and of giving the Sacrament to thoſe who are not ſo far as men can judge in a Regenerate Eſtate: and he ſaith, that this is to ſet the Lords Seal to a blank. But I will labour to anſwer the intent of this argument, ſo far as I am able to reach it.</p>
               <p>That which I am to ſhew is, That ſome Unſanctifyed men have a right before God to the Lords Supper. Surely the Children of Iſrael had a right before God to the Paſsover; when God commanded them to celebrate it; and they had a right to Circumciſion, when God commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to circumciſe them. And thoſe that are the Covenant People of God have a right <hi>to keep the Covenant;</hi> we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to teach ſuch as are baptiſed to obſerve all things that Chriſt hath commanded,</hi> Mat. 28.19, 20.

               <p>If I may gather up what he aims at, I would reduce it to theſe two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Unregenerate men are not in Covenant with God. This is a great
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001433_0027_0FB2F0585A51A3F0"/>miſtake, tho' Unregenerate men are not in the internal, they have not performed any act of Saving Faith, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant, and God is not bound to give Saving Bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them: yet they are in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Covenant. <hi>Moſes ſaith, the Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb,</hi> Deut. 5.2. And when he renews his Covenant, he is ſaid to <hi>betroth them to himſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 2.19, 20. And therefore the Adoption is ſaid to belong to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. They are his People, his Sons &amp; Daughters, his Spouſe, and he becomes their God, he makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes unto them upon condition of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and they promiſe Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Hence they become capable of breaking Covenant; they have <hi>broken the everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Iſai. 24.5. <hi>Neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78.37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That becauſe they have no right to the bleſſings of the New Covenant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have no right to the Seal. That the Sacrament may not be given to them becauſe their Sins are not pardoned: they have no right to Salvation, therefore not to the Seal of Salvation, if the Seal be given to them, it is the ſetting of the Lords Seal to a blank: Sealing a Pardon to thoſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001433_0028_0FB2F05B2AF35898"/>whom the Lord hath not pardoned.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>To this I make anſwer in three particulars,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That tho' Unregenerate men have no right to pardon of Sin &amp; Salvation, yet they may have a right before God unto the Seals of the Covenant; they had a right to Circumciſion: <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.2. yet that was a Seal of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. So they had right to the Paſso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo they have to Baptiſm. It is unreaſonable to think that all Baptiſed Children are Regenerate: and ſo they may have a right to the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Unregenerate men may have in conjunction with other, a right to ſome of the bleſſings of the Covenant. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Seals of the whole Covenant, not only thoſe promiſes that are made to particular Believers, but the promiſes of outward proſperity that are made to the viſible Church: &amp; men that are Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in Conjunction with others, have a right as part of the body Corporate to thoſe bleſſings, and may receive the Seal thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Sacraments do not Seal up Pardon and Salvation to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, but they are Seals to the truth
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001433_0029_0FB2F05CC1DFACE0"/>of the Covenant. It doth not Seal mens having of faith, neither doth it Seal the Salvation of the Communicants; they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably deceive themſelves, if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it ſo: but it is a Seal to the Covenant. God offers Pardon and Salvation through faith in Chriſt, men are ready to doubt of the truth of this; but God Seals this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the Sacraments. This is that which is intended when it is ſaid, That Circumciſion was a <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. Whether we underſtand by the righteouſneſs of faith, Faith it ſelf, which is our Evangelical righteouſneſs, or the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is <hi>Faith</hi> apprehended by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it comes to one &amp; the ſame: and circumciſion Seals the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this unto Salvation; that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he has made ſhall in this way be fulfilled: and this is a great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to draw forth the Exerciſe of Faith.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Both parts of this argument are to be denyed. And there is very little ſaid for the proof of either.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I deny the Conſequence. It may be a Converting Ordinance, though there be neither promiſe nor example. I may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue as well, that if there be no promiſe in the word of the Edification of Saints an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, nor any Example of Saints edifyed thereby, then it is no Ordinance for the Edification of Saints. Yea I may as well argue that there is no promiſe of converting Grace, annexed to circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor any Example of Perſons Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it, therefore that was no Ordinance for Converſion. But there be other things that do ſhew it to be a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as the command given to the Church, which doth conſiſt partly of men Converted, partly of men Unconverted, to attend this Ordinance. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25. <hi>This do in remembrance of me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny the Minor alſo. There be general promiſes that do reach the caſe: Prov. 8.34. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors:</hi> This being one of the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001433_0031_0FB2F060A6EE00E0"/>ways of Gods appointment, this promiſe is an encouragement to wait upon God in this way. Mat. 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all things that I have commanded, &amp; lo I am with you alway even to the end of the world;</hi> this is one of Chriſt commands. Rom. 10.14. <hi>Faith comes by hearing.</hi> In this Ordinance the Goſpel is proclamed; and Pardon is offered to Sinners by Jeſus Chriſt: Pſal. 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the Soul.</hi> This is one of Gods laws.</p>
               <p>This Ordinance has a proper tendency in its own nature to Convert men. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men may learn the neceſſity &amp; ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Death of Chriſt in order to Pardon. Here is an affecting offer of Chriſt crucifyed; here is a Sealing of the Covenant, that if men come to Chriſt, they ſhall be Saved, which is a great means to convince of ſafety in coming to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>All Ordinances are for the Saving good of thoſe that they are to be adminiſtred unto. This Ordinance is according to Inſtitution to be applyed to viſible Saints, though Unconverted, therefore it is for their Saving good, and conſequently for their Converſion.</p>

               <head>Mr. Mather's <hi>Fifth Argument.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Argument is thus preſaced, That <hi>it is a clear confutation of what</hi> Mr. S. <hi>affirms:</hi> we will ſee it. <hi>If the Lords Supper be a converting Ordinance than prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought to be admitted to partake of it: but ſuch are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</hi> He ſaith Mr. S. <hi>himſelf confeſſeth thus much.</hi> And it is very true, I wiſh I could ſay, that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> did confeſs, that prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might not be admitted to the Paſsover.</p>
               <p>I utterly deny his Conſequence. His reaſon for it is, <hi>That we may not withold from the prophaneſt perſon in the world, that which is appointed to be the means of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> But his conſequence is as ſtrong as a rope of Sand: May we not as well argue that if Baptiſm be a Converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, we ſhould Baptize the <hi>Indians,</hi> and other Heathens, as <hi>John Hircanus</hi> did compel the <hi>Edomites</hi> to be circumciſed.</p>
               <p>My anſwer was and is, that the Lords Supper is a Converting Ordinance, only for Church Members and not for other men. He hath three objections againſt my anſwer. One is, <hi>that it is an odd one.</hi> I hope it is not criminal to give an odd
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001433_0033_0FB2F063A0900F40"/>anſwer, and if ſo, let it go for an odd one. The ſecond is, <hi>that it is new of mine own invention.</hi> It is no ſufficient ground to reject his notions becauſe they are other mens, or to reject mine becauſe they are my own: it is for God to reveal his mind to any whom he pleaſes: but the main objection is, <hi>That I do not prove it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now further vindicate that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is for the Converſion of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Church Members, by laying down three Propoſitions, which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> himſelf will own.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The efficacy of the Lords Supper does depend upon the bleſſing of God. What ever tendency Ordinances have in their own nature to be Serviceable to men, yet they will not prevail any further than God doth bleſs them. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4. It is God that teaches men to profit, and makes them profitable and ſerviceable to mens Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is reaſon to hope for adivine bleſſing on the Lords Supper, when it is adminiſtred to thoſe that it ought to be adminiſtred unto. Gods bleſſing is to be expected in Gods way: if men act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own humours &amp; phanſies,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001433_0034_0FB2F0666B1F46B0"/>and don't keep in a way of Obedience, it is preſumption to expect Gods bleſſing. Mat. 15.9. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men:</hi> but when they are admitted to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that God would have to be admitted, there is ground to hope that he will make it profitable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is Gods will that ſuch as are in the judgment of rational Charity Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, be admitted to the Lords Supper, tho' they be Unregenerate: God allows his Church to accept of ſuch Unregenerate men as carry themſelves ſo, that there is reaſon to look upon them to be Saints, he would not have his Church to admit thoſe that are prophane, that would be a great offence to him; but the Apoſtles did receive thoſe that were to Charity Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and Churches now ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch, what-ever they be in reality. From theſe things it is moſt apparent that the Lords Supper may be looked on a Converting Ordinance, for Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that carry orderly, yet not for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Perſons.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Mather</hi> argues that if the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be a converting Ordinance, then it ſhould be adminiſtred to prophane. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001433_0035_0FB2F06E2092D630"/>may he not with as good reaſon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that if it be an Ordinance for the ſtrengthning of Grace, it ſhould be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to ſuch Godly men as have fallen into Scandalous tranſgreſſions, for they need to have their Grace ſtrengthened.</p>
               <p>I had ſaid in my Sermon, that the Lords Supper was a converting Ordinance, only to ſuch Church Members as walked or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, when any carry ſcandalouſly there are other Ordinances, <hi>viz.</hi> Cenſures for their Converſion, in caſe they be Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Mr. M. <hi>in anſwer to this ſaith,</hi> Diſputatur non conceſſis, <hi>he takes it for granted that the perſon is not Converted: &amp; ſo runs out into a long diſcourſe that the inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Corinthian might be a godly man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I take it for granted that ſome Perſons cenſured may be Unconverted, not that all of them are, nor that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> was: and his diſcourſe is wholly impertinent, and altho' he glories in the concluſion of the Chapter, that my new deviſed diſtinction is neither Solid nor Scriptural, yet his anſwer has nothing of an anſwer in it, as equal judges when they compare things together will readily determine.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>He faith that this Opinion is contrary to the Profeſſion &amp; Practice of the Primitive Churches.</hi> This he labours to prove from <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Origin, Tertullian, Cyprian:</hi> and he faith, <hi>That for about four or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years of the Chriſtian Aera, there was great ſtrictneſs in admitting to Sacraments.</hi> The like is aſſerted by him in an Epiſtle to Mr <hi>Quick;</hi> and he grants that there was too much rigidity among them.

                  <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> Here is a great deal of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and little ſubſtance. The practice in the Primitive Church about the time of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> was full of Vanity &amp; Superſtition. They took in their Members at <hi>Eaſter</hi> time, or <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> they required <hi>Suſceptores</hi> or god fathers, though the perſons were men grown, they uſed to Exorciſe them, they made them to renounce the Devil as if he were preſent. When they entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Portel of the houſe of Baptiſm, they were ordered ſtanding toward the Weſt, with their hand ſtretched out as if Satan were preſent, to renounce him, ſaying, I renounce thee Satan and all thy works, and all thy pomps: ſometimes they add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his Worſhip and his Angels, and his Inventions, and all under him. And after-ward they made a Profeſſion, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Creed by heart; which is called a pronouncing of the true Faith, <hi>Praeclara f<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ducia,</hi> or elſe anſwering to Queſtions. It was their manner alſo to uſe the ſign of the Croſs, as is evident from <hi>Chamier in his</hi> 15. &amp; 16. ch. <hi>de Baptiſmo.</hi> This practice of theirs is ſuch a piece of Pageantry, as is more fit for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to imitate, than theſe Churches. I admire we ſhould be directed to follow the pattern of theſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001433_0038_0FB2F074B5B6A028"/>ancient Churches under a notion of ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and purity.</p>
               <p>In his other Book made upon the like occaſion againſt me, <hi>viz.</hi> his Epiſtle to Mr. <hi>Quick, Alcuinus</hi> is brought in ſaying, <hi>Fiunt ſcutinia, ut ſaepius explorentur, an poſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciationem Satanae, Sacra verba datae fidei, radicibus corde defixerint. Scrutinies were made, that they might be often Examined, to ſee whether the Sacred words of the Faith, which they profeſſed, were throughly fixed in their hearts.</hi> A <hi>New-England</hi> man reading this, would be ready to think, that our practice were but the reviving of the practice of the Primitive Church, but if we ſearch what this Scrutiny was, we may gather it part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the words of <hi>Auſtin, ipſis diebus, quibus catechezantur, exorcizantur, ſcrutantur:</hi> and the words of <hi>Leo</hi> both reported by <hi>Chamier</hi> in the ſame place, <hi>In Baptizandis electis, qui ſecundum Apoſtolicam regulam, &amp; exorciſmis ſcrutandi, &amp; jejuniis Sanctificandi, &amp; frequentibus ſunt praedicationibus imbuendi.</hi> By this it appears that this Scrutiny was made by <hi>Exorciſms,</hi> not by inquiring into the works of Gods Spirit on their hearts, but by adjuring of them to Speak true; tho' there was another way of Exorciſing in uſe at this time, <hi>viz.</hi> an adjuring of the

               <p n="2">2. <hi>He faith this Opinion is contrary to the judgment of the moſt eminent Reformers in theſe latter Ages.</hi> Some are mentioned by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That the generality of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches are larger than I deſire to be, in their practices, and the practice of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is every whit as large.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the judgment of particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines: I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome of them intend no more, than that thoſe who are admitted to the Lords Supper, be to the judgment of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Believers; as is obvious to thoſe that are converſant in their Books; and I am of the ſame judgment with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some of theſe Divines have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of great miſtakes in other things, and it is not piacular to ſuſpect them in this.

               <p n="3">3. Many Divines have abundance of work before them, and have not opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſearch narrowly into the points of controverſy; but take ſome things for

<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001433_0043_0FB2F082F1D38DE0"/>Mr. <hi>John Humphry</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Froome,</hi> has written three Books in defence of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. Mr. <hi>John Timſon</hi> alſo: he was no Miniſter, but his Book gave good ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to many Miniſters in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Humphry</hi> reports. <hi>Beza D.

               <p n="6">6.

                  <hi>Gilleſpy.</hi> But to make good his opinion, he ſaith, That <hi>Eſtius</hi> declares that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks maintain, that Sacraments work Grace in thoſe that do not <hi>Obicem ponere,</hi> or withſtand their operation. And he ſaith, that <hi>Brockmond,</hi> a bitter Lutheran, mentions it as a <hi>Calvinian</hi> error, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are not inſtituted to be means of conferring Grace. But what of all this, doth it follow from hence, that they hold that the Lords Supper is a converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. They never teach that the firſt Grace is communicated by the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but ſuppoſe that to be wrought by Baptiſm, before ever Perſons partake of the Lords Supper. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> does require a proving of themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to the Lords Supper; and they curſe thoſe that ſay, That <hi>Faith alone is ſufficient preparation for the Lords Supper.

               <p>
                  <hi>IF it be impoſſible for Unregenerate Perſons whilſt ſuch, to be worthy Communicints at the Lords Table, then they have no command or allowance from God to be there whilſt in their Sins. But it is impoſſible for them to be worthy Communicants.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the minor.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we take communicating worthily in the Apoſtles ſenſe, 1 Cor. 11.29. <hi>For diſcerning the Lords body,</hi> it is not impoſſible for them to communicate worthily; they may underſtand the nature of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance very well, and be able to inſtruct others in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we take communicating worthily in his ſenſe, for exerciſing Faith &amp; other Graces, at the time of participation, it is not impoſſible for thoſe that came to the Ordinance in an Unregenerate condition to partake worthily. God may give them Grace at that time. Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> who was bred up under Mr. <hi>Robert Bolton,</hi> and wrote two Books judiciouſly upon this Subject, to the good acceptance of many Godly and Learned men, received the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Gods Grace at this Ordinance.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001433_0046_0FB2F08B39332C58"/>As Mr. <hi>John Humphry</hi> gives the Account. And indeed all men when they come to the Lords Supper, depend upon the help of God for communicating in Faith; if God don't aſſiſt Godly men, it is impoſſible for them to do it; and if God do not change the hearts of natural men, it is impoſſible for them to do it. But one and the other muſt ly in Gods way and ſo wait upon him for his Grace.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> blames me for ſaying, That it is not to be imagined, that all that were Baptized by <hi>John</hi> were Regenerate; or judged by him to be ſo: and ſaith, I do not confirm my Aſſertion with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>p.</hi> 65. I ſhall give him a reaſon now: that they were not all Regenerate appears from, Joh. 5.35. <hi>John was a burning and a ſhining light, and ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light.</hi> That <hi>John</hi> did not think them to be ſo, appears becauſe, he knew that many were called and few were choſen: and that <hi>the Kingdom of God is like a net, that was caſt into the Sea and gathered of every kind,</hi> as Chriſt teaches us, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.47.</p>
               <p>He takes notice, that I ſay, <hi>If Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons might not be Baptized, the Phariſees would not have been blamed for neglecting
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001433_0047_0FB2F08CD497DDA8"/>Baptiſm. And ſaith, that</hi> Mr. S. <hi>implies that John would have Baptized them, but that they refuſed to be Baptized by him. Whereas the truth is other-wiſe, they would have been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized but John refuſed to Baptize them.</hi> And he brings ſeveral Authors to confirm it. <hi>p.</hi> 66, 67.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What they ſay is no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to what I ſay. It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay, that <hi>John</hi> would have Baptized them, if he were willing to do it upon ſuch conditions as they were able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: he required of them to bring forth fruits meet for repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8. that is to behave themſelves as Saints; this they might have done, tho' Unregenerate. And it is very proper to ſay, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be Baptized, becauſe they did refuſe it upon thoſe terms that <hi>John</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. He that has a mind to a Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but will not go to the price of it, doth refuſe it. If they had renounced their Errors and Superſtitions and reformed their lives, <hi>John</hi> would not have refuſed them, tho' there had been no Saving change in their hearts, but their neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things, was a refuſing of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>

            <head>The Second BOOK. <hi>The Arguments of</hi> Mr. Vines, Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>and</hi> Mr. Charnock, <hi>Anſwered.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MR. Vine's <hi>firſt Argument. No Effects can be aſcribed to this Sacrament of the Supper, that fall not under the ſignification of it: One thing is not ſignifyed and another wrought. But the Converſion of a Sinner is not ſignifyed by this Sacrament of the Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I premiſe, that this Argument is as ſtrong againſt the Paſsover, being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance, whereas we know that by inſtitution that was to be attended by Unconverted men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny the minor. Eating &amp; Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sacrament does ſignify feeding upon Chriſt; when men do act faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, they are ſaid to feed upon the body &amp; blood of Chriſt. Joh. 6.53, 54. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, &amp; drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoſo eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my fleſh &amp; drinketh my blood hath eternal life. And the firſt act of faith or feeding on Chriſt, which is actual Converſion is ſignifyed as well <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

2. Argument, <hi>That Sacrament that by the inſtitution of it preſuppoſeth thoſe that reep the benefits of it to be Converts, is no Conventing Ordinance: But this Sacrament of the Supper preſuppoſeth by the Inſtitution, thoſe that reap the benefits of it to be Converts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the minor. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Inſtitution of it ſuppoſes them to be ſuch as the Church is bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. <hi>viz.</hi> Viſible Saints. If God have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Church to admit viſible Saints, whether they be real Saints or not; we cannot ſay that they are by Inſtitution ſuppoſed to be real Saints: Men may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what they will, but by Inſtitution they are ſuppoſed to be viſible Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Argument, <hi>The word is the only Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to beget Faith.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he intends the Preaching of the Word, both parts will fall under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Conſequence is denyed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is the Preaching the word in the Lords Supper: there the Goſpel is Publiſhed, that Chriſts blood is ſhed for the remiſſion of Sins: there is an offer of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed: Chriſt may be Preached, though there is not a diſcourſe of an hour upon a Text.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Arg. <hi>If no man is commanded or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to receive the Sacrament without the Profeſſion of true Faith, then not without faith it ſelf: But no man is warranted to receive the Sacrament, without the Profeſſion of true faith.</hi>

I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the minor: For then no man might come, but he that has Aſſurance. And a great many gracious men muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he means that no man is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to receive the Sacrament, unleſs he profeſſes real faith. I deny the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: He would prove his conſequence, <hi>becauſe no man is bound to make a falſe: Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>

               </gap> Anſwer it is the duty of a man that is rationally convinced of the truth
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001433_0051_0FB2F09B61114D30"/>of the Goſpel to affirm that he believes it, tho' he doth not believe it with a Saving faith. They were blamed for not doing of it: Joh. 12.42, 43. <hi>Among the chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers many believed on him, but becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue, for they loved the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God.</hi> When ſuch profeſs faith, they make a true Profeſſion, they profeſs that which they do indeed believe, though their profeſſion be not graciouſly ſincere, &amp; men are bound to ſpeak the truth, though they only do it with a moral, and not with a gracious ſincerity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Arg. <hi>If no Commandments that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Scripture will warrant men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament without Saving faith, then no man may receive the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Saving Faith: but none are produced in the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The minor is denyed. He proves it two ways. 1. <hi>They were not Commanded to be circumciſed, whether they did conſent to the Covenant or not. Anſ.</hi> That is a great miſtake, Children were not capable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. 2. <hi>The Parent confeſſed an hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Covenant, and an hearty conſent to it, is Faith. Anſ.</hi> If an hearty conſent to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001433_0052_0FB2F09F69472F38"/>the Covenant be ſaith, yet the profeſſion of an hearty conſent to it, is not faith.</p>
            <p>In the next place he reherſes a popular diſcourſe of Mr. <hi>Charnocks;</hi> wherein there is ſuch a looſe way of arguing, that it is hardly worth the while to put Pen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to anſwer the arguments.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Charnocks</hi> arguments are of two ſorts; the firſt ſort are to prove that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Perſons may not come to the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Arg. <hi>The Lords Supper is Childrens bread. Anſ.</hi> If ſo then it does belong to the viſible People of God, whether they be Regenerate or no. Deut. 14.1. <hi>Ye were the Children of the Lord your God.</hi> Iſa. 1.2. <hi>I have brought up Children.</hi> Jer. 3.14. <hi>Turn O backſliding Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Arg. <hi>For Unregenerate Perſons to come to the Lords Supper is a mocking of God.</hi> Anſ. It is no more a mocking of God than for ſuch Perſons to pray; by this argument they may not Pray.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Arg. <hi>An Unregenerate man is not in Covenant with God, becauſe he has no faith, which is the condition of the Covenant, therefore has no right to the Seal of the Covenant.</hi> Anſw. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. By this argument <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had no right to the Seal of the Covenant, nor many
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001433_0053_0FB2F0A0ECBC9B30"/>of thoſe that God commanded to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, <hi>Joſn.</hi> 5.2. 2. That many Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men are in external Covenant. Deut. 5.2 <hi>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in </hi>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> therefore they have a right to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Covenant. 3. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Unregenerate men have a right to the offer of the internal Covenant, and ſo they may have a right to the Seal of it, which does Seal the truth of the Covenant, and alſo Seals the Spiritual and Eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant, not abſolutely, but conditionally.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Arg. <hi>An Unregenerate man is dead: what has a dead man to do with a feaſt?</hi> Anſ. Thoſe that are Spiritually dead are called upon to believe, which is a feeding upon Chriſt. So that they have to do with a Feaſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Arg. <hi>The Sacrament is an Ordinance of inward Communion with Chriſt.</hi> Anſ. So was the Paſsover, yet Unregenerate men might partake of that; and Unregenerate men when they come to the Lords Supper are capable of believing, and ſo having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Arg. <hi>Freemen only have a right to the Priviledges of the city: and true Chriſtians to the Priviledges of the Church.</hi> Anſ. The
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001433_0054_0FB2F0A34E829D68"/>Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and other Gentile Churches, <hi>Were fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſehold of God,</hi> Eph. 2.19. When he ſaith fellow citizens with the Saints; he means fellow citizens with the Jaws: but neither all the profeſſing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, nor all the Jews were Regenerate men.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of Arguments are to prove, that the Lords Supper is not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Arg. <hi>Baptiſm is not a Converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, much leſs this of the Supper.</hi> Anſ. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a Converting Ordinance two ways. 1. God gives Grace to the Children in this way. Some in their Infancy: thus we hope for ſome that dye in Childhood; ſome afterward. 2. The conſideration of their being Baptiſed, is a means to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their Converſion, by convincing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakning and incouraging of them. He would prove, that <hi>Baptiſm is not a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordinance, becauſe Circumciſion was to Abraham a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of faith, which he had when he was Uncircumciſed,</hi> Rom. 4.11. But tho' Abraham had faith before he was Circumciſed, yet it don't follow that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had, that all his Male Servants had; and others in future times.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Arg. <hi>Bread &amp; Wine are not to enloven
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001433_0055_0FB2F0A5A1C98D28"/>a Dead man, but to nouriſh a living man, Chriſt is offered here as Spiritual food, and ſpiritual food ſuppoſeth a new birth.</hi> Anſ. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is to be denyed: for theſe three reaſons. 1. Becauſe this Argument lyes as ſtrong againſt the Paſsover's being a Converting Ordinance as the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. 2. Becauſe Chriſt being offered as ſpiritual food, is a ſpecial incouragement unto the firſt act of faith, which is actual Converſion, if Chriſt offers to nouriſh us up to eternal life, that draws us to accept of him. 3. The Lords Supper repreſents Chriſt as the bread of Life, as he is; and then it is a Converting Ordinance. The reaſon is, becauſe he is not only, a life ſupporting, ſtrengthning, nouriſhing and increaſing bread, but a life giving bread. Joh. 6.48.53. <hi>I am that bread of life, except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</hi> And life is given in Converſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Arg. <hi>Pre-examination implies that it is no Converting Ordinance.</hi> Anſ. It implies no ſuch thing, becauſe this Examination is about diſcerning the nature of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance: about <hi>diſcerning the Lords body,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Arg. <hi>The nature of Excommunication
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001433_0056_0FB2F0A6EED326F0"/>ſhews it to be no Converting Ordinance. If it were a Converting Ordinance, the Inceſtuous Corinthian, ſhould rather have been kept in the Church then caſt out.</hi> Anſ. 1. Though it be a Converting Ordinance, yet only to orderly Members; the cenſures are for the Converſion of diſorderly ones, in caſe they be Unconverted. 2. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as ſtrong againſt its being a ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Ordinance. The Corinthian if he were a godly man, as Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, had then need to be kept in the Church that his Grace might be ſtrengthned.</p>

And God threatens ſuch Perſons as neglect it, except they were Unclean or in a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. <hi>The man that is clean and not in a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, &amp; forbeareth to keep the Paſsover, even the ſame Soul ſhall be cut off from his People,</hi> Numb. 19.13. The want of Sanctification never was alledged by any man, as a reaſon for forbearing the Paſsover. Unſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jews did ſin when they attended the Paſsover, becauſe they did it not in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manner: ſo they did when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any other duty of Worſhip, but the attending of this Ordinance was no Sin, nor ever charged on them as Sin in the Scripture: it would have been a great tranſgreſſion if they had neglected it. There were many times, when there were very few godly men among them. Pſal. 12.1. <hi>Help Lord for the godly man ceaſeth, the faithful fail, from among the children of men.</hi> Iſai 53.1. <hi>Who birth believed our report &amp; to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed.</hi> Yet the Paſsover was to be attended by the whole Congregation of Iſrael: there was no reſtriction laid upon them in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:001433_0058_0FB2F0AC25071870"/>time, or <hi>Joſiah's</hi> time, and their practice is ſpoken of as matter of commendation.</p>
            <p>The conſequence is likewiſe good. If the want of Sanctification, did not make it unlawful for men to come to the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over: Then it don't make it unlawful for men to come to the Lords Supper. The Paſsover is a Sacrament as well as the Lords Supper, therefore <hi>Chriſt is called our Paſso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſsover is Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or us.</hi> In the Paſsover Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and it is as well as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith. If it be unlawful for Unſanctifyed perſons to partake of the Lords Supper, becauſe that is a ſign of Chriſt Crucifyed, it would on the ſame account have been unlawful to have partook of the Paſsover, for that likewiſe was a ſign of Chriſt Crucifyed. If it were unlawful, becauſe it is an holy Ordinance; then they might not have come to the Paſsover, for that was an holy Ordinance alſo. If it be unlawful becauſe therein Saints have communion with Chriſt, it would upon the ſame account have been unlawful to have come to the Paſsover; for Saints therein had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt. If it were unlawful, becauſe the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001433_0059_0FB2F0B2458C9BC8"/>is a Sacrament of confirmation, then it would have been unlawful to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of the Paſsover, on the ſame account: the Paſsover &amp; the Lords Supper are like figures, one of Chriſt to come, the other of Chriſt already come: and when Chriſt aboliſhed one, he inſtituted the other in the room thereof. It ſeems to me that many Perſons do make an idol of the Lords Supper; crying it up above all Ordinances both of the Old &amp; New Teſtament, as if it were as peculiar to Saints as heavenly glory, and to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more reverence than all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. It may be this is ſome of the relicks of Popiſh Idolatry, in making the Bread &amp; Wine to be the natural Body &amp; Blood of Chriſt. They do by the Lords Supper as ſome men do by the Name of Jeſus, they bow to that, but not to the Name of Chriſt, or God, or the Holy Ghoſt. So theſe Perſons have a greater reverence for this than any other holy Ordinance. It concerns them to ſee that there be no Superſtition in it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> makes three exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Argument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Exception. <hi>That the Church of the Jews was National: &amp; the Church now is Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational:</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:001433_0060_0FB2F0B5885938E8"/>and he depends on Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to make it good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no oppoſition between the Churches being National &amp; yet Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational. The whole Nation may be a National Church, and the ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations may be Congregational Churches, as the ſeveral Synagogues of the Jews were.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why we have no account of any National Church among the Gentiles, is becauſe there was no Nation Converted to the Chriſtian ſaith, during that time; which we have the Hiſtory of, in the New Teſtament: there were a few in one City and a few in another that did receive the Chriſtian faith: but the bulk of the ſeveral Nations lay in their heatheniſm.</p>
            <p>At the Jews were a National Church of old, ſo when they return, they will be a National Church again, and as they will be a National Church, ſo Gentile Nations that profeſs the true Religion, are Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Churches. His objection that then there muſt be an High Prieſt is frivolous. If he had argued that then there muſt be a National Church Government, he had argued right; becauſe Iſrael was a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church they had an Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rim,</hi> but they had an High-Prieſt on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001433_0061_0FB2F0B6B7DE4EA0"/>account, <hi>viz</hi> to typify Chriſt as the High-Prieſt of our Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>A Nation that is in Covenant with God is a National Church, a Nation that are in Covenant with God are the People of God, bound jointly and ſeverally to keep Covenant with him. God is one party in the Covenant, and they are the other, and being bound together to keep Covenant, the whole muſt have power over the parts, to rectify all Mal-adminiſtrations, and to ſee the Covenant kept: it need not ſeem ſtrange to any to hear of a National Church in the time of the New-Teſtament, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how it was foretold by Iſaiah: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.24, 25. <hi>In that day Iſrael ſhall be the third with Egypt, and with Aſſyria, whom the, Lord of hoſts ſhall bleſs, ſaying, bleſſed be Egypt my People, Aſſyria the work of my hands, and Iſrael my inheritance.</hi> And how it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by Chriſt: <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.33. <hi>The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of Meal till the whole was leavened.</hi> Though few entertain the Goſpel at firſt, yet the whole Country in a while are brought to entertain it. What is a National Church but a Profeſſing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion jointly bound to keep Covenant with God.</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:001433_0062_0FB2F0B8E8EA6550"/>
2. Exception. <hi>Though Goſpel myſteries were typifyed by the Poſsover, yet it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in ſpecial, to be a commemoration of the deliverance out of Egypt, and ſo the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to partake of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If when he ſaith, it was in ſpecial to be a commemoration of the deliverance out of Egypt, he intends no more. 1. Then this, that beſide its typifying Goſpel myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it had a particular reſpect to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of Egypt; there is no force at all in the exception, if it had ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to that, that hindred not the Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Ordinance, neither could it be a reaſon why Unſanctifyed perſons ſhould come to that Ordinance, more than to any now in the time of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the reſpect is had to the deliverance out of Egypt, does not deſtroy the reſpect it had to the Redemption by Chriſt: its being a Memorial of the deliverance from Egypt, don't hinder it from being a Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith, nor make it fit to be attended by ſuch as may not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Lords Supper. 2. If when he ſaith, it was in ſpecial to be a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the deliverance from Egypt, he means that it was eſpecially, or principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtituted for that end, to be a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001433_0063_0FB2F0BB2D73F4B0"/>of that deliverance from Egypt; ſurely he did not Write thoſe words in cold blood: the deliverance out of Egypt was a great Mercy, but ſmall in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the deliverance by Chriſt: if the great thing was to be a Memorial of the deliverance from Egypt, why was there not ſuch another Ordinance inſtituted, when they were delivered from Babylon; if that were the great thing why was it abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed after Chriſts ſuffering? can it enter into any mans heart, to think that the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying the Redemption by Chriſt was only a thing by the by in this inſtitution? is that deliverance from Egpyt the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing intended in the preface to the ten Commandments? <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Exception. <hi>That Scandalous Perſons might come to the Paſsover but not to the Lords Supper.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Adulterers, Thieves, Liars, Slanderers, Perjured perſons, might come to the Paſsover, and I muſt admit ſuch Scandalous perſons to the Lords Supper, or let go my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Paſsover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he teaches me what to anſwer, <hi>viz. That more poſitive fruits of Regeneration are required in the Church Members of the New Teſtament than the Old.</hi> But I dare not give that anſwer, becauſe of the abſurdity of it:
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001433_0064_0FB2F0BD842BBBD8"/>for the perſons, that he ſpeaks of wanted the Negative fruits of Regeneration, and were not able to ſay, as the Phariſee: Luk. 18.11. <hi>God I thank thee I am not as other men are Extortioners, Unjuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this I anſwer, that he does greatly reproach the Church of Iſrael: he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to endeavour the purity of Goſpel Churches, but obtrudes that upon us which is crude and indigeſted, as if all ſorts of vile perſons might according to divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, live in communion with the Jewiſh Church: as if the Church of Iſrael were like Babylon a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. I know there were great corruptions many times among them, but ſurely viſible Saints were always <hi>de jure,</hi> the matter of Church Members: So Iſrael are often called: Deut. 33.3. <hi>All his Saints are in his hands:</hi> So David calls them: Pſal. 111.1. <hi>I will praiſe thee in the Aſſembly of the Upright and in the Congregation.</hi> And he teaches us, <hi>That holineſs becomes Gods Houſe for ever,</hi> Pſal. 93.5. And not only as Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> ſaith, in the time of the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>God appointed in the Church of Iſrael a way for the removal of Scandals. For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:001433_0065_0FB2F0BEF299DF68"/>
1. Men were required in caſe of Sin to offer up their Sacrifices: as is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident from the Law of Moſes. Lev. 6.6, 7. <hi>He ſhall bring his treſpaſs offering unto the Lord, and the Prieſt ſhall make attonement for him before the Lord, and it ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> This offering of Sacrifice was to be attended with confeſſion. Lev. 5.5. <hi>He ſhall confeſs that he hath ſinned in that thing, &amp; he ſhall bring his treſpaſs-offering unto the Lord for his ſin.</hi> Numb. 5.6, 7. <hi>When a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man commit any ſin, that men commit, then they ſhall confeſs their ſin that they have done.</hi> Hereby the Scandal was removed: there were to be viſible ſigns of Repentance, as now are required among us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In caſe of obſtinacy they had their way to purge the Church: they had their Eccleſiaſtical cenſures, according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution. Which as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> calls them, were an authoritative Excluſion of them, from the Society of the Church and the Members of it. The Jews do diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe cenſures into three degree, the firſt they call <hi>Niddui,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Cherem,</hi> the third <hi>Shammatha.</hi> The Jews in Chriſts time did agree, that if any <hi>confeſſed Chriſt, they would put him out of the Synagogue,</hi> Joh. 9.22. This was executed on the blind man,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001433_0066_0FB2F0C143FBE1D8"/>
               <hi>v</hi> 24. And it is very probable that when it is ſaid in the Old Teſtament, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate offenders ſhall be cut off from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their People, that this is at leaſt ſometimes intended by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When Perſons were under the ſecond cenſure, which they call <hi>Cherem,</hi> they were not to eat the Paſsover, they did allow them that were under the firſt to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, though at a diſtinct gate, which they called the gate of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but in the ſecond they were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: they agreed in Ezra's time, <hi>That thoſe that did not aſſemble within three days, ſhould be ſeparated from the Congregation,</hi> Ezra 10.8. Then they were looked on as Heathens, according to that, Math. 18.17. <hi>If he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a Publican:</hi> which was no new rule appropriated to the Goſpel Church, which was not in being, when Chriſt ſpake theſe words, but Chriſt did herein revive an old rule that had been always in force.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Argument. <hi>If no Unſanctifyed Perſon may come to the Lords Supper, than no man may come, but be that knows himſelf to be Sanctifyed: But perſons may come, that do not know themſelves to be Sanctifyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:001433_0067_0FB2F0C36ADA69C8"/>
The minor is granted. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> grants that there is no neceſſity of Aſſurance: and that if Perſons ſearch and have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable hope that they are Converted, they may come. <hi>p.</hi> 84.</p>
            <p>The conſequence is plain: becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſuppoſition, That Sanctifyed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only muſt come; he that don't know his Sanctification, doth not know that he hath any right to come: and ſo he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat in faith, and therefore Sins in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus the Apoſtle determines the caſe about eating of fleſh: that thoſe that doubted whether God allowed them to do it and yet did it, were guilty: Rom. 14.23. <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he eateth not of faith, for whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi> He that doth not know that he is Sanctifyed, doth not by that doctrine know that he hath any right to come: he is ignorant that he hath any warrant to come: if he comes, he comes upon his peril of eating and drinking damnation to himſelf: if he comes he takes a liberty to do that, that he doth not know, that God gives him a liberty to do: it is horrible preſumption for him to come; if all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctifyed perſons are forbidden, then he doth not know but that it is forbidden
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001433_0068_0FB2F0CF4F064C58"/>fruit to him, and that he rebels in coming: he that doth that, which he doth not know he may lawfully do, will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in it: Conſcience may ſay to him, What right have you to it, Who gave you leave, What Warrant have you to do it? If Churches are to cenſure only Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons, then they muſt know they are Scandalous before they do cenſure them; it is not enough for them to ſay they don't know but that they are, or they think that they are. If a man has a liberty to Sell only his own Horſe, and not another mans, then he muſt know it to be his own and not another mans; and it is not enough for him to ſay, He did not know but it was his own, or he thought it was his own. If a Miniſter has a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Preach nothing but the truth, then he muſt know it to be the truth before he Preaches it; it is not enough for him to ſay, he did not know but it was, or that he hoped it was. Thus it is in this caſe. If only Sanctification gives him a real right to the Lords Supper, then nothing ſhort of the knowledge of Sanctification can give him a known right to it: until he knows his Sanctification he is ignorant of his right: if Sanctification only gives him a
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001433_0069_0FB2F0D3173928F0"/>right, then if he doth not know his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, he doth not know, that he hath a right. Probable hopes wont Warrant him to come: for they don't give him a right, it is only Sanctification doth that, neither do they evidence that he hath a right.</p>
            <p>But though the truth of this Argument be as evident as the light of the Sun at Noon day, yet it would be ſtrange if Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> ſhould have no anſwer to give. <hi>He tells us if after ſerious Examination, be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hope there is a good work begun in his Soul, be ought to come, though his hopes be not Aſſurance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſay, he ought not to come unleſs he has a right to come; ought he to come if he have this hope, whether he be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate or not? he may have theſe hopes, and yet be unſanctifyed, then it is not San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification that gives him the right but the hopes of it: he ought to come, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaith: yet he ought to ſtay away becauſe he is unſanctifyed: he is charged to come becauſe of his hopes, and condemned for coming becauſe he is unſanctifyed.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> labours to give relief to Wounded Conſciences by a compariſon, he tells, <hi>If a Jew after he had ſearched for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001433_0070_0FB2F0D4057AC560"/>leaven in the houſe, found none, be was to eat the Paſsover; ſo if Chriſtians after ſelf Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, cannot find that they are in a ſtate of Hypocriſy, which is leaven, they ought to come to the Lords Table.</hi> Here is a ſhadow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubſtance, a compariſon without a ſimilitude. The Jew ſearches for leaven, he finds bread and is at a loſs whether it be leavened or no; may he eat the Paſso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without removing that bread; ſo the Chriſtian ſearches his heart, and finds a great deal of hypocriſy, but is at a loſs whether it be reigning hypocriſy or no: ought he in this caſe to run the venture and come to the Lords Table?</p>
            <p>The caſe with theſe men that don't know their Saint-ſhip, is like the caſe of the Prieſts that could not find their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, Ezra 2.62, 63. <hi>They were put from the Prieſt-bood as Polluted, that they ſhould not eat of the holy things, till there ſtood up a Prieſt with Urim and Thummim.</hi> So theſe that cannot find their Saint-ſhip muſt forbear eating at the Lords Table, till they can make it out, if it be Sanctification that gives a right to the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>There is a ſtrange inconſiſtency in his doctrine, ſometimes he teaches that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation gives the right to come, and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001433_0071_0FB2F0D6DD96C0B8"/>that unſanctifyed perſons may not come; ſometimes that if they hope after Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that they are godly, then they may come. But if it be grace only that gives them a right, then preponderating hopes of Grace will not give them a right; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if an hope that they are godly gives them a right, then that which is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will give them a right: for ſuch are the hopes of many men, founded in Pride and Ignorance: <hi>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleanſed from their filthineſs,</hi> Prov. 30.12. Again, if a probable hope gives men a right, then when ever they have a preponderating fear that they are not godly, they muſt forbear, and ſo neglect the means of their conſolation. Again, if a preponderating hope gives them a right: then ſome have a right to the Lords Supper, that are worſe than ſome that know themſelves to be Unconverted: ſome conceited ſenceleſs men nouriſh ſuch an hope: and ſome that are very near to the Kingdom of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbled and prepared for Chriſt know themſelves to the Unconverted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Argument. <hi>Thoſe that are Members of the Church and neither ignorant nor ſcandalous may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, but ſome
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001433_0072_0FB2F0D80EF90200"/>Unſanctifred perſons are Members of the Church and neither ignorant nor ſcandalous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The major doth appear, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, this is his command to his Church. When Chriſt inſtituted the Supper, he appointed it to be an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for Diſciples to the end of the World, when he ſaid, <hi>This do in remembrance of me,</hi> Luk. 22.19. It doth not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the duty of the Apoſtles at that time, but that they and their ſucceſſours ſhould attend that Service in all Generations. Therefore this command is inforced on the Church of Corinth by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. This is one ſpecial way wherein the Church doth give a teſtimony unto Chriſt, celebrate the Memory of his death, and ſhew it forth: <hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is alſo evident from the practice of the Apoſtles, and primitive Church, thoſe that were added to the Church continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this practice. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. So the <hi>Diſciples came together on the Lords day to break bread,</hi> Acts 20.7. This was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo of the Church of Corinth: there were not a Number of them that neglected, becauſe unſanctifyed, but they all partook.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001433_0073_0FB2F0DCB3CFA048"/>1 Cor. 10 17. <hi>We being many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread:</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. <hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor is alſo evident. That ſome Unſanctifyed men are Members of the Church. The fooliſh Virgins did belong unto the Kingdom of God, as well as the wiſe, Mat. 25.1, 2. <hi>The Kingdom of heaven ſhall be likened to ten Virgins which took their Lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom, and five of them were wiſe, and five were fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh.</hi> Multitudes that are in fellowſhip with Churches are deſtitute of Saving Grace. Among the many that are called ſew are choſen, <hi>Math.</hi> 20.16. Our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author does acknowledge this, but he faith, <hi>They are not duly qualifyed to be Members of Churches.</hi> But this is utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with what he faith in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For he doth again &amp; again acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Churches ought to admit thoſe that are Saints to rational Charity, though they be Unregenerate; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he doth acknowledge, that if after <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Examination, a perſon cannot but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that there is a good Work begun in
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001433_0074_0FB2F0DDA94B2EA8"/>his Soul, he ought to come. And by theſe two rules many that are deſtitute of Grace ought to be admitted into Churches, God does appoint them to come and God does appoint Churches to accept of them; ſo that according to divine inſtitution they are Members of Churches, and qualifyed according to Gods Ordinance for it.</p>
            <p>For the further clearing that ſome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctifyed perſons are Members of the Church. Let it be conſidered, that many of theſe perſons were born in the Church, and therefore Baptized in their Infancy, and have been all their days bred up in the Church, and never gave any juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be caſt out of the Church: ſo that they have their ſtanding there, and are regular Members of the Church.</p>
            <p>I foreſee that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> will object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, from his digreſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe perſons do belong to the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Catholick, but not to any particular inſtituted Church, and he has Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> for his voucher.</p>
            <p>But this will not bear Examination; it is as if he ſhould ſay, That the Children of the Town, were Members of Mankind, and Members of the Common Wealth, but not Members of the Town where they
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001433_0075_0FB2F0E008DFA6F8"/>dwell: Is it agreable to reaſon to think that the Church ſtands in relation to them, and is bound to ſee to their Education, and that they ſtand in no relation to the Church? How unreaſonable is it to think, that a Multitude of men ſhould be reckoned of the Common Wealth of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and have ſome Priviledges for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Children, and yet be under no Eccleſiaſtical Government? is not this quite contrary to the practice of theſe Churches, who have been wont to call many to account for their Miſdemenours, who were the Children of the Church?</p>
            <p>What do theſe men want to make them Members of particular Churches? he will ſay, <hi>They want to be in Covenant with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches;</hi> but there is neither Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nor PRecedent for it in the Scripture. He faith in another Book, That I call the Church a body corporate; but there is no forming of a body corporate without a Covenant; but therein he lies under a great miſtake; bodies corporate may be made by Law, and they may be made by Charter.</p>
            <p>There is a covenant indeed between God and every profeſſing Nation. God brought his people of old into a Church
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001433_0076_0FB2F0E16E26E548"/>Eſtate by making a covenant with them, which covenant was ſeveral times renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10-13. And all Proſelytes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews were to take hold of this covenant: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.4. But there is no neceſſity of any covenant between the Members of a particular Congregation among themſelves, though God makes Promiſes to a National Church, it does not follow, that the Members of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation muſt make Promiſes among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There was a covenant between God and the Church of Iſrael: but the Members of each Synagogue did not make a covenant between themſelves: Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches may be bounded either by civil Authority, or Eccleſiaſtical, or by Argument: and it is ordinarily the duty of every one that is a Member of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, to carry on the Worſhip of God in conjunction with the particular Church where he dwells: and he is bound by his profeſſion of Religion ſo to do, and the Church likewiſe doth ſtand bound to accept of him, if he carries well.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Argument <hi>If the Lords Supper be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for Converſion of Sinners as well as for the Edification of Saints, then Sanctifying Grace is not neceſſary to mens attending of it: But it as Inſtituted for the Converſion of Sinners: not
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001433_0077_0FB2F0E354F985A8"/>for the Converſion of Heathens to the Chriſtian Religion, but for the Saving Converſion of Profeſſing men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor which is only in queſtion, may be confirmed by theſe conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Ordinance has a proper ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote mens Converſion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion taken largly, as it comprehends preparatory Work, conſiſts of three parts, &amp; this Ordinance is ſerviceable to them all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conviction.</hi> Men muſt be convinced of the anger of God becauſe of their Sins, and the neceſſity of being at Peace with him: and this Ordinance is a means to ſettle this conviction on the heart: for here is a diſcovery of the terrible anger of God for ſin, by the inflicting of the curſe upon Chriſt, when ſin was but imputed unto him; a man may well reaſon thus, <hi>If this be done to the green tree, what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Humiliation.</hi> Or the bringing of the Sinner off from his own Righteouſneſs: for in this Ordinance God teaches men, the neceſſity of Chriſts righteouſneſs, that their own is but husks, and will not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them up unto eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith.</hi> Chriſt is here offered to men, and the call makes way for the anſwer of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001433_0078_0FB2F0E707BC4920"/>the Soul; here is an affecting repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the dying love of Chriſt, which ſerves to remove many diſcouragements, and of the accurſed death of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sinner may ſee Satisfaction made for ſin. In this Ordinance the truth of the covenant is Sealed, which is a great means to beget in the Soul a perſwaſion of the cruth of it. And if the man be but convinced of theſe things he is gained: thoſe that underſtand any thing of the working of Gods Spirit on the heart, muſt be ſenſible that it hath a great tendency to advance Converſion; &amp; why has God given it ſuch a tendency to promote Converſion, if it were not appointed for that end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some that are Unſanctifyed ought to offer themſelves to communion in the Lords Supper, and that on a double account; <hi>1ſt.</hi> Becauſe they are in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and therefore being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant nor of bad converſation, the Seal of the covenant doth belong to them. Many of them were born in covenant and have actually renewed the covenant, and therefore ought to tender themſelves to communion, they ought to receive Gods confirmation of his covenant, and to uſe
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001433_0079_0FB2F0E9C934DF60"/>the means to ſtir them up to keep cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>2ly.</hi> Becauſe it is a ſcandal if they do not, and the Church may call them to an account for their neglect. It is a viſible contempt caſt upon the Ordinance, it is a denyal of the Goſpel, and a refuſal to ſhew forth the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Church by the Ordinance of God is bound to admit many Unconverted perſons to the Lords-Supper, they are Eccleſiaſtically qualifyed having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and a good converſation; they are Saints to a judgment of Charity, walking orderly; and therefore the Church is to accept them into their communion; the Church is to act upon what is viſible, ſo that according to the Ordinance of God they are to be received to communion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lords Supper is for the Spiritual good of all that are regularly to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto. All Ordinances attended according to inſtitution, are for that end, that the Spirit may be Saved in the day of the Lord Jeſus, and ſo this Ordinance. This is the Work of the Miniſtry in all their adminiſtrations, by all means to ſave ſome. This Ordinance may have a contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, &amp; be an occaſion of the ruin of ſoftie: but the direct end of it is Salvation, and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:001433_0080_0FB2F0ED52801D50"/>ſo the direct end of it is Converſion, when the Subject that it is adminiſtred unto ſtands in need of Converſion: there is no reaſon to confine the benefit of it unto Saints.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> argues, That <hi>Faith comes by Hearing,</hi> Rom. 14. Why does he not argue that the Subſequent acts of faith come by hearing as well as the firſt, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords Supper is not for the ſtrengthning of Faith. Put indeed there is Hearing, as well as Seeing, and Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Smelling and Taſting, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, there is a gracious offer of Chriſt, and all his benefits, which has a proper tendency to beget faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Argument. <hi>If the Lords Supper be only for Converted men, then God would have given ſome certain rule in the attending of which it might be reſtrained to Converted men: but he hath given no ſuch rule in attending of which it may be reſtrained to Converted men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The major is evident, becauſe if it be appointed only for Converted men, and no rule given whereby it may be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, then his Law would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. The law would be a meer ſnare, and men would be under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to prophane his Ordinance: it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001433_0081_0FB2F0EFA6C1DC18"/>on the Wiſdom and Holineſs of God to impute ſuch a thing to him. God don't bind his Church to impoſſibilities, if he had made any ſuch Ordinance, he would give gifts to his Church to diſtinguiſh Sincere men from Hypocrites, whereby the Ordinance might have been attended.</p>
            <p>The minor is alſo evident: He has given no ſuch rule to his Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be reſtrained to converted Men. This appears becauſe by the rule, that they are to go by, they are allowed to give the Lords Supper to many Unconverted men: for all viſible Signs are common to men converted and unconverted. If they go by profeſſion of the truth, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both; if by a good Converſation, that is common to both; if by zeal in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that is common to both; if by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in the cauſe of God, that is common to both; if by knowledge, that is common to both; if by a relation of Experiences, that is common to both.</p>
            <p>Obj <hi>There is a certain rule given whereby godly men may knew their godlineſs, &amp; that they are Warranted to come to the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> will not ſtand by that rule: for he ſaith, <hi>That if after ſerious ſelf Examination, a man cannot but hope that
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:001433_0082_0FB2F0F150230EC8"/>he is a godly man, he may come though be hath not Aſſurance:</hi> And if he goes by Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi> rule, that will not reſtrain the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to converted men. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> pretends to give a ſolution of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by propounding another Objection for me to anſwer. He ſaith, <hi>That I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that only Orthodox Chriſtians may come to the Lords Supper;</hi> and then there muſt be a certain rule to know the inward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of mens hearts: but he miſtakes the matter very much; I only hold that men muſt be Orthodox in their Profeſſion. Churches are to judge concerning viſible Saint-ſhip, when they go higher they go beyond their Sphere.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>why ſhould we not believe that men that give us an account of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and whoſe Converſations are outwardly blameleſs and holy, are really according as they ſeem to be.</hi> I will give him a reaſon, and that is becauſe it may be falſe; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons that have given a fair account and carried well in the eye of the World for ſeveral years, have not proved well at laſt: and God obliges no man to believe that which may be falſe.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:001433_0083_0FB2F0F2B4E74238"/>
6. Argument. <hi>If Unſanctifyed men may attend all other Ordinances or Duties of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then they may lawfully attend the Lords Supper: But they may attend all other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or Duties of Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor will be generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: And indeed there was not any duty of Worſhip required ſince the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, that they might not attend. But Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> doth object: he grants that an Unconverted man may Preach: for he may have great gifts which he may and ought to improve to the glory of God, and the good of men. But he thinks he may not adminiſter the Lords Supper; he ſaith, <hi>The argument from Natural to Inſtituted Worſhip will not hold.</hi> But he ſtrangly forgets himſelf; might not the Prieſts of old though unregenerate attend other duties of their Office as well as Preach the word; Sacrificing was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Worſhip as well as adminiſtring the Lords Supper, ſo was offering of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe: but where were they forbidden to do thoſe Services, in caſe they were Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate? the bleſſing of adminiſtrations in the houſe of God doth not depend upon the Piety of the Miniſter. The Officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001433_0084_0FB2F0F491C2E000"/>as Prieſts of old did depend upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Generation, and not upon Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Unregeneracy did not give them a diſcharge from the work of their Office.</p>
            <p>The conſequence may be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, becauſe there can be no reaſon aſſigned, why Unſanctifyed perſons may attend all other duties of Worſhip and not the Lords Supper. If there be the like reaſon for them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear other duties of Worſhip as to forbear this, and the like reaſon to attend this act of Worſhip as others, then the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of attending them, ſhews the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of attending this: if it were made out to be Gods pleaſure that it ſhould be ſo that is reaſon enough: but there is no reaſon can be aſſigned for ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
            <p>Particularly: It can be no reaſon for Unregenerate men to forbear the Lords Supper becauſe it is an holy Ordinance: For all the Ordinances of God are holy. Circumciſion was ſo, and the Paſsover, ſo is Baptiſm: theſe Ordinances were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the advancing of Holineſs, there was Religion in them, they were to be attended in an holy manner, and it was great Wickedneſs to uſe them in a
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:001433_0085_0FB2F0F8346F5AE8"/>prophane way; they were deſigned for the honour of God, yet that was no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon for Unregenerate men to forbear attending of them: and therefore that can be no ſufficient reaſon to forbear attending the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lords Supper being a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Seal of the Covenant can be no reaſon. Two of Mr. <hi>Gilleſpy</hi>'s arguments are built upon that foundation; but if that arguing were good, Unregenerate perſons muſt be forbidden all Sacraments. <hi>Circumciſion was a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of faith, Rom.</hi> 4.11. Yet God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Joſhua</hi> at <hi>Gilgal</hi> to Circumciſe all the Males who were born in the Wilderneſs: who were ſeveral hundred thouſands, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Its being a Sacrament of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be no ſufficient reaſon. For the Paſsover was ſo as well as the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; Circumciſion was the initiating Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the Jews, and the Paſsover the Sacrament of confirmation: but Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men might lawfully celebrate the Paſsover, when God firſt appointed it, multitudes of them were Unregenerate, as appears by their carriage in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As this Sacrament does repreſent
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001433_0086_0FB2F0FA278BCF50"/>Chriſt as food for the Soul, ſo did the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over: As in this Ordinance, Saints have communion with Chriſt, ſo they had in the Paſsover.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is no ſufficient reaſon,</hi> becauſe the Miniſter is to ſay at the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, That <hi>this is Chriſts body which is given for you,</hi> and <hi>this is his blood which is ſhed for you:</hi> according to the Pattern: <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19,20. For theſe words may be ſpoken to Unregenerate men. As Miniſters often do in their Sermons, when they call on Sinners to come to Chriſt, and when they reprove for ſin, and urge them to duties of Obedience: thoſe expreſſions do not intend that Chriſt did dye deſignedly for them, but that his death and ſatisfaction is offered to them, and ſhall be made over to them if they accept of Him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gods not allowing Scandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to come to this Ordinance is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Some Scandalous perſons indeed may be far better than Unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet there may be great reaſon for the former to be prohibited and not the latter: Scandalous perſons are forbidden, partly to bring them in that way to a ſight of their evil practices, partly for the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001433_0087_0FB2F0FDD6680DB0"/>Vindication of Gods Name, which has been diſhonoured by them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Apoſtles commanding men to Examine themſelves as a preparation for coming to the Lords Supper, can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If he had ſaid, Let men Examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves &amp; ſo let them faſt, we ſhould not have thought that to be a ſufficient reaſon for Unregenerate men to abſtain from faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And if he had ſaid, That he that Prays unworthily, and Hears the word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, expoſes himſelf to Damnation or Judgment, we ſhould not have looked upon that a ſufficient reaſon for Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men to refrain from Praying, and Hearing of the Word.</p>
            <p>Were I a Papiſt, and did I believe the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, that the Bread and Wine were the natural body and blood of Chriſt, I might think that to be a ſufficient reaſon for Unregenerate mens not coming to the Lords Supper, &amp; though I do not imagine any ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions in thoſe Brethren that differ from me, yet I doubt that opinion has laid the foundation of their doctrine, and likewiſe of recieving the Sacrament knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:001433_0088_0FB2F1002EE1FBD0"/>
7. Argument. <hi>They that are in external Covenant with God, and neither Ignerant nor Scandalous may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, but ſome Unſanctifyed perſons are in external Covenant with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor cannot be denyed. God made a Covenant with the whole People of Iſrael: <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.2. They and their Poſterity after them were the Covenant People of God: God ſtood in relation to them as their God, they ſtood in relation to him as his People. And ſo the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing People of God now are in Covenant with him, and ſo are their Children, and therefore they are baptized.</p>
            <p>The conſequence is evident from hence. Becauſe it is lawful for them to keep the external Covenant: as they have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſo they have a legal power to keep the external Covenant. The attending of the Lords Supper is one of the external duties of the Covenant: Circumciſion is ſaid <hi>to be the Covenant:</hi> Gen. 17.10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee, every man Child among you, ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 14. The neglect of this is called, <hi>A break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Covenant.</hi> So the Lords Supper
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001433_0089_0FB2F101AF55FB20"/>is part of the Covenant, and a token of the Covenant: and if any Profeſſing People do neglect it, be it under what notion it will, it will be a grievous breach of Covenant.</p>
            <p>If God does command them to attend Covenant duties, then he don't forbid them; God does not require and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the ſame thing, there is a conſiſtency in Gods commands: He does not lay a tye upon mens Conſciences to come, and lay a tye upon their Conſciences to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; God makes them promiſe to keep his Covenant; and will he make it criminal to attend thoſe duties of the Covenant, which he has made them promiſe to keep? they cannot keep the Covenant if they don't come to the Lords Supper, therefore it muſt be lawful for them to come.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>It is a Covenant duty but it muſt not be attended by Unqualifyed Perſons; though it be a Covenant duty, yet not for Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor Scandalous Perſons, nor Unſanctifyed Perſons: if Perſons be not duly qualified it is no immediate duty for them; the Ignorant muſt get knowledge, Scandalous perſons muſt repent of their tranſgreſſions, and Natural men muſt get into a Converted condition, and ſo come to the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:001433_0090_0FB2F1033683E308"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very reaſonable to ſay that God requires Ignorant perſons to come, and yet for bids them to come before they have knowledge; and that he requires Scandalous perſons to come, and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids their coming until they have made Satisfaction: becauſe they are able to qualify themſelves, they may truly be ſaid to have liberty and legal power to come, becauſe they have a natural power to qualify themſelves; it is their duty to amend their fauls and ſo to come.</p>
            <p>But it is unreaſonable to ſay that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men are commanded to come, and yet that they are forbidden to come till they are Sanctifyed: for their Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a thing out of their power: the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible people of God are able to keep the external Covenant: It cannot be ſaid to be lawful for them to keep the external Covenant, if it doth depend upon their Converſion which is indeed out of their power. But indeed there is no part of the external Covenant, that is beyond mens natural power, or their legal power.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Argument. <hi>Either ſome Unſanctifyed Perſons may lawfully come to the Lords Supper, or it is not lawful for them to carry themſelves
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001433_0091_0FB2F105A52BEE20"/>as Saints: But it is not unlawful for them to carry themſelves as Soints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor doth appear: Becauſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are commanded to carry as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Saints: Phil. 1.27. <hi>Let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</hi> Such as make a Profeſſion of the Goſpel, ought not to carry ſo as to give men occaſion to ſear that they are not Saints: they may not live in ſuch a way as is unlawful for Saints to live in, in ſuch a way as is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Spirits of Saints: it is unlawful for them to bring a reproach upon their Profeſſion; to live in ſuch a way as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the living exerciſe of Grace.</p>
            <p>The truth of the disjunction doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; becauſe when Profeſſors do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Lords Supper, they do not carry themſelves as Saints; for they do neglect that Ordinance that Saints are bound to attend; and they neglect that Ordinance that the Souls of Saints do crave, they do viſibly deny the Goſpel, they withold their Teſtimony from Jeſus Chriſt, and do not ſhew forth the Lords death. This neglect of theirs is an unholy carriage, not
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001433_0092_0FB2F106F4E04528"/>according to their Profeſſion; they carry like viſible Unbelievers they are called viſible Saints &amp; challenge Baptiſm for their Children as viſible Saints, and yet in this particular they carry themſelves as Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and not as viſible Saints.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Argument. <hi>If Sanctifying Grace be neceſſary unto the lawful attending of the Lords Supper, then none but thoſe that have a Saving work of Converſion, may attend it: but that is not true doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor is evident from hence: That doctrine that has a direct tendency to diſcourage many godly Men from doing their duty, and the means of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to make their attending of their duty to be a torment to them, is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture. For one great deſign in the Scripture is to encourage godly men to do their duty: but this doctrine has quite another tendency.</p>
            <p>There be many godly men, that are not aſſured of their Converſion: but are exerciſed with many fears about their Sincerity: though Grace be viſible, yet ſeveral Perſons that have it do not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know it. Grace may be ſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, and falſe hearts may go ſo far
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:001433_0093_0FB2F10AA08BF478"/>in Religion, that many godly men are held down with great Suſpicions that they are not godly, eſpecially at times. Hence godly men are adviſed <hi>to give all diligence to make their Calling &amp; Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. And this doctrine has two bad effects upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It makes them neglect the Lords Supper.</hi> It is their duty to attend it: it is one of the holy appointments of Jeſus Chriſt; and we owe this Service to Chriſt to ſhew forth his Death, and give our teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony before the world, to the vertue of his blood, which is an honour and glory to him; and this Service is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to our ſelves to draw forth the actings of faith, to ſtrengthen our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and to quicken us in a way of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: but ſeveral as choice Perſons for godlineſs as any, ſo far as men can judge, have been ſo diſcouraged by this doctrine, that they have neglected the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and continued at leaſt for ſome time in the Omiſſion of this Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It makes ſome of them to attend it with guilt and torment.</hi> They have been urged to attend it by a fear leaſt they ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, and by the perſwaſions of men, and by conſidering that it would be an
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:001433_0094_0FB2F10B67FBBF90"/>occaſion of reproach: and an offence to the Church, if they ſhould not do it. Yet becauſe of this doctrine, they have been far from Satisfaction in what they have been doing: Conſcience has forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them, threatned them and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for doing of it; they have ſet upon thorns, and had a great deal of fear and diſquietment of Spirit: hereby they have been hindred from attending of it in an holy manner; Conſcience has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them to meddle with it, their thoughts has been taken up at the time, not about the virtue of Chriſts Death, but about their own dreadful venture in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither: the fears of their hypocriſy have been increaſed by their daring to participate; that that ſhould have been a means to comfort them, has proved an occaſion of torment to them.</p>
            <p>If theſe perſons be told that this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be only for Converted perſons, yet if they after Serious Examination have hopes that they are Converted, they may and ought to come; That will not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their tender Conſciences: they will ſay, <hi>We may have ſuch hopes and yet not be Converted: the hopes of Multitudes of men are deluſions, and if our hopes ſhould be ſuch,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:001433_0095_0FB2F113E5C76EB8"/>
               <hi>they will not warrant us to come, we don't find in the Scriptures, that God gives allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to men becauſe they have hopes; we can't find that God ſaith we ſhould come, if we have ſuch hopes:</hi> the men ſay: <hi>We don't know but that we eat and drink Damnation to our ſelves: the thing that is required is Converſion, not hopes of Converſion. If God ſhould demand of us, What makes us ſo bold to come, He will not accept of that for an anſwer, That we hoped we were Converted, if we be not indeed ſo, we prophane Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and eat forbidden fruit.</hi> Fears that they are not Converted is a ſtronger ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make them ſtay away, than hopes that they are Converted is to make them come: Tender Conſciences will not be bafled with ſuch anſwers.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Argument. <hi>They who do convey to their Children a right to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, have a right themſelves to the Lords Supper, provided they carry inoffenſively: But ſome Unſanctifyed perſons do convey unto their Children a right to the Sacrament of Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor is evident from theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Children of ſome Unſanctifyed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:001433_0096_0FB2F115FA769550"/>perſons have a right to Baptiſm.</hi> For the Children of all viſible Believers have a right to Baptiſm, and among them, there be ſeveral Unſanctifyed Perſons: and it has been determined by a <hi>Synod</hi> in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England, That the Children of thoſe who are born in the Church, and underſtand the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, and own the Covenant, are to be Baptized.</hi> And the generality of the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> do prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice accordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Parents though Unſanctifyed, do convey this right unto their Children.</hi> The Children have a right to Baptiſm, becauſe they are the Children of viſible Believers: the Children are Eccleſiaſtically holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one at leaſt of their Parents are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Believers: 1 Cor. 7.14. <hi>The unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Husband is Sanctifyed by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is Sanctifyed by the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The conſequence is evident, becauſe this ſhews that they are in Covanant with God. If they were not in Covenant with God, their Children would not be in Covenant, neither would they have any right to Baptiſm; but they are in Covenant, God has made Promiſes to
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001433_0097_0FB2F11854EE0840"/>them, and they are under Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to him; and becauſe they are in Covenant, and inoffenſive in their Converſation, the Seal of the Covenant does belong to them.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Argument. <hi>If the Inviſible Church Catholick is not the prime and principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Seal of the Covenant, then ſome Unſanctifyed perſons may lawfully partake of the Lords-Supper: But the Inviſible Church Catholick is not the prime and principal Subject, of the Seals of the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor is laid down as a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> in his Survey: <hi>p.</hi> 41. which he proves by ſeveral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt Mr. <hi>Ruterford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly he argues, Such as were graceleſs and without any intereſt in Chriſt, and ſo none of his inviſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, have Gods command to injoyn, and his word to warrant them, to receive the Seals; as <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and all the Males were injoyned to be Circumciſed. All the Families of the Jews were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eat the Paſsover, many whereof were without all queſtion, not inviſible and believing Members of Chriſt. He
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001433_0098_0FB2F119CA95ABC8"/>adds, That the viſible Church is the Olive ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. The Seals are part of that fulneſs that appertains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and therefore the viſible Church is the prime ſubject of them. And he brings in Mr. <hi>Ruterford</hi> confeſſing that if any after they are received, ſhall be found Unregenerate, they are not to be caſt out for that. And ſaith upon it. Then I ſuppoſe you will not deny them the Seals. <hi>p.</hi> 43.</p>
            <p>I mention this Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> to ſhew how injuriouſly Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> deals with me, when he calls my Opinion, a new, upſtart and ſingular Opinion; and the vanity of his admiration, That a Miniſter of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſhould Publiſh ſuch doctrine; whereas its no other than what has been Printed by one of the Pillars of the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> Sixty years before.</p>
            <p>Had Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſpoken half ſo much in the Vindication of Mr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in probability he would have ſpent good part of a Page in an Encomium of him, and in urging the irrefragableneſs of his diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:001433_0099_0FB2F11CB5FBEA70"/>
Before I conclude, I ſhall take notice of two failings further in Mr. <hi>Mather's</hi> Book; one is, That he recites ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of mine, where I Paraphraſe on and illuſtrate my Poſition about the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Supper: as if they were the arguments that I brought to prove my Opinion; and then ſaith, Is not all this weak ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing. <hi>p.</hi> 76. He has now my arguments, and his liberty to ſhew the weakneſs of them.</p>
            <p>The other is, That he ſaith, My doctrine hath been condemned by an whole Synod of Elders and Meſſengers of Churches: who met in <hi>Boſton</hi> in the year 1679.</p>
            <p>The words of the Synod are theſe, <hi>It is requiſite that Perſons be not admitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Communion in the Lords Supper, without making a Perſonal and Publick Profeſſion of their Faith and Repentance, either Orally or in ſome other way, to the juſt Satisfaction of the Church, and that therefore both Elders and Churches be duely watchful and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall give the World an Account how the matter was acted. Some of the Elders in the Synod had drawn up a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:001433_0100_0FB2FBD5074C0EA8"/>That perſons ſhould make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the work of Gods Spirit upon their hearts, in order to coming into full Communion. Some others of the Elders objected againſt it, and after ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe it was agreed to have a diſpute on that queſtion, Whether thoſe Profeſſors of Religion as are of good Converſation, are not to be admitted to full Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, provided that they are able to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, and diſcern the Lords body. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> held the Negative; I laboured to make good the Affirmative: The reſult was, That they blotted out that clauſe of Making a Relation of the work of Gods Spirit, and put in the room of it, <hi>The Making a Profeſſion of their Faith and Repentance;</hi> and ſo I Voted with the Reſt, and am of the ſame judgment ſtill; yet this Vote is mentioned as condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my Opinion.</p>
            <p>What can we ſuppoſe to be the reaſon, that Divines in reckoning up thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that flow from Effectual Calling, take no notice of a right to the Lords Supper, they reckon Juſtification, Adoption, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, Peace of Conſcience, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Aſſurance of Gods Love, &amp;c.
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001433_0101_0FB2FBD676DF4D60"/>But I meet with none that reckon a right to the Lords-Supper among thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: I can give no other reaſon than this, That it is not accounted of by them a peculiar Priviledge of thoſe that are Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually Called; but the Priviledge of viſible Believers: neither would Paſtors of Churches ſatisfy their Conſciences, to forbear warning of ſuch as were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that they were in a Natural Eſtate, to refrain coming to the Lords Supper, if they did judge it to be a Sinful and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing for them to come.</p>
            <p>If theſe things which I have Written be impartially conſidered, it will appear that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> has not proved any miſtake in the Sermon, that he has ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much zeal againſt; indeed Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> has in a manner given the caſe. (1.) By owning that the Church ought to receive Unregenerate men, provided they are Godly to rational Charity. (2.) That it is the duty of perſons to come to the Lords-Supper, if after Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination they cannot but hope, that there is a good work begun in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:001433_0102_0FB2FBDA300A3F90"/>
I will conclude this defence, of my Self, and my Sermon againſt which Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> has Written, with my aſſurance of my Brethren in the Miniſtry, and all good Men, That I differ from none of them in a ſtrict Opinion of the Straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gate, and Narrowneſs of the Way that leads to Life; nor of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Sincere Repentance, true Faith and Obedience, to all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Goſpel, in all ſuch as Expect Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of which the Participation in the Sacraments of the New-Teſtament of themſelves, give no Aſſurance, as is evident from our Saviours anſwer at the Great Day to ſuch as challenge, <hi>to have Eaten and Drank in his Preſence;</hi> yet am well aſſured, they are the Ordinances and path of Life, in which every Chriſtian ought to walk; and I dare not my ſelf, as one of the Stewards in Gods Houſe, refuſe his Bread to ſuch as regularly demand it, upon the Tearms mentioned in this ſmall Tract, in which I am well confirmed by the Practice of ſo many Proteſtant Churches; nor am I at all Startled by
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:001433_0103_0FB2FBDBC8FAE3A0"/>any mans Opinion to the contrary. All Proteſtants agree that there is no Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility at <hi>Rome;</hi> and I know no body pretends to any elſe ſince the Apoſtles days; nor do I fear the Athenian accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Novelty any more than the great Apoſtle, and becauſe we muſt all anſwer for our ſelves to our Great Maſter, I am contented, and hope I live dayly in a Preparation for that Account. In the mean time, I will carry it as I ought to all good men of another Opinion, leaſt I be found beginning to beat my Fellow-Servant, when my Lord ſhall come; being well aſſured, That if a ſtrict diſcipline be maintained in the Churches of Chriſt, all Unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants will be far more eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and reformed, than if I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them what is their juſt due, and thereby Scandalize them, to their Offence, and it may be to their Ruin.</p>
            <p>The firſt Reformers of the Church from Popery proceeded well, but we ſtayed not with <hi>Luther,</hi> ſince which the Proteſtant Churches have gone further; and I hope <hi>New-England,</hi> has done ſomething more
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:001433_0104_0FB2FBDDF1A1A488"/>than moſt: but I ſhould be very vain to think there muſt be nothing left for us of this Generation, and am very fearful leaſt the Neglect of a good Government of all Gods People, born within the Pale of the Church, ſhould bring theſe Churches to a great defection; the means to prevent which, is not to deny them their right at the Lords Table, but to give them that, and a good and ſtrict Watch over their Lives and Manners, together with it; which I Pray to God may be never wanting in <hi>New-England.</hi>
