            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN Troth this Demand alarms me. I have endeavoured to put a good Face on the Matter; but I really dread the Conſequence. <hi>A full Moiety of Fourteen Thouſand Cocks of Hay, with Boot and Emblements and all!</hi> I cannot think of it with Patience. But I am told that I <hi>muſt</hi> think of it. My late <hi>Chums</hi> and <hi>Cronies! where are you all now?</hi> Such a Moiety to refund, and left in the Lurch! Hah <hi>Friendſhip!</hi> where art thou? But it was my own darling Doctrine, (and hang me for having ever preached it) <hi>not to value any man longer than he is able to ſerve you.</hi> My Diſciples, like apt Scholars, have imbibed the Maxim, and will now play off the <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem</hi> againſt their poor old <hi>Democritus,</hi> without Mercy. But People ſo obliged, and ſo virtually veſted with all my Influence and Authority throughout the whole Hamlet! For them, to deſert me in my ſoreſt Extremity! But <hi>Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur cum illis.</hi> Come, then, <hi>Fate,</hi> my old Divinity, ſtand by me! Come <hi>Fortune,</hi> hitherto propitious, and ſuccour thy conſtant Favourite! But what are <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> to a Chancery Suit for <hi>Seven Thouſand Cocks of Hay?</hi> Like a huge Cake of Ice at the opening of Hudſon's River,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011702_0003_0F87EB531E6572C8"/>
it advances with a ſlow but reſiſtleſs Motion, ſweeping away in its Progreſs, the ſtrongeſt oppoſing Houſe or Barn, even as the weakeſt—Drumſtick. <hi>One half of all my Harveſt! A full and complete Moiety! An equal Diviſion of Fourteen Thouſand Cocks of Hay!</hi> 'Tis unconſcionable. O how I mow'd with all my might and Main againſt the Expiration of the Leaſe! And how my Friends labour'd like Emmets, to get it houſed before that fatal Period! A goodly Crop it was; and never before did the ſame Farm produce the like. But no ſooner has my Landlord's Agent entered the Cloſe to make his Demand, but away fly my Workmen, pell mell and helter ſkelter, with Carts, and Waggons, and Teams, and Forks, and Rakes; leaving me, like the D— of C—, <hi>with Nobody by me but myſelf.—One half of the whole Crop with the Emblements and Appurtenances, and Hay-Boot, and Eſtovers and all!</hi> Not I, indeed. I will hold faſt as long as I can. The <hi>Habendum</hi> and <hi>Tenendum,</hi> are worth all the reſt of the longeſt Deed in the World. Poſſeſſion is eleven Points of the Law. But where is the <hi>Title</hi> to be tried? Aye, that's the Devil. What a Fool was I to kick up a Duſt againſt Juries? 'Tis the beſt Tryal in the World; and the grand Bulwark of Engliſh Liberty. But can it be juſt? Can it be right, that my Land-lord ſhould have half of all my Earnings? <hi>A full and equal,</hi> and (oh the frightful Thought!) <hi>to-be-divided</hi> Moiety? Is it
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011702_0004_0F87EB53DE667C68"/>
by Virtue of a Condition precedent, or ſubſequent? I remember no ſuch Clauſe in the Leaſe. <hi>Refund! Refund!</hi> and that, <hi>an equal Moiety?</hi> I think I can prove the contrary by expreſs Law. I raiſed the Crop myſelf. That was my own Act. If I am compelled to refund half, that will not be my own Act, but the Act of another, and conſequently tortious. This Authority may be found in Judge <hi>Hale,</hi> in his Chapter of <hi>Juries.</hi> I have often thought of <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Re-action,</hi> in a <hi>philoſophical</hi> Senſe; but Perdition, I ſay, to this <hi>Re-action,</hi> in the <hi>Law</hi> Senſe. But it ſeems I <hi>muſt</hi> think of it: And truly it is not now a Time to ſtrut and ſwagger. My Landlord is powerful: My Sons are his Tenants at Will: His Agent is inflexible: My Friends are ſhrunk into Non-Entity: And I may be called to an Account <hi>pour autros Choſes.</hi> Beſides, if the Moon will get in Oppoſition to the Sun, ſhe may depend upon being <hi>eclipſed:</hi> And this Conteſt of mine will probably be conſidered as our Meeting in the <hi>Nodes of the Ecliptic,</hi> upon which ſuch <hi>Obſcuration</hi> always enſues. 'Tis truly an intricate Point. Would to my Stars that I could prevent this <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> by driving away the <hi>Sun</hi> as the <hi>Chineſe</hi> formerly attempted to do on the like Occaſion, by Beat of <hi>Kettle Drum!</hi> I'm weary of Conjectures. I think I will either challenge the Array, or plead the Benefit of the Clergy. But hold—that is not the Caſe in Chancery. Pox on it, then I
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011702_0005_0F87EB549E67C870"/>
will convey the Whole in Truſt. Aye, but the Interrogatories upon Oath! In what an inextricable Quondary am I plung'd! I really think a Trial by Juries the wiſeſt Contrivance in the World. But this <hi>ſwearing—ſwearing—ſwearing!</hi> Oh for a Draught of the River <hi>Lethe,</hi> to deface the Memory of all my <hi>Receptions!</hi> Then I could anſwer plump, <hi>I know nothing about it.</hi> But am I obliged to diſcover <hi>all</hi> my Profits? Suppoſe I have ſold my Hay for more than the Market Price. Suppoſe I had found the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone</hi> upon the demiſed Premiſes, —What is all that to the <hi>uſual, cuſtomary</hi> and <hi>annual</hi> Profits of the Farm? Is a Man to get nothing by his own Genius and Invention? Suppoſe again, that Neighbour <hi>Hobſon,</hi> reduced to great Extremity, and obliged to move the Day before his Spouſe expected to lay in, has paid me (I, do you ſee me? improving that Occurrence according to Cuſtom) Twenty Shillings a Day for the Hire of my Team, when the ſtated Price is only Ten. Can my Landlord, upon his own Principles of a Moiety of my ſtated Earnings, demand more than Five? Surely he does not deſire to participate in my Extortions? He cannot expect more by Reaſon of <hi>Goody Hobſon</hi>'s being within a Day of her Reckoning. 'Twas my own perſonal Dexterity that mounted that Day's Hire from Ten to Twenty. And if this will do, I ſhall ſecure Three-fourths
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011702_0006_0F87EB555E630998"/>
of the greateſt Part of the Matter in Controverſy. For that in Fact is the Caſe with above Nine-tenths, of all the Profits I ever received. But <hi>one full Moiety of all!</hi> I cannot part with it. Such <hi>Re-action</hi> would be the moſt unprofitable Action of my Life; and ſuch <hi>Refund,</hi> the worſt of all Funds. <hi>The full Half of all my Profits!</hi> What! of every Hen, and Duck, and Chick, and Egg, and Calf, and Colt, and Pig, with a thouſand <hi>Etcaeteras,</hi> which are no more appurtenant to the genuine natural Iſſues of the Premiſes, than if I had received them upon the High Way? I cannot. Poſitively I cannot bear the Thought. My Landlord will not inſiſt upon it. I once had Merit; and it is not long ſince that I flattered myſelf to have been made <hi>Tenant for Life.</hi> Certain it is, that I have greatly improved the Freehold; and every Body knows that the Farm, while in my Tenure, has yielded, by the bare Dint of my Huſbandry, ten fold more than ever it did before. Who then could have put him upon this new-fangled pernicious Scheme of <hi>one half of all the Profits?</hi> Surely he has heard ſome ſtrange Tales to my Prejudice. Can he have learnt that I ſuffered one of his Servants, and <hi>merely becauſe he was his Servant,</hi> to be turn'd out of Doors, when I could have prevented it by a ſingle Word? In this I own, I did not conſult his Intereſt, agreeable to my conſtant Profeſſions. But then it was only the Sin of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011702_0007_0F87EB561E70A9E0"/>
gratify thoſe who would not be my Friends, but upon the Terms of that violent Meaſure. Or can he have heard that I have been bribed, to permit the Neighbours to encroach upon ſeveral of his Franchiſes, when it redounded to my own Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument, tho' greatly to his Diſadvantage? Why, it was only to oblige the very ſame Set of Friends; and I flattered myſelf that I had ſo gloſſed the Matter, with his Honour and Intereſt, and Power, and Dignity, and all that, (which I have conſtantly at my Fingers Ends) that he would never have detected me. But had I foreſeen this Conſequence, I can aſſure them, I had preferred their former Curſes to their late Cringings; and followed my old Practice of making <hi>Money, Money,</hi> my ſole and only Friend. But then what Reaſon had I to believe any Man ſincere? O dear-bought Experience, of what I could ſo eaſily have read in my own Breaſt! O that I could once more get Poſſeſſion of my ſweet delightful old Tenement! A beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Spot it was; and many, many a golden Harveſt has it produced me.</p>
            <q>O mihi proeter itos referet ſi Jupiter Annos!</q>
            <p>But ſomething, they ſay, muſt be done; and ſpeedily done. For the Agent is in full Chace; and after a few Doublings more, the old Fox will certainly be out of Wind. Why, and ſomething I ſhould be willing to do. <hi>But the Half of all my Profits!</hi> Skin for
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011702_0008_0F87EB56DE62BF60"/>
Skin, what will not a Man do to ſave his Money? <hi>An equal Diviſion!</hi> There is not a more nauſeous Bolus in the whole Diſpenſatory. I have read, when I lately commenced <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleader,</hi> of the <hi>Moiety</hi> of an <hi>Advowſon,</hi> and of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon</hi> of a <hi>Moiety,</hi> and of fifty other <hi>Moieties;</hi> but never a Syllable of the <hi>Moiety</hi> of my <hi>Profits,</hi> nor of the <hi>Profits</hi> of my <hi>Moiety. Melchizedek,</hi> I have heard my Father ſay, was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with a <hi>Tenth</hi> of the <hi>Spoil;</hi> and Decimation would make no great Hole in the Reckoning, But a <hi>full, equal, perfect, abſolute, entire, compleat, whole and total Moiety!</hi> There is no ſuch Thing in all <hi>Hobb's Leviathan.</hi> But then in Caſe of Refuſal, who will ſtand by me? Aye, that's the Queſtion. My greateſt Beneficiaries have abandoned me. Moſt of the Tenants remember my old Pranks, as how I have told his Honor a thouſand Fibs about them, and endeavoured to ſpirit him up to raiſe his Rent-roll. The Lawyers, whom I have ſo ſcurrilouſly treated, cannot in Honour be <hi>for</hi> me: And <hi>againſt</hi> me are the <hi>Powers,</hi> the <hi>Powers,</hi> the <hi>Powers.</hi> O the Viciſſitude of human Affairs! Surely mortal Man is a Drumſtick! <hi>Sic tranſit Gloria Mundi.</hi>

I will inſtruct them to frame, form deviſe, adviſe, conceit, conceive, conſtruct, fabricate, make, do, execute, and ſuffer; and cauſe and procure to be made, done, executed, and ſuffered, all and ſingular, and each and every, and all Sorts, Species and Kinds of dilatory, cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, poſtponitory, procraſtinatory, and circumlocutory Act and Acts, Thing and Things, Machination and Machinations, paſt, preſent, and to come, and World without End. Thus before the Complainant can have a Decree, the Defendant will be, <hi>non inventus. Zuks,</hi> this is a bright Thought! 'Tis the very Primroſe of all Invention. No, No, it is not worth a Farthing. They would call upon Poſterity. Yes, upon Poſterity. But what of all that? Pray, what has Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity ever done for me? But then I don't chuſe that the Money ſhould go from <hi>me,</hi> even after I am gone from the <hi>Money.</hi> There is a certain Connection that ſubſiſts, and will ſubſiſt, even <hi>poſt mortem.</hi> Why now again, I am as far from

the Mark as ever. I ſhall as ſoon diſcover the Longitude, as an Extrication out of my Difficulties! Indeed a Trial by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is the beſt Trial in the World. 'Tis the grand Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark and Paladium of our Liberties.—But after all, why can't I, for the firſt Time in my Life, do that which is right, and pay the Gentleman his Money without any Litigation? I know very well that there is ſuch a Clauſe in the Leaſe; and that I took the Farm upon that expreſs Condition. But then as it would be the <hi>firſt,</hi> ſo it would alſo be the <hi>laſt</hi> Time in my Life, that I gave up a Point, eſpecially concerning the ready Rhino, before I had wrangled it out to the End. For it would inſtantly kill me as dead as a Herring.</p>
            <p>But ſtay, ſtay, I think I have it. Yes, poſitively I have it.—<hi>Strike up the Drums! Huzza! Long live the King!</hi> I have it, I have it.—I will even take Refuge in a <hi>Petition of Dolence;</hi> for in a moſt <hi>daleful</hi> Condition I am. I will blazon my old Services, and conceal my recent Iniquities. My Landlord is bountiful; and at Repreſentation, aye and at Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too, who a greater Adept than myſelf? Let us try what they'll amount to.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In the Year 1747, I ſtood by a favourite Tenant of my Landlord's, who had got the ill-will of the whole Hamlet; and took the ſole Management of his Buſineſs upon myſelf.

In this I certainly have Merit. <hi>Unleſs his Honour ſhould have heard that I received Ten Shillings a Day for the Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I once took it into my Head from a Hint in a Letter of one of my Landlord's Attornies (which by the Way I knew meant no ſuch Thing) to embark in a very troubleſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, which I was certain would greatly aggrandize his Power; and indeed render him the Sovereign Arbiter of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his Tenants. It was this. I pretended that it was his poſitive Order, in meer Affection to them, and for the greater Security of their Eſtates, that he ſhould re-examine all their Quarrels and Diſputes, after having before been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by their Neighbours. To induce their Compliance, which I knew in point of Time and Expence, would reduce them to Beggary, I vilified all the uſual Arbitrators in that Part of the Country, and inſiſted that no Perſon in the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my Landlord alone, could poſſibly give a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any Caſe. I was upon the very Verge of carrying the Point, when the Lawyers ſet themſelves in Array againſt me; and compelled me to drop the Project, after the generality of the Tenants appeared to acquieſce in it. I did not however tamely yield the Diſpute. No, No, that was never any fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mine, when I intended to ingratiate myſelf with his Honor. I determined to ſee it out to the Butt's End. I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Law Books. I ſtudied Law. I wreſted Authorities.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011702_0013_0F87EB5A9E5CF300"/>
I pleaded. I twiſted and turned. I fretted and foamed. In ſhort I toil'd and moil'd, and tore and ſwore, and thunder'd and blunder'd, and diſcharged my Law as a Conjuror ſpits Fire. But all to no Manner of Purpoſe. That deteſtable Neſt of Hornets, (whom I have hated ever ſince) perſuaded the whole Village, (which by the bye, was the real Truth of the Matter) that my Meaſure, if carried into Execution, would not leave a ſingle Tenant ſo much as Salt to his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge. This was ſurely Merit, <hi>unleſs my Landlord knows that my ſecret View was only to pleaſe him, in Expectation of ſecuring a Leaſe for Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I have great Merit in the many Letters I have wrote to his Attornies, containing Schemes for encreaſing his Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments; and more than doubling his <hi>Rental.</hi> I remember I once projected to him how his Tenants might be made to burn Brick without Fuel; and that I could extract Gold-duſt from their Urine. Nay, at a particular Time I went ſo far as to aſſure him, that if he would furniſh me with ſufficient Force to protect the Workmen, againſt thoſe who I feared, might diſpute the Title, I would undertake to open a Mine in his Manor, that ſhould nett him above ten thouſand Pounds Sterling per Annum. At other Times I endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate his Favour, by traducing the moſt faithful of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants:
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011702_0014_0F87EB5B5E59A358"/>
As that they were debauched and diſaffected.—That they would often make free with his Name over their Liquor; and drink the Health of his greateſt Enemy, <hi>Le Chevalier Wou'd be.</hi> Surely all this muſt be real ſubſtantial Merit: and I well remember that Neighbour <hi>Frank</hi> for leſs than half of the <hi>Rodomontades</hi> I have tranſmitted, was lately made a <hi>Juſtice of the Quorun;</hi> and now ſtruts with his new <hi>Cockade</hi> ſo as ſcarcely to know his old Acquaintance. <hi>And though in theſe Meaſures Self-intereſt was my only Motive,</hi> I think it impoſſible he ſhould have ſeen through my Deſign.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, and <hi>Finis coronat opus.</hi> My Landlord once took a Notion of having all the Horſes and Cattle of his Tenants marked and branded, they paying ſo much a Head to the Agents whom he appointed for that Purpoſe. But on ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Marking-irons,</hi> the Tenants roſe in a Body; and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſeize and deſtroy the <hi>notarial Inſtruments,</hi> ſtock and block. Upon this, in ſheer Fidelity to his Intereſt (expecting however a ſmall Gratuity in the End, if his Honor ſhould be ſo minded) I took all the Irons into my own Tenement. To reſcue them out of my Poſſeſſion, they attacked the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage. Determined to repel the Aſſault, I threw up Trenches, fortified the Paſſes, covered the Fences with Bruſh, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed up every Sword, Piſtol, Bayonet, and Fowling-piece in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011702_0015_0F87EB5C1E588E00"/>
the Houſe. I pierced the Garret for threeſcore Muſkets. I ordered a Chauldron of boiling Water into the third Story; and diſpoſed of my Dung-cart, ready loaded, to defend the Poſtern. I caſt four pewter Urinals into Bullets; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted an old Frying-pan into a Breaſt-plate. I turned two Spits into Spiers, and ſix Braſs Kettles into as many Drums. Of my Muſtard-grinder I made an excellent Bomb; and a very comfortable Helmet of an half worn Iron Chafing-diſh. Thus fortified and accoutred, and looking like <hi>Mars,</hi> as one Egg is like another. I called to my Aſſiſtance a truſty Band of his Dependents; and threatened to return the Attack, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fire to every Hut, Cottage, Barn, Hovel, Cow-pen, Dove-houſe, Hen-rooſt, Barrack, and Stable, on the whole Eſtate. In ſhort, I diſplayed the moſt heroic Conduct; and though I never had any Connection with military Affairs, ſave in a certain Capacity that requires neither Powder nor Ball, I exhibited both the Skill and Bravery of the moſt experienced General; and finally preſerved all the Irons from the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Deſtruction. To revenge their Diſappointment, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents carried off, and burnt my Wheel-barrow; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the ſame Fate two of my Family Pictures, <hi>the Devil's</hi> and <hi>my own.</hi> But effectually to prevent their renewing the Siege, I ordered a Detachment in the dead of Night, to take off the Locks, and p—s in the Barrels of every Muſket in the Vicinity.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:011702_0016_0F87EB5CDE5B9B40"/>Now all theſe ſundry and divers and ſupernumery merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Services and Sufferings, Loſſes and Croſſes, Writings and Fightings, well-dreſſed and coloured, (as I very well know how) and humbly preſented in a moſt humble <hi>Petition of Dolence,</hi> will undoubtedly ſo mollify a good-natured Landlord, as to quit all farther Claim upon the <hi>Moiety of my Crop.</hi> 'Tis however the only Chance left. <hi>Fortune,</hi> I once more invoke thee! If thou deſerteſt me now, thou art a Vixen. For it muſt not go. I can never—never—never part with it.</p>
