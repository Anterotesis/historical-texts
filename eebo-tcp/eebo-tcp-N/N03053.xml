            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Hearts Deſire and Prayer to God for you and yours,</hi> is, <hi>That you might be ſaved:</hi> This likewiſe has been, and is my earneſt and conſtant Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; for your Souls are very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for whom our dear Redeemer ſpilt his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood. I am ſorry you will not give me more Opportunity to ſerve the Intereſt of your Souls, which I ſhould gladly do with all my Heart: But you are taught to keep at a Diſtance from me,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003672_0003_1002412F9BFE36C8"/>
and beware of my Converſation: And all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Pains have been taken to frighten you from coming within the Doors of the Church, which, at leaſt, is directly contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Advice, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Prove all Things and hold faſt that wich is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, becauſe you will not give me Opportunity to promote the ſpiritual Good of your Souls, neither at my Habitation, nor at the Houſe of God, I have taken this method to wait upon you at your own, and I hope you will not ſhut your Eyes againſt the Light, or be ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt the Title of this Paper, as not to read it carefully, and conſider it ſeriouſly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I BEAR you Record, that you have a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledge, Rom.</hi> 10 2. You are, many of you, ſeriouſly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpoſed, and heartily concerned to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but, give me Leave to ſay, you are unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily miſtaken and miſled in ſundry weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. Did you rightly underſtand the true State of Things, did you really know the true Principles of our Church, and how exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable her Doctrine, Diſcipline and Government are to the holy Scriptures, and the true primitive Church, as founded by the Apoſtles, I ſay, did you underſtand things as they really are, you would immediately fly into her Boſom, as into the Ark, and not be contented a Day out of our Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003672_0004_100241312591D028"/>BUT the Truth is, there are ſo many Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods and Slanders induſtriouſly ſpread about, to caſt Diſgrace on the Church, that, no wonder you are frighted from her, and afraid to be concerned with her; for it would indeed deeply grieve any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indifferent, ſerious and conſiderate Perſon, to hear what injurious Miſ-repreſentations, evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and groundleſs Reproaches ſhe ſuffers from ſome who call themſelves Chriſtians, may our <hi>Heavenly Father forgive them,</hi> and grant them better Minds, <hi>for they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I will obſerve to you in particular ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry falſe and groundleſs Stories, which you are made to believe concerning the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by which you may ſee how wickedly you are impoſed on and we abuſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. SOME of the wicked Books ſcattered about among you, would perſwade you, <hi>That our Church is little better than</hi> Popery, <hi>and ſymbolizes with the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> NOTHING can be more falſe and abuſive than this: For thoſe who firſt laid the Foundation of our Church, burnt at the Stake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not comply with Popery. And never did any Writers ſo effectually confute <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> as ours have, and we have as much Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt and Hatred to <hi>Popery</hi> as you can have: Nay, if you would give me Opportunity, I could make it appear, That ſome of your Principles are nearer a Kin to <hi>Popery</hi> than any of ours, and that there is nothing peculiarly taught or practiſed in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003672_0005_1002413394ECEB18"/>
               <hi>Church of England,</hi> but was taught and practiſed in the Church long before <hi>Popery</hi> was heard of in the World. Do we deny you the Scriptures or public Worſhip in your own Language? Do we worſhip Images, or pray to Saints or Angels? Do we teach Tranſubſtantiation, or deny the Cup to the Laity? Do we teach the Popes Supremacy or Infallibility, or Pray Souls out of Purgatory? Theſe and the like are the Abſurdities of <hi>Popery,</hi> which our Church abhors as much as you can do: So that your <hi>Delaune</hi> and the reſt of them are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably injurious to us, in endeavouring to faſten <hi>Popery</hi> upon us, and by the ſame Reaſons they might as well charge it upon you: For thus he argues; <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>uſe the</hi> Te Deum, <hi>the Reſponſes, &amp;c. ſo do the Church of</hi> Rome. Nay, he goes on, and ſays, <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>uſe the Apoſtles Creed, the Lords Prayer and Ten Commandments, and the Pſalms of</hi> David, <hi>and ſo does the Church of</hi> Rome. Does this prove them to be <hi>Popery?</hi> Why juſt as much as it proves the two Sacraments to be <hi>Popery.</hi> And indeed he did hold Infant Baptiſm and Sprinkling to be <hi>Popery</hi> as much as any Thing elſe in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And therefore his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do as much Prove you to be <hi>Papiſts</hi> as us.</p>
            <p>YOU are told, <hi>Our Church is a perſecuting bloodthirſty Church.</hi> I anſwer. This is a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive Inſinuation; for it is eaſy to prove, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> never ſhed a Drop of any Mans Blood in the World for his Religion.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003672_0006_10024135ED24B788"/>
It is true the civil Goverment hath ſometimes impriſoned and fined Perſons for ſeditious Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who pretended Zeal for Religion in what they did: But you are the moſt unreaſonable People in the World, to talk of Perſecution at this Time of Day, when you know that you have for almoſt 50 Years enjoyed a free Liberty and uninterrupted Tolleration. But if you are for looking back, remember <hi>the bleſſed Days</hi> (as ſome of you call them) <hi>of Oliver Cromwell,</hi> when the Diſſenters were uppermoſt, and the Church was ſuppreſſed, and her Clergy ſequeſtred, plundred, impriſoned and barbarouſly treated, and forbid to perform the leaſt Part of their Office. Or if you are for looking into <hi>Scotland,</hi> don't forget how barbarouſly the Epiſcopal Clergy were turned out of Doors and perſecuted, when the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> got the Upperhand: Inſtances theſe are enough to ſhut your Mouths, if you had any Modeſty: However I have nothing to ſay for Perſecution, I abhor it as much as you do; only I would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that we of the <hi>Church of England</hi> here have but too much Reaſon to apprehend, from ſundry Inſtances of the ſevere oppreſſive Treatment we have met with from ſame of you, that if we were in your Power, there are not a few would perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us, at leaſt as much as ever any Diſſenters were perſecuted in the World.</p>
            <p>SOME have been ſo ridiculous as to try to make you believe, <hi>That the Martyrs in Queen</hi> Mary<hi>'s Days (and particularly</hi> John Rogers) <hi>were
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003672_0007_100241384C2D14A8"/>
Preſbyterians.</hi> I anſwer, That nothing can be a more abſurd or falſe Pretence than this; for it is certain and can be eaſily made to appear that ſome of thoſe who were burnt at the Stake at that Time, were the very Men that compoſed our Prayer-Book, and ſealed their Religion with their Blood, and they all ſuffered long before the Preſbyterians were heard of in <hi>England.</hi> And this puts me in mind to obſerve to you, how wickedly ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon you, in making you believe, <hi>That we of the Church in this Country are not true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſuch as they are in</hi> England, <hi>and ſuch as they were from the Beginning of the Reformation.</hi> Now this is a moſt injurious Slander; for we uſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly thoſe very ſame Prayers now as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by thoſe old holy Martyrs, and the very ſame Service here as they do in <hi>England,</hi> Word for Word, without the leaſt Variation: But it is inſupportably abuſive in any of you, as ſome do, to charge us with being <hi>High-flyers</hi> and <hi>Jacobites,</hi> when you know in your Conſciences, that we conſtantly pray for our moſt Gracious Sovereign King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> and ſteddily practice and preach up a ſincere Attachment to his Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And I challenge you to produce an Inſtance of any one Perſon in theſe Parts, that ever mentioned the Pretenders Name but with Abhorrence.</p>
            <p>SOME of the wicked Books among you would perſwade you, <hi>That our Church places all Religion in mere outward Ceremonies, and holds no
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003672_0008_1002413AC9167A20"/>
Regeneration but Baptiſm, no Neceſſity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Work of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, this is all abſolutely falſe: For tho' we hold the great Expediency of outward Rites and Obſervances for Unity and Uniformity, for Decency and Order in the Worſhip of God; yet we don't place all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in them: On the contrary, we hold that all outward Performances without an inward Change of Heart and a good Life, are of no Account with God. 'Tis true, we call Baptiſm <hi>External Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 3.5. who there calls it <hi>the Waſhing of Regeneration;</hi> but we deny, that Baptiſm alone can ſave us without the inward Regeneration wrought in us, by the mighty Power of the Spirit of God: So that theſe vile Books do moſt falſly miſrepreſent and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly abuſe us, and we wiſh you therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly, how little thoſe are to be believed or regarded, who ſpread ſuch falſe and ſcandalous Books among you, to impoſe upon you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. YOU are told, <hi>That we don't hold the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Converſion and real Goodneſs, to qualify us for the Sacrament, and that we receive all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſtinction.</hi> I anſwer the direct contrary to this is true; for tho' our Charity is larger than yours, yet we hold the ſame Qualifications neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as you do: This appears to any one that will read our <hi>Exhortations to the Communion.</hi> We hold no Man can come acceptably without Faith, Repentance and new Obedience, whereas ſome of your Teachers hold the Sacrament a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003672_0009_1002413CA85FB180"/>
Ordinance, which the Writers of our Church deny.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some would perſwade you, <hi>That we take upon us to forgive Sins;</hi> whereas we only declare Gods Forgiveneſs to all true Penitents. And <hi>That we pray for the Dead,</hi> for this wiſe Reaſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, becauſe we pray <hi>That God would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member againſt us our Iniquities, nor the Iniquities of our fore-Fathers.</hi> Can it be that People would diſpute ſuch Things as theſe, were it not purely for Diſputing ſake, or diſſent for ſuch Reaſons, unleſs meerly for Diſſenting ſake? Surely they deſerve no Reply but that of Pity for poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant People that are impoſed upon by them, and for the poor trifling Diſputers that by ſuch means impoſe upon them.</p>
            <p>MANY Things are objected againſt us as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, ſuch as the <hi>Surplice, God-Fathers and God-Mothers in Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>the Croſs after it,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Days,</hi> and the like. I put theſe things together for brevily becauſe I would make the quicker diſpatch. And I anſwer in the firſt Place, There are very wiſe and good Reaſons for the propriety decency and expediency of theſe Practices; particularly, as to the <hi>Surplice.</hi> What can be more proper, than to diſtinguiſh the ſacred Services by a peculiar Garment, for which we have the Example of God himſelf in the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation, which, tho' not binding upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, may be a good Precedent to them, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing what is decent in publick Worſhip:
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003672_0010_1002413F14406708"/>
Thus in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 44 17, it is ordered, <hi>That when they come to miniſter in the inner Court, they ſhall be cloathed with linnen Garments:</hi> To which it is very likely St. <hi>John</hi> alludes, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19 8, even in Goſpel Times, when the Church <hi>ſhould be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in fine Linnen, clean and white, for the fine Linnen is</hi> [the Emblem of] <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Saints.</hi> I don't offer theſe as Scripture Evidences of the Neceſſity, but of the Lawfulneſs, Propriety and Significancy of this Appointment. And how mean a Thing is it, and how deſpicable a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to diſpute and contend about or take Offence at the Matter, Colour or Shape of a Garment? It betrays a Littleneſs of Mind, and a mean Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of Soul. And then as to <hi>God-Fathers</hi> and <hi>God-Mothers,</hi> or <hi>Sponſors in Baptiſm,</hi> what can be more proper or expedient, when a Child is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Covenant by Baptiſm, than that ſince the Child cannot anſwer for it ſelf, ſome Body ſhould anſwer its Part in the Covenant, in its Name? and that there ſhould be double Security for its Chriſtian Education? You don't think it unreaſonable in your temporal Affairs, to have Bondsmen joyntly engaged with the Perſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned in paying of Money; and can it then be thought improper, that there ſhould be the like double Security inſiſted upon for this more important Matter, the Chriſtian Education of a Child, in Caſe of Mortality, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, or any other Inability or Want of Duty in the Parents? And as to the <hi>Sign of the Croſs;</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:003672_0011_100241427A0FCCD0"/>
what can he more proper or ſignificant, after a Child is <hi>baptized into the Faith of a Crucified Saviour,</hi> and is publickly declared to be <hi>admitted into the Number of Chriſt's Flock,</hi> than to uſe this Sign, to intimate to us, that we ſhould be ſo far from <hi>being aſhamed</hi> of, that with St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6 14, <hi>We ſhould glory in the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> And this was a Practice that always obtained in the Church from the earlieſt Ages, and even ſeveral Hundred Years before the Day of Popery, as is plain from the Teſtimonies of St <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> within little more than a Hundred Years of the Apoſtles, which renders it highly probable that it was the very thing alluded to in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7 3. where we read of <hi>Sealing the Servants of God in their Forheads,</hi> ſo far is it from being <hi>a Mark of the Beaſt,</hi> as ſome opprobriouſly, and I may ſay, profanely call it! And laſtly, what can be more properly and wiſely done, than to ſet apart par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Days and Seaſons to commemorate the ſeveral Steps which our glorious Redeemer took in accompliſhing our Redemption, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in propagating the Knowledge of it: For by this Means every Miniſter is obliged once a Year to explain, and the People have Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as often to hear opened, each Article of the Chriſtian Faith, and ſo a lively Senſe of every one of them is the better kept up in their Minds; whereas you may go to Meeting ſeveral Years (and perhaps all your Days) and never hear ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, ſuch as the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003672_0012_100241440BBF7A10"/>
               <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> or <hi>Aſſenſion of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Diſcent of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> once particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained or inſiſted upon, and the Senſe of them is in Danger of being loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>Where has God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded theſe Things, and does he not give this Reaſon for the Unlawfulneſs of ſuch Things, that</hi> he commanded them not? <hi>Jer.</hi> 7 31. I anſwer no: For that Text don't ſpeak of Things in their own Nature indifferent, but what is notoriouſly ſinful and idolatrous, <hi>building high places and worſhipping Idols,</hi> which when he ſays <hi>he had not commanded,</hi> the meaning is he had forbidden them. And it betrays great (not to ſay wilful) Ignorance of the Figures uſed often in Scripture-Language, to put ſuch an Interpretation on this Text. So that the proper Queſtion in theſe and the like Caſes, is not <hi>Where has God commanded them?</hi> But <hi>Where has he forbidden them?</hi> For it is certain, that we may lawfully do any thing that God has not forbidden; and I dare challenge you to ſhew one Text, that forbids theſe or any Thing elſe that the Church requires. But then let me aſk in my turn, where has God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Relations as Terms of Communion, or your Form of Church Covenant, or that you ſhould keep a Faſt on the 15th of <hi>April</hi> (ſuppoſe) or a Thanksgiving on the 9th of <hi>November?</hi> You have no Rule in Scripture for keeping theſe Days. O, you will ſay, <hi>Our Governours command theſe Day to be obſerved, and we are commanded to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey

them!</hi> Very good; the ſame ſay we: Do you juſtify your ſelves in theſe Matters, and with the ſame Breath you juſtify us in every Thing we plead for: God has no where forbidden us theſe Practices, and our Governours both in Church and State have commanded them, and God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us <hi>to ſubmit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 13. and <hi>to obey them that have the Rule over us, who watch for our Souls, Heb.</hi> 13 17. and therefore we muſt obſerve theſe Rites and Days in Obedience to him as well as them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>Is not this teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men? Mat.</hi> 15 9. I anſwer, no: For what the Phariſees were there condemned for, was 1. advancing human Inventions into eſſential Doctrines, as tho' they were Divine and neceſſary in themſelves; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we declare theſe Things ſtill indifferent in their own Nature. You ſeem rather guilty of this, in inſiſting on your Church Covenant, and (in ſome Places) Relations, as Terms of Communion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of their being Divine Ordinances, and in making the abſolute Predeſtination of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, an eſſential Doctrine, which real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is no where taught in Scripture. 2. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees are here accuſed of juſtling out and ſetting aſide Divine Commands, by, and for the ſake of human Ordinances: Thus <hi>v.</hi> 6. They ſet aſide th fifth Commandment by their <hi>Corban, Mark.</hi> 7 11. whereas we challenge you to ſhew one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003672_0014_10024147957777D8"/>
Doctrine rejected, or one Divine Law ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and neglected by the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you ſay, <hi>why will you offend your weak Brethren by theſe Things? St. Paul ſays,</hi> 1 Cor. 8 13. Rom. 14. <hi>he would rather not eat Fleſh while he lived than offend.</hi> I anſwer, I am glad you are ſenſible that you are but weak Brethren, as indeed you really are if you take Offence at ſuch innocent harmleſs Things. But pray wherein do we offend you? To offend in the Apoſtles Senſe, is to lay a Stumbling-Block before our Brother, ſo as to cauſe him to ſin. Now I can't ſee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church is guilty of tempting you into any ſinful Practices; ſo far from this, that I would wiſh you to obſerve, That the Apoſtle in thoſe Places is ſpeaking of Things, not only indifferent in themſelves, but thoſe concerning which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine nor humane Authority had interpoſed to command or forbid, with Reſpect to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we muſt <hi>become all things to all Men;</hi> but does it hence follow, that we muſt diſobey God, or even lawful human Authority for Fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending? Nay, ſo far from this, that we ſhould properly, according to the Apoſtles Senſe, offend, if we ſhould not conform to the Laws of both Church and State; for then our Example of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to Authority would tend to confirm thoſe that diſſent from us in their Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Laſtly a great Noiſe and Clamour is raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us about <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and you are told we
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003672_0015_1002414BA2CD83F0"/>
are <hi>Arminians,</hi> To this I anſwer, That we hold no Doctrines now but what were held and taught in our Church long before <hi>Arminius</hi> was heard of as I can make appear from ſundry of the Writings of our firſt Reformers and Martyrs, <hi>Cranmer, Hooper,</hi> and <hi>Ridley, &amp;c.</hi> And if <hi>Arminius</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to agree with them in ſome of his Notions, I know no Reaſon however, why we ſhould be called after his Name. In Short, we have no Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with <hi>Arminius,</hi> he was a <hi>Dutch Preſbyterian,</hi> and we are none of his Followers: <hi>We call no Man Maſter upon Earth, for one is our Maſter in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> we are Followers of Jeſus Chriſt and his noble Army of Martyrs, who ſealed the Truth with their Blood. In a Word we hold no Doctrines but what where always held from the Begining, even in the pureſt times of Chriſtianity, none but what the Apoſtles every where taught, and are plainly revealed to us in the holy Scriptures, which our Church aſſerts to be her only Rule of Faith.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſome would wickedly perſwade you, <hi>That we lay aſide the Scriptures, and build on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authority:</hi> This as well as all the reſt, is a groundleſs Slander. 'Tis true, we make uſe of the ancient Writers, to help us in finding out the Senſe of Scriptures, and appeal to the certain Facts of the earlieſt Ages of the Church, as our beſt Guides in doubtful Caſes, where the Senſe of Scripture is Diſputed, to determine the true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; but ſtill that is our Rule both of Faith
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003672_0016_1002414D2BCC3438"/>
and Manners. Of the Falſhood of all theſe Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Miſrepreſentations, and the Truth of what I have here aſſerted, I could yet further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly convince you if I had Opportunity, and ſhould gladly do it; for while you are thus miſerably impoſed upon, and led on in Ignorance and Miſtake, I can't but look on you with the greateſt Compaſſion, and wiſh you to conſider the Danger there is leſt, while <hi>the Blind lead the Blind,</hi> they both <hi>fall into the Ditch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps you would deſire to know what I have againſt you; you think your Fathers <hi>were very good Men, and came here for the ſake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and you can ſcarcely be perſuaded to think <hi>they could be miſtaken.</hi> To this I anſwer, that I believe I think as charitably of your Fathers as any of you do; I am ready to believe that they meant well, and endeavoured to pleaſe God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of their Light: But I don't therefore think they were perfect: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary I am perſuaded, they greatly, tho' I hope ignorantly, erred in ſome things; and indeed I ſuppoſe you think ſo too, for you have greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them in ſeveral Inſtances, and are aſhamed of many of their Notions and Practices. Nay, your Teachers have in ſome Caſes uſed the ſame Arguments againſt them as we do, as ſome of you very well know, and if you think them wrong in ſome Things, why mayn't I think ſo in others, and at the ſame Time have as much Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for them as you have.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:003672_0017_1002414EB859CFD0"/>Indeed I own they and you too are right in many Things, nay in moſt of the Eſſentials and Fundamentals of Religion: For you joyn with us in teaching the Neceſſity of <hi>Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>ſober, godly and righteous Life,</hi> and <hi>of the ſupernatural Grace of the holy Spirit, to enable us to repent, believe and obey the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>that our Acceptance with God depends wholly on the free Grace of God, and the Merits and Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is happy that we agree thus far, and <hi>ſo far as we have attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, and mind the ſame Things.</hi> Give me leave however to obſerve to you, that there are ſome very weighty Points of Religion wherein you grieviouſly err in ſeparating from us, beſides others of leſs moment, and to offer them as ſo many Reaſons, why you ſhould return into the Boſom of the Church and come into our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and you will plainly ſee under each Head, how expreſsly they are founded on the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that you have left that holy Rule in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from us. Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. You have caſt off the Original Government which Chriſt, or at leaſt his Apoſtles under the Guidance of his holy Spirit, eſtabliſhed in his Church, in the Order of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and in the Room of it have ſet up what is next akin to none, as is evident from the ſad Effects of your Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the many Diſorders, Contentions and Confuſions which you miſerably ſee and feel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003672_0018_100241522670D200"/>
and daily increaſing among you: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, You pretend to retain the Orders of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> but as to <hi>Deacons,</hi> You know that your Miniſters refuſe to Ordain them <hi>by laying on of Hands,</hi> wherein they act directly contrary to Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. And as to your <hi>Elders,</hi> You know that what Ordination they, many of them, Originally had, were perform'd by the Brethren mere Laymen, who were allowed to Ordain in the pure Days of Your fore-Fathers, as appears by the <hi>Platform</hi> agreed upon at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the Year 1649. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. The like certainly was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before in the whole Chriſtian Church. But ſuppoſe Your Miniſters were Originally Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by Biſhops; Yet the Biſhops that Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them never gave them Power to Ordain others: So that any one Captain or Juſtice of the Peace, however lawfully commiſſioned, might as well take upon them to give Commiſſions to others and ſet up other Captains or Juſtices of the Peace as thoſe Miniſters, even upon this Suppoſition, could ſet up and commiſſionate others. But Your Error is aggravated in this, That You ſet up in Oppoſition to Biſhops, in Oppoſition to that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which was at firſt eſtabliſhed in the Church, and is thro' Gods Goodneſs eſtabliſhed in our own Nation and Mother Country, and this from a wrong Notion of a particular Church, as is plain from the holy Scriptures, which do not call a particular Congregation of Chriſtians a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church:</hi> For the Scripture Notion of a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003672_0019_1002415485728418"/>
particular Church comprehended all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in a City and Country adjacent, however ſo many Chriſtians or Congregations of Chriſtians were contained in it. Thus we read of the <hi>Church of Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Church of Epheſus,</hi> the <hi>Church of Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> That the Caſe was thus with the reſt, we may learn from what we read of the <hi>Church of Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20, 17. in which one Church you there ſee, there were a <hi>Numbers of Elders,</hi> and conſequently doubtleſs many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; for the Apoſtle dad laboured there three Years and an half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if we may judge of his Succeſs by other Places, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, 41. — 4, 4. — where 3000 were converted by one Sermon, 5000 by another, <hi>ſo mightily grew the Word and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, Acts</hi> 19, 20. there muſt have been many Congregations, as there were many Elders, in this one Church, and over theſe the Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward appointed <hi>Timothy,</hi> to exerciſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Juriſdiction, as appears by his Epiſtles to him, and the like of <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 5. And that this Government was to continue is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in that 30 Years after this, when there muſt be yet many more Congregations and Elders, there was ſtill but one Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and but <hi>one Angel,</hi> or but one Eccleſiaſtical Governour or <hi>Biſhop</hi> there, which was alſo the Caſe of the other ſix Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as appears from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. So that you plainly ſee, theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Churches were not ſuch as they call <hi>Churches</hi> here in <hi>New-England.</hi> Thus far the Scriptures
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003672_0020_100241560F5A5028"/>
ſpeak in this matter, and we are well aſſured we don't miſunderſtand them, becauſe we find plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Hiſtory of the Church that this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Church Government was eſtabliſhed in all the Churches, and continued down from the Days of the Apoſtles thro' all the Ages of the Church, to which our Biſhops have ſucceeded, and no other was ever tho't of for 1500 Years; ſo that your Way is but a late invention, that was never heard of till within thoſe 200 Years; for I challenge all your Inſtructors to ſhow one Church in the firſt and pureſt Ages of Chriſtianiy that was ever goverred after the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> or <hi>Congregational</hi> manner: So that in caſting off this Order of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, you ſeem to me to have rejected an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and might as well have caſt off any other of his Inſtructions that you do retain. Nay I am ready to make it appear, that there is at leaſt as much (if not more) Evidence for Biſhops as for Infant Baptiſm, or the firſt Day Sabbath, and that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are rather more excuſable ſome of them in rejecting the firſt Day Sabbath, and all in denying Baptiſm to Infants, than you in denying Submiſſion to Biſhops. But I will be more brief in giving an Account of the other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have againſt you. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Thing I have againſt you is, (what I have already had Occaſion to mention) that you do not follow the Apoſtles Rule, to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake.</hi> And <hi>obey them that have the Rule over you.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003672_0021_10024158E079C050"/>
2, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 17. This you are bound to do, becauſe God expreſsly commands it, and that <hi>not only for Wrath but alſo for Conſcience ſake, Rom.</hi> 13, 5. So that you cannot diſcharge a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to God, unleſs you be obedient to thoſe he has ſet over you. There is one Exception to this, and that is, <hi>in Caſe our Rulers command what is contrary to the Word of God:</hi> But you could never prove that the Church eſtabliſhed by King and Parliament commands any Thing <hi>contrary to the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For this Reaſon I cannot ſee how your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from us can be juſtified or excuſed, and it is clear to me, that you have broken the Peace of the Body of Chriſt, by needleſs Diviſions, and the Apoſtle requires us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, 17. to <hi>mark ſuch as cauſe Diviſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine we have learned, and avoid them.</hi> Indeed if we had impoſed on you any Doctrine or Practice <hi>contrary to the Word of God,</hi> I own we ſhould then be the Schiſmatics: But in as much as we require nothing of you that God has forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, I don't ſee how you can clear your ſelves from being guilty of Schiſme.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I think you are to be juſtly faulted that you do not read the Word of God in your public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: This was the Practice of Chriſt himſelf, who <hi>ſtood up to read in the Synagogue, Luke</hi> 4, 6. and the Apoſtles appeal to and approve of this Practice, <hi>Acts</hi> 13, 27. that <hi>the Writings of the Prophets were read every Sabbath Day:</hi> And
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003672_0022_1002415B42050760"/>
               <hi>Timothy</hi> was required 1 <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 13. <hi>to give Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to Reading</hi> as well as <hi>Exhortation and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</hi> So that I cannot conceive how you came to be ſo conceited of what you call your <hi>Gifts,</hi> as to juſtle out the Reading of Gods holy Word. If you ſay, you <hi>can read it at Home:</hi> I anſwer, <hi>you can alſo read Sermons and pray at Home,</hi> ſo this Plea equally concludes againſt all public Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You ſeem to me to break an expreſs Law of Chriſt, in that you do not uſe the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> in your Worſhip: For he commanded expreſsly, <hi>Luke,</hi> 11, 2. <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> By which it is plain, he requires that this Prayer be always uſed when we addreſs our ſelves to God, eſpecially in public. Not indeed that we ſhould uſe no other Prayer, but however, that this ſhould not be omitted: And I am ſure a better cannot be deviſed. And what could tempt you to throw it out of your public Worſhip, I cannot conceive, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were that you thought yours were <hi>better than Chriſt's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. You have laid aſide <hi>Publick Forms of Prayer,</hi> and in Room of them have ſet up the <hi>extempore Way,</hi> wherein you depend on the meer Invention of your Miniſter, and ſo you cannot be agreed beforehand what to offer up to God, becauſe you don't know what it will be; whereas our Saviour makes it a Condition of our being heard <hi>That we ſhould be agreed touching any Thing we would aſk, Mat.</hi> 18, 19. This we can't be in your Aſſembly,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003672_0023_1002415D9CB2B5D0"/>
unleſs (like the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) we put an implicit Faith in the Miniſter. Now we in the Church are free from this Difficulty; for our Service is taken, at leaſt two Thirds, if not three Quarters of it, Word for Word, out of the Scripture, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Scripture, and we all know what we are going to do, and ſo are prepared to offer up our Addreſs to God unanimouſly, with the <hi>Unity of the ſpirit, in the Bond of Peace, Eph.</hi> 4, 3. and <hi>to lift up holy Hands without Wrath or Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. And beſides your <hi>extempore Way</hi> is liable to many raſh and unbecoming Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and therefore directly contrary to the wiſe Man's Advice, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Be not raſh with thy Mouth, nor let thy Heart Haſten to utter any Thing before God, for God is in Heaven and thou upon Earth, therefore let thy Words be few.</hi> For theſe and the like Reaſons all the wiſe and holy Men of old, and all ancient Churches, both <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> have ever uſed <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> carefully compoſed. Thus <hi>David</hi> compoſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forms of Prayer and Praiſe, and his Pſalms were ever uſed in public Worſhip, by both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and expreſsly commanded by St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 5, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3, 16. and <hi>Solomon</hi> uſed a Form in the Dedication of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8, 22. <hi>Hezekiah, Iſai.</hi> 37, 15. and 38, 9. and <hi>Daniel,</hi> 9, 4. uſed Forms. And our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Poſed a Form, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. and uſed a From, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.44. and ſo did the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4, 24. Strange it is you ſhould be againſt Forms, when
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003672_0024_1002415F4DCCCE70"/>
you have ſo many Scripture Rules and Examples for it! Your only Pretence is, <hi>That you pray with the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 5. which you vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend is praying <hi>Extempore,</hi> as tho' the Spirit dictated the very Words and Phraſes, or at leaſt the Matter of your Prayers. But if this be the Meaning of it, you muſt by the ſame Rule <hi>ſing Extempore</hi> alſo, and it will be as much ſtinting the Spirit to ſing the Pſalms, which are Forms, as to uſe Forms in Prayer: And indeed if your Prayers were thus inſpired as you pretend, I don't ſee why they ſhould not be <hi>equal to canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture:</hi> But I believe if you could ſee many of them written out Word for Word after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, you would be aſhamed to pretend they were inſpired.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another Thing wherein you appear to me to vary from the ancient Examples and Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in holy Scriptures, is, <hi>That the People do not bear a Part in your publick Worſhip.</hi> Indeed this is what many of you are prejudiced againſt, becauſe you think it is <hi>Confuſion:</hi> But let me aſſure you, that this is meerly becauſe you are not accuſtomed to ſuch a Method, which if you were, Experience would ſoon convince you, as it does us, that it would be ſo far from being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that it would appear the moſt awakening, enlivening and every way the moſt edifying Way: But I ſhould hope that it would take off this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, if you would conſider that it was the ancient Scripture-Method of Worſhip. Thus the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003672_0025_100241621B8CC3D0"/>
Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, <hi>lift up their Voice with one Accord, Acts</hi> 4, 24. all joyning in one Form. And the Apoſtle requires, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 6. That <hi>we ſhould with one Mind and one Mouth glorify our Heavenly Father.</hi> And the Church in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19, 6. are repreſented as all praiſing God together, ſo that <hi>their Voice was like the Noiſe of many Waters,</hi> which implies not their Singing but Speaking together: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires not only that we ſhould <hi>ſing Pſalms,</hi> but alſo <hi>that we ſpeak to one another in Pſalms and Hymns and ſpiritual Songs, Eph.</hi> 5, 19.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I think I have juſt Reaſon to except againſt you in <hi>that you do not kneel in your Prayers and other Services,</hi> which is directly contrary to what is required, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 95, 6. <hi>Let us kneel befere the Lord our Maker.</hi> And to the Example of the Apoſtle, who <hi>kneeled down and prayed with them all. Acts</hi> 20, 36. You pretend <hi>That bodily Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe profiteth little, and that we ſhould worſhip God in Spirit and Truth,</hi> which, it is true, is of the greateſt Importance; but thence to depretiate or exclude bodily Worſhip is directly contrary to the Apoſtle, who tells us, that ſince <hi>we are</hi> [in Body as well as Spirit] <hi>bought with a Price,</hi> we ſhould therefore <hi>glorify God with our Bodies,</hi> as well as <hi>our Spirits, which are his,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 20. You except againſt our <hi>bowing at the Name of JESUS,</hi> which it is ſtrange you ſhould do, when it is expreſsly ſaid, <hi>at the Name of Jeſus let every Knee bow, Phil.</hi> 2, 10. which, if it is not
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003672_0026_1002416549B949D0"/>
to be underſtood as an expreſs Command of what we practice, is, I think at leaſt, ſufficient to juſtify the lawfulneſs of it, and none me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks but an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinan</hi> could find Fault with it. You alſo except againſt <hi>Kneeling at the Sacrament:</hi> But, pray, why ſhould you? when this is the moſt ſolmn Act of Worſhip that we can perform; and I have before ſhewn that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the proper and Scripture Poſture of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. You reply, <hi>Our Savour and his Apoſtles did not kneel.</hi> I anſwer, it does not certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what Poſture they uſed; but beſure it was not ſitting, for the Table geſture then was <hi>lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> if therefore you are bound by his Example preciſely, you muſt lean on one another. But, ſuppoſing the Table-Poſture was then admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is not the Caſe now much altered from what it was then? Does it follow, becauſe he admitted his Apoſtles to ſit with him then, when he appeared in the <hi>Form of a Servant,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould not now uſe the Poſture of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on that Occaſion, ſince <hi>All Power in Heaven and Earth is given unto him, Mat.</hi> 28, 18. And he is made <hi>the Lord of Angels,</hi> who are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to worſhip him, Heb.</hi> 1, 6. How ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly indecent is it to receive this Seal of our Pardon ſitting? And is it not much more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to perform this moſt ſolemn Act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the antient adoring Poſture?</p>
            <p n="9">9. I can't but think it a wrong Thing, that the Laity among you are not only forbid bearing a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003672_0027_10024166D34A1470"/>
vocal Part in your Service, but are not allowed even ſo much as to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> audibly in your Worſhip, at the End of the Prayers and other Services: Whereas God requireth this, and it was the Practice of the Church of Old, both <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as will evidently appear to you if you will look into <hi>Deut.</hi> 27, 15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 106, 48. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16, 36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5, 4.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I will add laſtly, as to doctrinal Points, that you ſeem to me guilty of a very great Error, in teaching your Children, <q>
                  <hi>That God has fore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained whatſoever comes to paſs.</hi>
               </q> For ſeeing Sin has come to paſs, it is plain, that you do herein teach them, <hi>That God has ordained,</hi> that is, <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sin,</hi> and conſequently <hi>approves it;</hi> which yet we are ſure he abhors, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1, 13. and therefore could not decree it: And you teach alſo, <hi>That God has abſolutely decreed the eternal Death and Deſtruction of the greateſt Part of Mankind;</hi> for this I take to be the true Senſe of your Confeſſion of Faith. Whereas he hath declared with an Oath <hi>That he hath no Pleaſure in the Death of a Sinner, Ezek.</hi> 33, 11. and therefore he could not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely decree it, for he can't but have Pleaſure in his own Decrees.</p>
            <p>MANY Things might be offered further un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each Head, but I will add no more at preſent. Theſe I hope will be ſufficient, if duly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both to make you ſenſible how much Reaſon we have, not for want of Charity, but purely in point of Conſcience, to ſcruple the lawfulneſs of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003672_0028_1002416931780830"/>
your Communion, and that it is your Duty to lay aſide your Prejudices, and come over to ours. At leaſt I hope you will be convinced how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious your Teachers are, in repreſenting the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church as <hi>grievous Wolves, and falſe Brethren,</hi> as they lately did deliberatly being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in Council. They could not, ſure, in this, be governed by the Spirit of the Goſpel, which is all Truth, Charity, Meekneſs and Moderation: This is the Spirit of Chriſt, with which ſuch a cenſorious, malevolent and uncharitable Spirit is certainly inconſiſtent, which therefore I hope you will lay aſide, conſidering, that <hi>they which have not the Spirit of Chriſt, are none of his, Rom.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
            <p>TO conclude therefore, let me beſeech you in the Spirit of Meekneſs, to give theſe Things an unbyaſſed, candid and ſerious Conſideration; and let nothing but a pure diſintereſted Love of Truth and Right influence you in examining the Weight and Imporance of them: For if you receive not <hi>the Love of the Truth,</hi> and do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after it, and embrace it, purely for its own ſake, but are governed only by Vogue, Cuſtom, Faſhion and worldly Conſiderations, and for the ſake of them <hi>hold faſt deceit, and refuſe to let it go,</hi> or (which in Effect is the ſame Thing) if you lazily or negligently ſit down, in a careleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs about it, you may provoke <hi>God to ſend you ſtrong Deluſions,</hi> and leave you under
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003672_0029_1002416AC05AE1A0"/>
the Power of them, to run on into enleſs Mazes of Contention and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>BE not therefore afraid or any Account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to acquaint your ſelves with the Church, and examine the Matter fairly on both Sides. This can do you no harm, and may do you a great Deal of Good: For if upon a fair and impartial Examination on both ſides you find, that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the beſt of your Judgment, the Truth is on the <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Side, you will then be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and at leaſt you would learn to be <hi>Charitable Diſſenters,</hi> and conſequently be the more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in continuing as you are: But if you ſhould find (as I doubt not but you will; for the Church is not afraid, nay is glad, to ſtand the Teſt of a ſerious, honeſt and impartial Examination; I ſay, if you ſhould find) That the Truth is on the Side of the Church, you will not repent of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry: For I conclude, certainly, if you are Perſons of Honeſty and Seriouſneſs, you would rather be on the ſide of the Church, then not be on the Side of Truth: For to be deceived or in an Error, in any Caſe, is to be in a wretched and unnatural Condition. And if you would thus uprightly enquire, and be thus impartially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, you would then Act the Part of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures, and perform an <hi>acceptable</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>a reaſonable Service,</hi> and be able <hi>to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every one a Reaſon of the Hope that is in you,</hi> and which is yet of infinitely greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, you would then be able at laſt to give
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003672_0030_1002416C752D9A08"/>
the better Account of your ſelves to God. And certainly, if, having an Opporunity to enquire and inform your ſelves, to examine and judge for your ſelves, you neglect it' and will not put your ſelves into the Way of being impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed, but ſhut your Eyes againſt the Light, you can't but have much to anſwer for, and which I don't ſee how you can give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of; wherereas, if you would thus honeſtly and ſeriouſly inquire after the Truth, with a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and conſcientious Endeavour to find it, that you may be practically govern'd by it, you would not fail, by God's Bleſſing, to find it, and be led by it in the Way of <hi>Peace and Holineſs, through Faith, unto Salvation,</hi> which is the earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſhall be the hearty endeavour of</p>
