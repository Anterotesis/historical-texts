            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>AT a time when the thirſt for knowledge is ſo univerſal, that it is ſought after by all ranks of people; through its moſt intricate windings, and mazy labyrinths, it is not to be wondered at, that books of ſcience and polite literature are publiſhed in ſuch abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that they meet with that reception and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, from a liberal minded public, which their noble deſign requires, and which their intrinſic merit demands.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this publication, is not merely to amuſe; but rather, in an engaging, diverſified and pleaſing manner, to attract the attention—imperceptibly gain the affections—and draw the ſoul to a love of virtue, (by delineating her in her moſt attractive and alluring dreſs) from whence ariſes the ſpring of all great, noble and generous actions:—To inculcate a ſincere deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every ſpecies of vice, by an expoſition of the malevolent affections of the mind, as well in their ſofter, as in their more glaring, or aggravated colours.</p>
            <p>The above, though not the leaſt, is not the chief inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſelection.—The art of thinking juſtly, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pertinently and writing with correctneſs, eaſe, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and preciſion upon any ſubject, has ever been eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed the firſt ornament of the human mind, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted the grand characteriſtical mark, by which the rational being is diſtinguiſhed from the irrational.—
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030567_0004_0FE7D4C133154D10"/>
Yet, how few do we find thus accompliſhed, or how very few give themſelves any trouble to hold their rank in the great ſcale of animal creation? To render the above in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable accompliſhment eaſy of acquirement, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal deſign of <hi>THE HIVE,</hi> wherein all the vices, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, relative duties and affections of the human ſoul are delineated by the maſterly hands of many of the firſt writers in the Engliſh language, who are as much eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed for their correctneſs, eaſe, elegance and beauty of diction, as for their conciſeneſs, perſpicuity, juſtneſs and dignity of thought.</p>
            <p>The editor of this miſcellaneous volume, deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the importance of the above conſideration, without any parade of unmeaning ceremony, humbly recommends <hi>THE HIVE</hi> to the ſupport and attention of the candid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <head>AFFLICTIONS. THE PRESENT MISFORTUNE IS ALWAYS DEEMED THE GREATEST: THEREFORE, SMALL CAUSES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE US UNEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SY, WHEN GREAT ONES ARE NOT IN THE WAY.</head>
               <p>WE ought to make a good improvement of paſt and preſent afflictions. If they are not ſanctified to us, they become a double croſs; but if they work rightly in us, and, convince us of our failings, and how juſtly we are afflicted, they do us much good. Affliction is a ſpiritual phyſic for the ſoul, and is compared to a furnace; for as gold is tried and purified therein, ſo men are prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and either purified from their droſs, and fitted for good uſes, or elſe entirely burnt up and undone forever. Therefore may all
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030567_0006_0FE7D4C2C029ABF8"/>
who labour under any kind of affliction, have reaſon to ſay with JOB—"when he hath tried me, I ſhall come forth as pure gold."</p>
               <p>LET a man live (ſays Mr. Steele) but two or three years without affliction, and he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt good for nothing, he cannot pray, nor meditate, nor keep his heart fixed upon ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual things; but let God ſmite him in his child, health, or eſtate; now he can find his tongue and affections again, now he awakes and falls to his duty in earneſt; now God has twice as much honour for him as he had before. Now, ſaith God, this amendment pleaſeth me, this rod was well beſtowed, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed him in his great benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>IT may be boldly affirmed, that good men generally reap more ſubſtantial benefit from their afflictions, than bad men do from their proſperities; and what they loſe in wealth, pleaſure, or honor, they gain with vaſt advantage in wiſdom, goodneſs and tranquillity of mind.</p>
               <p>PROSPERITY is not without its troubles, nor adverſity without its comforts. A mind that can bear affliction without murmur, and the weight of a plentiful fortune without vain glory—that can be familiar without mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and reſerved without pride, has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it great, particularly pleaſing, and truly admirable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030567_0007_0FE7D46B19371018"/>NOTHING would be more unhappy, (ſaid Demetrius) than a man who had never known affliction. The beſt need afflictions for the trial of their virtue: How can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the grace of contentment, if all things ſucceed well? or, that of forgiveneſs if we have no enemies?</p>
               <p>HE who barely weeps at misfortunes, when it is in his power to heal them, is not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them to the heart, and only ſheds the tears of a crocodile.</p>
               <p>IF you are diſquieted at any thing, you ſhould conſider with yourſelf, Is this thing of that worth, that for it I ſhould ſo diſturb myſelf, and loſe my peace and tranquillity?</p>
               <p>THE conſideration of a greater evil, is a ſort of remedy againſt a leſſer. THEY are always impaired by affliction, who are not improved by it. A virtuous man is more peaceable in adverſity, than a wicked man in proſperity.</p>
               <p>THE keeping of ourſelves above grief, and every painful paſſion, is indeed very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and excellent; and none but ſouls of the firſt rate ſeem to be qualified for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
               <p>IT were no virtue to bear calamities, if we did not feel them.</p>
               <p>DIVINE PROVIDENCE always places the remedy near the evil; there is not any duty to which Providence has not annexed a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030567_0008_0FE7D4C87A7F72D8"/>
nor any affliction for which virtue has not provided a remedy.</p>
               <p>IF ſome are refined like gold in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of affliction, there are many more, that, like chaff, are conſumed in it.</p>
               <p>SORROW, when it is exceſſive, takes away fervour from piety, vigour from action, health from the body, light from the reaſon, and repoſe from the conſcience. Reſignation to the divine will is a noble and needful leſſon.</p>
               <p>YET there is a gloomy pleaſure in being dejected and inconſolable. Melancholy ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies how to improve itſelf, and ſorrow finds wonderful relief in being more ſorrowful.</p>
               <p>TO be afflicted with the afflicted, is an inſtance of humanity, and the demand of good nature and good breeding: Pity is but an imaginary aid; and yet, were it not for that, ſorrow would be many times utterly inſupportable.</p>
               <p>MIRTH is by no means a remedy for grief; on the contrary, it raiſes and inflames it. The only probable way I know of, to ſoften or cure grief in others, is by putting on an appearance of feeling it yourſelf; and you muſt, beſides, talk frequently and feelingly on the occaſion, and praiſe and blame as the ſufferer does; but then remember to make uſe of the opportunity this condeſcenſion and familiarity gives you, of leading him, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, into things and paſſages remote from his preſent bent of mind, and not unpleaſing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030567_0009_0FE7D46FB10F5B50"/>
in themſelves. In this manner, and by this policy, you will be able to ſteal him away from his afflictions with his own approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and teach him to think and ſpeak of other things than that alone, which frets — or rather WRINGS his heart.</p>
               <p>NONE ſhould deſpair, becauſe God can help them, and none ſhould preſume, becauſe God can croſs them. A firm truſt in the aſſiſtance of an Almighty Being naturally produces patience, hope, chearfulneſs and all other diſpoſitions of mind, that alleviate thoſe calamities which we are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move.</p>
               <p>HE, who is puffed up with the firſt gale of proſperity, will bend beneath the firſt blaſt of adverſity.</p>
               <p>REPROOF in adverſity hath a double ſting.</p>
               <p>THERE is but one way of fortifying the ſoul againſt all gloomy preſages and terrors of the mind; and that is, by ſecuring to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the friendſhip and protection of that Being who diſpoſes of events, and governs futurity.</p>
               <p>EVENTS which have the appearance of misfortunes, often prove a happy ſource of future felicity; this conſideration ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to ſupport affliction with calmneſs and fortitude.</p>

               <head>ANGER.</head>
               <p>AN angry man who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his paſſions, thinks worſe than he ſpeaks, and an angry man that will chide, ſpeaks worſe than he thinks. A vindictive temper is not only uneaſy to others, but to them that have it.</p>
               <p>ANGER may glance into the boſom of a wiſe man, but reſts only in the boſom of fools.</p>
               <p>IN all things miſtakes are excuſable; but an error that proceeds from any good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple leaves no room for reſentment.</p>
               <p>IT was a good method obſerved by Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, when he found in himſelf any diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to anger, he would check it by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low, in oppoſition to the motions of his diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>IT is much better to reprove ingenuouſly, than to be angry ſecretly.</p>
               <p>HE that waits for an opportunity of acting his revenge, watches to do himſelf a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p>BY taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy, but by paſſing it over, he is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</p>
               <p>IT is the only valour to remit a wrong, and the greateſt applauſe that I might hurt and would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030567_0011_0FE7D472696AD820"/>TO be able to bear provocation, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of great wiſdom; and to forgive it, of a great mind.</p>
               <p>THEY who will be angry for any thing, will be angry for nothing.</p>

               <p>REASON, in anger, is like a ſhip in the tempeſt, hurried away by the waves, and often overſet.</p>

               <head>BEAUTY.</head>
               <p>THERE is nothing that gives us ſo pleaſing a proſpect of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the contemplation of wiſdom and beauty. Beauty is an overweaning, ſelfsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient thing, careleſs of providing itſelf any more ſubſtantial ornament; nay, ſo little does it conſult its own intereſt, that it too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten defeats itſelf by betraying that innocence which renders it lovely and deſirable. As therefore virtue makes a beautiful woman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more beautiful, ſo beauty makes a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman really more virtuous.</p>
               <p>IT is, methinks, a low and degrading idea of that ſex, which was created to refine the joys, and ſoften the cares of human nature, by the moſt agreeable participation, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them merely as objects of ſight. This
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030567_0016_0FE7D4D719FC1980"/>
is abridging them of their natural extent of power, to put them upon a level with their pictures. How much nobler is the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of beauty heightened by virtue, and commanding our eſteem and love, while it draws our obſervation? How faint and ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itleſs are the charms of the coquet, when compared with the real lovelineſs of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, piety, good humour, the irreſiſtable charms of modeſty unaffected, humanity, with all thoſe rare and pleaſing marks of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; virtues, which add a new ſoftneſs to her ſex; and even beautify her beauty.</p>
               <p>NOTHING (ſays Mr. Addiſon) can atone for the want of modeſty and innocence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, beauty is ungraceful and quality contemptible.</p>
               <p>LET a woman be decked with all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments of art and care of nature; yet if boldneſs be to be read in her face, it blots all the lines of beauty.</p>
               <p>THE plainer the dreſs, with greater luſtre does beauty appear: Virtue is the greateſt ornament, and good ſenſe the beſt equipage.</p>
               <p>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour and complacency of temper in a woman, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the decays of it inviſible.</p>
               <p>IT is but too ſeldom ſeen, that beautiful perſons are otherwiſe of great virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030567_0017_0FE7D47F75101B40"/>NO beauty hath any charms equal to the inward beauty of the mind. A gracefulneſs in the manners is much more engaging than that of the perſon; the former every one has the power to attain to in ſome meaſure, the latter is in no one's power—is no internal worth, and was the gift of God, who formed us all. Meekneſs and modeſty are the true and laſting ornaments.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Virtue's the chiefeſt beauty of the mind,</l>
                  <l>The nobleſt ornament of human kind.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>BEAUTY inſpires a pleaſing ſentiment, which prepoſſeſſes people in its favour. Mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty has great advantages, it ſets off beauty, and ſerves as a veil to uglineſs. The misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of uglineſs is, that it ſometimes ſmothers and buries much merit; people do not look for the engaging qualities of the head and heart in a forbidding figure. 'Tis no eaſy matter when merit muſt make its way, and ſhine through a diſagreeable outſide.</p>
               <p>WITHOUT virtue, good ſenſe and ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, the fineſt ſet of features will, ere long ceaſe to pleaſe; but, where theſe with the graces are united, it muſt afford an agreeable and pleaſing contemplation.</p>
               <p>THE liberality of nature in the perſon, is but too frequently attended with a deficiency in the underſtanding.</p>
               <lg>

                  <l>The charms of beauty, are the charms of ſenſe.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>BEAUTY without the graces of the mind, will have no power over the hearts of the wiſe and good. Beauty is a flower which ſoon withers; health changes, and ſtrength abates, but innocency is immortal, and a comfort both in life and death.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let us ſuppoſe the virtuous mind a roſe,</l>
                  <l>Which nature plants and education blows.</l>

                  <l>For mental beauties will ſurvive the tomb.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>THERE are emanations from the mind, which, like a ray of celeſtial fire, animate the form of beauty; without theſe, the moſt perfect ſymmetry is but a moulded clod; and whenever they appear, the moſt indifferent features acquire a ſpirit of ſenſibility, and an engaging charm, which thoſe only do not admire, who want faculties to diſcover. —Thoſe ſtrokes of ſenſibility, thoſe touches of innocence and dignity, &amp;c. diſplay charms too refined for the diſcernment of vulgar eyes, that are captivated by a glance of beauty, aſſiſted by vivid colour and gaudy decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>AS benevolence is the moſt ſocial of all virtues, ſo it is of the largeſt extent; for there is not any man, either ſo great or ſo little, but he is yet capable of receiving ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efits.</p>
               <p>THE greateſt benefits of all, have no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but lie concealed in the conſcience.</p>
               <p>A KIND benefactor makes a man happy as ſoon as he can, and as much as he can. There ſhould be no delay in a benefit, but the modeſty of the receiver. If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not foreſee the requeſt, let us however im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately grant it. It is ſo grievous a thing to ſay, I beg!—The very word puts a man out of countenance, and it is a double kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do the thing, and ſave an honeſt heart the confuſion of a bluſh.</p>
               <p>LET no one be weary of rendering good offices, for by obliging others, (if our hearts
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030567_0020_0FE7D4DE5CD0E460"/>
and affections are as they ſhould be) we are really kind to ourſelves. No man was ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a loſer by good works; for though he may not be immediately rewarded, yet, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, ſome happy emergency or oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er occurs to convince him, that virtuous men are the darlings of Providence.</p>
               <p>HE that receives a benefit without being thankful, robs the giver of his juſt reward. It muſt be a due reciprocation in virtue that can make the obliger and the obliged worthy.</p>
               <p>HE who receives a good turn, ſhould nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er forget it; he who does one ſhould never remember it.</p>
               <p>IT is the character of an unworthy nature, to write injuries in marble, and benefits in duſt.</p>
               <p>THE following fact, I think, ſtrongly delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eates the image of a noble and generous mind, and may juſtly be ranked among the beauties of STERNE—ſo deſervedly famed for his humanity, ſenſibility and generoſity. A friend of this benevolent DIVINE, being diſtreſſed in finances, and whom Sterne wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to relieve, (for Sterne could not be happy while a FRIEND was in diſtreſs) but it was not in his power at that time!—Yet,—the FRIEND! a friend muſt be relieved at all haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards!—"A friend is ſacred!"—Sterne finds no reſt till it is done.—"I was" (ſays he) "obliged to borrow two hundred pounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my own currency, upon the occaſion.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030567_0021_0FE7D486B8F7E490"/>
I had no ſufficient ſecurity to proffer; but Captain Le Fevre happened luckily juſt then, to have ſold out of the army—<hi>I mortgaged the ſtory to him,</hi> and he lent me the money." The friend and Sterne, were each relieved— Sterne was the happieſt of the two.</p>
               <p>LET us be careful that we permit no arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial deſires to prevent us of the power, in which we ſhall ever find real pleaſure—that of relieving diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>THAT which is given with pride and oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, is rather an ambition than a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let a benefit be ever ſo conſiderable, the manner of conferring it is yet the nobleſt part.</p>
               <p>IT is a good rule for every one who has a competency of fortune, to lay aſide a certain proportion of his income for pious and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable uſes; he will then always give eaſily and chearfully.</p>
               <p>IT was well ſaid of him that called a good office that was done harſhly, "a ſtony piece of bread:" It is neceſſary for him that is hungry to receive it, but it almoſt chokes him in the going down.</p>
               <p>ALPHONSO, king of Scicily, being aſked, What he would reſerve for himſelf, who gave ſo much away? Even thoſe things, ſaid he, that I do give, for the reſt I eſteem as nothing.</p>
               <p>IT is a much greater kindneſs not to ſuffer us to fall, than to lend a hand to help us up,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030567_0022_0FE7D4DFE881F308"/>
and a greater ſatisfaction to be kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and obtain nothing, than obtain what we deſire, after having been expoſed.</p>
               <p>REQUESTS coſt a reluctancy in nature, fearing to receive the diſcourteſy of a denial. That which is beſtowed too late, is next to not giving.</p>
               <p>MONARCHS are more unhappy than their ſubjects.—For uſe makes ſtate familiar, and the fatigue grows every day more irkſome.— Has opulence and grandeur then no advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages? NONE—but the power of doing good. I have often been ſurpriſed that ſo little of this kind of manufacture is ever wrought by princes, when the very rarity of the work might ſerve to render their names famous to poſterity. "And paid a tradeſman once to make him ſtare." But away with all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which only affects our names, without improving our natures.</p>
               <p>LIBERALITY is never ſo beautiful or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, as when the hand is concealed that beſtows the gift.</p>
               <p>A NOBLE Lord, who once ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to loſe a thouſand pounds to a man of modeſt merit, whom he knew to be greatly neceſſitated, and to whom he durſt not offer it as a gift, ſurely did a very laudable action, and in which modeſty had no ſmall ſhare.</p>

               <p>THERE is no end of books. Many libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are furniſhed for ſight and oſtentation, rather than uſe; the very indexes not to be read over in an age: And in this multitude, how great a part of them are either danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or not worth reading! A few books well choſen, and well made uſe of, will be more profitable than a great confuſed Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an library.</p>
               <p>SUCH books as teach ſapience and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſerve to eradicate errors and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are the moſt profitable writings in the world, and ought to be valued and ſtudied more than all others whatſoever.</p>
               <p>IN vain do we look for true and laſting ſatisfaction in any other books than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures, wherein are contained all that is neceſſary to the happineſs of this life, and the life hereafter.</p>

               <p>NEXT to the ſtudy of the Holy Scriptures, it may not be amiſs to recommend the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a little poetry, properly choſen. The faculty in which WOMEN moſt excel (ſays the admirable—the judicious Mrs. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone) is that of imagination—and when prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly cultivated, it becomes the ſource of all that is charming in ſociety.—Nothing you can read will ſo much contribute to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this faculty, as <hi>poetry</hi>—which, if applied to its true ends, adds a thouſand charms to thoſe ſentiments of religion, virtue, generoſity and delicate tenderneſs, by which the human ſoul is exalted and refined.</p>

Never more life in the conſcience than when death makes its neareſt approach to the body. When it ſmiles, cheers, acquits and comforts, O what a heaven doth it create within; and when it frowns, condemns and terrifies, how are our pleaſures, joys and delights of this world clouded, and even benighted! it is certainly the beſt of friends, or the worſt of enemies in the whole creation.</p>

               <p>IT is highly requiſite to avoid too much familiarity in converſation. It is an old Engliſh adage, <hi>"too much famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity breeds contempt,"</hi> ſo he that familiarizes himſelf, preſently loſes his ſuperiority, that his ſerious air, and good deportment gave him, and conſequently his credit. The more common human things are, the leſs they are eſteemed; for communication diſcovers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections that a prudent reſerve concealed. We muſt not be too familiar with ſuperiors, becauſe of danger; nor with inferiors by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of indecency; and far leſs with mean people, whom ignorance renders inſolent; for, being inſenſible of the HONOURS done them, they preſume it is their due.</p>
               <p>IN your diſcourſe be cautious what you ſpeak, and to whom you ſpeak; how you ſpeak, and when you ſpeak; and what you ſpeak, ſpeak wiſely, ſpeak truly. A fool's heart is in his tongue, but a wiſe man's tongue is in his heart.</p>
               <p>PLUTARCH adviſes to moderate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all baſe, unworthy and hurtful paſſions, that in all our converſations we may be open hearted and ſincere, and not ſeek to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030567_0048_0FE7D50BC0C14878"/>
or deceive others in any of our deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>LET all your converſation with men be ſober and ſincere; your devotion to God dutiful and decent; let the one be hearty and not haughty, let the other be humble, but not homely. So live with men as if God ſaw you, ſo pray to God as if men heard you.</p>
               <p>NOTHING more engages the affections of men, than a handſome addreſs and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful converſation.</p>

               <p>TALKATIVENESS is uſually called a femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine vice, but it is poſſible to go into maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line company, where it will be as hard to wedge in a word as at a female goſſiping.</p>
               <p>CONTROVERSIES, for the moſt part, leave truth in the middle, and are factious at both ends.</p>
               <p>VILE and debauched expreſſions are the ſure marks of an abject and grovelling mind, and the filthy overflowing of a vicious heart.</p>
               <p>SPEAK always according to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but let it be done in terms of good nature, civility and good manners.</p>
               <p>IT is a ſure method of obliging in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to ſhew a pleaſure in giving atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>MUCH tongue and much judgment ſeldom go together; for talking and thinking are two quite different faculties, and there is commonly more depth where there is leſs noiſe.</p>
               <p>BUFFOONERY and ſcurrility are the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of wit, as knavery is of wiſdom. Some are ſo black in the mouth, as to utter ſcarce any thing that is decent; ſupplying want of ſenſe with want of modeſty, and want of reputation with want of ſhame.</p>
               <p>IT is a fair ſtep towards happineſs and virtue, to delight in the converſation of good and wiſe men; and where that cannot be had, the next point is, to keep no company at all.</p>
               <p>DISCRETION of ſpeech is more than elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and to ſpeak agreeably, is more than to ſpeak in exact order.</p>

               <p>IN diſputes men ſhould give ſoft words, and hard arguments, they ſhould not ſo much ſtrive to vex, as to convince an enemy.</p>
               <p>WHEREVER the ſpeech is corrupted, ſo is the mind.</p>
               <p>IN heat of argument, men are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as though they were tied back to back, cloſe joined, and yet they cannot ſee each other.</p>
               <p>FAMILIAR converſation ought to be the ſchool of learning and good breeding. A man ought to make his maſters of his friends, ſeaſoning the pleaſure of converſe, with the profit of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>PLEASURE given in ſociety, like money lent to uſury, returns with intereſt to thoſe who diſperſe it.</p>
               <p>MODESTY ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from an aukward baſhfulneſs, and ſilence ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be enjoined when it would be froward and impertinent to talk; if you ſpeak without conceit or affectation, you will always be more pleaſing than thoſe who ſit like ſtatues without ſenſe or motion. When you are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, your looks ſhould ſhew your attention and preſence to the company. You muſt
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030567_0051_0FE7D57265946838"/>
appear to be intereſted in what is ſaid, and endeavour to improve yourſelf by it.</p>
               <p>CONVERSATION may be divided into two claſſes—the familiar and the ſentimental.</p>
               <p>IT is the province of the familiar, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe cheerfulneſs and eaſe—to open the heart of man to man, and to beam a temperate ſunſhine upon the mind.</p>
               <p>NATURE and art muſt conſpire to render us ſuſceptible of the charms, and to qualify us for the practice of the ſecond claſs of converſation here termed ſentimental.</p>
               <p>TO good ſenſe, lively feeling and natural delicacy of taſte, muſt be united an expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mind, and a refinement of thought, which is the reſult of high cultivation. To render this ſort of converſation irreſiſtably attractive, a knowledge of the world is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and that enchanting eaſe, that elegance of manner, which is to be acquired only by frequenting the higher circles of poliſhed life. In ſentimental converſation, ſubjects intereſting to the heart and to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are brought forward; they are diſcuſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a kind of ſportive way, with animation and refinement, and are never continued longer than politeneſs allows: Here fancy flouriſhes—the ſenſibilities expand—and wit guided by delicacy and embelliſhed by taſte—points to the heart.</p>

               <p>ALL true courage is deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from virtue, and honour from integrity.</p>
               <p>IF you deſire to be magnanimous, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing raſhly, and fear nothing you undertake; fear nothing but infamy, dare any thing but injury. The meaſure of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity is to be neither raſh nor timorous; for magnanimity or true courage, which is an eſſential character in a ſoldier, is not a ſavage ferocious violence—not a fool hardy inſenſibility of danger, or headſtrong raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to run into it; not the fury of inflamed paſſions, broke looſe from the government of reaſon—but a calm, deliberate, rational courage, a ſteady, judicious, thoughtful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; the courage of a man, and not that of a tyger.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let us appear, nor raſh, nor indifferent,</l>
                  <l>Immoderate valour ſwells into a fault;</l>

certainly belongs to human nature in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral.

               <head>CHARITY.</head>
               <p>CHARITY makes the beſt conſtruction of things and perſons, excuſes weakneſs, extenuates miſcarriages, makes the beſt of every thing, forgives every one, and ſerves all.</p>
               <p>IN order to our final doom and ſentence, we need but this one enquiry, whether we were charitable or uncharitable? For they who are poſſeſſed with a true divine charity, have all chriſtian graces. They who have
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030567_0056_0FE7D51A54319228"/>
not this divine principle have no good in them, and that is enough to condemn them, without enquiring what evil they have done.</p>
               <p>WHEN a compaſſionate man falls, who would not pity him: Who that had power to do it, would not befriend and raiſe him up? Or could the moſt barbarous temper offer an inſult to his diſtreſs, without pain and reluctance? True charity is always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to find excuſes;—in generous ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, compaſſion is ſometimes an over balance for ſelf preſervation: God certainly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wove that friendly ſoftneſs in our nature, to be a check upon too great a propenſity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſelf love.</p>
               <p>UNDER the goſpel, God is pleaſed with a living ſacrifice; but the offerings of the dead, ſuch as teſtamentary charities are, which are intended to have no effect ſo long as we live, are no better than dead ſacrifices; and it may be queſtioned, whether they will be brought into the account of our lives, if we do no good while we are living. Theſe death bed charities, are too like a death bed repentance; men ſeem to give their eſtates to God and the poor, juſt as they part with their ſins—when they can keep them no longer.</p>
               <p>CHARITY obliges us not to diſtruſt a man, prudence not to truſt a man before we know him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:030567_0057_0FE7D57F9C2C2C68"/>THE firſt duty of man next to that of worſhipping the Deity, is, miniſtering to the neceſſities of his fellow creatures.</p>
               <p>ARE we not all citizens of the world? Are we not all fellow ſubjects of the univerſal monarch? Is not the univerſe our home? And is not every man a brother? Poor and illiberal is that charity which is confined to any particular nation or ſociety.—Should we not <hi>feel for the ſtranger, and him that hath no helper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE who is charitable from motives of oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, will never relieve diſtreſs in ſecret.</p>

               <p>PREPARE to part with life unwillingly; ſtudy more how to die than to live; if you would live till you were old, live as if you were to die when you are young. In ſome caſes it requires more courage to live than to die. He that is not prepared for death, ſhall be perpetually troubled, as well with vain apprehenſions,

as with real dangers; but the important point is, to ſecure a well grounded hope of a bleſſed immortality. When the good Muſculus drew near his death, how ſweet and pleaſant was this meditation of his ſoul.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Cold death my heart invades, my life doth fly,</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>Why quiv'reſt thou my ſoul, within my breaſt?</l>
                  <l>Thine angel's come, to lead thee to thy reſt;</l>

                  <l>God will reſtore it in th' appointed day.</l>
                  <l>Haſt ſin'd? I know it, let not that be urg'd,</l>
                  <l>For Chriſt thy ſins with his own blood hath purg'd</l>
                  <l>Is death affrighting? True, but yet withal,</l>
                  <l>Conſider Chriſt thro' death to life doth call.</l>
                  <l>He triumph'd over Satan, ſin and death,</l>
                  <l>Therefore with joy reſign thy dying breath.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>DESTINY has decreed all men to die; but to die well is the particular privilege of the virtuous and good.</p>
               <p>AS there is no covenant to be made with death, ſo, no agreement for the arreſt and ſtay of time: It keeps its pace, whether we redeem and uſe it well or not.</p>
               <p>HE that has given God his worſhip, and man his due, is entertained with comfortable preſages, wears off ſmoothly and expires in pleaſure.</p>
               <p>DEATH is no more than turning us over from time to eternity. It leads to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030567_0059_0FE7D58121EA5F80"/>
and that is recompenſe enough for ſuffering it.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Death is the crown of life, was death denied</l>
                  <l>Poor man had liv'd in vain.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>THE way to bring ourſelves with eaſe to a contempt of this world, is to think daily of leaving it. They who die well have lived long enough; as ſoon as death enters upon the ſtage, the tragedy of life is done. There are a great many miſeries which nothing but death can give relief to. This puts an end to the ſorrows of the afflicted and diſtreſſed. It ſets priſoners at liberty; it dries up the tears of the widows and the fatherleſs; it eaſes the complaints of the hungry and naked; it tames the proudeſt tyrants, and puts an end to all our labours: And the contemplation on it, ſupports men under their preſent adverſities, eſpecially when they have a proſpect of a better life after this.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Learn to live well, that thou may'ſt die ſo too;</l>
                  <l>To live and die is all we have to do.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>HAVE we ſo often ſeen ourſelves die in in our friends, and ſhall we ſhrink at our own change? Hath our Maker ſent for us, and are we loth to go? It was for us our

ſaviour triumphed over death. Is there then any fear of a foiled adverſary?</p>
               <p>THE grave lies between us and the object we reach after. Where one lives to enjoy whatever he has in view, ten thouſand are cut off in the purſuit of it.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Many are the ſhapes of death,</l>
                  <l>And many are the ways that lead</l>

               </lg>
               <p>ALL our knowledge, our employments, our riches and our honours, muſt end in death; ſo that we muſt ſeek a ſanctuary of happineſs ſome where elſe.</p>

I lay my hand upon my heart, and aſk myſelf, whether, if God ſhould require my ſoul of me this night, I could hope for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from him. The bitter agonies I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went in this my firſt acquaintance with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were ſo far from throwing me into deſpair of that mercy which is over all God's works, that it proved motives of greater cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection in my future conduct. The oftener I exerciſed myſelf in meditations of this kind, the leſs was my anxiety; and by making the thoughts of death familiar, what was at firſt ſo terrible and ſhocking, is now become the ſweeteſt of my enjoyments. Theſe contemplations have indeed made me ſerious, but not ſullen; nay, they are ſo far from having ſoured my temper, that I have a mind perfectly compoſed, and a ſecret ſpring of joy in my heart:—I taſte all the innocent ſatisfaction of life pure, as I have no ſhare in pleaſures that leave a ſting behind them.</p>

               <p>POSTERITY wiſely regulates the rewards due to men of learning, and equals them to the greateſt princes: Three thouſand years after their death, their honour is not tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that of the greateſt heroes. Homer is as well known as Achilles. The able hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, the famous poet, the great—the pious and ingenious philoſopher have an advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age over the conqueror and the general. Twenty centuries after they are dead and rotten they ſpeak with as much eloquence and vivacity as when living; and all that read their writings perceive their genius. The heroes who have rendered themſelves famous by their actions, have not near ſuch an aſcendant over our hearts; for he, at one
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030567_0066_0FE7D52EB250FF28"/>
and the ſame inſtant, perſuades, engages and captivates the heart of one man ſhut up in his cloſet at Stockholm, and of another that lives in the middle of Paris, London, &amp;c. &amp;c. Heroes are infinitely obliged to poets and hiſtorians, but the latter are ſeldom behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the former. Achilles owes part of his glory to Homer: If there had been no hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, it would ſcarce have been known that there ever was ſuch a man as Alexander, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>EDUCATION is the ruling motive in moſt of the actions of mankind; they are more or leſs tractable, according as they have been more or leſs cultivated in their youth. When they have been taught early to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſociable, to bend their tempers, and to accommodate their wills to thoſe of others, it grows into a cuſtom, and they become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly complaiſant, without thinking of being ſo. In ſhort, habit is to them a ſecond nature.</p>
               <p>We ſhould juſtly conſider religion as the moſt eſſentially neceſſary qualification; at the ſame time children ſhould be fitted for an appearance becoming their ſtation in this world. Many are apt to disjoin the ideas of piety and politeneſs, but true religion is not only conſiſtent with, but neceſſary to, the perfection of true politeneſs.</p>
               <p>THE end of learning is, to know God, and, in conſequence of that knowledge, to love
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030567_0067_0FE9E3BBB8F81370"/>
him, and to imitate him, as we may the nearer, by poſſeſſing ourſelves of virtue.</p>
               <p>WHAT ſculpture is to a block of marble, education is to the human ſoul. The phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, the ſaint, the hero, the wiſe, the good, or the great man very often lie hid and concealed in a plebeian; which a proper education might have diſinterred and brought to light.</p>
               <p>THE educator's care ſhould be, above all things to lay in his charge the foundation of religion and virtue.</p>
               <p>PARENTS are more careful to beſtow wit on their children, than virtue; the art of ſpeaking well, rather than doing well; but their morals ought to be their greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
               <p>AN induſtrious and virtuous education of children is a better inheritance for them than a great eſtate. To what purpoſe is it, ſaid Crates, to heap up eſtates, and have no care what kind of heirs they leave them to?</p>
               <p>THE higheſt learning is to be wiſe, and the greateſt wiſdom to be good.</p>
               <p>THE great buſineſs of man is, to improve his mind and govern his manners.</p>
               <p>EXCESS of ceremony ſhows want of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That civility is beſt, which excludes all ſuperfluous formality.</p>
               <p>TRUE philoſophy, ſays Plato, conſiſts more in fidelity, conſtancy, juſtice, ſincerity
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030567_0068_0FE7D53785DB63C0"/>
and in the love of our duty, than in a great capacity.</p>
               <p>IF our painful peregrination in ſtudies be deſtitute of the ſupreme light, it is nothing elſe but a miſerable kind of wandering.</p>
               <p>THE mind ought ſometimes to be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it may turn to thinking the better.</p>
               <p>LEARNING is the dictionary, but ſenſe the grammar of ſcience. Poetry is inſpiration —it was breathed into the ſoul, when it firſt quickened, and ſhould neither be ſtyled art nor ſcience, but genius.</p>
               <p>GREAT men are always reſerved and mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and being content with meriting praiſe, do not endeavour to court it; and for this they are the more praiſe worthy, becauſe, if vanity is pardonable, it is in the man who deſerves thoſe ſhining compliments, which are ſo becoming to many learned men. It is ſaid, that Racine was a whole year in compoſing his tragedy of Phaedra, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter piece of the theatre, and before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to the ſtage, conſulted his friends a long time, corrected ſeveral paſſages by their advice, and waited for the ſucceſs of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, before he would preſume to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it a good one. Prado wrote the ſame in a month's time; gave it out boldly to be acted, and aſſured the public it was an excellent piece. But it happened to him as it often does to all half witted authors; his work quickly went to the chandlers' ſhops,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030567_0069_0FE7D5303B4003B8"/>
whereas Racine's will reach to the lateſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
               <p>GREAT talents, ſuch as honour, virtue, learning and parts, are above the generality of the world, who neither poſſeſs them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor judge of them rightly in others: But all people are judges of the leſſer talents, ſuch as civility, affability and an obliging agreeable addreſs and manner: Becauſe they feel the good effects of them, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſociety eaſy and pleaſing.</p>
               <p>ALMOST all the advantages or miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our lives depend, in a great meaſure, upon our education. Therefore it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the duty of all who have in ANY way the inſpection of this important affair, by every means poſſible, to win young minds to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; to the end that good parts may not take an evil turn, nor indifferent ones be totally loſt for want of induſtrious cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>EDUCATION, when it works upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous mind, brings out to view every la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perfection, which, without ſuch helps are never able to make their appearance. And, if we take the trouble to look round, we ſhall find very few, to whom nature has been ſuch a niggard of her gifts, that they are not capable of ſhining in one ſphere of ſcience or another: Since then there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bias towards knowledge, in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mind, which may be ſtrengthened and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030567_0070_0FE7D53D47950658"/>
improved by proper care; ſure, parents and others ſhould conſider, that, in the neglect of ſo eſſential a point, they do not commit a private injury only, as thereby they ſtarve poſterity, and defraud our country of thoſe perſons, who, under better management, might perhaps make an eminent figure.</p>
               <p>INDEED, the difference in the manners and abilities of men proceeds more from educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than from any imperfections or advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages derived from their original formation.</p>
               <p>YOUTH moreover is the proper and only ſeaſon for education; for if it be neglected then, it will ſurely be in vain to think of rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edying the overſight in more advanced years; it will be too late to think of ſowing it, when maturity has rendered the mind ſtubborn and inflexible, and when, inſtead of receiving the ſeeds, it ſhould be bringing forth the fruits of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>BUT there is one point in the article of ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation, which is more eſſential than any of the reſt: I mean the great care that ought to be taken to form youth to the principles of religion. Vice, if we may believe the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral complaint, grows ſo malignant nowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, that it is almoſt impoſſible to keep young people from the ſpreading contagion; if we venture them abroad, and truſt to chance or inclination, for the choice of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; it is therefore virtue, and a perfect ſenſe of their duty to God, which is the great and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030567_0071_0FE7D535FA471528"/>
valuable thing to be taught them. All other conſiderations and accompliſhments ſhould give way, and be poſtponed to theſe; theſe are the ſolid and ſubſtantial good we ſhould labour to implant and faſten on their minds, neither ſhould we ceaſe till we have attained a true reliſh for them, and placed their ſtrength, their glory and their PLEASURE IN THEM.</p>
               <p>IT is alſo of the firſt conſequence in train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up youths of both ſexes, that they be early inſpired with humanity, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that its principles be implanted ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their yet tender hearts, to guard them againſt inflicting wanton pain on thoſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which uſe or accident may occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put into their power.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>Friendſhip's a name to few confin'd,</l>
                  <l>The offspring of a noble mind;</l>
                  <l>A generous warmth which fills the breaſt,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>FRIENDSHIP is a ſweet attraction of the heart, towards the merit we eſteem, or the perfections we admire; and produces a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual inclination between two perſons, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote each others' intereſt, knowledge, virtue and happineſs.</p>
               <p>THERE is nothing ſo common as preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to friendſhip; though few know what it means, and fewer yet come up to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. By talking of it, we ſet ourſelves off; but when we enquire into it, we ſee our defects; and when we engage in it, we muſt charge through abundance of difficulty. The
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030567_0076_0FE7D546925FE350"/>
veneration it has challenged in every age, (the moſt barbarous not excepted) is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony of its excellence: And the more valuable it is, the more are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be inſtructed in it.</p>
               <p>MONSIEUR DE SACY in his eſſay upon friendſhip, treats to this effect: The friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is to be recommended, is union of affections, ſpringing from a generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to virtue, and is maintained by a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of manners. It is a great miſtake to call every trifling commerce by this ſerious name; or to ſuppoſe that empty compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and viſits of ceremony, when no more is intended than to paſs the time, and ſhew the equipage, ſhould paſs for a real and well eſtabliſhed friendſhip. The frequency of the practice will not wipe off the abſurdity: —There is as wide a difference between a bully and a man of honour.</p>
               <p>NOT that theſe amuſements are to be found fault with, the innocence and convenience of which protects them, when they paſs for nothing but what they are; but certainly they ought to be diſtinguiſhed from their betters; and the language and profeſſions bear a proportion to the real impreſſion they have on our heart.</p>
               <p>CONFORMITY of inclination is the life of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>WHILST all are purſuing this common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, all are travelling the ſame courſe,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030567_0077_0FE7D5972742A8C0"/>
nothing can break the union of their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſires. The danger is only from irregular motions, and forgetting from which they ſhould act. So long as we maintain a reſpect to this principle of union, and keep virtue on the throne, our humour and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price will be checked and ſubdued. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt can maintain and form ſocieties, as we find it does, why ſhould not thoſe who are actuated by a higher principle, (and with ſuch only is our buſineſs) do as much, if not more.</p>
               <p>IT may be ſaid, from hence I conclude that all good men are friends, if virtue be the life of friendſhip. The conſequence holds good as far as eſteem goes, if they knew one another, they would value one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. But though friendſhip is founded on eſteem, ſo much that it cannot otherways ſubſiſt, there goes however, ſomething more to form it; eſteem is a tribute due to merit in general; but friendſhip is an improvement made upon merit, and engages us in a very different degree.</p>
               <p>SUCH impreſſion has been made upon the heart as cannot be well deſcribed, and works like a mother's affection to her own children, above thoſe of ſtrangers, as amiable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thoſe who would have friendſhip confined to the narroweſt compaſs, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it the moſt ſublime; though num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, if practicable, may be highly uſeful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:030567_0078_0FE7D54C4FFECD88"/>FOR to have but one friend, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be to have none, or, which is the ſame thing, none when we want him. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time, and place and ability too, make it proper that we have more than one bottom to venture in. The offices of friendſhip are various, to direct our choice, and rectify our miſtakes; to ſuſtain our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, moderate our joys and the like. This may poſſibly be better done by the care and endeavours of ſeveral. Not that I would have friendſhip governed by profit and convenience; a motive ſo mean can produce nothing extraordinary. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing generous in the compoſition, that looks at another man's advantage as much as his own.</p>
               <p>AND that we may not talk without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for what we ſay, the ſages of old, whoſe friendſhips were ſo well cultivated, and became ſo famous as to be handed down to the preſent time, even theirs were divided into ſeveral ſtreams. The moſt polite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their PHILOSOPHERS too, gave us examples of that ſort to build upon. It were difficult to determine, juſt how many make a ſufficient quantity of friends, ſome fix the number to three, others allowing a greater latitude, but this rule will ſerve us, <hi>the fewer the better;</hi> and he who thinks he has a great number of friends, has moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe he has none. It was a good
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030567_0079_0FE7D59CE4447838"/>
return of Socrates, when his houſe was thought too little "Would to God I could fill it with true friends;" ſaid he: After all, if one ſhould have a barn full, one would wiſh for no more than a cloſet would hold. Let the matter at leaſt turn upon this, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the reaſons I have offered:—The difficulty we ſhall find in the choice of our friends, will make us rejoice we have but few to chuſe. Of ſuch importance is the work, it is ſo hard to ſucceed, and ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to miſcarry, ſo ſevere an inquiry into the inclination and merits of the perſon, and the experience we muſt run through, before we are ſafe in their hands, will convince us, that to gain three or four in the courſe of our life, is to employ it well. Whence is it, ſo many friendſhips clapt up on a ſudden, which have the air of a veteran, not of a raw, undiſciplined affection, and look like the meeting of old friends, not of new ones; whence can it be, theſe ſo promiſing, and kindly advances ſhould ſo ſoon be overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? It is becauſe they began too ſoon, and run up too faſt: And is there any myſtery in this, that time ſhould deſtroy what we ſet up without conſulting him? We meet, and at firſt ſight like one another well, the next thing is to ſay ſo, the next in courſe to be DEAR FRIENDS. We vow and ſwear eternal amity; and when we go to conſidering, we find him out; we grow cool;—and at length
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030567_0080_0FE7D54DD84CE6C8"/>
come to hate him. We ſwing ourſelves up by main force, and our own weight brings us down again. Would you contract a friendſhip that ſhould laſt a long time, be a long time in contracting it.</p>
               <p>PLUTARCH thus deſcribes the perſon a friend ſhould be. As to the perſon of whom we are to make a friend, he muſt be endowed with virtue, as a thing in itſelf lovely and deſirable, which conſiſts of a ſweet and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging temper of mind, a lively readineſs in doing good offices; than which qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, nothing is more rarely found in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To this a familiar converſation muſt be added; for the perſon whom we deſire to make our friend, muſt not caſually be pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up at a tavern, or an eating houſe, nor at a promiſcuous meeting at a horſe race; but one choſen upon long and mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confirmed by ſettled converſe, and with whom, as the proverb ſays, <hi>"we have eaten a buſhel of ſalt."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM a vicious man I ſhould deſire to ſtand off altogether. By a vicious man I do not mean one liable to failings, as all men are, but one that acts without any regard to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and conſcience. He is out of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that makes an engagement that is not ſupported only by principles of virtue. True friendſhip juſtly founded is a bleſſing, in which virtue has the ſole property. And, as virtue has but few temporal rewards to

propoſe, thoſe few are to be found no where elſe.</p>
               <p>EQUALITY of birth and fortune, is by ſome made a point neceſſary to a well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed friendſhip, and it muſt be ſaid the rule ever to be embraced, if we could, when we pleaſed, find as good men of our own rank, as elſewhere. But conſidering there are but few of any rank fit to be choſen, we ſhould look at the ſolid foundation of merit, and paſs by mere accompliſhments. We make no league with the coat of arms and liveries, but the man, and with that part of the man too, that is conſidered abſtractly from both. Theſe things are not fixed to the freehold.</p>
               <p>NOT but that one ſhould carry it with that diſtance and regard which is due to perſons of condition. If they condeſcend to lay aſide their ſtate there is no reaſon we ſhould take advantage of the level. One would preſume farther upon the behaviour of a man genteelly bred, than another that wanted that advantage. But, on the other hand, there are inſtances to be met with, of ſuch as have out ſtretched expectation, as well as thoſe that have fallen ſhort of it. Theſe ſhould be looked upon with as much favour, and more, for having hammered out themſelves into the perfections they have.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>THE general duty of a friend is, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious purſuit of his friend's real advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; fidelity in his truſts, aſſiſtance in all his wants, and a conſtant endeavour for his advancement in piety and virtue; for ſo cloſe is the connexion, that this is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of GOD himſelf ſpeaking of a friend: THY FRIEND, WHICH IS AS THINE OWN SOUL, Deut. xiii. 6.</p>
               <p>REVENGE (ſays de Sacy) which is never to be indulged, is between friends, moſt of all a crime, and yet it will ſometimes creep in, under the diſguiſe of juſtice; and here the eaſineſs of revenge may encourage us to it. We know the man to the bottom, and can therefore injure him a hundred ways; but, this is ungenerous—inhuman! All that we can honourably allow ourſelves in, is to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030567_0083_0FE7D5A42E5557E8"/>
ſhew, by a genteel behaviour, what he has loſt, who has forfeited our friendſhip; by our generous conduct, to diſcover the fault is his, and make him ſuffer in the reproach of his own breaſt. To be unconcerned at his misfortunes, or ſucceſs; to look upon him with the averſion of an enemy, is paſſion and not juſt reſentment. His betraying your ſecrets will not juſtify you in expoſing his. You will meet with a more favourable opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion from the beſt of men, while you are ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous to ſuffer rather than retaliate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they will think you deſerve ſuch uſage, if you can allow it in yourſelf. There is no relief but patience, admitting it otherwiſe, you open a door to all manner of diſorder. Friendſhip has no ſting to revenge affronts with, the remorſe which a guilty perſon feels, and the diſgrace he meets with abroad, if his character be known, is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſhould content ourſelves with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting.</p>
               <p>AMONG the friends we ſhould caſt off, I reckon thoſe that ſtick as long as fortune is kind, but turn with the tide and keep at a diſtance; thoſe flies that follow the honey pot while there is ſomething to be had, and take leave when there is no more to be hoped for. A true friend may be forgiven, if in time of proſperity he ſeem to neglect you, but he is not worth having, who neglects you in diſtreſs; for it is then his duty comes on,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030567_0084_0FE7D5553304D250"/>
when things go againſt you; to ſuſtain and comfort you when you are in trouble; and to bear a part of your burden.</p>
               <p>WE think we come up to the higheſt pitch of friendſhip, when our purſe is open to our friend. It is true, comparatively reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, he is a generous man that will do ſo much; but that is not enough, if to part with our money to thoſe who profeſs an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for us, be the higheſt piece of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, pray what muſt the loweſt be? Is it ſuch a mighty piece of buſineſs to do that for the deareſt perſon on earth, which we do to gratify a vain humour? What common humanity or applauſe will put us upon, ſurely, amongſt friends, is not to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an act of tranſcendent kindneſs, when it is no more than giving to another ſelf, and paying of debts. Is there any thing more certainly a due, than what we are engaged to by the alliance of friendſhip: Let a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the diſpleaſure of his ſuperiors, and warmly embark in my ſervice, I will own ſuch a man to be a friend indeed, generous and affectionate, one cannot praiſe him too much. Let him open his purſe to one he loves, this comes ſhort of the other. A man of honour, upon a ſlender friendſhip, will do as much as this. To cry up with the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our pence, for the higheſt ſacrifice that can be paid to friendſhip, is the ſign of a grovelling ſpirit, that knows not what is
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030567_0085_0FE7D5A5B4880368"/>
truly noble. The people of old had better notions of the matter, who would borrow to give others in diſtreſs, and think they had done no more than their duty.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE, he that fails in this point, is not worth our acquaintance, he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts a man to ſave his pocket, will never hazard life and reputation in his ſervice. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is the principle of union, but vice is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſtrong enough to make a ſeparation. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is a time to try how ſincere the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions were; if they paſs that teſt, we may depend upon them.</p>
               <p>WITH three ſorts of men enter into no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious friendſhip, the ungrateful man, the multiloquous man and the coward. The firſt cannot prize your favours, the ſecond cannot keep your counſel, and the third dares not vindicate your honour.</p>
               <p>OF all felicities, how charming is that of a firm and gentle friendſhip; it ſweetens our cares, ſoftens our ſorrows and aſſiſts us in extremities; it is a ſovereign antidote againſt calamities. Nature, within the ſoul of man, has formed nothing more noble, or more rare than friendſhip.</p>

               <p>IT was ever my opinion, ſays Horace, that a chearful good natured friend is ſo great a bleſſing that it admits of no compariſon.</p>
               <p>CICERO uſed to ſay, That it was no leſs an evil for a man to be without a friend, than to have the heavens without a ſun. And
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030567_0087_0FE7D5AB85CB1BC8"/>
Socrates thought friendſhip the ſweeteſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and that no piece of ground yielded more, or pleaſanter fruit than a true friend.</p>
               <p>FORTUNE, honours—life itſelf, are ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices due to the ſacred connexions of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>THAT friendſhip alone, which flows from the ſource of virtue, ſupplies an uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, an inexhauſtible ſtream of delight.</p>
               <p>HASTILY contracted friendſhips generally promiſe the leaſt duration or ſatisfaction; as they too often may be found to ariſe from deſign on one ſide, and weakneſs on the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. True friendſhip muſt be the effect of long and mutual eſteem, affection and knowledge.</p>
               <p>ONLY good and wiſe men or women, can be friends, others are but companions.</p>
               <p>THE kindneſſes of a friend lie deep, and whether preſent or abſent, as occaſion ſerves, he is ſolicitous about our concerns.</p>
               <p>FRIENDSHIP improves happineſs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates miſery, by the doubling of our joy, and dividing of our grief.</p>
               <p>THE beſt friendſhip is to prevent a requeſt, and never put a man to the confuſion of aſking. To aſk is a word that lies heavy on the tongue, and cannot be uttered but with a dejected countenance. We ſhould therefore ſtrive to meet our friend in his wiſhes, if we cannot prevent him.</p>

               <p>IT is no flattery to give a friend a due character, for commendation is as much the duty of a friend, as reprehenſion.</p>

               <p>FALSE is their conceit, who ſay, The way to have a friend is not to make uſe of him. Nothing can give a greater aſſurance, that two men are friends, than when experience makes them mutually acknowledge it.</p>

               <p>A FRIENDSHIP of intereſt laſts no longer than the intereſt continues; whereas true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is of the nature of a diamond; it is laſting, and it is hard to break.</p>
               <p>A FAITHFUL friend is the medicine of life, and this excellency is invaluable.</p>
               <p>FRIENDSHIP has a noble effect upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and conditions, it relieves our cares, raiſes our hopes, and abates our fears.

               <p>ALL men have their frailties; whoever looks for a friend without imperfections will never find what he ſeeks; we love ourſelves with all our faults, and we ought to love our friend in like manner.</p>
               <p>WHOEVER moves you to part with a true and tried friend, has certainly a deſign to make way for a treacherous enemy.</p>
               <p>HE is happy that finds a true friend in extremity; but he is much more ſo, who findeth not extremity whereby to try his friend.</p>
               <p>FRIENDSHIP is the moſt ſacred of all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bonds.

               <p>GOOD nature is the very air of a good mind, the ſign of a large and generous ſoul, the peculiar ſoil on which virtue proſpers. There is far more ſatisfaction in doing, than receiving good. To relieve the oppreſſed, is the moſt glorious act a man is capable of; it is in ſome meaſure doing the buſineſs of God and Providence; and is attended with a heavenly pleaſure, unknown but to thoſe that are beneficent and liberal.</p>
               <p>IT is not in the power of a good man to refuſe making another happy, where he hath both ability and opportunity.</p>
               <p>GOODNESS is generous and diffuſive. It is largeneſs of mind, and ſweetneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; modeſt and ſincere, inoffenſive and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging. Where this quality is predominant, there is a noble forwardneſs for public ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit; an ardour to relieve the wants, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the oppreſſions and better the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all mankind.</p>

               <p>WE read a pretty paſſage (ſays Philologus) of a certain cardinal, who, by the multitude of his generous actions, gave occaſion for the world to call him "The patron of the poor." This eccleſiaſtic prince had a conſtant cuſtom, once or twice a week, to give public audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all indigent people in the hall of his palace, and to relieve every one according to their various neceſſities, or the motions of his own bounty. One day, a poor widow, encouraged by the fame of his generoſity, came into the hall of this cardinal, with her only child, a beautiful maid, about fifteen years of age. When her turn came to be heard, among a croud of petitioners, the cardinal diſcerning the marks of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary modeſty in her face and carriage, as alſo in her daughter, encouraged her to tell her wants freely—ſhe bluſhing—and, not without tears, thus addreſſed herſelf to him. "My lord, I owe for the rent of my houſe, five crowns, and ſuch is my misfortune, that I have no other means to pay it, ſave what would break my heart, ſince my landlord threatens to force me to it; that is, to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute my only daughter, whom I have hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto, with great care, educated in virtue.— What I beg of your eminence is, that you
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030567_0097_0FE7D5BBB0B3F4E0"/>
would pleaſe to interpoſe your authority, and protect us from the violence of this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el man, till, by our honeſt induſtry, we can procure the money for him." The cardinal, moved with admiration at the woman's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and innocent modeſty, bade her be of good courage; then he immediately wrote a billet, and giving it into the widow's hands, Go, ſaid he, to my ſteward, and he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee five crowns to pay thy rent. The poor woman overjoyed, and returning the cardinal a thouſand thanks, went directly to his ſteward—and gave him the note, which when he had read, told her out fifty crowns. She, aſtoniſhed at the meaning of it, and fearing it was the ſteward's trick to try her honeſty, refuſed to take above five, ſaying, ſhe mentioned no more to the cardinal, and ſhe was ſure it was ſome miſtake. On the other ſide, the ſteward inſiſted on his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's order, not daring to call it in queſtion. But all the arguments he could uſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to prevail on her to take more than five crowns. Wherefore, to end the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, he offered to go back with her to the cardinal, and refer it to him. When they came before that munificent prince, and had fully informed him, of the buſineſs;— "it is true—ſaid he, I miſtook in writing fifty crowns. Give me the paper, and I will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it." Thereupon he wrote again; ſaying this to the woman, "So much candour and
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030567_0098_0FE7D570DD0BAF28"/>
virtue deſerves a recompenſe. Here I have ordered you five hundred crowns. What you can ſpare of it, lay up as a dowry to give with your daughter in marriage.</p>
               <p>WHAT a mighty impreſſion the actions of truly great men ſtamp on hearts ſincerely addicted to virtue.</p>
               <p>THE words of Lewis XII of France ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great and noble mind; who being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to puniſh thoſe that had wronged him before he was king, anſwered, It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a king of France to revenge injuries done to a duke of Orleans.</p>
               <p>THE conferring of a happineſs on any creature, is certainly the higheſt enjoyment of the human mind! but the paying of it to an amiable and deſerving object, muſt height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the ſentiment even to tranſport.</p>
               <p>AN extraordinary inſtance of generoſity in an Egyptian.</p>
               <p>A CONFLAGRATION having reduced to aſhes one of the principal moſques of Cairo, the Muſſulmans imputed this calamity to the hatred of the Chriſtians; and, without examining if ſuch an accuſation was well founded or not, ſeveral young people ran to the quarter inhabited by chriſtians, and ſet fire to it by way of repriſal.</p>
               <p>SUCH an outrage deſerved the ſevereſt puniſhment: The governor cauſed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators to be apprehended; but, as the number was very great, he could not reſolve

               <p>AS many lots were thrown into an urn, as, amounted to the number of culprits: Some few of theſe were marked, death; and all the others condemned the drawers to the correction only of rods.</p>
               <p>WHEN they had all drawn their lots out of the fatal urn, one of thoſe deſtined to death cried out in a tranſport of grief, "I do not regret the loſs of life; but how will my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, overwhelmed with ſorrow, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the greateſt miſery, be able to live without my aſſiſtance?"</p>
               <p>ONE of thoſe that had eſcaped death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him that was lamenting his fate. "Friend, I have neither father nor mother; my life is of no uſe to any one; give me your lot, and take mine."

               <head>HONESTY.</head>
               <p>EVERY man is bound to be an honeſt man, but all cannot be great men; he that is good is great, and if the fooliſh eſteem him not ſo, let him ſtand to the verdict of his own conſcience. Where there may be a ſufficient ground of reproach, yet an honeſt man is always tender of his neighbour's character, from the ſenſe of his own frailty. An honeſt man lives not to the world, but to himſelf.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>A wit's a feather, and a chief's a rod,</l>
                  <l>An honeſt man's the nobleſt work of God.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>THERE are few perſons to be found, but what are more concerned for the reputation of wit and ſenſe, than honeſty and virtue.</p>
               <p>HE only is worthy of eſteem, that knows what is juſt and honeſt, and dares to do it; that is maſter of his own paſſions, and ſcorns to be ſlave to another's. Such a one, in the loweſt poverty, is a far better man, and merits more reſpect, than thoſe gay things, who owe all their greatneſs and reputation to their rentals and revenues.</p>

               <p>HONESTY is ſilently commended even by the practice of the moſt wicked; for their deceit is under its colour.</p>
               <p>THE Dutch have a good proverb, "Thefts never enrich, alms never impoveriſh, prayers hinder no work."</p>
               <p>IT is not ſo painful to an honeſt man to want money, as it is to owe it.</p>
               <p>THE want of juſtice is not only condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the want of mercy. The rich man went to hell for not relieving Lazarus, though he wronged him not.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in the world worth being a knave for.</p>
               <p>THE difference there is between honour and honeſty, ſeems to be chiefly in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the mere honeſt man does that from duty, which the man of honour does for the ſake of character.</p>

But the bulk of mankind judge otherwiſe. Noiſe and ſhew, title and equipage, glitter and grandeur, conſtitute the whole idea of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and whoever can command an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſufficient to procure, and an affluence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport them, becomes thereby not only a man of honour, but even a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fountain of honour, enabled to produce others after his kind, and propagate the HON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OURABLE ſpecies from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>THE man of honour is an internal, the perſon of honour an external; the one a real, the other a fictitious character. I am therefore never ſurpriſed to ſee or hear ſuch things attempted, ſaid and done by a perſon of honour, which a man of honour would bluſh to think of.</p>
               <p>A PERSON of honour may be a prophane, irreligious libertine; a penurious, proud, revengeful coward, may inſult his inferiors, oppreſs his tenants and ſervants debauch his neighbours' wives and daughters, defraud his creditors, and proſtitute his public faith for a protection, may aſſociate with ſots and drunkards, ſharpers and gameſters, in order to increaſe his fortune; I ſay, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible

               <p>THERE is no paſſion that more excites us to every thing that is noble and generous than virtuous love.</p>
               <p>LOVE is not a guilty paſſion, a criminal deſire which debaſes human nature; it is a moſt exalted eſteem and regard, founded on reaſon and virtue; an affection which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobles the mind, elevates the ſoul, and leads it neareſt to heaven. This is the idea which
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030567_0115_0FE7D5D78775C658"/>
that ſacred name conveys—pure and unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any groſs conceptions; and which, thus underſtood, may as well ſubſiſt between two perſons of the ſame, as of a different ſex; though ſome will argue, that the latter is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a more refined ſoftneſs.</p>
               <p>LOVE founded on external charms, and which only ſeeks the gratification of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, will ſoon change its object, and be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with novelty; but where eſteem is the baſis of love, when it is founded on virtue— accompanied by all thoſe amiable and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing qualities of the head, and heart and mind enlarged, ſurely that affection—that friendſhip cannot die—it can never fall, while thoſe virtues remain on which it is built—by which it is enlarged, ſtrengthened and ſupported.</p>
               <p>SOLID love, whoſe root is virtue, can no more die than virtue itſelf.</p>
               <p>WITHOUT conſtancy there is neither love, friendſhip, nor virtue in the world.</p>
               <p>HE that loves on the account of virtue, can never be weary; becauſe there are ever freſh charms to attract him, and entertain him.</p>
               <p>OUR affections are the links which form ſociety; and though by being ſtretched or broken they may give us pain, yet certainly we could have no pleaſure without them.</p>

               <p>GOD is love, and the more we endeavour to imitate the Deity, the nearer we approach to perfection and happineſs. Love or char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is moreover the diſtinguiſhing character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>THAT ſweet and elegant uniting of the minds, which is properly called love, has no other knot but virtue; and therefore, if it be a right love, it can never ſlide into any action that is not virtuous.</p>
               <p>ALL thoſe who love are not true friends; but all ſuch as are true friends neceſſarily love. True love (ſays Thompſon) and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are the ſame.</p>

               <p>AN affection in a lover is reſtleſs, ſo if it be perfect it is endleſs.</p>
               <p>LOVE makes a man that is naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to vice to be endued with virtue, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces him to apply himſelf to all laudable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, that thereby he may obtain his love's

               <p>LOVE fixed on virtue, increaſeth ever by continuance.</p>
               <p>LOVE is a virtue, if meaſured by dutiful choice, and not maimed by wilful chance.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS it is not poſſible to love two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons exactly in the ſame degree, yet, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may be ſo ſmall, that none of the parties can tell certainly, on which ſide the ſcale preponderates.</p>
               <p>IT is a narrowneſs of mind to wiſh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine your friend's affection ſolely to yourſelf: If ſhe depends on you alone for all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and advantages of friendſhip, your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or death may leave her deſolate and forlorn. If therefore you prefer her good to your own gratification, you ſhould rather ſtrive to multiply her friends, and be ready to embrace in your affections all who love her, and deſerve her love.</p>

Where the love of God reigns in the affections, it will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the powers of nature, and all the reſt of the paſſions to act ſuitably to this ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign and all ruling affection of love. The eye will often look up to God in a way of humble dependence; the ear will be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his holy word; the hands will be lifted up to heaven in daily requeſts; the knees will be bent in humble worſhip; all
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030567_0119_0FE7D5D911F93240"/>
the outward powers will be buſy in doing the will of God, and promoting his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He that loves God will keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and fulfil every preſent duty with delight: He will endeavour to pleaſe God in all his actions, and watch againſt, and avoid whatever may offend him; and while the ſeveral outward powers are thus engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the inward affections of nature will be employed in correſponding exerciſes. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme love will govern all the active train of human paſſions, and lead them captive to chearful obedience.</p>
               <p>How ſenſeleſs and abſurd is the pretence to love God above all things, if we do not reſolve to live upon him as our hope and happineſs; if we do not chuſe him to be our God and our all, our chief and all ſufficient good in this world, and that which is to come! Where the idea of God, as a Being of ſupreme excellence, doth not reign in the mind, where the will is not determined and fixed on him as our ſupreme good, men are ſtrangers to that ſacred and divine affection of love. Until this be done, we cannot be ſaid to love God with all our heart.</p>
               <p>How neceſſary and uſeful a practice it is therefore for a chriſtian to meditate often on the tranſcendent perfections and worth of the bleſſed God, to ſurvey his attributes, and his grace in Chriſt Jeſus; to keep in mind a conſtant idea of his ſupreme excellence, and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030567_0120_0FE7D6384A4B9AD8"/>
frequently to repeat and confirm the choice of him as our higheſt hopes, our portion and our everlaſting good! This will keep the love of God warm at heart, and maintain the divine affection in its primitive life and vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. But if our ideas of the adorable and ſupreme excellence of God grow faint and feeble, and ſink lower in the mind; if we loſe the ſight of his amiable glories, the ſenſe of his amazing love in the goſpel, his rich promiſes, and alluring grace; if we ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the fervency of this ſacred paſſion, our love to God grows cold by degrees, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers great and gradual decays.</p>
               <p>WHAT thanks do we owe to God, who, though we are ſo much indebted to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands only our love, to pay off all our debts upon this conſideration; doth he not ſhew us, by placing the precept of love above all others, how, poor and inſolvent as we are, we may clear ourſelves of all that we owe him.</p>
               <p>IT is ſurely impoſſible to read the life and death of our bleſſed Saviour, without renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and increaſing in our hearts, that love and reverence, and gratitude to him, which is ſo juſtly due for all he did and ſuffered for us; every word that fell from his lips is more precious than all the treaſures of the earth, for his are the words of eternal life! They muſt therefore be laid up in our hearts,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030567_0121_0FE7D5DEE1E65458"/>
and be conſtantly referred to, on all occaſions, as the rule and direction of all our actions.</p>
               <p>IT is impoſſible to love God, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to pleaſe him, and, as far as we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to reſemble him; therefore the love of God muſt lead to every virtue in the higheſt degree; and we may be ſure we do not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love him, if we content ourſelves with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding flagrant ſins, and do not ſtrive in good earneſt, to reach the greateſt degree of perfection we are capable of, by his help.</p>
               <p>WE cannot poſſibly exceed in the meaſure of our love to God, to whom reaſon as well as revelation directs us to offer the beſt of our affections, and from whom alone we can hope for that happineſs, which it is our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inceſſantly to deſire.</p>

To be confined to live with one perpetually, for whom we have no liking and eſteem, muſt certainly be an uneaſy ſtate. There had need be a great many good qualities to reconcile a conſtant converſation with one, where there is ſome ſhare of kindneſs, but without love, the very beſt of all good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities will never make a conſtant converſation
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030567_0124_0FE7D63FA54BDDE8"/>
eaſy and delightful. And whence proceed thoſe innumerable domeſtic miſeries, that plague and utterly confound ſo many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but from want of love and kindneſs in the wife or huſband; from theſe come their neglect and careleſs management of affairs at home, and their profuſe extravagant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes abroad. In a word, it is not eaſy, as it is not needful, to recount the evils that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe abundantly, from the want of conjugal affection only. And ſince this is ſo certain, a man or woman runs the moſt fearful haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard that can be, who marries without their affection in themſelves, and without good aſſurances of it in the other.</p>
               <p>LET love adviſe you before you chuſe, and your choice be fixed before you marry. Remember the happineſs or miſery of your life depends upon this one act, and that nothing but death can diſſolve the knot.</p>
               <p>A SINGLE life is doubtleſs preferable to a married one, where prudence and affection do not accompany the choice; but where they do, there is no terreſtrial happineſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the married ſtate.</p>
               <p>THERE cannot be too near an equality, too exact a harmony betwixt a married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it is a ſtep of ſuch weight as calls for all our foreſight and penetration, and, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the temper and education muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. In unequal matches the men are
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030567_0125_0FE7D5E64D731D80"/>
generally more in fault than the women, who can ſeldom be chuſers.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Wiſdom to gold prefer, for 'tis much leſs</l>
                  <l>To make your fortune than your happineſs.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>MARRIAGES founded on affection are the moſt happy. Love (ſays Addiſon) ought to have ſhot its roots deep, and to be well grown before we enter into that ſtate. There is nothing which more nearly concerns the peace of mankind—it is his choice in this reſpect on which his happineſs or miſery for life depends.</p>
               <p>THOUGH Solomon's deſcription of a wiſe and good woman, may be thought too mean and mechanical for this refined generation; yet certain it is, that the buſineſs of a family is the moſt profitable and honorable ſtudy they can employ themſelves in.</p>
               <p>THE beſt dowry to advance the marriage of a young lady is, when ſhe has in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, mildneſs; in her ſpeech, wiſdom; in her behaviour, modeſty; and in her life, virtue.</p>
               <p>BETTER is a portion in a wife, than with a wife.</p>
               <p>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour and complacency of temper in a wife, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays of it inviſible.</p>
               <p>THE ſureſt way of governing both a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate family and a kingdom, is, for a huſband
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030567_0126_0FE7D6456C04B8F8"/>
and a prince to yield at certain times ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their prerogative.</p>
               <p>A GOOD wife, ſays Solomon, is a good por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there is nothing of ſo much worth as a mind well inſtructed.</p>
               <p>SWEETNESS of temper, affection to her huſband and attention to his intereſt, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the duties of a wife, and form the baſis of matrimonial felicity. The idea of power on either ſide, ſhould be totally baniſhed. It is not ſufficient, that the huſband ſhould nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have occaſion to regret the want of it; the wife muſt ſo behave, that he may never be conſcious of poſſeſſing it.</p>

               <p>HOW many men of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary parts and merit have died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known? How many are there who ſtill at this time live unknown, and who will never be taken any notice of? Nature produces

merit, virtue carries it to perfection, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gives it the power of acting.</p>
               <p>TRUE merit is not afraid of being effaced by that of others. We judge of the merit of men by the uſefulneſs of their actions, and there are a great many men valued in the world, who have no other merit than vices profitable to commerce and ſociety. The more true merit a man has, the more does he applaud it in others. Real merit gains a man the eſteem of good men, but it is only fate and chance that gains him that of the multitude.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>MEN of mean qualities ſhew but little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to great virtues; a lofty wiſdom offends an ordinary reaſon.</p>
               <p>SUPERIORITY of virtue is the moſt unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable provocation that can be given to a baſe mind. Innocence is too amiable to be beheld without hatred; and it is a ſacred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of merit which the wicked are betrayed into, when they purſue good men with violence. This behaviour viſibly proceeds from a conſciouſneſs in them, that other people's virtues upbraid their own want of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:030567_0129_0FE7D5ED949CB008"/>WE ought not to judge of men's merits by their qualifications, but by the uſe they make of them.</p>
               <p>IT is a thing exceedingly rare to diſtinguiſh virtue and fortune. The moſt impious, if proſperous, are always applauded; the moſt virtuous, if unproſperous, are ſure to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed.</p>
               <p>OUR good qualities often expoſe us to more hatred and perſecution, than all the ill we do.</p>
               <p>THE common people are oft but ill judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a man's merit; they are ſlaves to fame, their eyes are dizzled with the pomp, and titles and large retinue, and then no wonder if they beſtow their honours on thoſe who leaſt deſerve them.</p>

               <p>IN the flouriſhing commonwealth of Greece and Rome, it was either ſome brave action againſt the enemy, or eminent juſtice, virtue or ability, that raiſed one man above anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; wealth had no ſhare in it.</p>
               <p>THE world is a theatre, the beſt actors are thoſe that repreſent their parts moſt natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but the wiſeſt are ſeldom the heroes in the play. It is not to be conſidered (ſays Epic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus)

who is prince, or who is beggar, but who acts the prince or the beggar beſt.</p>
               <p>IT is true greatneſs that conſtitutes glory, and virtue is the cauſe of both. But vice and ignorance taint the blood, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy behaviour degrades and diſennobles the man, more than birth and fortune ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize and exalt him.</p>
               <p>WHAT need has a great man of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign aid to promote the regard that is due to his merit, when a certain air of noble ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and forgetfulneſs of his own gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, will not fail to attract the public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince ſhutting his eyes upon himſelf is an infallible way to open all the world's upon him.</p>
               <p>LEWIS the fourteenth, though a king, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded merit and encouraged literature. Plutarch has a fine expreſſion, with regard to ſome women of learning, humility and virtue—that her ornaments were ſuch as might be purchaſed without money, and would render any woman's life glorious and happy. Adam ſignifies earth, and Eve life, But not to inſiſt upon Hebrew definitions, man was originally made of the dead earth— but woman of the living man—therefore, of a more excellent nature.</p>
               <p>MERIT muſt take a great compaſs to riſe, if not aſſiſted by favour.</p>

               <p>SINCE misfortunes cannot be avoided, let them be generouſly borne. It is not for any ſort of men to expect an exemption from the common lot of mankind; and no perſon is truly great but he that keeps up the ſame dignity of mind in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>IT is a comfort to the miſerable to have companions in this ſad ſtate. This may ſeem to be a kind of malicious ſatisfaction, that one man derives from the misfortunes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; but the philoſophy of this reflection ſtands upon another foundation; for our comfort does not ariſe from others being miſerable, but from this inference upon the balance that we ſuffer only the lot of human nature; and as we are happy or miſerable compared to others, ſo others are miſerable or happy compared to us By which juſtice of providence, we come to be convinced of the ſin, and the miſtake of our ingratitude.</p>
               <p>IN any adverſity that happens to us in the world, we ought to conſider that miſery and affliction are not leſs natural than ſnow and hail, ſtorm and tempeſt, and it were as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to hope for a year without winter,

The tongue that once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the charms of harmony, and all the powers of eloquence, in this ſtrange land, "has forgot its cunning." Where are now thoſe ſtrains of melody, which raviſhed our ears? Where is that flow of perſuation, which carried captive our judgments?

               <head>MODESTY AND IMPUDENCE.</head>
               <p>MODESTY has a natural tendency to conceal a man's talents, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence diſplays them to the utmoſt, and has been the only cauſe why many have riſen in the world, under all the diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of low birth and little merit. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence and incapacity is there in the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality of mankind, that they are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a man for whatever he has a mind to put himſelf off for, and admit his over bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing airs, as proofs of that merit which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to himſelf.</p>
               <p>A DECENT aſſurance ſeems to be the nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural attendant on virtue; and few men can diſtinguiſh impudence from it; as, on the other hand, diffidence being the natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of vice and folly, has drawn diſgrace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on modeſty, which in outward appearance ſo nearly reſembles it.</p>
               <p>AS impudence, though really a vice, has the ſame effect upon a man's fortune, as if it were a virtue, ſo we may obſerve, that it is almoſt as difficult to be obtained, and is, in that reſpect, diſtinguiſhed from all the other vices which are acquired with little pains, and continually increaſe upon indulgence.
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030567_0139_0FE7D5FDA4915018"/>
Many a man being ſenſible that modeſty is exceedingly prejudicial to him in making his fortune, has reſolved to be impudent, and put a bold face upon the matter; but it is obſervable, that ſuch people have ſeldom ſucceeded in their attempts, but have been obliged to relapſe into their primitive mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty. Nothing carries a man through the world, like a true, genuine, natural impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; its counterfeit is good for nothing, nor can ever ſupport itſelf. If any thing can give a modeſt man more aſſurance, it muſt be ſome advantages of fortune which chance procured to him. Riches naturally gain a man a favourable reception in the world, and give merit a double luſtre, when a perſon is endowed with it. It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to obſerve what airs of ſuperiority fools and knaves, with large poſſeſſions, give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, above men of the greateſt merit, in poverty. Nor do the men of merit make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrong oppoſition to thoſe uſurpations, but rather ſeem to favour them by the mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty of their behaviour.</p>
               <p>To make wiſdom agree with imudence, is as difficult as to reconcile vice and modeſty. Theſe are the reflections which have occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon this ſubject of modeſty and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and I hope the reader will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to ſee them wrought into the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allegory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:030567_0140_0FE7D65CEBBE6128"/>JUPITER in the beginning joined Virtue, Wiſdom and Confidence together; and Vice, Folly and Diffidence; and thus connected, ſent them into the world. But though he thought he had matched them with great judgment, and ſaid, that Confidence was the natural companion of Virtue, and that Vice deſerved to be attended with Diffidence, they had not gone far before diſſenſion aroſe among them. Wiſdom, who was the guide of the one company, was always accuſtomed, before ſhe ventured on any road, however beaten, to examine is carefully, to enquire whither it led; what dangers difficulties, or hindrances might poſſibly, or probably occur in it. In theſe deliberations ſhe uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſome time, which delay was very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to Confidence, who was always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to hurry on, without much fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought or deliberation, in the firſt road he met. Wiſdom and Virtue were inſeparable; but Confidence one day following his impet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous nature, advanced a conſiderable way before his guides and companions, and not feeling any want of their company, he never enquired after them, nor ever met with them more. In like manner, the other ſociety, though joined by Jupiter, diſagreed and ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated. As Folly ſaw very little way before her, ſhe had nothing to determine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goodneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> nor could give the preference to one above another, and
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030567_0141_0FE7D6035E442F28"/>
their want of reſolution increaſed by Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who, with her doubts and ſcruples always retarded the journey. This was a great annoyance to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties and delays, and was nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſatisfied without his full career in whatev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his inclinations led him to. Folly, he knew, though ſhe hearkened to Diffidence, would be eaſily managed when alone, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a vicious horſe throws its rider, he openly beat away this controller of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and proceeded on his journey with Folly, from whom he is inſeparable. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Diffidence, being after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both thrown looſe from their reſpective companions, wandered about for ſome time; till at laſt chance led them at the ſame time to the ſame village. Confidence went directly up to the great houſe, which belonged to Wealth, the lord of the village, and without ſtaying for a porter, intruded himſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the innermoſt appartments, where he found Vice and Folly were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him. He joined the train, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himſelf very quickly to his landlord, and entered into ſuch familiarity with Vice, that he was enliſted in the ſame company with Folly. They were frequent gueſts with Wealth, and from that moment inſeparable. Diffidence in the mean time, not daring to approach the great houſe, accepted of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation from one of the tenants, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030567_0142_0FE7D662A99DA020"/>
the cottage found Wiſdom and Virtue, who, being repulſed by the landlord, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired thither.</p>
               <p>VIRTUE took compaſſion on her, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found from her temper, that ſhe would eaſily improve, ſo they admitted her into their ſociety. Accordingly by their means, ſhe altered, in a little time, ſomewhat of her manner; and becoming much more amiable and engaging, was now called by the name of Modeſty.</p>
               <p>As ill company has a greater effect than good. Confidence, though more refractory to counſel and example, degenerated ſo far by the ſociety of Vice and Folly, as to paſs by the name of Impudence.</p>
               <p>MANKIND, who ſaw theſe ſocieties as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter firſt joined them, and knew nothing of thoſe mutual diſſenſions, are thereby led into ſtrange miſtakes, and whenever they ſee Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, make account of Virtue and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and oft when they obſerve Modeſty, call her attendants Vice and Folly.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>A MAN without modeſty, is loſt to all ſenſe of honour and virtue.</p>
               <p>MODESTY is ſure the chief ornament of our ſex, and cannot be blameable in the men;
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030567_0143_0FE7D604E57372B8"/>
it is one of the moſt amiable qualities that either man or woman can poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>THERE ſcarce can be named one quality that is amiable in a woman, which is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in a man, not excepting even modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and gentleneſs of nature.</p>
               <p>THE modeſty of women prevails more than their power, riches or beauty. Mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty in your diſcourſe, will give a luſtre to truth, and an excuſe to your errors.</p>
               <p>IT has been ſaid, that when Jove created the paſſions, he aſſigned to every one of them its deſtined abode; modeſty was forgotten, and when ſhe was introduced to him, he knew not where to place her; ſhe was therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to conſort with all the reſt; ever ſince that time ſhe is inſeparable from them; ſhe is the friend of truth, and betrays the lie that dares attack it; ſhe is in a ſtrict and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate unity with love; ſhe always attends, and frequently diſcovers and proclaims it; love, in a word, loſes its charms, whenever it appears without her. There is not a more glorious ornament for either ſex, than mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of all virtues is innocence, the next is modeſty. If we baniſh modeſty out of the world, ſhe carries away with her half the virtues that are in it.</p>
               <p>MODESTY makes large amends for the pain it gives the perſons who labour under
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030567_0144_0FE7D66433BAE3B0"/>
it, by the prejudice it affords every worthy perſon in its favour.</p>
               <p>AS real modeſty is the beauty of the mind, ſo an affectation of it, as much diſgraces a perfect mind, as art and an affected dreſs do a perfect face.</p>

               <p>SHAKESPEARE, that ſagacious piercer into human nature, writes thus:
<q>

                     <l>The motions of his ſpirits are dull as night,</l>
                     <l>And his affections dark as Erebus:</l>

               <p>MUSIC is one of the ſeven ſciences, and is juſtly admired by all people of a fine taſte, and who love the liberal arts. A man who has no taſte for muſic, is deſtitute of a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we are informed will be of high eſtimation in another ſyſtem. The want of a taſte for muſic, is a ſign of a barbarous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and thoſe who are not affected with its charms, are, in character, ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the beaſts of the field.

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the degeneracy and meanneſs that is crept into human nature, there are a thouſand actions in which it breaks through its original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhews what it once was, and what it will be hereafter.

broken pillars and obeliſks, and a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence in confuſion.

A happy education, converſation with the fineſt ſpirits, looking abroad into the works of nature, and obſervations upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are the greateſt aſſiſtances to this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and glorious work.

               <p>DISCOURSES of religion and morality, and reflections upon human nature are the beſt means we can make uſe of to improve our minds, and gain a true knowledge of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and conſequently to recover our ſouls out of the vice, ignorance and prejudice which naturally cleave to them.</p>
               <p>THERE is nothing which favours and falls in with the natural greatneſs and dignity of human nature, ſo much as religion; which does not only promiſe the entire refinement

               <p>IT is with the mind as with the will and appetites; for, as after we have tried a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and pleaſures, and turned from one enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another, we find no reſt to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, till we at laſt fix them upon the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign good; ſo in purſuit of knowledge, we meet with no tolerable ſatisfaction to our minds, till after we are weary with tracing other methods, we turn them upon the one ſupreme and unerring truth.

               <p>Great qualities make great men. Who, ſays Seneca, is a gentleman? The man whom nature has diſpoſed, and as it were, cut out for virtue.

               <p>THIS one advantage is obſervable in being nobly born, that it makes men ſenſible they are allied to virtue, and lays ſtronger obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations on them not to degenerate from the excellencies of their anceſtors.</p>
               <p>THERE is no nobility like that of a great heart; for it never ſtoops to artifice, nor is wanting in good offices, where they are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
               <p>THERE is a nobility without heraldry.

               <p>TITLE and anceſtry render a good man more illuſtrious, but an ill one more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. Vice is infamous, though in a prince; and virtue honourable, though in a peaſant.</p>

               <p>THE lawful uſe and end of ſwearing, is, to put an end to all ſtrife, and to maintain both equity and charity among men; the two bonds and ligaments of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Now, ſince it is the ſovereign right and property of God alone, infallibly to ſearch and try the hearts of men, he therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the infallible witneſs of the truth or falſhood of what they ſpeak; ſo that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch lawful oath, there is not only a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn appeal, and in that appeal an inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of glory to his ſovereign omniſcience, but therein they put themſelves under his wrath and curſe, in caſe they ſwear falſely, which makes this action moſt ſacred and ſolemn.</p>
               <p>BUT to break in rudely and blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſacred and tremendous name of God, with bold and full mouthed oaths, ſtriking through his ſacred name with direct, contumelious blaſphemies, this argues a heart from which all fear of God is utterly expelled and baniſhed.

They deck (as they account it) their common diſcourſes with oaths, and horrid imprecations, not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them genteel and modiſh without. It conſiſts not with the greatneſs of their ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its to be wicked at the common rate. They are willing to demonſtrate to the world, that they are none of thoſe puny, ſilly fellows that are afraid of inviſible powers, or ſo much of a coward as to clip a full mouthed oath, by ſuppreſſing, or whiſpering the emphatical ſounding ſyllable, but think a horrid blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy makes the moſt ſweet and graceful cadency in the helliſh rhetorick. If there be a God, which they ſcarce believe, they are reſolved audaciouſly to provoke him, to give them a convincing evidence of his Being. And if he be, as they are told he is, rich in patience and forbearance, they are reſolved to try how far his patience will extend, and what load of wickedneſs it is capable to bear. If therefore deſtruction be not ſure enough, they will do their utmoſt to make it ſo, by treading down the only bridge where they can eſcape it, that is, by trampling under their feet the precious blood and wounds of the Son of God, and imprecating the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of hell upon their ſouls, as if it ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered

               <p>COMMON ſwearing argues in a man, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſtruſt of his own reputation, and is an acknowledgment that he thinks his bare word not worthy of credit.</p>

Deteſtable practice! Can ſuch perſons call themſelves men? No! their actions are too evident a proof of the brutal, inſtead of the rational mind.

               <p>THERE is a politeneſs of the heart which is confined to no rank, and dependant upon no education; the deſire of obliging ſeldom fails, (if joined with delicacy of ſentiment to pleaſe) though the ſtile may differ from that of modern refinement.</p>

                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:030567_0164_0FE7D689A0601218"/>TRUE politeneſs is a ſcience not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in ſchools.

               <p>MERIT and good breeding will make their way every where. Knowledge will introduce you, and good breeding will endear you to the beſt of companies; for, politeneſs and good breeding are abſolutely neceſſary to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn any, or all other good qualities or tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. Without them no knowledge, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection whatever, is ſeen in its beſt light. The ſcholar, without good breeding, is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; the philoſopher a cynic; the ſoldier a brute; and every one diſagreeable. If a man accoſts you, and talks to you ever ſo dully or frivolouſly, it is worſe than rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is brutality, to ſhew him, by a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt inattention to what he ſays, that you think him a fool, or a blockhead, and not

worth hearing. It is much more ſo with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to women, who, of whatever rank they are, are entitled, in conſideration of their ſex, not only to an attention, but an officious good breeding from men. The moſt familiar hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itudes, connexions, and friendſhips, require a degree of good breeding elſe their intimacy will ſoon degenerate into a coarſe familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, infallibly productive of contempt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</p>
               <p>POLITENESS and modeſty are becoming in all men, but eſpecially in thoſe whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has raiſed above others.</p>
               <p>GOOD breeding is the reſult of much good ſenſe, ſome good nature, and a little ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial for the ſake of others, and with a view to obtain the ſame indulgence from them. Good manners are, to particular ſocieties, what good morals are to ſociety in general, their cement and their ſecurity.</p>
               <p>WORLDLY politeneſs is no more than an imitation, or imperfect copy of Chriſtian charity, being the pretence or outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of that deference to the judgment, and attention to the intereſts of others; which a true Chriſtian has as the rule of his life, and the diſpoſition of his heart.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER ſphere a man has been bred in, or attained to, religion is not an injury, but an addition to the politeneſs of his carriage. They ſeem indeed to confeſs their relation to one another, by their reciprocal influence. In quick

promiſcuous converſation, as true religion contributes to make men decent or courteous, ſo true politeneſs guards them effectually from any outrage againſt piety or purity.</p>
               <p>TO be perfectly polite, one muſt have a great preſence of mind, with a delicate and quick ſenſe of propriety, or, in other words, one ſhould be able to form an inſtantaneous judgment of what is fitteſt to be done, on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion as it offers. I have known one or two perſons, who ſeemed to owe this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to nature only, and to have the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar happineſs of being born, as it were, with another ſenſe, by which they had an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate perception of what was proper and improper, in caſes abſolutely new to them; but this is the lot of very few. It muſt every where be good breeding, to ſet your compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions in an advantageous point of light, by giving each an opportunity of diſplaying their moſt agreeable talents, and by carefully avoiding all occaſions of expoſing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;—to exert your own endeavours to pleaſe, and to amuſe, but not to outſhine them:—To give each their due ſhare of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and notice:—Not engroſſing the talk, when others are deſirous to ſpeak, nor ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the converſation to flag, for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing ſomething to continue or renew the ſubject.

               <p>IN ſeeking virtue, if you find poverty, be not aſhamed, the fault is not yours. Your honour or diſhonour is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by your own actions; though virtue gives a ragged livery, ſhe gives a golden cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance.

               </lg>
               <p>POVERTY falls heavy upon him only, who eſteems it a misfortune.</p>
               <p>It is more honourable not to have and yet deſerve, than to have and not deſerve.</p>
               <p>THE little value Providence ſets upon riches, is ſeen by the perſons on whom it is beſtowed. Though want is the ſcorn of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wealthy fool, an innocent poverty is yet preferable to all the guilty affluence the world can offer.</p>
               <p>THERE is no contending with neceſſity; and we ſhould be very tender how we cenſure thoſe that ſubmit to it. It is one thing to be at liberty to do as we will, and another thing to be tied up to do what we muſt.</p>
               <p>OF all poverty, that of the mind is the moſt deplorable.</p>
               <p>IT is in every body's obſervation with what diſadvantage a poor man enters upon the moſt ordinary buſineſs; for as certainly as wealth gives grace and acceptance to all that its poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor ſays or does, ſo poverty creates diſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, ſcorn and prejudice to all the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of the indigent. The neceſſitous man has neither hands, lips, nor underſtanding
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:030567_0169_0FE7D6EEB71C13F8"/>
for his own, or his friend's uſe; but is in the ſame condition with the ſick, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only, that his is an infection no man will relieve, or aſſiſt; or if he does, 'tis ſeldom with as much pity as contempt, and rather for the oſtentation of the phyſician, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the patient: It is a circumſtance, wherein a man finds all the good he deſerves inacceſſible, all the ill unavoidable; under theſe preſſures, the poor man ſpeaks with heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation, undertakes with irreſolution, and acts with diſappointment; he is ſlighted in men's converſations, overlooked in their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, &amp;c. But from whence, alas! has he this treatment? From a creature that has only the ſupport of, but not an exemption from, the wants, for which he deſpiſes him; for ſuch is the unaccountable inſolence of man, he will not ſee, that he who is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is in the ſame claſs of natural neceſſity, as he that wants a ſupport; and to be helped implies to be indigent.</p>
               <p>A MAN is not judged by the internal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of his mind, but by the extent of his houſe. One who has been in buſineſs, and has not gained riches, is ſaid to have done poorly, notwithſtanding his mind may be formed by the beſt of principles, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions guided by the higheſt rules of Chriſtian benevolence; which perhaps was the only cauſe of his not thriving in temporary wealth in an equal degree with ſome of his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries.

While ſome who live as "without God in the world," thoughtleſs of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern but accumulating wealth, are eſteemed of the firſt rank in the community, and the moſt able members of ſociety. So much is the truth of that ſaying verified, that "Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney commands all things."</p>
               <p>AMIDST the miſeries to which human life is liable, nothing is ſo generally dreaded as poverty; ſince it expoſes mankind to diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are but little pitied, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of thoſe who have no natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuperiour to our own. Every other difficulty or danger, a man is enabled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with courage and alacrity, becauſe he knows that his ſucceſs will meet with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, for bravery will always find its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers; but in poverty every virtue is obſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no conduct can entirely ſecure a man from reproach. Cheerfulneſs, (as an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble author obſerves) is here inſenſibility, and dejection, ſullenneſs; its hardſhips are without honour, and its labours without reward. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, there is no ſtation more favourable to the growth of virtue, where the ſeeds of it are previouſly ſown in the mind.</p>
               <p>But when poverty is felt in the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, it then becomes exceſſively dangerous, and ſome deviations from rectitude, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps impoſſible to be avoided.</p>
               <p>VICE is covered by wealth, and virtue by poverty.</p>

               <p>A CONSCIOUSNESS of the rectitude of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, tells us, though we are unfortunate, it is not becauſe we are more undeſerving than others; nor is our native pride depreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſenſe of our poverty. We can ſee, in idea, Cincinnatus, the great dictator, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring on his hearth the homely repaſt, with thoſe hands that had ſubdued the enemies of his country, and borne the triumphal laurel; reflect that Socrates, the reformer, and Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Agrippa, the arbiter of his country, had been, the one maintained, and the other buried by contribution. And the great Scipio Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanus had been ſo poor, that the portions of his daughters were paid by the public: Who then would repine at adoption into a family that has been honoured by ſuch illuſtrious anceſtors!</p>

               <head>PRAISE.</head>

of bad men, when we have not a true title to it; yet it is not to be eſteemed diſagreeable, or undiſcreditable when beſtowed upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions where it is really due, and by thoſe who are really judges of virtue. Praiſe is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of noble actions: What is more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating to our commanders both by ſea and land, than the aſſurance of their country's applauſe, for their heroic behaviour. Praiſe is only to be given when truly merited, and then not in the preſence of the party to whom it is due. When Telemachus repaired to the aſſembly of the confederate kings, after the death of Adraſtus, and the Daunians deſired peace, we are told, that as ſoon as they eſpied him, they were all huſhed in expectation to hear him diſcourſe; this made him bluſh, and he could not be prevailed upon to ſpeak. The praiſes that were given him by public acclamations, on account of his late action, added to his baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſo, that he would gladly have hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. At length, he deſired as a favour, that they would deſiſt from commending him: Not but that I am a lover of praiſe, ſaid he, eſpecially when it comes from ſuch good judges of virtue; but, I am afraid of loving it too much. Praiſes are apt to corrupt men; they fill them full of themſelves, and render them vain and preſumptuous; we ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to merit and decline them; there is a great likeneſs between the juſteſt and the falſeſt

praiſes. Juſt praiſes are ſuch as you will give me in my abſence, if I am ſo happy as to deſerve them. If you believe me to be really good, you ought alſo to believe that I am willing to be modeſt, and would fear vanity; ſpare me, therefore, if you have any eſteem for me, and do not praiſe me as if I were a man fond of ſuch things. A man ought to bluſh, when he is praiſed for perfections he does not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. Be careful how you receive praiſe; from good men neither avoid it nor glory in it; from bad men neither deſire nor expect it. To be praiſed of them that are evil, or for that which is evil, is equal diſhonour; he is happy in his merit, who is praiſed by the good, and emulated by the bad.</p>

               <p>THE underſtanding is by nothing more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily vanquiſhed than the artillery of praiſe, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if accompanied with the ideas of truth and gravity: It makes its way to the heart, without oppoſition; and the ſenſe and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

               <p>PRAISE from the common people is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally falſe, and rather follows vain perſons than virtuous.</p>
               <p>LET us conſtantly follow reaſon, ſays Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne, and let the public approbation follow us the ſame way, if it pleaſes.</p>

               <head>PRAYER.</head>
               <p>PRAYER unaccompanied with a fervent love of God, is like a lamp unlighted; the words of the one without love being as unprofitable, as the oil and cotton of the other without flame. "Our wants" ſays the late Biſhop of London (Dr. Gibſon) "are daily, and the temptations which draw our hearts from God, to the things of this world are daily, and upon both theſe accounts our prayers ought alſo to be daily."</p>
               <p>THE ſaid doctor gives the following ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</p>
               <p>"OUR morning prayers will always moſt properly begin with thankſgivings to almighty God, our Creator and Preſerver. In the next place a ſolemn dedication of ourſelves to his ſervice. This followed by petitions, viz. for his grace and aſſiſtance to ourſelves—for the like in behalf of others.</p>
               <p>The evening prayers to begin in the ſame order, only a confeſſion of ſins at the end of the day, and petition muſt ſtand in the place of morning dedication—and the concluſion ſhould be with a petition for reſt and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inſtead of that for a bleſſing on our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030567_0176_0FE7D6A5766A2148"/>
—For the Sabbath, the great day of reſt, &amp;c." Let your prayers be ever ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the form and expreſſion, or let your heart accompany them with a devotion ever ſo intenſe, ſtill be very careful to avoid the dangerous error of imagining that any merit ariſes from the moſt perfect performance of them. They become acceptable to God through Chriſt alone; and are the means, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to make you good; but the goodneſs itſelf is not in them, no more than a favour among men can be ſaid to be deſerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe aſked with humility, propriety and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egance. If therefore you were to truſt merely in them, 'twould be making idols of your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;—it would be putting them in the place of CHRIST'S atonement, which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to praying, (as an unworthy ſinner) in the name of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>IF we have not recourſe to God with the mind and thoughts that we ought, it looks as if we expected nothing from him; or rather, (ſeeing our remiſſneſs and indolence) it may be ſaid, that we do not deſerve to obtain—that we do not value the things that we ſeem to aſk. Yet, God would have what is aſked of him, aſked with earneſtneſs; and far from taking our importunity ill, he is in ſome manner well pleaſed with it. For, in fine, He is the only debtor who thinks himſelf obliged for the demands that are made upon him. He is the only one that pays what we never lent him.
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:030567_0177_0FE7D6FD5FF49A60"/>
The more he ſees us preſs him, the more liberal he is. He even gives that he does not owe. If we coldly aſk, he defers his liberalities; not becauſe he does not love to give, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would be preſſed, and becauſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is agreeable to him.</p>
               <p>TERTULLIAN ſays ſomething like this, of the prayers that the primitive chiſtians made in common. We meet together, ſays he, as if we conſpired to take by our prayers what we aſk of him; this violence is pleaſing to him. St. Paul ingeniouſly explains what Chriſt teaches in the Goſpel, that heaven is taken by violence; "do violence to God," ſays he, ſeize the kingdom of heaven. He that forbids us to touch another's goods rejoices to have his own invaded: He that condemns the violence of avarice, praiſes that of faith.</p>
               <p>AS the bones of the human frame connected together, form the ſkeleton of a man, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, faith, hope, charity, love, zeal, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, patience, reſignation, hatred of ſin, purity of heart and holineſs of life, all united together, make a Chriſtian; but muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with prayer, the breath of the new creature, or they will prove like dead corps, lifeleſs and inactive.</p>
               <p>GOING to prayer with bad affections, is like paying one's levee in an undreſs.</p>
               <p>ALL prayer muſt be made with faith and hope: He who would pray with effect, muſt live with care and piety: Our prayers muſt
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030567_0178_0FE7D6A703743378"/>
be fervent, intenſe, earneſt and importunate. Our deſires muſt be laſting, and our prayers frequent and continual. God hears us not the ſooner for our many words, but much the ſooner for our earneſt deſire. A long prayer and a ſhort differ not in their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of being accepted; for both of them take their value, according to the fervency of ſpirit, and the charity of the prayer. That prayer which is ſhort, by reaſon of an impatient ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, dullneſs, ſlight of holy things, or indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of deſires, is very often criminal, always imperfect; and that prayer which is long out of oſtentation, ſuperſtition, or a trifling ſpirit, is as criminal and imperfect, as the other in their ſeveral inſtances.</p>
               <p>WE muſt be careful in all our prayers to attend our preſent work, having a preſent mind, not wandering upon impertinent things, nor diſtant from our words, much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them.</p>
               <p>OFTEN pray, and you ſhall pray oftener; and when you are accuſtomed to frequent devotion, it will ſo inſenſibly unite to your nature and affections, that it will become a trouble to you to omit your uſual or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prayers; and what you obtain at firſt by doing violence to your inclinations, at laſt will be left with as much uneaſineſs, as that by which at firſt it entered.</p>

When we come to have our minds cleared by reaſon from thoſe thick miſts that our diſorderly paſſions throw about them; when we come to diſcern more perfectly, and conſider more nearly the immenſe power and goodneſs, the infinite glory and duration of God; and to make a compariſon between theſe perfections of his, and our own frailty and weakneſs, and the ſhortneſs and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our beings, we ſhould humble ourſelves even into the very duſt before him.—Titles, riches and fine houſes, ſignify no more to the making of one man better than another, than the finer ſaddle, to the making of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter horſe. And it truly ſhews a poor ſpirit, for one man to take theſe paltry advantages of another; it muſt be intrinſic worth in any creature, that muſt give it the preference to another. If he is ambitious to excel his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, let it be in ſomething that belongs to himſelf, ſomething that demonſtrates him to be a better creature. Let him contend in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which alone is capable to put a great difference between man and man; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gains the advantage there, has reaſon to value it, though it will never make him proud.</p>

               <p>READING is to the mind what exerciſe is to the body; as by one, health is preſerved, ſtrengthened and invigorated: by the other, virtue, (which is the health of the mind) is kept alive, cheriſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. There are perſons who ſeldom take a book in their hand, but to diſcover the faults it may, in their opinion, contain; and the merit of the work is the leaſt of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; they can paſs over many fine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and rhetorical expreſſions, without the leaſt regard, but to whatever they think obſcure, abſurd, or impertinent, they are ſure to afford no quarter: Many perfections can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not atone for a few imperfections with them, they muſt have a perfect piece or none; ſuch perſons ought not to read at all, they are not fit to judge of what they do read. For every man of ſenſe and candour, who reads in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reap the benefit of reading, will give merit its due, wherever he finds it, and be cautious how he commends. When I meet with a great many beauties in a piece, I am not offended with a few faults, which might have eſcaped the author through inadvertency,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030567_0186_0FE7D6B5A21674A8"/>
or which the impotence of human nature could not ſo well provide againſt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, too, what is very clear in a book, ſeems to us obſcure, for want of reading it with ſufficient attention.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould not read a book on purpoſe to find its faults; but, purely to underſtand it.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whoever thinks a faultleſs piece to ſee,</l>
                  <l>Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er ſhall be;</l>
                  <l>In every work regard the writer's end,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>OF all the diverſions of life, there is none ſo proper to fill up its empty ſpaces, as the reading of uſeful and entertaining authors; and with that, the converſation of a well choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en friend.</p>
               <p>BY reading we enjoy the dead, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation the living, and by contemplation our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Reading enriches the memory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation poliſhes the wit, and contemplation improves the judgment. Of theſe, reading is the moſt important, which furniſhes both the other.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be allowed, that ſlow reading is the quickeſt and ſureſt way to knowledge. A frequent peruſal of a few well-choſen books, will tend more to the improvement of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, than a multifarious reading of all the ſuperficial writers, who have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to acquire literary fame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:030567_0187_0FE7D70DE0FA3708"/>IF we would perpetuate our fame or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we muſt do things worth writing, or write things worth reading.</p>
               <p>I THINK perſons may as well be aſleep —for they can be only ſaid to dream—who read any thing, but with a view of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their morals, or regulating their conduct. Nothing, in this life, after health and virtue, is more eſtimable than knowledge—nor is there any thing ſo eaſily attained, or ſo cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſed—the labour, only ſitting ſtill, and the expenſe, but time, which if we do not ſpend we cannot ſave.—In the world, you are ſubject to every fool's humour.—In a library, you can make every wit ſubject to yours.</p>
               <p>MANY great readers load their memories, without exerciſing their judgments; and make lumber rooms of their heads, inſtead of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them uſefully.</p>

               <head>RELIGION.</head>
               <p>RELIGION is a thing much talked of, but little underſtood; much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, but very little practiſed; and the reaſon why it is ſo ill practiſed, is, becauſe it is ſo little underſtood; knowledge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt precede religion, ſince it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be wiſe, in order to be virtuous, it muſt be known to whom, and upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count duty is owing, otherwiſe it never can be
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030567_0189_0FE7D71592721B60"/>
rightly paid. It muſt therefore be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, that God is the object of all religion, and that the ſoul is the ſubject wherein it exiſts and reſides. From the ſoul it muſt proceed, and to God it muſt be directed, as to that Almighty Being whoſe power alone could create a rational ſoul, and whoſe goodneſs only could move him to make it capable of an eternal felicity, which infinite bounty of God has laid a perpetual obligation upon the ſoul to a conſtant love, obedience and adoration of him, and to an undoubted aſſurance, that the ſame power and goodneſs that created man, will forever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him and protect him, if he perſeveres in the ſincere performance of his duty. The body can have no other ſhare in religion, than by its geſtures to repreſent and diſcover the bent and inclination of the mind, which rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentations alſo are but too often falſe and treacherous, deluding thoſe that behold them, into the opinion of a ſaint, but truly diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering a notorious hypocrite to God, who ſees how diſtant his intentions are from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. People are as much deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they deceive others, who think to uſe religion as they do their beſt clothes, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wear it to church and on ſundays, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear fine, and make a ſhew, and with them, as ſoon as they come home again, lay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide carefully, for fear of wearing it out: That religion is good for nothing that is
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030567_0190_0FE7D6BCF0045FA8"/>
made of ſo ſlight a ſtuff, as will not endure wearing, which ought to be as conſtant a covering for the ſoul, as the ſkin is to the body, not to be divided from it; diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ruin of both. Nor muſt it be thought that religion conſiſts only in bending the knees, which is a ſitting poſture of humility; but in the fervent and humble adoration of the ſoul. Nor in the lifting up of the hands and eyes, but in the warmth of the affections. Outward geſtures and decent behaviour are things very fit and reaſonable, being all that the body can pay; but it is inward ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alone that can render them both accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Much leſs does religion conſiſt in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal looks and ſour faces, which only ſhew that it is very unpalatable to thoſe who make them; and it ſeems as if they were ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething that went grievouſly againſt their ſtomachs. It is likewiſe to be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, the frequency and fervency of prayers gives it acceptance, not the length of them. That one prayer rightly addreſſed to God from a well diſpoſed mind, is more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than ten ſermons careleſsly heard, and more careleſsly practiſed. But hearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a much eaſier duty than praying, becauſe it can often change into ſleeping, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preferred to it, by a great many people. But if, in the end, their profound ignorance will not excuſe them, I am ſure their ſtupid obſtinacy never will. But there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030567_0191_0FE7D7140C4F0040"/>
virtues required in order to praying right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that people think, perhaps, that it would take up too much time and pains to acquire them. And they are much in the right, if they think their prayers will be inſignificant without them, and that an ill man can never pray well, and to purpoſe, for the ſtream will always partake of the fountain. And if the mind, which is the fountain of all our addreſſes to God, be vicious and impure, the prayers, which proceed from it, muſt needs be ſullied with the ſame pollutions. But, on the contrary, if the mind be once made vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, all that proceeds from it will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and accepted. And as to dejected looks and a ſorrowful countenance, they are no wiſe graceful in religion, which is ſo far from being a melancholy thing, that it can never appear diſpleaſing, or tireſome to a mind where wiſdom and virtue do not firſt ſeem troubleſome; for wiſdom, inſtructing the ſoul to act reaſonably, inſtructs it likewiſe to ſerve and obey God readily and chearfully; for that which appears reaſonable to a wiſe man, will always appear delightful; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is that very ſame reaſon and wiſdom, whoſe ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all whoſe paths are peace.</p>
               <p>WERE men ſenſible of the happineſs that reſults from true religion, the voluptuous man would there ſeek his pleaſure, the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etous

man his wealth, and the ambitious man his glory.</p>
               <p>MEN who are deſtitute of religion are ſo far from being learned philoſophers, that they ought not to be eſteemed ſo much as reaſonable men.</p>
               <p>RELIGION is ſo far from debarring men of any innocent pleaſure or comfort of human life, that it purifies the pleaſures of it, and renders them more grateful and generous. And, beſides this, it brings mighty pleaſures of its own, thoſe of a glorious hope, a ſerene mind, a calm and undiſturbed conſcience, which do far outreliſh the moſt ſtudied and artificial luxuries.</p>
               <p>NEITHER human wiſdom, nor human vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue —unſupported by religion, are equal to the trying ſituations that often occur in life.</p>
               <p>As little appearance as there is of religion in the world, there is a great deal of its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence felt in its affairs—nor can any who have been religiouſly educated, ſo root out the principles of it, but, like nature, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, and give checks and interruptions to guilty purſuits.—There can be no real happineſs without religion and virtue, and the aſſiſtance of God's grace and Holy Spirit to direct our lives, in the true purſuit of it. Happineſs, I contend, is only to be found in religion—in the conſciouſneſs of virtue—and a ſure and certain hope of a better life, which brightens all our proſpects, and leaves no
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030567_0193_0FE7D71B5A6055A8"/>
room to dread diſappointments—becauſe the expectations of it are built upon a rock, whoſe foundations are as deep as thoſe of heaven or hell.—So ſtrange and unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a creature is man! he is ſo framed, that he cannot but purſue happineſs—and yet, unleſs he is made ſometimes miſerable, how apt is he to miſtake the way, which can only lead him to the accompliſhments of all his wiſhes.—What pity it is that the ſacred name of religion ſhould ever have been borrowed and employed in ſo bad a work, as in cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over pride—ſpiritual pride, the worſt of all pride—hypocriſy, ſelf love, covetouſneſs, extortion, cruelty and revenge—or that the fair form of virtue ſhould have been thus diſguiſed, and forever drawn into ſuſpicion, from the unworthy uſes of this kind, to which the artful and abandoned have often put her. —Some people paſs through life, ſoberly and religiouſly enough, without knowing why, or reaſoning about it—but from force of habit merely.—Again, ſome think it ſufficient to be good Chriſtians, without being good men— to ſpend their lives in—drinking, cheating —and praying.</p>
               <p>TRUE religion gives an habitual ſweetneſs and complacency, which produces genuine politeneſs, without injury to ſincerity; it preſerves the mind from every unfair bias, and inclines it to temper juſtice with mercy in all its judgments upon others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="unknown:030567_0194_0FE7D6C449F46E70"/>RELIGION is the beſt armour in the world, but the worſt cloak.</p>
               <p>DIVINE meditations do not only in power ſubdue all ſenſual pleaſures, but far exceed them in ſweetneſs and delight.</p>
               <p>To be furious in religion is to be irrelig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly religious. Perſecution can be no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to perſuade, nor violence the way to converſion.</p>
               <p>WERE angels, if they look into the ways of men, to give in their catalogue of worthies, how different would it be from that which any of our own ſpecies would draw up?

They, on the contrary, ſee the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in the cottage, who poſſeſſes a ſoul in thankfulneſs, under the preſſure of what little minds call poverty and diſtreſs. The evening's walk of a wiſe man is more illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious in their ſight, than the march of a general, at the head of a hundred thouſand men. A contemplation of God's works, a generous concern for the good of mankind, and unfeigned exerciſe of humility only— denominates men great and glorious.</p>
               <p>WHAT can be more ſuitable to a rational creature, than to employ reaſon to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate that divine Being, which is both the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of its reaſon, and nobleſt object about which it can poſſibly be employed.</p>

                  <pb n="195" facs="unknown:030567_0195_0FE7D71CE46CA560"/>ALL our wiſdom and happineſs conſiſt ſummarily in the knowledge of God and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To know, and to do, is the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of our duty.</p>

               <p>TRUE repentance is that ſaving grace wrought in the ſoul, by the ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of God, whereby a ſinner is made to ſee, and be ſenſible of his ſin, is grieved and humbled before God on account of it, not ſo much for the puniſhment to which ſin has made him liable, as that thereby God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured and offended, his laws violated, and their own ſoul polluted and defiled: And this grief ariſes from love to God, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a hatred of ſin, a fixed reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to forſake it, and expectation of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and forgiveneſs through the merits of CHRIST; this is evangelical repentance.

And to whom is it pleaſing? To the moſt vile and perſidious, the talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But what is its ſource? From what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igin does it proceed? From falſehood for its father, and envy for its mother, and from curioſity for its nurſe.</p>
               <p>NOR is calumny itſelf without an offspring; for it not only begets ſtrife and contention, hatred and malice, bloodſhed and murder; but nouriſhes other deſtructive evils. And now let us enquire, what is the antidote to this diſeaſe? Innocence and patience. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence enables us to bear it, and patience blunts its edge.—When you hear any one ill ſpoken of in your company, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but too often, mingle not the poiſon of your malignant reflections, nor bid higher than the reſt in the auction of ſlander, much leſs be the meſſenger of ſuch abuſes to the perſon concerned.</p>

artful hands, it is done by ſo ſubtile and nice an infuſion, that it is not to be taſted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered but by its effects. How frequently is the honeſty and integrity of a man diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, by a ſmile or ſhrug.—How many good, generous actions have been ſunk in oblivion, by a diſtruſtful look—or ſtamped with the imputation of proceeding from bad motives, by a myſterious and ſeaſonable whiſper. Look into the companies of thoſe whoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle natures ſhould diſarm them, we ſhall find little better account.—How large a portion of chaſtity is ſent out of the world by diſtant hints—nodded away, and cruelly winked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuſpicion, by envy. How often does the reputation of a helpleſs creature, bleed from report—which the party who is at the pains to propagate it—hopes in God it is not true, but in the mean time is reſolved to give the report her paſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome wounds given to reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that are like the wounds of an enven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omed arrow; where we irritate and enlarge the orifice while we extract the bearded weapon; yet cannot the cure be completed otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>WHEN a man of diſtinguiſhed worth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers unmerited calumny, it often has the ſame effect as an eclipſe of the ſun, which ſerves only to make it admired the more.

<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030567_0215_0FE7D7591F2EF8A0"/>
by ſome ſudden and unexpected dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it attracts our attention, and emerges with an unuſual and ſuperior eclat.</p>
               <p>IN this age, in ſome companies, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing, when you have done with public affairs, and public diverſions, but private anecdotes—pulling down, or gently undermining characters, ſitting in judgment upon thoſe tranſactions, which, though of a private nature, are, by the newly eſtabliſhed cuſtom of the times, laid before the public— or producing freſh accounts of them from private hands. I hardly ever hear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of this kind carried on for half an hour, without ſome flagrant inſtance of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and injuſtice. It is amazing to obſerve the courage with which, upon mere common report, facts are repeated, which tend to the utter ruin of a character, and even motives confidently aſſigned, which, it was impoſſible ſhould be known.</p>
               <p>THE heavieſt misfortune will not ſhelter you from cenſure, when the converſation takes this turn. If you have loſt your dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friend, we pity you indeed; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help obſerving, either that you have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little feeling, and do not grieve enough, or that you are highly blameable in feeling too much, and grieving too violently; or elſe, that there is ſomething very ridiculous in your manner of ſhewing your griefs, or in ſome circumſtance of your behaviour under it. If
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030567_0216_0FE7D72C210F41C0"/>
you are ſtripped of your whole fortune, it is a terrible thing to be ſure, but it cannot be diſſembled, that your own imprudence was in a great meaſure the cauſe of it.</p>

               <p>THE beſt diſpoſitions have uſually the moſt ſenſibility.

It is not an unreaſonable and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſelf love, but a regard to that, without which, a feeling mind cannot be happy, which renders many of us attentive to every word which is whiſpered of us in our abſence.</p>
               <p>No virtue, no prudence, no caution, no generoſity can preſerve us from miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Our conduct muſt be miſunderſtood by weak intellects, and by thoſe who only ſee a part of it, and haſtily form a judgment

of the whole. Every man of eminence has thoſe in his vicinity who hate, who envy, and who affect to deſpiſe him. Theſe will ſee his actions with a jaundiced eye, and will repreſent them to others in the colours in which they themſelves behold them.</p>
               <p>LET the weak and ill natured enjoy the poor pleaſure of whiſpering calumny and detraction, and let the man of ſenſe diſplay the wiſdom and dignity of diſregarding them.

the precious liquor contained in it; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is but the cabinet; the ſoul is the jewel; the body is but the dwelling; the ſoul the inhabitant; the body is but the lanthorn; the ſoul or ſpirit, the candle of the Lord, that burns in it. And ſeeing there is ſuch differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the ſoul and the body in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of excellency, ſure our better part chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges our greater care and diligence, to make proviſion for it. Bodily proviſion is but half proviſion; it is but one part, and that the meaner and more ignoble too, if we conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only the time of this life: But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a future ſtate of endleſs duration after this life, then bodily proviſion will appear to be but no proviſion at all, in compariſon, there being no proportion between ſo ſhort a period of time, and the infinite ages of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Our great partiality towards our bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, and neglect of our ſouls, ſhews clearly what part we prefer; we are careful enough in not wounding or maiming our bodies; but we make bold to laſh and wound our ſouls daily. We are induſtrious enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our bodies from ſlavery, &amp;c. but we make nothing of ſuffering our ſouls to be ſlaves and drudges to luſt, and to live in the vileſt bondage to the moſt degenerate of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the devil.</p>
               <p>WE arm and defend our bodies, and our ſouls have as much need of armour as they, for the life of a Chriſtian is a continual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,

and we have potent and vigilant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to encounter withal, the devil, the world, and this corrupt fleſh we carry about with us. We had need, therefore, to put on the whole armour of God that we may be able to ſtand in the evil day, and having done all may ſtand, having ourſelves girt with truth, and having the breaſtplate of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs; above all, taking the ſhield of faith, and for a helmet, the hope of ſalvation, and the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God.—Epheſians, vi. 13, 14.</p>

                  <pb n="224" facs="unknown:030567_0224_0FE7D78B6A3B5B08"/>A WISE man counts his minutes: He lets no time ſlip, for time is life; which he makes long, by the good huſbandry of a right uſe and application of it.</p>
               <p>MAKE the moſt of your minutes, ſays Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius, and be good for ſomething while you can.</p>
               <p>KNOW the true value of time; ſnatch, ſeize and enjoy every moment of it. No idleneſs, no lazineſs, no procraſtination; never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould read over our lives as well as books, take a ſurvey of our actions, and make an inſpection into the diviſion of our time. King Alfred (that truly great and wiſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch) is recorded to have divided the day and night into three parts: Eight hours he allotted to eat and ſleep in, eight for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and recreation, and eight he dedicated to ſtudy and prayer.</p>
               <p>TO come but once into the world, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle away our right uſe of it, making that a burthen which was given for a bleſſing, is ſtrange infatuation.</p>
               <p>TIME is what we want moſt, but what we uſe worſt; for which we muſt all account, when time ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>THERE is but little need to drive away that time by fooliſh divertiſements, which flies away ſo ſwiftly of itſelf, and when once gone, can never be recalled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="unknown:030567_0225_0FE7D76DD9FFEDF8"/>AN idle perſon is a kind of monſter in the creation; all nature is buſy about him. How wretched is it to hear people complain, that the day hangs heavy upon them, that they do not know what to do with themſelves. How monſtrous are ſuch expreſſions among creatures, who can apply themſelves to the duties of religion and meditation; to the reading of uſeful books; who may exerciſe themſelves in the purſuits of knowledge and virtue, and every hour of their lives, make themſelves wiſer and better.</p>
               <p>SHOULD the greateſt part of people ſit down, and draw a particular account of their time, what a ſhameful bill would it be? So much extraordinary for eating, drinking and ſleeping, beyond what nature requires; ſo much in revelling and wantonneſs; ſo much for the recovery of laſt night's intemperance; ſo much for gaming, plays and maſquerades; ſo much in paying and receiving formal and impertinent viſits, in idle and fooliſh prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in cenſuring and reviling our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; ſo much in dreſſing, and talking of faſhions; and ſo much loſt and waſted in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing.</p>
               <p>THERE is no man but hath a ſoul, and, if he will look carefully to that, he need not complain for want of buſineſs. Where there are ſo many corruptions to mortify, ſo many inclinations to watch over, ſo many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to reſiſt, the graces of God to improve,
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030567_0226_0FE7D73B557EDA78"/>
and former neglects of all theſe to lament, ſure he can never want ſufficient employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For all theſe require time, and ſo men at their deaths find; for thoſe who have lived careleſsly, and waſted their time, would then give them all to redeem it.</p>
               <p>THIS was a memorable practice of Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian, through the whole courſe of his life; he called himſelf to an account every night for the actions of the paſt day, and ſo often as he found he had ſkipped any one day without doing ſome good, he entered upon his diary this memorial, <hi>"I have loſt a day."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF time, like money, could be laid by, while one was not uſing it—there might be ſome excuſe for the idleneſs of half the world —but yet not a full one; for even this would be ſuch an economy, as the living on a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſum, without making it purchaſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</p>
               <p>TIME is one of the moſt precious jewels which we poſſeſs; but its true value is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom known till it is near a cloſe, and when it is not in our power to redeem it. The right improvement of time is of the greateſt conſequence to mankind. The preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is only ours. The preſent moment calls for diſpatch; and, if neglected, it is a great chance if ever we get another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Today we live, tomorrow we may die. Beſide, we have a great work to do, and an appointed time in which it muſt be done.

The uncertainty of this time adds much to its brevity; the velocity of it urges its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement the more. SENECA obſerves, We all complain of the ſhortneſs of time, but ſpend it in ſuch a manner, as if we had too much.</p>
               <p>THE time we live ought not to be comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by the number of years, but by the uſe which has been made of it: It is not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ground, but the yearly rent which gives the value to the eſtate. Wretched and thoughtleſs creatures! in the only place where covetouſneſs were a virtue, we turn prodigals! nothing lies upon our hands with ſuch uneaſineſs, nor has there been ſo many devices for any one thing, as to make time glide away imperceptibly and to no purpoſe. A ſhilling ſhall be hoarded up with care whilſt that which is above the price of an eſtate, is flung away with diſregard and contempt.</p>
