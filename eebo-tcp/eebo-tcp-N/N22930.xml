            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH Great Britain cannot vaunt of being an early Stoop to the ſpirit of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but in that reſpect muſt give place to the Dutch, yet it may with truth be aſſerted that ſhe has ſince far ſurpaſſed them, even in their own track. In the fifteenth and ſixteenth centuries, ſome ſpirited enterpriſes were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; but afterwards, the ſpirit of Diſcovery, ſeemed to have totally ſubſided, till about the year 1741, when by the command of his late Majeſty, a voyage was undertaken under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Captain Middleton, for diſcovering a North-weſt paſſage through Hudſon's Bay. In 1746, two ſhips were ſitted out by ſubſcription for the ſame purpoſe, under the command of Captains Smith and Moor. But it was reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his preſent Majeſty, by that munificence and patronage, which every liberal purſuit meets with from him, to open friendly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with ſome receſſes of the Globe, hitherto unexplored. Captain (now Admiral) Byron, with the ſhips Dolphin and Tamar, in 1764—6; Wallis and Carteret, with the Dolphin and Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in 1766—9; and Cook, with the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in 1768—71, and with the Reſolution and Adventure, in 1772—5, carried on a plan
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:030274_0013_0FE56A630647E130"/>
of Diſcovery, which it was the purpoſe of the preſent voyage to finiſh.</p>
                  <p>The intimate connection between theſe voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, render it very neceſſary, to ſtate as ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as poſſible, the objects accompliſhed by the preceding voyages, and how far the intention of the preſent one has been anſwered.</p>
                  <p>In general, it may be premiſed, that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal object of all the voyages of the preſent reign, was to explore the vaſt Ocean which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends thro' the whole Southern Hemiſphere; as the reſult of all the reſearches which had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been made might be juſtly conſidered as obſcure traditions, bold fictions, and plauſible conjectures; that theſe five different circumna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigations have anſwered a better purpoſe, is viſible from the following obſervations.</p>
                  <p>Falkland's Iſlands in the South Atlantic Ocean were barely known to exiſt before Anſon, and ſo erroneous was even his idea of them, that he conſidered Pepys Iſland and Falkland's Iſles to be different places; there can be no doubt that they are the ſame, from Byron and M'Bride's joint teſtimony: and of them we have as exact charts, as of the Coaſts of Great Britain itſelf. Beſides this, the diſcovery of Sandwich Lands, the moſt ſoutherly point yet known, and the certain accounts we have of the Iſle of Georgia, are all to be attributed to Cook. Sir John Narborough gave us very imperfect accounts of Magalhaen's Straits,
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:030274_0014_0FE56A64DE06FB30"/>
but Captains Byron, Wallis and Carteret, have furniſhed us with very accurate accounts of its coaſt, harbours, headlands, bays, iſlands, tides, ſoundings, and currents, which are a very valuable acquiſition, and ſhould deter any future adventurers from ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that courſe, eſpecially when a much ſafer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance may be had to the Pacine Ocean, by doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cape Horn; this navigation Captain Cook has clearly ſhewn, is by no means attended with ſuch danger as might be ſuſpected from the hardſhips and diſtreſſes which Anſon a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Pizarro ſuffered there; and that, wholly owing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the ſeaſon in which they were obliged to hazard it. But they have not only rendered the acceſs to the Pacific Ocean more eaſy, but have made us acquainted with a far greater part of its contents. As the Spaniſh navigators had no further deſign than to get a paſſage to the Moluccas and other ſpice i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lands, they never ſteered further weſt-ward, by deviating from their track, except accidently, and if then they fell in with any iſlands, or made any diſcoveries, little benefit was derived from them, their accounts being ſo inaccurate as ſometimes to occaſion a queſtion if ſuch places exiſted. Indeed, the vaſt quantity of territory annexed to the Spaniſh Crown, and the many rich mines never wrought rendered new acquiſitions by no means to be covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that, except the annual Manilla and Acapul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co ſhip, they ſeldom attempted to ſteer acroſs the vaſt gulph which ſeparates Aſia from America.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030274_0015_0FE56A6666B52248"/>Other Navigators in theſe ſeas, generally followed the Spaniſh track: as indeed, their ſole buſineſs there was either for the purpoſe of commerce or hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with them. It is probable then, that after paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Terra del Fuego, they would hold a notherly courſe to the uninhabited Iſland of Juan Fernande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and thence ſail along the American coaſt from Chili to California, but they would either return to the Atlantic by the ſame courſe, or ſteer the track of the Phillipine galleons, as trade or rapine could be benefited by no other. In latter years, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing Dutch have made ſome more certain and effectual reſearches in the ſouthern latitudes of this ocean. In 1642 Taſman's voyge will ever be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, for the diſcoveries he made in a circuit, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a high ſouthern latitude, ſo far North as New Guinea. Le Maine and Schouton in 1616, and Roggiuein in 1772, croſſing the ſouth tropic, traverſed this ocean, from Cape Horn to the Eaſt Indies. But even the diſcoveries they made, can only be conſidered as a proof how much might be done. If they diſcovered a coaſt, they often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to land; or if they ventured, their enquiries and obſervations were ſo futile, as not to ſatisfy common curioſity, much leſs philoſophical enquiry.</p>
                  <p>While we thus muſt allow the Dutch to have been our harbingers, it is alſo to be obſerved, that we afterwards went beyond them, even in their own track. And now ſucceſſively his Majeſty'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhips have penetrated into the obſcureſt receſſes of
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030274_0016_0FE56A67EFF67910"/>
the ſouth Pacific Ocean, will appear from a recital of their various and extenſive operations, which have adjuſted the geography of ſo conſiderable a part of the globe.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral lands, mentioned to have been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by preceding navigators, whether Spaniſh or Dutch have been diligently ſought after; and moſt of thoſe which appeared to be of any conſequence, found out and viſited; when every method was put in practice to correct former miſtakes, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply former deficiences. Thus, the famous Tierra Auſtralia del Eſpiritu Santo, which was always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered a part of a ſouthern continent, Captain Cook has defined its true poſition and bounds, in the Archipelago of the New Hebrides.</p>
                  <p>But beſides perfecting the diſcoveries of their predeceſſors, our late navigators have added a long catalogue of their own, to enrich geographical knowledge. By repeatedly traverſing the Pacific Ocean, within the ſouth trophic, a ſeeming end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs profuſion of habitual ſpots of land was found. Iſlands interſperſed through the amazing ſpace of eighty degrees of longitude, either ſeparately ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or grouped in numerous cluſters; and ſuch ample accounts have we received, both of them and their inhabitants, that, to make uſe of the Captains own words, we <hi>have left little more to be done in that part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Byron, Wallis, and Carteret, all contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards increaſing our knowledge of the iſles in the Pacific Ocean, within the limits of the ſouthern
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030274_0017_0FE56A6E55D52C20"/>
tropic; but how far that ocean extended to the weſt, by what lands it was bounded on that ſide, and the connections of thoſe lands with the former diſcoveries, remained unknown, till Captain Cook, after his firſt voyage, brought back a ſatisfactory deciſion to theſe queſtions. With wonderful ſkill and perſeverance, amidſt perplexities, difficultie and dangers, he traced this coaſt almoſt 2000 miles, from the 38° of ſouth latitude, acroſs the tropic, to its northern extremity, within 10° and a half of the equinoctial, where it joined the land, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy explored by the Dutch, which they have deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated New Holland. Taſman's diſcoveries in the laſt century is now completed by Captain Cook; and we are fully acquainted with the circumference of this vaſt body of land, which is juſtly computed to be <hi>One Fifth of the Globe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although Taſman was the firſt Diſcoverer of New-Zealand, yet the ſmall portion of it along which he ſailed, rendered his account of it ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that it was the general opinion of geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that New-Zealand was part of a Souther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though Mr. Dalrymple and others had diſcovered ſome traces of ſuch a paſſage, yet the uncertainty of its practicability, as well as the importance of the diſcovery, may be judged of, by reflecting that Monſ. Bougainville in 1768, rather than attempt ſuch a paſſage, ſailed ninety leagues about, while reduced to feed on ſeal ſkins from of the yards and riggings, for want of proviſions.</p>
                  <p>For a ſimilar diſcovery to the preceding, we are indebted to Captain Carteret; <hi>viz.</hi> that the land named by Captain Dampier New Britain, conſiſts of two large and ſeveral ſmaller iſlands, through which by Sir George's Channel, is a much better and ſhorter paſſage, whether from the eaſt-ward or weſt-ward, than round all the Iſlands and lands to the north-ward.</p>
                  <p>Byron, Wallis and Carteret were principally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in exploring the ſouth Atlantic, and knew no more of the ſouth Pacific, than accidentally occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the direct tract they held: and as Captain Cook's main object in his firſt voyage was to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the tranſit of Venus at Otaheite, his anxiety to be there in proper time, preventing his viſiting that part of the South Pacific, where the riches and mine of diſcovery was ſuppoſed to exiſt. To put an end to all conjectures on this matter, Captain Cook was ſent out with the Reſolution and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in 1772, on the moſt enlarged plan of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

                     </gap> the Globe in high ſouthern latitudes, and carefully to examine every corner of the ſouth Pacific, at once to determine, whether a ſouthern continent exiſted in any acceſſible part of the ſouthern hemiſphere.</p>
                  <p>In attending Captain Cook in this ſecond voyage together with his preceding one, we have the greateſt certainty to conclude, that many extenſive conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents and iſlands mentioned by former navigators, were either large fields of ice, or exiſted only in the chimerical heads of the pretended diſcoverers.</p>
                  <p>It has been, by many, conſidered as an unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able argument; that a ſouthern continent is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to preſerve the due equilibrium; but from the thorough knowledge of the greater part of the ſouthern hemiſphere, of which we are now poſſeſt, we may with certainty aver, that the equilibrium of the earth is maintained although the vaſt track of ſea ſailed through, leaves no proportion for an equal quantity of land.</p>
                  <p>Thus though ſome preceding navigators have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed more land to the known Globe, than Captain Cook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to him belongs the honor of diſcloſing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ſea covering its ſurface.

of ſome old diſcoveries, but made there many new ones, and left, I conceive, very little to be done in that part. Thus I flatter myſelf, that the intention of the voyage has, in every reſpect, been fully anſwered; the ſouthern hemiſphere ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explored; and a final end put to the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a ſouthern continent, which has, at times, engroſſed the attention of ſome of the maritime powers for near two centuries paſt, and been a favourite theory amongſt geographers of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>From the general ſketch we have already given of the preceding voyages, it is evident that, though the utmoſt acceſſible extremities of the ſouthern hemiſphere had been viſited, yet our own had not; and it remained a queſtion, how far a northern paſſage between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean was practicable, either by ſailing weſtward round North America, or eaſtward, round Aſia.</p>
                  <p>Could ſuch a paſſage be effected, it would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhorten paſſages to Japan, China, and the Eaſt-Indies in general.

                              <p>WHEREAS the Earl of Sandwich has ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us his Majeſty's pleaſure, that an attempt ſhould be made to find out a Northern paſſage by ſea, from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean; and whereas we have, in purſuance thereof, cauſed his Majeſty's ſloops, Reſolution and Diſcovery, to be
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:030274_0022_0FE56A9CB3E06158"/>
fitted, in all reſpects, proper to proceed upon a voyage for the purpoſe above mentioned, and, from the experience we have had of your abilities and good conduct in your late voyages, have thought fit to intruſt you with the conduct of the preſent intended voyage, and with that view ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed you to command the firſt mentioned ſloop, and directed Captain Clerke, who commands the other, to follow your orders for his further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. You are hereby required and directed to proceed with the ſaid two ſloops directly to the Cape of Good Hope, unleſs you ſhall judge it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſtop at Madeira, the Cape de Verd, or Canary Iſlands, to take in wine for the uſe of their companies; in which caſe you are at liberty to do ſo, taking care to remain there no longer than may be neceſſary for that purpoſe.</p>
                              <p>On your arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, you are to refreſh the ſloops companies, and to cauſe the ſloops to be ſupplied with as much proviſions and water as they can conveniently ſtow.</p>
                              <p>You are, if poſſible, to leave the Cape of Good Hope by the end of October, or the beginning of November next, and proceed to the ſouth-ward in ſearch of ſome iſlands ſaid to have been lately ſeen by the French, in the latitude of 48° 0′ ſouth, and about the meridian of Mauritius. In caſe you find thoſe iſlands, you are to examine them thoroughly for a good harbour; and upon diſcovering one,
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:030274_0023_0FE56A7B29C4A468"/>
make the neceſſary obſervations to facilitate the finding it again; as a good port, in that ſituation, may hereafter prove very uſeful, although it ſhould afford little or nothing more than ſhelter, wood, and water. You are not, however, to ſpend too much time in looking out for thoſe iſlands, or in the examination of them, if found, but proceed to Otaheite, or the Society Iſles, (touching at New-Zealand in your way thither, if you ſhould judge it neceſſary and convenient), and taking care to arrive there time enough to admit of your giving the ſloops companies the refreſhments they may ſtand in need of, before you proſecute the further object of theſe inſtructions.</p>
                              <p>Upon your arrival at Otaheite, or the Society Iſles, you are to land Omai at ſuch of them as he may chooſe, and to leave him there.</p>
                              <p>You are to diſtribute among the Chiefs of thoſe iſlands ſuch part of the preſents with which you have been ſupplied as you ſhall judge proper, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the remainder to diſtribute among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the countries you may diſcover in the Northern Hemiſphere; And having refreſhed the people belonging to the ſloops under your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and taken on board ſuch wood and water as they may reſpectively ſtand in need of, you are to leave thoſe iſlands in the beginning of February, or ſooner if you ſhall judge it neceſſary, and then proceed in as direct a courſe as you can to the coaſt of New Albion, endeavouring to fall in
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:030274_0024_0FE56A9E4232F148"/>
with it in the latitude of 45° 0′ north; and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care, in your way thither, not to loſe any time in ſearch of new lands, or to ſtop at any you may fall in with, unleſs you find it neceſſary to recruit your wood and water.</p>
                              <p>You are alſo, in your way thither, ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined not to touch upon any part of the Spaniſh dominions on the Weſtern continent of America, unleſs driven thither by ſome unavoidable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; in which caſe you are to ſtay no longer there than ſhall be abſolutely neceſſary, and to be very careful not to give any umbrage or offence to any of the inhabitants or ſubjects of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Majeſty. And if, in your further progreſs to the north-ward, as hereafter directed, you find any ſubjects of any European Prince or State upon any part of the coaſt you may think proper to viſit, you are not to diſturb them, or give them any juſt cauſe of offence, but, on the contrary, to treat them with civility and friendſhip.</p>
                              <p>Upon your arrival in the coaſt of New Albion, you are to put into the firſt convenient port to recruit your wood and water, and procure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, and then to proceed north-ward along the coaſt, as far as the latitude of 65°, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you are not obſtructed by lands or ice; taking care not to loſe any time in exploring rivers or inlets, or upon any other account, until you get into the before-mentioned latitude of 65° where we could wiſh you to arrive in the month

When you get that length you are very carefully to ſearch for, and to explore, ſuch rivers or inlets as may appear to be of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable extent, and pointing towards Hudſon's or Baffin's Bay; and if, from your own obſervations, or from any information you may receive from the natives, (who there is reaſon to believe are the ſame race of people, and ſpeak the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, of which you are furniſhed with the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulary, as the Eſquimaux), there ſhall appear to be a certainty, or even a probability, of a water paſſage into the aforementioned bays, or either of them, you are, in ſuch caſe, to uſe your utmoſt endeavours to paſs through with one or both of the ſloops, unleſs you ſhall be of opinion that the paſſage may be effected with more certainty, or with greater probability, by ſmaller veſſels; in which caſe you are to ſet up the frames of one or both the ſmall veſſels with which you are provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and, when they are put together, and are properly ſitted, ſtored, and victualled, you are to diſpatch one or both of them, under the care of proper officers, with a ſufficient number of petty officers, men and boats, in order, to attempt the ſaid paſſage; with ſuch inſtructions for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining you, if they ſhould fail, or for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings, if they ſhould ſucceed in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as you ſhall judge moſt proper.

out, in order to make a diſcovery of the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned paſſage, (if any ſuch there be), you are at liberty, and we leave it to your diſcretion to purſue ſuch meaſures accordingly.</p>
                              <p>In caſe you ſhall be ſatisfied that there is no paſſage through to the above-mentioned bays ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the purpoſes of navigation, you are, at the proper ſeaſon of the year, to repair to the port of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamtſchatka, or wherever elſe you ſhall judge more proper, in order to refreſh your people, and paſs the winter; and, in the ſpring of the enſuing year 1778, to proceed from thence to the north-ward, as far as, in your prudence, you may think proper, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearch of a North-Weſt paſſage from the Pacific Ocean into the Atlantic Ocean or the North Sea; and if, from your own obſervation, or any information you may receive, there ſhall appear to be a probability of ſuch a paſſage, you are to proceed as above directed: and, having diſcovered ſuch a paſſage, or failed in the attempt, make the beſt of your way back to England, by ſuch route as you may think beſt for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of geography and navigation; repairing to Spithead with both ſloops, where they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till further order.</p>
                              <p>At whatever places you may touch in the courſe of your voyage, where accurate obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the nature hereafter mentioned have not already been made, you are, as far as your time

You are alſo carefully to obſerve the nature of the ſoil, and the produce thereof; the animals and fowls that inhabit or frequent it; the fiſhes that are to be found in the rivers or upon the coaſt, and in what plenty; and, in caſe there are any peculiar to ſuch places, to deſcribe them as minutely, and to make as accurate drawings of them, as you can; and, if you find any metals, minerals, or valuable ſtones, or any extraneous foſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You are likewiſe to obſerve the genius, temper, diſpoſition, and number of the natives and inhabitants, where you find any; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by all proper means, to cultivate a friendſhip with them; making them preſents of ſuch trinkets as you have on board, and they

may like beſt; inviting them to traſſic; and ſhewing them every kind of civility and regard; but taking care, nevertheleſs, not to ſuffer your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſurpriſed by them, but to be always on your guard againſt any accidents.</p>
                              <p>You are alſo, with the conſent of the natives, to take poſſeſſion, in the name of the King of Great-Britain, of convenient ſituations in ſuch countries as you may diſcover, that have not already been diſcovered or viſited by any other European power; and to diſtribute among the inhabitants ſuch things as will remain as traces and teſtimonies of your having been there; but if you find the countries ſo diſcovered are unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, you are to take poſſeſſion of them for his Majeſty, by ſetting up proper marks and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, as firſt diſcoverers and poſſeſſors.</p>
                              <p>But foraſmuch as, in undertakings of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeveral emergencies may ariſe not to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, and therefore not particularly to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by inſtructions before-hand; you are, in all ſuch caſes, to proceed as you ſhall judge moſt advantageous to the ſervice on which you are employed.</p>

In 1745, a law had paſſed offering a donation of <hi>L.</hi> 20,000 to the diſcoverer of a Northern paſſage <hi>through Hudſon's Bay,</hi> in which his Majeſty's ſhips were excluded. This was now extended to any ſhip belonging to his Majeſty, or any of his ſubjects, and the reſtriction to Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Bay cancelled, bearing that the diſcoverer of a paſſage by ſea, between the the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean in <hi>any direction,</hi> or paralled of the Northern Hemiſphere, ſhould be entitled, &amp;c. As alſo a reward of five thouſand pounds, to any ſhip that ſhould approach to within 1° of the North Pole. In the beginning of ſummer 1776, Captain Pickerſgill was appointed Commander of the armed brig the Lion, and ordered to proceed to Davis's Straits, to protect the Britiſh fiſhers; and in order to facilitate Captain Cook's expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to proceed up Baffin's Bay, and make ſuch charts and take ſuch views of the ſeveral bays, harbours, &amp;c. as might be uſeful to navigators and others; and to be careful to return in the fall of the year. Pickerſgill failed in executing his commiſſions, and in March following Lieutenant Young was appointed to ſucceed him.</p>
                  <p>As the object of this voyage is immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with that of Captain Cook, we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a ſummary of his inſtructions, dated March 13th, 1777.</p>

                     <pb n="xx" facs="unknown:030274_0031_0FE56A8680B08768"/>"That as the Reſolution and Diſcovery had been ſent out under the command of Capt. Cook, to attempt the diſcovery of a northern paſſage, by ſea, from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, and to run as far up as the 65° of north latitude, and there, and as far north as he judged it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, carefully to ſearch for ſuch rivers or inlets as might appear to him pointing towards Baffin's or Hudſon's bay, or the north ſeas; and to attempt a paſſage by theſe if poſſible; ſo, on the other hand, you are to proceed to Baffin's Bay, and carefully to explore the weſtern ſhores thereof, and if an inlet or river is diſcovered ſeemingly pointing towards the Pacific Ocean, you are to attempt navigating the ſame; and if not, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to return to England once this year."</p>
                  <p>But this expedition was of no ſervice; Young was found more calculated to aſſiſt in the glory of a victory, than explore icy mountains.</p>
                  <p>On examining theſe inſtructions, it may be queſtioned, why Captain Cook was not directed to commence his ſearch, before he arrived at 65°? Why not examine Hudſon's Bay, on our ſide of America? Why was the weſtern ſea of John de Fuca in latitude 47° and 48°; the Archipelago of St. Lazarus of Admiral de Fonte from 50° to 55°; and the rivers and lakes to the north eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, neglected? It may eaſily be ſhewn that theſe pretended diſcoveries are mere fictions, and that the Orders, not to begin his ſearch before the

                  <p>Captain Middleton, the commander of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in Hudſon's Bay, in 1741, and 42, had entertained a notion of the probability of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a paſſage to the Pacific, and in ſearch of it, had proceeded further north than any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; but he found it utterly impracticable. Mr. Dobbs, however, the patron of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, upon the information of ſome of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's officers, ventured to accuſe him of miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting facts, and that from his own accounts of an inlet running weſt-ward in latitude 65° or 66° it was evident he had not taken proper pains. To be at a point upon this, he prevailed upon a ſociety of merchants and gentlemen to fit out the Dobbs and California to inveſtigate this very inlet, having previouſly got the <hi>L.</hi> 20,000 premium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>But this voyage abundantly eſtabliſhed Captain Middleton's opinion; for the ſuppoſed ſtraits was found to be a freſh water river. So high had expectation been raiſed in favour of this ſuppoſed paſſage, that notwithſtanding the failure of this expedition, it was ſtill conſidered as attainable. Two places were mentioned as the moſt probable, the one Cheſterfield or Bowden's inlet, in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 63° or 64°, the other Repulſe Bay in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 67°. This laſt, the committee who directed
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:030274_0033_0FE56A880A060658"/>
the enterpriſe, declared to be impracticable, upon the teſtimony of Mr. Ellis, the commander of the Dobbs, and ſome of his officers; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer has been fully explored, and traced 170 miles up the country, to a large lake from whence it takes its riſe, in two different voyages by Captain Chriſtopher, in the ſloop Churchill in the years 1761 and 62.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe ſea voyages, the matter is much elucidated by the journey of Mr. Hearne, who was ſent out by the Hudſon's Bay company to travel over land, as far as the <hi>Copper Mine River,</hi> which had been much ſpoken of by Mr. Dobbs and other favourers of the ſcheme. He ſet out in December 1770, from Fort Prince of Wales, on Churchill's River lat. 58° 50′, and his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions are preſerved in his written journal. It is much to be wiſhed that this journal were publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it contains a very diſmal account of the wretched ſituation of the miſerions, inhabitants of that part of the globe. His general courſe was to the north-weſt. In June 1771, when at a place called <hi>Conge Catha who Chaga,</hi> he determined by two good obſervations, that this place is ſituated 24° 2′ weſt longitude of Churchill River, and in 68° 46′ north latitude. On the 13th of July, he reached Copper Mine River; and contrary to the idea he had been left to form of it, ſound it ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly navigable for a canoe. Without entering par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly into the account Mr. Hearne gives of this
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:030274_0034_0FE56AACEEA19388"/>
river, it is ſufficient for our purpoſe to mention, that he found it by no means navigable for the ſmalleſt veſſels, and impoſſible to be made ſo. On our general chart, the particular ſituation of this river, as well as the country in general, through which Mr. Hearne paſſed, is accurately laid down. In fine, Mr. Hearne's travelling 1300 miles before he arrived at the ſea, makes it clear that the continents of North America ſtretches from Hudſon's Bay, at leaſt that diſtance to the north-weſt, while his moſt weſterly diſtance from Hudſon's Bay was about 600 miles; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians who attended him as guides were convinced that there exiſted a vaſt track of continent, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in the ſame direction. What we have now mentioned, being ſufficiently known to the firſt Lord of the Admiralty, was a good reaſon for his ordering Captain Cook to commence his ſearch in latitude 65°, and not more to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But if there are any, we are ſtill inclined to think it ſhould have begun earlier. We beg leave to recommend to them a peruſal of the Spaniſh voyages, particularly that on the coaſt of America in 1775, publiſhed by Mr. Danes Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington. In the general ſketch we have now given of the preſent and preceding voyages, a pretty diſtinct idea may be formed, of what was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done, and what was really accompliſhed. The benefits ariſing from them may be enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as follows:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:030274_0035_0FE56A89E69B4918"/>1. All viſionary ſpeculators and ſchemers, ſuch as Buſſon, Campbell, and de Broſſes, will find few votaries to ſupport their airy fanciful dreams of treaſures and paradiſes in theſe ſeas, as Captain Cook has ſufficiently inveſtigated what is and what is not to be found there; ſo, many impracticable undertakings which would probably have taken place, will be entirely prevented.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But unprofitable ſearches will not only be diſcouraged, but the diſtreſſes and inconveniencies attending the navigation of theſe ſeas, in a great meaſure prevented. The exact ſituation of the different iſlands are properly laid down; rocky ſhores, perplexing currents, dangerous ſhoals, and narrow ſtraits accurately deſcribed; beſides many other advantages, to enumerate which, it would be neceſſary to tranſcribe great part of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of our ſeveral Commanders. By thus leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger of theſe voyages, a ſcene of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce comes in view, that in a courſe of years will probably come to ſuch a height as is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us at preſent to have any conception of; nay, in our own day, it is highly probable that ſome ſpeedy advances will be made to form ſome commercial eſtabliſhments in the ſouth Pacific; at leaſt, if we do not, we have taught the Ruſſians and Spaniards ſome important leſſons in the ſkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade, and otherwiſe, which they will not fail to improve.</p>

The valuable acceſſions which human know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge has made by the continued plan of diſcovery carried on in the preſent reign, cannot fail to diſtinguiſh Britain as taking the lead in the moſt arduous enterpriſes, for the benefit of mankind. And were no real benefit to accrue to us, either in this or a future age, as mentioned in the preceding article, certainly no greater ſcope was ever given to the dignified exerciſe of the powers of the human mind, particularly in the aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical lines.</p>

It may be added, that the method of making and comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſervations for finding the variation of the compaſs is better known, and more frequently practiſed by thoſe who have been on theſe voyages, than by moſt others.

                     <p>ON the 10th of February, 1776, Captain Cook went on board his Majeſty's ſloop the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and hoiſted the pendant, having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a commiſſion to command her the preceding day. The Diſcovery, of three hundred tons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, at the ſame time, prepared for the ſervice,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030274_0049_0FE56AE0EE595B40"/>
and Captain Clerke appointed to the command of her. It may be neceſſary to obſerve, that Captain Clerke had been Captain Cook's Second Lieutenant on board the Reſolution, in his ſecond voyage round the world.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two ſhips were then equipping in the dock at Deptford, for a voyage to make farther diſcoveries in the Pacific Ocean, under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Captain Cook.</p>
                     <p>The Reſolution was hauled into the river on the 9th of March to complete her rigging, and take in ſtores and proviſions for the voyage. Both ſhips, indeed, were abundantly ſupplied with every thing requiſite for a voyage of ſuch duration. We ſailed on the 29th of May, and arrived the next day at Long Reach, where our powder and ſhot, and other ordnance ſtores, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p>On the 8th of June, while we lay in Long Reach, we had the ſatisfaction of a viſit from the Earl of Sandwich, Sir Hugh Palliſer, and others of the Board of Admiralty, to examine whether every thing had been completed purſuant to their orders, and to the convenience of thoſe who were to embark. They honoured Captain Cook with their company to dinner on that day; and were ſaluted, on their coming on board, and on their going aſhore, with ſeventeen guns and three cheers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="unknown:030274_0050_0FE56AC875674F78"/>To convey ſome permanent benefit to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Otaheite, and of the other iſlands which we might happen to viſit, his Majeſty commanded ſome uſeful animals to be taken out. On the 10th we took on board a bull, two cows with their calves, and ſome ſheep; with hay and corn for their ſupport. We were alſo furniſhed with a ſufficient quantity of our valuable Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean garden ſeeds, which might add freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of food to the vegetable productions of our newly diſcovered iſlands.</p>
                     <p>Both the ſhips, by order of the Board of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, were amply ſupplied with an extenſive aſſortment of iron tools and trinkets, to facilitate a friendly commerce and intercourſe with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of ſuch new countries as we might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. With reſpect to our own wants, nothing was refuſed us that might be conducive to health, comfort or convenience.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe at the head of the naval department were equally ſolicitous to render our vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The board, likewiſe, put into their poſſeſſion the time-keeper, which Captain Cook had carried out in his laſt voyage, and which had performed ſo well. It
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030274_0051_0FE56AE290C41570"/>
was conſtructed by Mr. Kendal, and was a copy of Mr. Harriſon's. Another time-keeper, and the ſame aſſortment of aſtronomical and other inſtruments were put on board the Diſcovery, for the uſe of Mr. William Bailey, a diligent and ſkilful obſervator, who was engaged to embark with Captain Clerke.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Anderſon, Surgeon to Captain Cook, added to his profeſſional abilities a great profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in natural hiſtory. He had already vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the South-Sea Iſlands in the ſame ſhip, and enabled the Captain to enrich his relation of the preceding voyage with uſeful and valuable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
                     <p>Though ſeveral young men, among the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers, were capable of being employed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing charts, drawing plans, and taking views of the coaſts and head-lands, Mr. Webber was engaged to embark with Captain Cook, for the purpoſe of ſupplying the defects of written accounts, by taking accurate and maſterly draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the moſt memorable ſcenes of our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.</p>
                     <p>The neceſſary preparations being completed, Captain Cook received orders to proceed to Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, and to take the Diſcovery under his command. In conſequence of which, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captain Clerke to carry his ſhip alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Diſcovery proceeded the next day in obedience to Captain Cook's order, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution remained at the Nore till Captain Cook, who was then in London, ſhould join her.</p>
                     <p>It being our intention to touch at Otaheite and the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Though Omai left London with ſome degree of regret, when he reflected upon the favours and indulgencies he had received, yet, when mention was made of his own iſlands, his eyes ſparkled with joy. He entertained the higheſt ideas of this country and its inhabitants; but the pleaſing proſpect of returning home, loaded with what would be deemed invaluable treaſures there, and of obtaining a diſtinguiſhed ſuperiority among his countrymen, operated ſo far as to ſuppreſs every uneaſy ſenſation, and when he got on board the ſhip, he appeared to be quite happy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030274_0053_0FE5489022DC1A50"/>Omai was furniſhed by his Majeſty, with quantities of every article that were ſuppoſed to be in eſtimation at Otaheite. He alſo received ſeveral preſents from Lord Sandwich, Mr. Banks, and many others. Every method had, indeed, been employed, during his abode in England, and at his departure, to make him the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conveying to his countrymen, an exalted opinion of Britiſh greatneſs and generoſity.</p>
                     <p>About noon on the 25th we weighed anchor, and made ſail for the Downs, with a gentle breeze at north-weſt by weſt. At nine the ſame day we anchored, with the North Foreland bearing ſouth by eaſt, and Margate Point ſouth-weſt by ſouth.</p>
                     <p>On the 26th, at two o'clock, we weighed, and ſtood round the Foreland; and at eight o'clock the ſame morning anchored in the Downs. Here Captain Cook received two boats on board, which had been built for him at Deal; and the next day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, we got under ſail, but the breeze ſoon died away, and we anchored again. At ten o'clock the ſame night we weighed again, and proceeded down the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>We anchored at Plymouth Sound on the 30th, at three o'clock in the afternoon. The Diſcovery had arrived there three days before. We ſaluted Admiral Amh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030274_0054_0FE56ACB8BEE69B0"/>We were employed on the 1ſt and 2d of July in replacing the water and proviſions we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and in receiving on board a ſupply of port wine. On the 8th Captain Cook received his inſtructions for the voyage, and an order to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope with the Reſolution; with directions alſo to leave an order for Captain Clerke to follow him, as ſoon as he ſhould join his ſhip, he being at that time in London.</p>
                     <p>The officers and men on board the Reſolution (including marines) were one hundred and twelve, and thoſe on board the Diſcovery were eighty.</p>
                     <p>On the 10th of July the proper perſons came on board, and paid the officers and crew up to the 30th of laſt month. The petty officers and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men received alſo two months wages in advance. Such indulgence to the latter is cuſtomary; but the payment of what was due to the ſuperior of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, was in conſideration of our peculiar ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to enable us to defray the expence of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ourſelves with neceſſaries for a voyage of ſuch uncommon duration.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 11th, Captain Cook de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the hands of Mr. Burney, Firſt Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Diſcovery, Captain Clerke's ſailing orders; a copy of which he alſo left with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of his Majeſty's ſhips at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, to be delivered to the Captain on his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. In the afternoon we weighed with the ebb,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030274_0055_0FE56AE9F80CC140"/>
and got out beyond all the ſhipping in the Sound, where we were detained moſt of the following day. At eight o'clock in the evening, we weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, and ſtood out of the Sound, with a gentle breeze at north-weſt by weſt.</p>

                     <p>SOON after we came out of Plymouth Sound, the wind came more weſterly, and blew freſh, which obliged us to ply down the channel; and we were not off the Lizard till the 14th at eight in the evening.</p>
                     <p>On the 16th at noon, the light-houſe of St. Agnes, on the Iſles of Scilly, bore north-weſt by weſt, diſtant about ſeven or eight miles; and on the 17th and 18th, we were off Uſhant.</p>
                     <p>On the 19th we ſtood weſtward till eight o'clock in the morning, when the wind ſhifted, and we
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030274_0056_0FE56ACD332742B8"/>
tacked and ſtretched to the ſouthward: here we beheld nine ſail of large ſhips, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be French men of war. On the 22d, at ten in the morning, we ſaw Cape Ortegal about four leagues diſtant.</p>
                     <p>We had calm weather on the 22d and 23d, and on the afternoon of the 24th, we paſſed Cape Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterre, with a fine gale at north-north-eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook determined to touch at Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, to get a ſupply of hay and corn for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of his animals on board, as well as the uſual refreſhments for ourſelves. We ſaw Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe on the 31ſt of July, at four in the afternoon; and at day-light on the firſt of Auguſt, we ſailed round the eaſt point of that iſland, and anchored on the ſouth ſide, in the road of Santa Cruz, about eight o'clock, in twenty-three fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>There were, riding in this road, a French fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, two French brigantines, an Engliſh brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and fourteen ſail of Spaniſh ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after we had anchored, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a viſit from the maſter of the port, who aſked the ſhip's name. Upon his retiring, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook ſent an officer aſhore, to preſent his reſpects to the Governor, and aſk his permiſſion to take in water, and to purchaſe ſuch articles as were thought neceſſary. The Governor very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely complied with Captain Cook's requeſt, and ſent an officer on board to compliment him on his arrival. In the afternoon Captain Cook wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030274_0057_0FE56AEBEEE17AE8"/>
upon him, accompanied by ſome of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; and, before he returned to his ſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke ſome corn and ſtraw, ordered a quantity of wine, and made an agreement for a ſupply of water.</p>
                     <p>The Road of Santa Cruz is ſituated on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of the iſland, before the town of the ſame name. It is ſaid to be the principal road of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriffe for ſhelter, capacity, and the goodneſs of its bottom.</p>
                     <p>The water to ſupply the ſhipping, and for the uſe of the inhabitants of Santa Cruz, is derived from a rivulet that runs from the hills, which is conveyed into the town in wooden troughs. As theſe troughs were at this time repairing, freſh water was extremely ſcarce.</p>
                     <p>From the appearance of the country about Santa Cruz, it might naturally be concluded that Teneriffe is a barren ſpot: we were convinced however, from the ample ſupplies we received, that it not only produced ſufficient to ſupply its own inhabitants, but alſo enough to ſpare for viſitors. Though wine is the chief produce of the iſland, beef may be had at about three-pence ſterling a pound; the oxen, however, are ſmall, lean, and boney. Sheep, goats, hogs, and poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may be had on terms equally reaſonable. A great variety of fruits are to be had in plenty, as pears, figs, grapes, mulberries, muſk-melons, &amp;c. beſides others that were not then in ſeaſon. The
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030274_0058_0FE56AD18ED4F388"/>
pumpkins, potatoes, and onions, which grow here, are excellent.</p>
                     <p>Indian corn is produced on this iſland, and is ſold at about three ſhillings and ſix-pence per buſhel: the fruits and vegetables are, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, very cheap. Though the inhabitants are but indifferently ſupplied with fiſh by the adjoining ſeas, they are engaged in a conſiderable fiſhery on the coaſt of Barbary, and the produce of it ſells at a very moderate price.</p>
                     <p>Teneriffe is certainly a more eligible place than Madeira, for ſhips to touch at which are bound on long voyages; but the wine of the latter is infinitely ſuperior to that of the former: the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their prices is almoſt as conſiderable as their qualities, for the beſt Teneriffe wine was ſold for twelve pounds a pipe, whereas a pipe of the beſt Maderia was worth conſiderably more than double that ſum.</p>
                     <p>Behind the town of Santa Cruz, the country riſes gradually to a moderate height; afterwards it continues to riſe ſouth weſtward towards the celebrated pic of Teneriffe. But we were much diſappointed in our expectations with reſpect to its appearance <note n="*" place="bottom">In Sparta's Hiſtory of the Royal Society, page 200, &amp;c. is an account of a journey to the top of the pic of Teneriffe. A modern traveller, viz. the Chevalier de Borda, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the height of this mountain in Auguſt 1776, makes it 123<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030274_0059_0FE56AED7996DBE0"/>The iſland, eaſtward of Santa Cruz, appears perfectly barren. Ridges of high hills run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea, between which are deep vallies, terminating at mountains that run acroſs and are higher than the former.</p>
                     <p>On the 1ſt of Auguſt in the afternoon, Mr. Anderſon (Captain Cook's ſurgeon) went on ſhore to one of theſe vallies, intending to reach the top of the remoter hills, but time would not permit him to get farther than their foot. The lower hills produce great quantities of the <hi>euphorbia canarienſis.</hi> The people on the ſpot imagine its juice to be ſo cauſtic as to erode the ſkin; but Mr. Anderſon convinced them to the contrary, by thruſting his finger into a plant full of it. The inhabitants dry the buſhes of <hi>euphorbia,</hi> and carry them home for fuel.</p>
                     <p>Santa Cruz, though not large, is a well-built city. Their churches have not a magnificent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance without, but they are decent and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably handſome within.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt facing the ſtone pier, which runs into the ſea from the town, is a marble column, lately erected, enriched with human figures which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect honour to the ſtatuary.</p>
                     <p>On the 2d of Auguſt, in the afternoon, Mr. Anderſon and three others hired mules to ride to the city of Laguna, about the diſtance of four miles from Santa Cruz. They arrived there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween five and ſix in the evening, but the ſight
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030274_0060_0FE56AD477178BD0"/>
of it did not reward us for our trouble, as the roads were very bad, and our cattle but indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Though the place is extenſive, it hardly deſerves to be dignified with the name of a city. There is ſome good houſes, but the diſpoſition of the ſtreets is very irregular. Laguna is larger than Santa Cruz, but much inferior to it in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                     <p>The road from Santa Cruz to Laguna, runs up a ſteep barren hill; but, lower down, we ſaw ſome fig-trees and corn-fields. The corn, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is not produced here without great labour, the ground being greatly encumbered with ſtones. Nothing elſe preſented itſelf, deſerving notice, except a few aloe plants in flower on the ſide of the road.</p>
                     <p>The laborious work in this iſland is chiefly performed by mules, horſes being ſcarce, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the uſe of the officers. Oxen are alſo much employed here. Some hawks and parrots wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Mr. Anderſon was informed, by a gentleman of acknowledged veracity, that a ſhrub is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon here, agreeing exactly with the deſcription given by Linnaeus of the tea ſhrub, as growing in China and Japan. It is conſidered as a weed,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030274_0061_0FE56AEF070D5FC8"/>
and large quantities are rooted out of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards every year. The Spaniards, however, who inhabit the iſland, ſometimes make uſe of it, and aſcribe to it all the qualities of the tea imported from China.</p>
                     <p>The ſame gentleman mentioned to Mr. Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon another botanical curioſity, which is called the <hi>impregnated lemon.</hi> It is a diſtinct and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect lemon encloſed within another.</p>
                     <p>A certain ſort of grape growing here, is deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an excellent remedy in phthiſical complaints. The air and climate are remarkably healthful, and particularly adapted to afford relief in ſuch complaints. By reſiding at different heights in the iſland, it is in the power of any one to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſuch a temperature of air as may be beſt ſuited to his conſtitution. He may continue where it is mild and ſalubrious, or he may aſcend till the cold becomes intolerable. No perſon, it is ſaid, can live comfortably within a mile of the perpendicular height of the pic, after the month of Auguſt.</p>
                     <p>Smoke continually iſſues from near the top of the pic, but they have had no earthquake or erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince 1704, when the port of Garrachica was deſtroyed, being filled up by the rivers of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lava that flowed into it; and houſes are now built, where ſhips formerly lay at anchor.</p>
                     <p>The trade of Teneriffe is very conſiderable, forty thouſand pipes of wine being annually made

                     <p>HAVING got our water and other articles on board, we weighed anchor on the 4th of Auguſt, quitted Teneriffe, and proceeded on our voyage.</p>
                     <p>On the 10th, at nine o'clock in the evening, we ſaw the iſland of Bonaviſta bearing ſouth, diſtant about a league; though we then thought our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much farther off, but it ſoon appeared that we were miſtaken; for after hauling to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to clear the ſunken rocks that lie near the ſouth-eaſt point of the iſland, we found ourſelves cloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> upon them, and bearly weathered the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Our ſituation was, for ſome minutes, ſo very alarming, that Captain Cook did not chuſe to ſound, as that might have increaſed the danger, without any poſſibility of leſſening it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030274_0064_0FE56AD849A26E40"/>Having cleared the rocks, we ſteered between Bonaviſta and the iſland of Mayo, intending to look into Port Praya for the Diſcovery, as Captain Cook had told Captain Clerke that he ſhould touch there. At one o'clock we ſaw the rocks ſouth-weſt of Bonaviſta, bearing ſouth-eaſt, diſtant three or four leagues.</p>
                     <p>On Monday the 12th, at ſix o'clock in the morning, the iſle of Mayo bore ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, diſtant four or five leagues. We ſounded, and found ground at ſixty fathoms. At the diſtance of three or four miles from this iſland, we ſaw not the leaſt appearance of vegetation; nothing preſented itſelf to our view, but that lifeleſs brown, ſo common in unwooded countries under the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid zone.</p>
                     <p>During our continuance among theſe iſlands, we had gentle breezes of wind, varying from the ſouth-eaſt to eaſt, and ſome calms. On the 13th, at nine o'clock in the morning, we arrived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Port Praya, in the iſland of St. Jago, where two Dutch Eaſt-India ſhips, and a ſmall brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, were at anchor. The Diſcovery not being there, we did not go in, but ſtood to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>We loſt the north-eaſt trade-wind, the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we left the Cape de Verde iſlands; and, on the 30th, got that which blows from the ſouth-eaſt. The wind, during this interval, was principally in the ſouth-weſt quarter. It generally blew a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030274_0065_0FE56AF81305A100"/>
gentle breeze, but ſometimes freſh, and in ſqualls. We had few calms, and thoſe of ſhort duration. Between the latitude of 12°, and of 7° north, the weather was very gloomy, and frequently rainy; inſomuch, that we were enabled to ſave as much water as filled the greateſt part of our empty caſks.</p>
                     <p>Every bad conſequence is to be apprehended from theſe rains, and the cloſe ſultry weather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying them. Commanders of ſhips ought carefully to purify the air between decks with fires and ſmoke, and to oblige the people to change their cloaths at every opportunity. Theſe precautions were ſtrictly obſerved on board the Reſolution and Diſcovery; and we enjoyed the advantage of it, having fewer ſick than on either of Captain Cook's former voyages. Our ſhip, however, was very leaky in all her upper works. The ſultry weather had opened her ſeams ſo wide, that the rain-water paſſed through as it fell. The officers in the gun-room were driven from their cabins, by the water that came through the ſides, and hardly a man could lie dry in his bed. The caulkers were employed to repair theſe defects, as ſoon as we got into fair ſettled weather; but Captain Cook would not truſt them over the ſides while we were at ſea.</p>
                     <p>On the 1ſt of September, we croſſed the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in the longitude of 27° 38′ weſt, and paſſed the afternoon in performing the old ceremony of

We proceeded on our voyage, without any remarkable occurrence, till the 6th of October. Being then in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 35° 15′ ſouth, longitude 7° 45′ weſt, we alternately met with light airs and calms for three ſucceſſive days. For ſome days before we had ſeen albatroſſes, and pintadoes, and we then ſaw three penguins. In conſequence of this we found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but found no ground with a line of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty fathoms. We ſhot a few birds, one of which was a black petrel, about the ſize of a crow.</p>
                     <p>In the evening of the 8th, a bird, which the ſailors call a noddy, ſettled on our rigging, and was taken. It was larger than a common Engliſh black-bird, and nearly of the ſame colour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the upper part of the head, which was white. It was web-footed, had black legs, and a long black bill. Though it is ſaid th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as the Atlantic ocean, ſouthward of us, has been but little frequented, there may poſſibly be more iſlands than we know of.</p>
                     <p>A freſh gale from the north-weſt ſucceeded this calm weather, which continued two days. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we had variable light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After receiving the uſual viſit from the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attendant and the Surgeon, Captain Cook ſent an officer to Baron Plettenberg, the Governor, and ſaluted the garriſon with thirteen guns, and was complimented in return with the ſame number. Two French Eaſt-India ſhips were in the bay, the one outward, and the other homeward-bound.</p>
                     <p>After having ſaluted, Captain Cook went on ſhore, accompanied by ſome of his officers, and waited on the Governor, the Lieutenant-governor, the Fiſcal, and the Commander of the troops. Theſe Gentlemen received Captain Cook with the greateſt civility; and the Governor, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar voluntarily promiſed him every aſſiſtance that the place afforded. Before Captain Cook return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board, he ordered freſh meat, greens, &amp;c. to be provided every day for the ſhip's company.</p>
                     <p>On the 22d we fixed our tents and obſervatory; the next day we began to obſerve equal altitudes of the ſun, in order to diſcover whether the watch had altered its rate. The caulkers were ſet to work to caulk the ſhip; and Captain Cook had concerted meaſures for ſupplying both ſhips with ſuch proviſions as were wanted; and, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral articles for the Reſolution were got ready<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were immediately conveyed on board.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:030274_0068_0FE56B01D2E29070"/>The homeward-bound French ſhip ſailed for Europe on the 26th, and by her we ſent letters to England. The next day the Hampſhire Eaſt-India ſhip, from Bencoolen, anchored in the bay.</p>
                     <p>On the 31ſt of October it blew exceſſively hard at ſouth-eaſt, and continued for three days. The Reſolution was the only ſhip in the bay that rode out the gale without dragging her anchors.</p>
                     <p>The ſtorm ceaſed on the 3d of November, and on the 6th the Hampſhire ſailed for England, in which Captain Cook ſent home an invalid. On the 10th, in the morning, the Diſcovery arrived in the bay. She ſailed from Plymouth on the 1ſt of Auguſt, and would have been in with us a week ſooner, had not the late gale of wind blown her off the coaſt. Captain Clerke, on his paſſage from England, loſt one of his marines, by falling over board. No other accident happened among his people, and they arrived in perfect health.</p>
                     <p>The next day the Diſcovery wanting caulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Captain Cook ſent all his workmen on board her, and lent every other aſſiſtance to the Captain to expedite his ſupply of proviſions and water.</p>
                     <p>Having, by the Governor's permiſſion, taken our cattle on ſhore, on the night preceding the 14th, ſome dogs got in amongſt the ſheep, forced them out of the pen, killed four, and diſperſed the reſt. We recovered ſix of them the next day; but among thoſe which were miſſing were two rams, and two of the fineſt ewes in the whole flock.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030274_0069_0FE56B04485B6780"/>
Though the Dutch frequently boaſt of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice at the Cape, yet the Captain's ſheep evaded all the vigilance of the Fiſcal's officers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. At length, after much trouble and expence, by employing ſome of the loweſt fellows of the place, we recovered all but the two ewes. One of the rams, however, was ſo miſerably torn by the dogs, that we thought he would never recover.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Hemmy, the Lieutenant-governor, very obligingly offered to make up this loſs, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Captain Cook a Spaniſh ram, out of ſome he had ſent for from Liſbon; but the Captain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the offer, thinking it would equally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his purpoſe to take with him ſome of the Cape rams: in this, however, the Captain was miſtaken. Mr. Hemmy had endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce European ſheep at the Cape; but all his attempts were fruſtrated by the obſtinacy of the country people, who highly eſteemed their own breed, on account of their large tails; the fat of which ſometimes produces more money than the whole car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>While the ſhips were repairing for the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of our voyage, Mr. Anderſon, and ſome of our officers, made an excurſion, to take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the neighbouring country. Mr. Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030274_0070_0FE56B06C1B37878"/>
relates their proceedings to the following effect:</p>
                     <p>In the forenoon of Saturday the 16th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, he, and five others, ſet out in a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, to take a view of the country. They croſſed the large plain to the eaſtward of the town, which is entirely a white ſand, reſembling that which is commonly found on beaches. At five in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon they paſſed a large farm-houſe, ſome corn-fields and vineyards, ſituated beyond the plain, where the ſoil appeared worth cultivating. At ſeven they arrived at Stellenboſh, a colony, in point of importance, next to that of the Cape.</p>
                     <p>The village ſtands at the foot of the range of lofty mountains, about twenty miles to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Cape-Town, and conſiſts of about thirty houſes, which are neat and clean: a rivulet, and the ſhelter of ſome large oaks, planted at its firſt ſettling, form a rural proſpect in this deſert coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. There are ſome thriving vineyards and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards about the place, which ſeem to indicate an excellent ſoil, though perhaps much may be owing to the uncommon ſerenity of the air.</p>
                     <p>At this ſeaſon of the year, Mr. Anderſon could find but few plants in flower, and inſects were very ſcarce. He and his companions left Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenboſh the next morning, and ſoon arrived at the houſe they had paſſed on Saturday; Mr. Cloeder, the owner of which, having ſent them an invitation to viſit him, they were entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030274_0071_0FE56B084A218180"/>
by this gentleman with great politeneſs and hoſpitality. They were received with a band of muſic, which continued playing while they were at dinner; which, in that ſituation, might be reckoned elegant.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon they croſſed the country, and paſſed ſome large plantations. In the evening they arrived at a farm-houſe, which is ſaid to be the firſt in the cultivated tract called the <hi>Pearl.</hi> Here they had a view of Drakenſtein, the third colony of this country, which contains ſeveral little farms or plantations.</p>
                     <p>Plants and inſects were as ſcarce here as at Stellenboſh, but there was a greater plenty of ſhrubs, or ſmall trees, naturally produced, than they had before ſeen in the country.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 19th, in the afternoon, they went to ſee a remarkable large ſtone, called by the inhabitants the Tower of Babylon, or the Pearl Diamond. It ſtands upon the top of ſome low hills, and is of an oblong ſhape, rounded on the top, and lying nearly ſouth and north. The eaſt and weſt ſides are nearly perpendicular. The ſouth end is not equally ſteep, but its greateſt height is there; whence it declines gently to the north-part, by which they aſcended, and had a very extenſive proſpect of the whole country.</p>
                     <p>The circumference of this ſtone is about half a mile, as they were half an hour walking round it, including allowances for ſtopping and a bad
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030274_0072_0FE56B0FC7A84FD8"/>
road. Its height ſeems to equal the dome of St. Paul's church. Except ſome few ſiſſures, it is one uninterrupted maſs of ſtone. The ſtone is of that ſort which mineralogiſts call <hi>Saxum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinatum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the 20th, in the morning, they ſet out from the Pearl, and going a different road, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through an uncultivated country to the Tyger Hills, where they beheld ſome tolerable corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields. About noon, they ſtopped in a valley for refreſhment, where they were plagued with a vaſt number of muſquitoes; and, in the evening, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Cape-Town.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 23d, we got the obſervatory, clock, &amp;c. on board. From the reſult of ſeveral calculations and obſervations, we had reaſon to conclude, that the watch, or time-piece, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed well all the way from England.</p>

                     <p>CAPTAIN Cook, fearing a ſecond diſaſter, got his ſheep and other cattle on board as ſoon as poſſible. He alſo increaſed his ſtock by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing two bulls, two heifers, two ſtone-horſes, two mares, two rams, ſome ewes and goats, ſome poultry, and ſome rabbits.</p>
                     <p>Both ſhips being ſupplied with proviſions and water ſufficient for two years and upwards, and every other neceſſary article, and Captain Cook having given Captain Clerke a copy of his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we repaired on board in the morning of the 30th. A breeze ſprung up at ſouth-eaſt, at five in the afternoon, with which we weighed and ſtood out of the Bay; at nine it fell calm, and we anchored. At three o'clock the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we weighed and put to ſea, with a light breeze at ſouth, but did not get clear of land till the 3d of December in the morning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="unknown:030274_0074_0FE56B1323BCD590"/>On Thurſday the 5th, a ſquall of wind carried away the mizen top-maſt of the Reſolution, but we had another to replace it. On the evening of the 6th, being then in the latitude of 39° 14′ ſouth, and in the longitude of 23° 56′ eaſt, we obſerved ſeveral ſpots of water of a reddiſh hue. Upon examining ſome of this water that was taken up, we perceived a number of ſmall animals, which the microſcope diſcovered to reſemble cray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh.</p>
                     <p>We continued to the ſouth-eaſt, followed by a mountainous ſea, which occaſioned the ſhip to roll exceedingly, and rendered our cattle trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Several goats, eſpecially the males, died, and ſome ſheep. We now began to feel the cold in a very ſenſible degree.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 12th, at noon, we diſcovered land extending from ſouth-eaſt by ſouth, to ſouth-eaſt by eaſt. We, at length, diſcovered it to be two iſlands. That which lies moſt to the ſouth, appeared to be about fifteen leagues in circuit; and the moſt northerly one, about nine leagues in circuit.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed at equal diſtance from both iſlands, and could not diſcover either tree or ſhrub on either of them. They ſeemed to have a rocky ſhore, and, excepting the ſouth-eaſt parts, a ridge of barren mountains, whoſe ſides and ſummits were covered with ſnow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:030274_0075_0FE56B1505F93C60"/>Theſe two iſlands, and four others more to the eaſt, were diſcovered by Captains Marion du Freſne and Crozet, French navigators, in January 1772, on their paſſage from the Cape of Good Hope to the Philippine Iſlands. As they have no names in the French chart of the ſouthern hemiſphere, Captain Cook named the two we now ſaw Prince Edward's Iſlands, and the other four by the name of Marion's and Crozet's Iſlands.</p>
                     <p>We had now, in general, ſtrong gales, and very indifferent weather. After leaving Prince Edward's Iſlands, we ſhaped our courſe to paſs to the ſouthward of the four others, to get into the latitude of the land diſcovered by Monſieur de Kerguelen.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook had received inſtructons to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this iſland, and endeavour to diſcover a good harbour. On the 16th we ſaw numbers of penguins and divers, and rock-weed floating in the ſea; and on the 21ſt we ſaw a very large ſeal. The weather was now very ſoggy, and as we hourly expected to fall in with the land, our navigation was both dangerous and tedious.</p>
                     <p>On the 24th, at ſix in the morning, the fog clearing away a little, we ſaw land, bearing ſouth ſouth-eaſt, which we afterwards found to be an iſland of conſiderable height, and about three leagues in circuit. We ſoon after diſcovered ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of equal magnitude, about one league to the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030274_0076_0FE56B1AE4167AC8"/>
eaſtward; and, between theſe two, ſome ſmaller ones. In the direction of ſouth by eaſt, another high iſland was ſeen. We did but juſt weather the iſland laſt mentioned: it was a high round rock, named Bligh's Cap. Captain Cook ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this to be the ſame that Monſieur de Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guelen called the Iſle of Rendezvous; but he knew nothing that could rendezvous at it but the fowls of the air, for it was certainly inacceſſible to every other animal.</p>
                     <p>The weather beginning to clear up about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we tacked, and ſteered in for the land. At noon we were enable to determine the latitude of Bligh's Cap to be 48° 29′ ſouth, and its longitude 68° 40′. We paſſed it at three o'clock, with a freſh gale at weſt.</p>
                     <p>Preſently after we clearly ſaw the land, and at four o'clock it extended from ſouth-eaſt to ſouth-weſt by ſouth, diſtant about four miles. The left extreme, which Captain Cook judged to be the northern point of this land, called in the French chart of the ſouthern hemiſphere Cape François, terminated in a high perpendicular rock; and the right one in a high indented point.</p>
                     <p>Towards the middle of the land there appeared to be an inlet; but, on our approaching it, we ſaw it was only a bending on the coaſt: we, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bore up to go round Cape François.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:030274_0077_0FE56B1CDEFD2E88"/>Having got off the Cape, we obſerved the coaſt, to the ſouthward, much indented by points and bays, and, therefore, fully expected to find a good harbour. We ſoon diſcovered one, into which we began to ply; but it preſently fell calm, and we anchored in forty-five fathom water: the Diſcovery alſo anchored there ſoon after. Mr. Bligh, the maſter, was ordered to ſound the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; who reported it to be ſafe and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
                     <p>Early in the morning of the 25th we weighed, and having wrought into the harbour, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in eight fathoms water. The Diſcovery got in at two o'clock in the afternoon; when Captain Clerke informed us, that he had with difficulty eſcaped being driven on the ſouth point of the harbour, his anchor having ſtarted before he could ſhorten in the cable. They were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, obliged to ſet ſail, and drag the anchor after them, till they had room to heave it up, when they perceived that one of its palms was broken off.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after we had anchored, Captain Cook ordered all the boats to be hoiſted out, and the empty water-caſks to be got ready. In the mean time he landed, to ſearch for a convenient ſpot where they might be filled, and to obſerve what the place afforded.</p>
                     <p>He found vaſt quantities of penguins, and other birds, and ſeals, on the ſhore. The latter were
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030274_0078_0FE56B1E64BA86E0"/>
not numerous, but ſo inſenſible of fear, that we killed as many as we choſe, and made uſe of their fat and blubber to make oil for our lamps, and other purpoſes. Freſh water was exceedingly plentiful; but not a ſingle tree or ſhrub was to be diſcovered, and but little herbage of any kind; though we had flattered ourſelves with the hope of meeting with ſomething conſiderable growing here, having obſerved the ſides of ſome of the hills to be of a lively green.</p>
                     <p>Before Captain Cook returned to his ſhip, he aſcended a ridge of rocks, riſing one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, expecting, by that means, to obtain a view of the country; but before he had reached the top, ſo thick a fog came on, that it was with difficulty he could find his way down again. Towards the evening we hauled the ſeine at the head of the harbour, but caught no more than half a dozen ſmall fiſh; nor had we any better ſucceſs the next day, when we tried with hook and line. Our only reſource, therefore, for freſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, was birds, which were innumerable.</p>
                     <p>Though it was both foggy and rainy, on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 26th, we began to fill water, and to cut graſs for our cattle, which we found near the head of the harbour. The rivulets were ſwelled to ſuch a degree, by the rain that fell, that the ſides of the hills, bounding the harbour, appeared to be covered with a ſheet of water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:030274_0079_0FE56B1FEC6D6DA8"/>The people having laboured hard for two ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive days, and nearly completed our water, Captain Cook allowed them the 27th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as a day of reſt, to celebrate Chriſtmas. In conſequence of which, many of them went on ſhore, and made excurſions into the country, which they found deſolate and barren in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. In the evening one of them preſented a quart bottle to Captain Cook, which he had found on the north-ſide of the harbour, faſtened with ſome wire to a projecting rock. This bottle contained a piece of parchment, with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſcription:

                     <p>It is evident from this inſcription, that we were not the firſt Europeans who had viſited this harbour. Captain Cook ſuppoſes it to have been left by Monſieur de Boiſguehenneu, who went on ſhore the 13th of February 1772, the day that Monſieur de Kerguelen diſcovered this land; but the Captain appears to be for once miſtaken; for how could Monſieur de Boiſguehenneu, in the beginning of 1772, leave an inſcription which

                     <p>Captain Cook, as a memorial of our having been in this harbour, wrote on the other ſide of the parchment as follows:

                     <p>It is the firſt inlet that we meet with on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of Cape François, which forms the north ſide of the harbour, and is the northern point of this land. The ſituation ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes it from any of the other inlets; and, to make it ſtill more remarkable, its ſouth point terminates in a high rock, perforated quite through, forming an appearance like the arch of a bridge. The head of the harbour lies open to only two points of the compaſs, and theſe are covered by
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030274_0082_0FE56B2A792E7938"/>
iſlands in the offing, ſo that a ſea cannot fall in to hurt a ſhip. It is high water here about ten o'clock at the full and change days, and the tide riſes about four feet.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, Captain Cook, accompanied by Mr. King, his Second Lieutenant, went upon Cape François; expecting from this elevation to have had a view of the ſea-coaſt, and the iſlands lying off it. But they found every diſtant object below them, hid in a thick fog. The land even with them, or of a greater height, was viſible enough, and appeared exceedingly naked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate; except ſome hills to the ſouthward, which were covered with ſnow. When they returned to the ſhip, they found her unmoored, and ready to put to ſea; but we did not weigh anchor till five o'clock the next morning.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ON the 29th of December we ſailed out of Chriſtmas Harbour, ſteering ſouth-eaſt along the coaſt, with a fine breeze and clear weather. This was unexpected, as, for ſome time paſt, fogs had prevailed more or leſs every day. Though we kept the lead conſtantly going, we ſeldom ſtruck ground with a line of ſixty fathoms.</p>
                     <p>We were off a promontory, which Captain Cook called Cape Cumberland, about ſeven or eight o'clock. It lies about a league and an half from the ſouth point of Chriſtmas Harbour; between them is a good bay. Off Cape Cumberland is a ſmall iſland on the ſummit of which is a rock, reſembling a ſentry-box, which name was given to the iſland on that account. A group of ſmall iſlands and rocks lies two miles farther to the eaſtward: we ſailed between theſe and Sentry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030274_0084_0FE56B2DD6C5ECF0"/>
Iſland, the breadth of the channel being full a mile. We found no bottom with forty fathoms of line.</p>
                     <p>After paſſing through this channel, we ſaw a bay on the ſouth-ſide of Cape Cumberland, running in three leagues to the weſtward. It is formed by Cape Cumberland to the north, and by a promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the ſouth. Captain Cook named this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory Point Pringle, as a compliment to Sir John Pringle, Preſident of the Royal Society. The bottom of this bay was called Cumberland Bay.</p>
                     <p>The coaſt is formed into a fifth bay, to the ſouthward of Point Pringle. In this bay, which obtained the name of White Bay, are ſeveral leſſer bays or coves, which appeared to be ſheltered from all winds. Off the ſouth-point, ſeveral rocks raiſe their heads above water, and probably there are many others that do not.</p>
                     <p>The land which firſt opened off Cape François, in the direction of ſouth 53° eaſt, we had kept on our larboard-bow, thinking it was an iſland, and that we ſhould diſcover a paſſage between that and the main; but we found it to be a peninſula, joined to the reſt of the coaſt by a low iſthmus. The bay, formed by this peninſula, Captain Cook named Repulſe Bay. The northern point of the peninſula was named Howe's Foreland, in honor of Lord Howe.</p>
                     <p>Drawing near it, we obſerved ſome rocks and breakers not far from the north-weſt part, and two
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030274_0085_0FE56B31F39BDE48"/>
iſlands to the eaſtward of it, which, at firſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as one. We ſteered between them and the foreland, and were in the middle of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel by twelve o'clock. The land of this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or peninſula, is of a tolerable height, and of a hilly and rocky ſubſtance. The coaſt is low, and almoſt covered with ſea-birds. We alſo ſaw ſome ſeals upon the beaches.</p>
                     <p>Having cleared the rocks and iſlands before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, we perceived the whole ſea before us to be chequered with large beds of rock-weed, which was faſt to the bottom. There is often found a great depth of water upon ſuch ſhoals, and rocks have, as often, raiſed their heads al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the ſurface of the water. It is always dangerous to ſail over them, eſpecially when there is no ſurge of the ſea to diſcover the danger. We endeavoured to avoid the rocks, by ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the winding channels by which they were ſeparated. Though the lead was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally going, we never ſtruck ground with a line of ſixty fathoms; this increaſed the danger, as we could not anchor, however urgent the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity might be. At length we diſcovered a lurking rock, in the middle of one of theſe beds of weeds, and even with the ſurface of the ſea. This was ſufficiently alarming, to make us take every precaution to avoid danger.</p>
                     <p>We were now about eight miles to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Howe's Foreland, acroſs the mouth of a
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030274_0086_0FE56B346D3CF2A8"/>
large bay. In this bay are ſeveral rocks, low iſlands, and beds of ſea-weed; but there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be winding channels between them. We were ſo much embarraſſed with theſe ſhoals, that we hauled off to the eaſtward, in hopes of extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating ourſelves from our difficulties; but this plunged us into greater, and we found it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſecure the ſhips, if poſſible, before night, eſpecially as the weather was hazy, and a fog was apprehended.</p>
                     <p>Seeing ſome inlets to the ſouth-weſt, Captain Cook ordered Captain Clerke (the Diſcovery drawing leſs water than the Reſolution) to lead in for the ſhore, which was immediately attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: after running over the edges of ſeveral ſhoals, on which was found from ten to twenty fathoms water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Captain Clerke made the ſignal for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered an harbour, in which we anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fifteen ſathoms water, about five o'clock in the evening.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner were the ſhips ſecured, than it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to blow ſo very ſtrong, that we deemed it neceſſary to ſtrike top-gallant yards. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, however, continued fair, and it preſently became clear, the wind having diſperſed the fog that had ſettled on the hills. As ſoon, therefore, as we had anchored, Captain Cook ordered two boats to be hoiſted out; in one of which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Mr. Bligh, the Maſter, to ſurvey the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the harbour, and looking out for wood.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030274_0087_0FE56B35F3C48870"/>
He alſo deſired Captain Clerke to ſend his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſound the channel, ſouth of the ſmall iſles, and went himſelf, in his other boat, accompanied by Mr. Gore and Mr. Bailey, and landed on the north point, to ſee what diſcovery could be made from thence.</p>
                     <p>From an hill over the point, they had a view of the ſea-coſt, as far as Howe's Foreland. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmall iſlands, rocks, and breakers, were ſcattered along the coaſt, and there appeared no better channel to get out of the harbour, than that by which they had entered it.</p>
                     <p>While Captain Cook and Mr. Bailey were mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe obſervations, Mr. Gore encompaſſed the hill, and joined them at the place where the boat was attending for them. There was nothing to obſtruct their walk, except ſome craggy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices; the country being, if poſſible, more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and deſolate than that about Chriſtmas Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. There was neither food nor covering for cattle of any ſort, and, if any had been left, they muſt inevitably have periſhed. In the little cove, where their boat was waiting for them (which Captain Cook called Penguin Cove, from the immenſe numbers of thoſe birds appearing there) is a fine river of freſh water, which we could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach without difficulty. Some large ſeals, ſhags, and a few ducks were ſeen here; and Mr. Bailey had a glance of a very ſmall land-bird, but it flew among the rocks, and they loſt it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="unknown:030274_0088_0FE56B37D1AE6DA0"/>At nine o'clock they got on board, and Mr. Bligh returned ſoon after. He reported that he had been four miles up the harbour; that its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was weſt ſouth-weſt; that its breadth near the ſhips did not exceed a mile; that the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were from thirty-ſeven to ten fathoms; and that, having landed on both ſhores, he found the land barren and rocky, without a tree or ſhrub, or hardly any appearance of verdure.</p>
                     <p>The next morning we weighed anchor and put out to ſea. This harbour was named Port Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſer, in honour of Admiral Sir Hugh Palliſer. In getting out to ſea, we, in general, ſteered through the winding channels among the ſhoals, though we ſometimes ventured to run over ſome of them, on which we never found leſs than eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen fathoms water; they would not, therefore, have been diſcovered, had it not been for the ſea-weed growing upon them.</p>
                     <p>Having got three or four leagues from the coaſt we found a clear ſea, and, about nine o'clock, diſcovered a round hill, like a ſugar-loaf, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouth-eaſt, and a ſmall iſland to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, diſtant about four leagues. Captain Cook named the ſugar-loaf hill Mount Campbell; at noon it bore ſouth 47° weſt; a low point bore ſouth-eaſt, at the diſtance of about twenty miles; and we were little more than two leagues from the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="unknown:030274_0089_0FE56B3EC1823718"/>The land here, in general, is low and level. The mountains end about five leagues from the low point, leaving a great extent of low land, on which Mount Campbell is ſituated. Theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſeemed to be compoſed of naked rocks, whoſe ſummits were covered with ſnow; and nothing but ſterility was to be ſeen in the vallies.</p>
                     <p>At noon we perceived low land, opening off the low point juſt mentioned, in the direction of ſouth ſouth-eaſt. It proved to be the eaſtern extremity of this land, and was named Cape Digby. Between Howe's Foreland and Cape Digby, the ſhore forms one great bay, extending ſeveral leagues to the ſouth-weſt. A vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſea-weed grows over it, which ſeemed to be ſuch as Mr. Banks diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>fucus giganteus.</hi> Though the ſtem of this weed is not much thicker than a man's thumb, ſome of it grows to the amazing length of ſixty fathoms.</p>
                     <p>At one o'clock, ſeeing a ſmall bending in the coaſt, on the north ſide of Cape Digby, we ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, with an intention to anchor there; but, being diſappointed in our views, we puſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in order to ſee as much as poſſible of the coaſt before night. From Cape Digby, it trends nearly ſouth-weſt by ſouth to a low point, to which Captain Cook gave the name of Point Charlotte, in honour of our amiable Queen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:030274_0090_0FE56B40949EBB78"/>In the direction of ſouth ſouth-weſt, about ſix leagues from Cape Digby, is a pretty high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting point, called the Prince of Wales's Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and ſix leagues beyond that, in the ſame direction, is the moſt ſoutherly point of the whole coaſt, which, in honour of his Majeſty, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the name of Cape George.</p>
                     <p>Between Point Charlotte, and the Prince of Wales's Foreland, we diſcovered a deep inlet, which was called Royal Sound; and, advancing to the ſouth, we ſaw another inlet into the Royal Sound, on the ſouth-weſt ſide of the Prince of Wales's Foreland.</p>
                     <p>On the ſouth-weſt ſide of the Royal Sound, all the land to Cape George conſiſts of elevated hills, gradually riſing from the ſea to a conſiderable height; they were naked and barren, and their ſummits capt with ſnow. Not a veſtige of a tree or ſhrub was to be ſeen. Some of the low land about Cape Digby ſeemed to be covered with a green turf, but a conſiderable part of it appeared quite naked. Penguins, and other oceanic birds, were numerous on the beaches, and ſhags innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable kept flying about our ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Deſirous of getting the length of Cape George, Captain Cook continued to ſtretch to the ſouth, till between ſeven and eight o'clock; when, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no probability of accompliſhing his deſign, he took the advantage of the wind, which had ſhifted to weſt ſouth-weſt, (the direction in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030274_0091_0FE56B421C572850"/>
which we wanted to go) and ſtood away from the coaſt.</p>
                     <p>Cape George now bore ſouth 53° weſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about ſeven leagues. We ſaw no land to the ſouth of it, except a ſmall iſland that lies off the pitch of the Cape; and a ſouth-weſt ſwell, which we met when we brought the Cape to bear in this direction, almoſt convinced us that there was no more in that quarter.</p>
                     <p>The French diſcoverers imagined Cape Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çois to be the projecting point of a ſouthern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. The Engliſh have diſcovered that no ſuch continent exiſts, and that the land in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an iſland of ſmall extent; which, from its ſterility, might properly be called the Iſland of Deſolation; but Captain Cook was unwilling to rob Monſieur de Kerguelen of the honour of its bearing his name.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Anderſon, who, during the ſhort time we lay in Chriſtmas Harbour, loſt no opportunity of ſearching the country in every direction, relates the following particulars.</p>
                     <p>No place, (ſays he) hitherto diſcovered in either hemiſphere, affords ſo ſcanty a field for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt as this ſteril ſpot. Some verdure, indeed, appeared, when at a ſmall diſtance from the ſhore, which might raiſe the expectation of meeting with a little herbage; but all this lively appearance was occaſioned by one ſmall plant, reſembling ſaxifrage, which grew up the hills in large ſpead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

tufts, on a kind of rotten turf, which, if dried might ſerve for fuel, and was the only thing ſeen here that could poſſibly be applied to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Another plant, which grew to near the height of two feet, was pretty plentifully ſcattered about the boggy declivities; it had the appearance of a ſmall cabbage when it was ſhot into ſeeds. It had the watery acrid taſte of the antiſcorbutic plants, though it materially differed from the whole tribe. When eaten raw, it was not unlike the New-Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſcurvy-graſs; but when boiled, it acquired a rank flavour. At this time, none of its ſeeds were ripe enough to be brought home, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into our Engliſh kitchen-gardens.</p>
                     <p>Near the brooks and boggy places were found two other ſmall plants, which were eaten as ſallad; the one like garden creſſes, and very hot; and the other very mild: the latter is a curioſity, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only male and female, but alſo androgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus plants.</p>
                     <p>Some coarſe graſs grew pretty plentifully in a few ſmall ſpots near the harbour, which was cut down for our cattle. In ſhort, the whole cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of plants did not exceed eighteen, including a beautiful ſpecies of lichen, and ſeveral ſorts of moſs. Nor was there the appearance of a tree or ſhrub in the whole country.</p>
                     <p>Among the animals, the moſt conſiderable were ſeals, which were diſtinguiſhed by the name of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030274_0093_0FE56B4998DC7C98"/>
ſea-bears; being the ſort that are called the urſine ſeal. They come on ſhore to repoſe and breed. At that time they were ſhedding their hair, and ſo remarkably tame, that there was no difficulty in kelling them.</p>
                     <p>No other quadruped was ſeen; but a great number of oceanic birds, as ducks, ſhags, petrels, &amp;c. The ducks were ſomewhat like a widgeon, both in ſize and figure; a conſiderable number of them were killed and eaten: they were excellent food, and had not the leaſt fiſhy taſte.</p>
                     <p>The Cape petrel, the ſmall blue one, and the ſmall black one, or Mother Carey's chicken, were not in plenty here; but another ſort, which is the largeſt of the petrels, and called by the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Mother Carey's gooſe, is found in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. This petrel is as large as an albatroſs, and is carnivorous, feeding on the dead carcaſſes of ſeals, birds, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt number of birds here were pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guins, which conſiſt of three ſorts. The head of the largeſt is black, the upper part of the body of a leaden-grey, the under part white, and the feet black; two broad ſtripes of fine yellow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the head to the breaſt; the bill is of a reddiſh colour, and longer than in the other ſorts. The ſecond ſort is about half the ſize of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It is of a blackiſh grey on the upper part of the body, and has a white ſpot on the upper
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030274_0094_0FE56B4B2E8D4C20"/>
part of the head. The bill and feet are yellowiſh. In the third ſort, the upper part of the body and throat are black, the reſt white, except the top of the head, which is ornamented with a fine yellow arch, which it can erect as two creſts.</p>
                     <p>The ſhags here were of two ſorts, viz. the leſſer corvorant, or water-crow, and another with a blackiſh back and a white belly. The ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwallow, the tern, the common ſea-gull, and the Port Egmont hen, were alſo found here.</p>
                     <p>Large flocks of a ſingular kind of white bird flew about here, having the baſe of the bill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a horney cruſt. It had a black bill and white feet, was ſomewhat larger than a pigeon, and the fleſh taſted like that of a duck.</p>
                     <p>The ſeine was once hauled, when we found a few fiſh about the ſize of a ſmall haddock. The only ſhell-fiſh we ſaw here, were a few limpets and muſcles.</p>
                     <p>Many of the hills, notwithſtanding they were of a moderate height, were at that time covered with ſnow, though anſwering to our June. It is reaſonable to imagine that rain muſt be very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent here, as well from the marks of large tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents having ruſhed down, as from the appearance of the country, which, even on the hills, was a continued bog or ſwamp.</p>
                     <p>The rocks conſiſt principally of a dark blue and very hard ſtone, intermixed with particles of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030274_0095_0FE56B4CEAA4CF20"/>
glimmer or quartz. Some conſiderable rocks were alſo formed here from a browniſh brittle ſtone.</p>

                     <p>CAPTAIN Cook intending, purſuant to the inſtructions he had received, to proceed next to New-Zealand, to take in wood and water, and provide hay for the cattle, ſteered eaſt by north from Kerguelen's Land. The 31ſt of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, our longitude, by obſervation of the ſun and moon, was 72° 33′ 36″ eaſt; and on the firſt day of the year 1777, we were in the latitude of 48° 41′ ſouth, longitude 76° 50′ eaſt. Till the 3d of January the weather was tolerably clear, with freſh gales from the weſt and ſouth-weſt; but now the wind veered to the north, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030274_0096_0FE56B4EBA2BF7C0"/>
in that quarter eight days; during which, though there was at the ſame time a thick fog, we ran upwards of three hundred leagues, chiefly in the dark; the ſun, indeed, ſometimes made its appearance, but very rarely. On the 7th, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook diſpatched a boat with orders to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke, fixing their rendezvous at Adventure Bay, in Van Diemen's Land, if the ſhips ſhould happen to ſeparate before they arrived there. However, we had the good fortune not to loſe company with each other. On Sunday the 12th, the northerly winds were ſucceeded by a calm, which was ſoon followed by a ſoutherly wind. Our latitude was now 48° 40′ ſouth, longitude 110° 26′ eaſt. The wind blew from the ſouth a whole day, and then veering to the weſt and north-weſt, brought on ſome fair weather.</p>
                     <p>On the 19th, a ſudden ſquall carried away the Reſolution's fore-top-maſt, and main-top-gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt, which occaſioned ſome delay in fitting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther top-maſt. The former was repaired without the loſs of any part of it. The wind ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the weſt point, we had clear weather; and on the 24th, in the morning, we diſcovered the coaſt of Van Diemen's Land, bearing north ½ weſt. Several iſlands and elevated rocks lie diſperſed along the coaſt, the moſt ſoutherly of which is the Mewſtone. Our latitude, at noon, was 43° 47′ ſouth, longitude 147° eaſt, the ſouth-eaſt or ſouth cape being near three leagues diſtant. Captain
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030274_0097_0FE56B54815241C0"/>
Cook gave the name of the Eddyſtone to a rock that lies about a league to the eaſtward of Swilly Iſle or Rock, on account of its ſtriking reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to Eddyſtone light-houſe. Theſe two rocks may, even in the night, be ſeen at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance, and are the ſummits of a ledge of rocks under water. On the north-eaſt ſide of Storm Bay, are ſome creeks that ſeem tolerably ſheltered; and if this coaſt was carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſeveral good harbours would moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be found.</p>
                     <p>The 26th, at noon, a breeze ſprung up at ſouth-eaſt, which gave Captain Cook an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of executing his deſign of carrying the ſhips into Adventure Bay, where we anchored at four o'clock in the afternoon in twelve fathoms water, about three quarters of a mile from the ſhore. The Captains Cook and Clerke then went, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate boats, in ſearch of convenient ſpots for wooding, watering, and making hay. They found plenty of wood and water, but very little graſs. The next morning Captain Cook detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two parties, under the conduct of Lieutenant King, to the eaſt ſide of the bay, to cut wood and graſs, ſome marines atttending them as a guard, though none of the natives had yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. He alſo ſent the launch to provide water for the ſhips; and afterwards paid a viſit to the parties thus employed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="unknown:030274_0098_0FE56B5843251978"/>In the evening we drew the ſeine, and caught a great quantity of fiſh, with which this bay abounds; and we ſhould have procured more, if the net had not broken. Every one now came on board with the ſupplies they had obtained; but next morning, the wind not being fair for ſailing, they were again ſent on ſhore on the ſame duty; and Mr. Roberts, one of the Mates, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in a boat to examine the bay. We had obſerved columns of ſmoke in different parts, from the time of our approaching the coaſt; but we ſaw none of the natives till the afternoon of the 28th, when eight men and a boy ſurpriſed us with a viſit at our wooding-place. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached us with the greateſt confidence, none of them having any weapons except one, who had a ſhort ſtick pointed at one end. They were of a middling ſtature, and ſomewhat ſlender; their hair was black and wholly, and their ſkin was alſo black. They were entirely naked, with large punctures or ridges, ſome in curved, and others in ſtraight lines, on different parts of their bodies. Their lips were not remarkably thick, nor their noſes very flat: their features, on the contrary, were not unpleaſing, their eyes pretty good, and their teeth tolerably even and regular, though exceedingly dirty. The faces of ſome of them were painted with a red ointment, and moſt of them ſmeared their hair and beards with the ſame compoſition. When we offered them preſents,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030274_0099_0FE56B59CA1E83E0"/>
they received them without any apparent ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. They either returnrd, or threw away ſome bread that was given them, without even taſting it: they likewiſe refuſed ſome elephant fiſh; but when we gave them ſome birds, they kept them. Two pigs having been brought on ſhore to be left in the woods, they ſeized them by the ears, and ſeemed inclined to carry them off, with an intention, as we ſuppoſed, of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook wiſhing to know the uſe of the ſtick which one of the ſavages held in his hand, made ſigns to them to ſhew him; upon which one of them took aim at a piece of wood placed as a mark, about the diſtance of twenty-yard; but, after ſeveral eſſays, he was ſtill wide of the mark. Omai, to ſhew the great ſuperiority of our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, immediately fired his muſquet at it, which unexpected noiſe ſo alarmed them, that they ran into the woods with uncommon ſpeed; and one of them was ſo terrified, that he let fall two knives and an axe which he had received from us. They then went to the place where the crew of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery were watering; but the officer of that party firing a muſquet in the air, they ſled with great precipitation.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after they had retired, Captain Cook ordered the two pigs, one a male and the other a female, to be carried about a mile within the woods, and he himſelf ſaw them left there,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030274_0100_0FE56B5BC419CA18"/>
taking care that none of the natives ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what was paſſing. He alſo intended to have left a young bull and a cow, beſides ſome goats and ſheep; but he ſoon relinquiſhed that deſign, being of opinion that the natives would deſtroy them; which he ſuppoſed would be the fate of the pigs, if they ſhould chance to find them out. But as ſwine ſoon become wild, and are fond of being in the woods, it is probable that they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The other cattle could not have remained long concealed from the ſavages, as they muſt have been put into an open place.</p>
                     <p>We were prevented from ſailing on the 29th by a dead calm, which continued the whole day. Captain Cook, therefore, ſent parties on ſhore to cut wood and graſs, as uſual; and he accompanied the wooding party himſelf. Soon after our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about twenty of them joined us, one of whom was diſtinguiſhed not only by his deformity, but by the drollery of his geſticulations, and the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humour of his ſpeeches, which, however, we could not underſtand. Thoſe whom we now ſaw differed in ſome reſpects, particularly in the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the hair, from the natives of the more northerly parts of this country, whom Captain Cook met with in his firſt voyage. Some of our preſent company had a ſlip of the kangooroo ſkin round their ancles; and others wore round their necks ſome ſmall cord, made of fur. They ſeemed not to value iron, but were apparently pleaſed
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030274_0101_0FE56B615F023B80"/>
with the medals and beads that were given them. They did not even appear to know the uſe of fiſh-hooks, though it is more than probable, that they were acquainted with ſome method of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Their habitations were ſmall hovels or ſheds built of ſticks, and covered with the bark of trees. We had alſo good reaſon to ſuppoſe, that they ſometimes took up their reſidence in the trunks of large trees, hollowed out by fire.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook, on leaving the wooding party, went to the graſs-cutters, and having ſeen the boats loaded with hay, returned on board. He had juſt quitted the ſhore, when ſeveral women and children appeared, and were introduced to Lieutenant King by the men who accompanied them. Theſe females wore a kangooroo ſkin faſtened over their ſhoulders, the only uſe of which ſeemed to be, to ſupport their children on their backs, for it left thoſe parts uncovered which modeſty directs us to conceal. Their bodies were black, and marked with ſcars like thoſe of the men; from whom, however, they differed, in having their heads ſhaved; ſome of them being completely ſhorn, others only on one ſide, while the reſt of them had the upper part of their heads ſhaved, leaving a very narrow circle of hair all round. They were far from being handſome; however, ſome of our gentlemen paid their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030274_0102_0FE56B62E6BD1D40"/>
to them, and made liberal offers, but without effect.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon Captain Cook went again on ſhore, and found the graſs-cutters on Penguin Iſland, where they had met with excellent graſs in the greateſt abundance. The different parties laboured hard till the evening, and then, having provided a ſufficient quantity of what was moſt wanted, returned on board.</p>
                     <p>During our continuance in Van Diemen's Land, we had either light airs from the eaſt, or calms: we therefore loſt little or no time by touching on this coaſt. This land was diſcovered in Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1642, by Taſman, who gave it the name of Van Diemen's Land. Captain Furneaux touched at it in March 1773. It is the ſouthern point of New-Holland, which is by far the largeſt iſland in the known world, and almoſt deſerves the name of a continent. The land is diverſified with hills and vallies, and well wooded. The only wind to which Adventure Bay is expoſed, is the north-eaſt; and, upon the whole, this may be conſidered as a very ſafe road. Its latitude is 43° 21′ 20″ ſouth, and its longitude 147° 29′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Anderſon, ſurgeon of the Reſolution, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelf in examining the country during our continuance in Adventure Bay. His remarks on the inhabitants and their language, and his account of the natural productions of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are to the following purport. There is a
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030274_0103_0FE56B646E592878"/>
beautiful ſandy beach, about two miles long, at the bottom of Adventure Bay, formed to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance by the particles which the ſea waſhes from a fine white ſand-ſtone. This beach is very well adapted for hauling a ſeine. Behind it is a plain, with a brackiſh lake, out of which we caught, by angling, ſome bream and trout. The parts adjoining the bay are moſtly hilly, and are an entire foreſt of tall trees, rendered almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable by brakes of fern, ſhrubs, &amp;c. The ſoil on the flat land, and on the lower part of the hills, is ſandy, or conſiſts of a yellowiſh earth, and in ſome parts of a reddiſh clay; but further up the hills, it is of a grey tough caſt. This country, upon the whole, bears many marks of being very dry, and the heat appears to be great. No mineral bodies, nor ſtones of any other kind than the white ſand ſtone, were obſerved by us; nor could we find any vegetables that afforded ſubſiſtence for man. The foreſt-trees are all of one kind, and generally quite ſtraight: they bear cluſters of ſmall white flowers. The principal plants we obſerved were wood-ſorrel, milk-wort, cudweed, bell-flower, gladiolus, ſamphire, and ſeveral kinds of fern. The only quadruped we ſaw diſtinctly was a ſpecies of opoſſum, about twice the ſize of a large rat. The kangooroo, found further northward in New Holland, may alſo be ſuppoſed to inhabit here, as ſome of the inhabitants had pieces of the ſkin of that animal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:030274_0104_0FE56B66419E9CA0"/>The principal ſorts of birds in the woods are brown hawks or eagles, crows, large pigeons, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh paroquets, and a ſpecies which we called <hi>motacilla cyanea,</hi> from the beautiful azure colour of its head and neck. On the ſhore were ſeveral gulls, black oyſter-catchers, or ſea-pies, and plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of a ſtone-colour.</p>
                     <p>We obſerved in the woods ſome blackiſh ſnakes that were pretty large, and we killed a lizard which was fifteen inches long and ſix round, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully clouded with yellow and black.</p>
                     <p>Among a variety of fiſh we caught ſome large rays, nurſes, leather-jackets, bream, ſoles, floun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, gurnards, and elephant-fiſh; beſides a ſort which we did not recollect to have ſeen before, and which partakes of the nature both of a round and a flat fiſh. Upon the rocks are muſcles and other ſhell-fiſh; and upon the beach we found ſome pretty Meduſa's heads. The moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inſects we met with were the muſquitoes, and a large black ant, whoſe bite inflicts extreme pain.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants ſeemed mild and chearful, with little of that wild appearance that ſavages in general have. They are almoſt totally devoid of perſonal activity or genius, and are nearly upon a par with the wretched natives of Terra del Fuego. They diſplay, however, ſome contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in their method of cutting their arms and bodies in lines of different directions, raiſed above
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030274_0105_0FE56B6A33E09038"/>
the ſurface of the ſkin. Their indifference for our preſents, their general inattention, and want of curioſity, were very remarkable, and teſtified no acuteneſs of underſtanding. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion is a dull black, which they ſometimes heighten by ſmutting their bodies, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, from their leaving a mark behind on any clean ſubſtance. Their hair is perfectly woolly and is clotted with greaſe and red ochre, like that of the Hottentots. Their noſes are broad and full, and the lower part of the face projects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably. Their eyes are of a moderate ſize, and though they are not very quick or piercing, they give the countenance a frank, chearful, and pleaſing caſt. Their teeth are not very white, nor well ſet, and their mouths are too wide: they wear their beards long, and clotted with paint. They are, upon the whole, well proportioned, though their belly is rather protuberant. Their favourite attitude is to ſtand with one ſide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and one hand graſping, acroſs the back, the oppoſite arm, which, on this occaſion, hangs, down by the ſide that projects.</p>
                     <p>Near the ſhore in the bay, we obſerved ſome wretched conſtructions of ſticks covered with bark; but theſe ſeemed to have been only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and they had converted many of their largeſt trees into more comfortable and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious habitations. The trunks of theſe were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed out to the height of ſix or ſeven feet, by

                     </argument>
                     <p>ON the 30th of January, in the morning, we weighed anchor with a light weſterly breeze, from Adventure Bay. Soon after we had put to ſea, the wind became ſoutherly, and produced a perfect ſtorm; but veering in the evening to the eaſt and north-eaſt, its fury began to abate. This wind was attended with an almoſt-intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heat, which, however, was of ſo ſhort a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, that ſome of our company did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
                     <p>In the night, between the 6th and 7th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, one of the Diſcovery's marines fell over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board and was drowned. On the 10th, in the afternoon, we deſcried the coaſt of New-Zealand, at the diſtance of eight or nine leagues. We then ſteered for Cape Farewell, and afterwards for Stephens's Iſland; and, in the morning of the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030274_0110_0FE56B761A6E3C40"/>
12th, anchored in Ship Cove, Queen Charlotte's Sound. We ſoon after landed many empty water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſks, and cleared a place for two obſervatories. In the mean time ſeveral canoes came along-ſide of our ſhips; but very few of thoſe who were in them would venture on board. This ſhyneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the more extraordinary, as Captain Cook was well known to all of them; and as one man in particular among the preſent group, had been treated by him with diſtinguiſhed kindneſs dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a former voyage. This man, however, could not by any means be prevailed on to come aboard. We could only account for this reſerve by ſuppoſing, that they were apprehenſive of our revenging the death of Captain Furneaux's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who had been killed here. But, upon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook's aſſuring them of the continuance of his friendſhip, and that he ſhould not moleſt them on that account, they ſoon laid aſide all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſuſpicion and diſtruſt. The next day we pitched two tents, and erected the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatories, in which Meſſrs. King and Baily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately commenced their aſtronomical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Two of our men were employed in brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpruce beer; while others filled the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſks, collected graſs for the cattle, and cut wood. Thoſe who remained on board were occupied in repairing the rigging, and performing the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty of the ſhips. A guard of marines was appointed for the protection of the different par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030274_0111_0FE56B77A3F0E998"/>
on ſhore, and arms were given to all the workmen, to repel all attacks from the natives, if they had been inclined to moleſt us; but this did not appear to be the caſe.</p>
                     <p>During the courſe of this day, many families came from various parts of the coaſt, and erected their huts cloſe to our encampment. The faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with which they build theſe temporary habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is remarkable. They have been ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en to erect above twenty of them on a ſpot of ground, which was covered with plants and ſhrubs not an hour before. Captain Cook was preſent when a number of ſavages landed, and built a village of this kind. They had no ſooner leaped from the canoes, than they tore up the ſhrubs and plants from the ground they had fixed upon, or put up ſome part of the framing of a hut. While the men were thus employed, the women took care of the canoes, ſecured the proviſions and utenſils, and gathered dry ſticks, to ſerve as materials for a fire. Theſe huts are ſufficiently calculated for affording ſhelter from the rain and wind. The ſame tribe or family, however large, generally aſſociate and build together; ſo that their towns and villages are uſually divided by paliſades into ſeparate diſtricts.</p>
                     <p>We received conſiderable advantage from the natives coming to live with us; for, every day, ſome of them were occupied in catching fiſh, a good ſhare of which we generally procured by
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030274_0112_0FE56B792D32E088"/>
exchanges. Beſides fiſh, we had other refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in abundance. Scurvy-graſs, celery, and portable ſoup, were boiled every day with the wheat and peaſe; and we had ſpruce beer for our drink. Such a regimen ſoon removed all ſeeds of the ſcurvy from our people, if any of them had contracted it. But indeed, on our arrival here, we had only two invalids in both ſhips.</p>
                     <p>We were occaſionally viſited by other natives, beſides thoſe who lived cloſe to us. Their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of traffic were fiſh, curioſities, and women; the two firſt of which were ſpeedily diſpoſed of, but the latter did not come to a good market, as our crew had conceived a diſlike to them. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook obſerves upon this occaſion, that he connived at a connection with women, becauſe he could not prevent it; but that he never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged it, becauſe he dreaded its conſequences. Among our occaſional viſitors was a chief called Kahoora, who headed the party that cut off Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Furneaux's people. He was far from being beloved by his countrymen, ſome of whom even importuned Captain Cook to kill him, at the ſame time expreſſing their diſapprobation of him in the ſevereſt terms. A ſtriking proof of the diviſions that prevail among theſe people occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us; for the inhabitants of each village, by turns, ſolicited our Commodore to deſtroy the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:030274_0113_0FE56B806C1A5FF0"/>Captain Cook, on the 15th, went in a boat to ſearch for graſs, and viſited the hippah, or forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied village, at the ſouth-weſt point of the iſland of Motuara. He obſerved no inhabitants at this village, though there were evident marks of its having been lately occupied, the houſes and pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades being in a ſtate of good repair. Not the ſmalleſt veſtage remained of the Engliſh garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds which had been planted at this hippah in 1773, during Captain Cook's ſecond voyage. They had probably been all rooted out to make room for buildings; for, at the other gardens then planted, we found radiſhes, onions, leeks, cabbages, purſlain, potatoes, &amp;c. Though the natives of New-Zealand are fond of the laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned root, they had not planted a ſingle one, much leſs any of the other articles we had introduced among them.</p>
                     <p>Early in the morning of the 16th, the Captains Cook and Clerke, and ſeveral of the officers and ſailors, accompanied by Omai and two New-Zealanders, ſet out, in five boats, to collect fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the cattle. Having proceeded about three leagues up the Sound, they landed on the eaſt ſide, where they cut a ſufficient quantity of graſs to load the two launches. On their return down the Sound, they paid a viſit to Graſs Cove, the place where Captain Furneaux's people had been maſſacred. They here met with Captain Cook's old friend Pedro, who is mentioned by him in
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030274_0114_0FE56B82392F8AA8"/>
the hiſtory of his ſecond voyage. He, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther New-Zealander, received them on the beach, armed with the ſpear and patoo, though not without manifeſt ſigns of fear. Their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, however, were quickly diſſipated by a few preſents, which brought down to the ſhore two or three others of the family.</p>
                     <p>During the continuance of our party at this place, the Commodore, being deſirous of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the particular circumſtances relative to the maſſacre of our countrymen, fixed upon Omai as an interpreter for that purpoſe, as his language was a dialect of that of New-Zealand. Pedro, and the other natives who were preſent, none of whom had been concerned in that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate tranſaction, anſwered every queſtion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve. Their information imported, that while our people were at dinner, ſome of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſtole, or ſnatched from them, ſome fiſh and bread, for which offence they received ſome blows; a quarrel immediately enſued, and two of the ſavages were ſhot dead, by the only two muſquets that were firred; for, before a third was diſcharged, the natives ruſhed furiouſly upon our people, and being ſuperior in number, deſtroyed them all. Pedro and his companions alſo pointed out the very ſpot where the <hi>fracas</hi> happened, and the place where the boat lay, in which a black ſervant of Captain Furneaux had been left to take care of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="unknown:030274_0115_0FE56B83C6D26620"/>According to another account, this negro was the occaſion of the quarrel; for, one of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſtealing ſomething out of the boat, the black gave him a violent blow with a ſtick. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen hearing his cries at ſome diſtance ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined he was killed, and immediately attacked our people, who, before they could reach the boat, or prepare themſelves againſt the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected aſſault, fell a ſacrifice to the fury of the exaſperated ſavages.</p>
                     <p>The former of theſe accounts was corroborated by the teſtimony of many other natives, who could have no intereſt in diſguiſing the truth. The latter account <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſts upon the authority of the young New-Zealander, who quitted his country for the ſake of going away with us, and who, therefore, could not be ſuppoſed to be inclined to deceive us. As they all agreed, that the fray happened while the boat's crew were at dinner, both the accounts may be true; for it is by no means improbable, that, while ſome of the iſland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were ſtealing from the man who had been left to guard the boats, others might take equal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with thoſe who were on ſhore.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that there was no premeditated plan of bloodſhed, and that, if theſe thefts had not been rather too haſtily reſented, all miſchief would have been avoided; for Kahoora's greateſt enemies acknowledged, that he had no previous intention of quarrelling. With regard to the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030274_0116_0FE56B859ADDB368"/>
boat, ſome ſaid, that it had been pulled to pieces and burnt; while others aſſerted, that it had been carried off by a party of ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>Our party continued at Graſs Cove till the evening, and then embarked to return to the ſhips. They had ſcarcely left the ſhore, when the wind began to blow violently at north-weſt, ſo that it was not without great difficulty that they could reach the ſhips, where ſome of the boats did not arrive till the next morning; and it was very fortunate that they got on board then, for ſoon afterwards a perfect ſtorm aroſe. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the evening, however, the wind veering to the eaſt, brought on fair weather. On Tueſday the 18th, Pedro and his whole family came to reſide near us. The proper name of this chief was Matahouah; but ſome of Captain Cook's people had given him the appellation of Pedro in a former voyage. On the 20th we had another ſtorm, of leſs duration than the former, but more violent; in conſequence of which, both our ſhips ſtruck their yards and top-maſts. Theſe tempeſts are frequent here; and the nearer the ſhore, the more ſenſible are their effects.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 21ſt, a tribe or family of about thirty perſons came from the upper part of the ſound to viſit us. Their chief was named To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matongeauooranuc: he was about the age of forty-five, and had a frank, chearful countenance; and, indeed, the reſt of his tribe were, upon the

whole, the handſomeſt of all the New-Zealanders that Captain Cook had ever ſeen. By this time upwards of two-thirds of the natives of Queen Charlotte's Sound had ſettled near us, numbers of whom daily reſorted to the ſhips, and our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment on ſhore; but the latter was moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, during the time when our people there were making ſeal blubber; for the ſavages were ſo fond of train oil, that they reliſhed the very dreg of the caſks, and ſkimmings of the kettle, and conſidered the pure ſtinking oil as a moſt delightful feaſt.</p>
                     <p>When we had procured a competent ſupply of hay, wood, and water, we ſtruck our tents, and the next morning, which was the 24th, weighed out of the Cove. But the wind not being ſo fair as we could have wiſhed, we were obliged to caſt anchor again near the Iſle of Motuara. While we were getting under ſail, Tomatongeau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oranuc, Matahouah, and many others of the natives, came to take leave of us. Theſe two chiefs hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requeſted Captain Cook to preſent them with ſome hogs and goats, he gave to Tomatongeau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ooranuc two pigs, a boar and a ſow; and to Matahouah two goats, a male and female, after they had promiſed not to deſtroy them. As for the animals, which Captain Furneaux had left <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ere, Captain Cook was now told, that they were all dead; but he was afterwards informed, by the two New-Zealand youths who went away with
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030274_0118_0FE56B8C5953E6E8"/>
us, that Tiratou a popular chief, had in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion many cocks and hens, beſides a ſow.</p>
                     <p>Before we had been long at anchor near Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuara, ſeveral canoes, filled with natives, came towards us, and we carried on a briſk trade with them for the curioſities of this place. In one of theſe canoes was Kahoora, whom Omai imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately pointed out to Captain Cook, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him to ſhoot that chief; he alſo threatened to be himſelf his executioner, if he ſhould ever preſume to pay us another viſit. Theſe menaces of Omai had ſo little influence upon Kahoora, that he returned to us the next morning, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his whole family. Omai, having obtained Captain Cook's permiſſion to aſk him to come on board, introduced him into the cabin, ſaying, "There is Kahoora; diſpatch him." But, fearing perhaps that he ſhould be called upon to put his former threats in execution, he inſtantly retired. He ſoon, however, returned; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the chief was unhurt, he earneſtly remonſtrated to Captain Cook on the ſubject, ſaying, that if a man killed another in England, he was hanged for it; but that Kahoora had killed ten, and therefore juſtly deſerved death. Theſe arguments, however plauſible, had no weight with our Commodore, who deſired Omai to aſk the New-Zealand chief, why he had deſtroyed Captain Furneaux's people? Kahoora, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this queſtion, hung down his head, folded
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030274_0119_0FE56B8DE1D03C18"/>
his arms, and ſeemed in expectation of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death: but, as ſoon as he was aſſured of ſafety, he became chearful. He appeared, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unwilling to anſwer the queſtion which had been put to him, till after repeated promiſes that no violence ſhould be offered him. He then ventured to inform us, that one of the natives having brought a ſtone hatchet for the purpoſe of traffic, the perſon to whom it was offered took it, and refuſed either to return it, or give any thing in exchange; upon which the owner of it ſeized ſome bread by way of equivalent; and this gave riſe to the quarrel that enſued. He alſo mentioned, that he himſelf, during the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance, had a narrow eſcape; for a muſquet was levelled at him, which he found means to avoid by ſkulking behind the boat; and another man, who happened to ſtand cloſe to him, was ſhot dead: upon which Kahoora attacked Mr. Rowe, the officer who commanded the party, who defended himſelf with his hanger, with which he gave the chief a wound in the arm, till he was overpowered by ſuperiority of numbers. Mr. Burney, whom Captain Furneaux diſpatched the next day with an armed party in ſearch of his people who were miſſing, had, upon diſcovering the melancholy proofs of this cataſtrophe, fired ſeveral vollies among the natives who were ſtill on the ſpot, and were probably partaking of the horrid banquet of human fleſh. It was reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030274_0120_0FE56B8F950D1190"/>
to ſuppoſe that this firing was not ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; but upon inquiry it appeared, that not a ſingle perſon had been killed, or even hurt, by the ſhot which Mr. Burney's people had diſcharged.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the natives we had met with, expected that Captain Cook would take vengeance on Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoora for his concern in the maſſacre; and many of them not only wiſhed it, but teſtified their ſurpriſe at the Captain's forbearance and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. As the chief muſt have known this, it was a matter of aſtoniſhment that he ſo often put himſelf in the power of our Commodore. His two laſt viſits, in particular, were made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances, that he could not have flattered himſelf with a proſpect of eſcaping, had the Captain been inclined to detain him: and yet, when his firſt fears, on being queſtioned, had ſubſided, ſo far was he from entertaining uneaſy ſenſations, that, on ſeeing in the cabin a portrait of a New-Zealander, he deſired that his own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might be taken, and ſat till Mr. Webber had finiſhed his portrait, without the ſmalleſt token of impatience. Captain Cook admired his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and was pleaſed with the confidence which he repoſed in him; for he placed his whole ſafety in the uniform declarations of the Captain, that he had always been a friend to the natives, and would continue in the ſame ſentiments till they gave him reaſon to behave otherwiſe; that he ſhould think no more of their barbarous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030274_0121_0FE56B956B278410"/>
of our countrymen, as that tranſaction had happened long ago; but that, if they ſhould ever venture to make a ſecond attempt of that kind, they might reſt aſſured of meeting with an adequate puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Before our arrival in New-Zealand, Omai had expreſſed a deſire of taking one of the natives with him to his own country. He ſoon had an opportunity of gratifying his inclination, for a youth named Taweiharooa, the only ſon of a deceaſed chief, offered to accompany him, and took up his reſidence on board. Captain Cook cauſed it to be made known to him and all his friends, that if the youth departed with us, he would never return. This declaration, however, had no effect. The day before we quitted the Cove, Tiratouton, his mother, came to receive her laſt preſent from Omai; and the ſame even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe and her ſon parted, with all the marks of the tendereſt affection. But ſhe ſaid ſhe would weep no more, and faithfully kept her word; for the next morning, when ſhe returned to take her laſt farewell of Taweiharooa, ſhe was quite chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful all the time ſhe remained on board, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with great unconcern. A boy of about ten years of age accompanied Taweiharooa as a ſervant; his name was Kokoa. He was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Captain Cook by his own father, who part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him with ſuch indifference, as to ſtrip him, and leave him entirely naked. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030274_0122_0FE56B96F4FECD90"/>
having in vain endeavoured to convince theſe people of the great improbability of theſe youths ever returning home, at length conſented to their going.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of New-Zealand ſeem to live under continual apprehenſions of being deſtroyed by each other; moſt of their tribes having, as they think, ſuſtained injuries from ſome other tribe, which they are ever eager to revenge: and it is not improbable, that the deſire of a good meal is frequently a great incitement. They ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſteal upon the adverſe party in the night, and if they chance to find them unguarded, which is ſeldom the caſe, they kill every one without diſtinction, without ſparing even the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children: when they have completed the inhuman maſſacre, they either gorge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the ſpot, or carry off as many dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as they can, and feaſt on them at home, with the moſt horrid acts of brutality. If they are diſcovered before they have time to execute their ſanguinary purpoſe, they uſually ſteal off again, and ſometimes they are purſued and attacked by the adverſe party, in their turn. They never give quarter, or take priſoners, ſo that the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed muſt truſt to flight alone for ſafety. From this ſtate of perpetual hoſtility, and this deſtructive mode of carrying it on, a New-Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander derives ſuch habitual vigilance and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, that he is ſcarce ever off his guard:
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030274_0123_0FE56B988186DE80"/>
and, indeed, theſe people have the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motives to be vigilant, as the preſervation of both ſoul and body depends on it; for it is a part of their creed, that the ſoul of the man whoſe fleſh is devoured by his enemies, is condemned to an inceſſant fire; while the ſoul of him whoſe body has been reſcued from thoſe that ſlew him, as well as the ſouls of thoſe who die a natural death, aſcend to the manſions of the gods. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook having aſked them, whether they eat the fleſh of ſuch friends as had loſt their lives in war, but whoſe bodies had been prevented from falling into the enemy's hands, they anſwered in the negative, and expreſſed their abhorrence of the idea.</p>
                     <p>Their ordinary method of diſpoſing of their dead is to commit their bodies to the earth; but when they have more of their ſlain enemies than they can conveniently eat, they throw them into the ſea. There are no <hi>morais,</hi> or other places of public worſhip, among them; but they have prieſts, who pray to the gods for the ſucceſs of their temporal affairs. The principles of their religion, of which we know but little, are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtilled into them from their infancy. We obſerved a remarkable inſtance of this in a youth, who abſtained from eating during the greateſt part of the day, merely on account of his hair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut, though every method was practiſed that could induce him to change his reſolution. He
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030274_0124_0FE56B9A52D2DCE8"/>
ſaid that the <hi>eatooa,</hi> or deity, would kill him if he eat any thing on that day. Towards the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, his religious ſcruples gave way to the importunate cravings of appetite, and he eat, though ſparingly.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the divided ſtate in which theſe people live, travelling ſtrangers, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are honourable, are well received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; but it is expected that they will remain no longer than their buſineſs requires. It is thus that a trade for green talc, which they call <hi>poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nammoo,</hi> is carried on. They informed us, that none of this ſtone is to be found, except at a place which bears its name, near the head of Queen Charlotte's Sound. We were told many fabulous and improbable ſtories concerning this ſtone, one of which is, that it is originally a fiſh, which they ſtrike with a gig in the water, and having tied a rope to it, drag it to the ſhore, to which they faſten it, and it afterwards hardens into a ſtone. As it is fiſhed out of a large lake, it is probable that it may be brought from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and depoſited in the water, by means of the torrents. This lake is called by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants <hi>Tavai Poenammoo,</hi> or the water of green talc.</p>
                     <p>The New-Zealanders have adopted polygamy among them; and it is common for one man to have two or three wives. The women are ripe for marriage at an early age; and thoſe who are
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030274_0125_0FE56B9EABCC3050"/>
unmarried, find difficulty in procuring ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>Theſe people ſeem perfectly contented with the ſmall degree of knowledge they poſſeſs, for they make no attempts to improve it. They are not remarkably curious, nor do new objects ſtrike them with much ſurpriſe, for they ſcarce fix their attention for a moment. Omai, indeed, being a great favourite with them, would ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a circle about him; but they liſtened to his ſpeeches with very little eagerneſs.</p>
                     <p>On our inquiring of Taweiharooa, how many ſhips, reſembling ours, had ever arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound, or in its neighbourhood, he gave us an account of one entirely unknown to us. This veſſel, he ſaid, had put into a harbour on the north-weſt coaſt of Teerawitte, a few years before Captain Cook arrived in the Sound in the Endeavour. He further informed us, that the Captain of her, during his continuance here, had cohabited with a female of the country, who had borne him a ſon that was ſtill living. He alſo mentioned, that this ſhip firſt introduced the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal diſeaſe among the natives of New-Zealand. This dreadful diſorder is now but too common among them. The only method they put in practice as a remedy, is to give the patient the uſe of a kind of hot bath, produced by the ſteam of certain green plants placed over hot ſtones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="unknown:030274_0126_0FE56BA0E11BC8C8"/>Taweiharooa's intelligence induced us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a ſhip had really been at Teerawitte previous to Captain Cook's arrival in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as it correſponded with what the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had formerly heard; for, towards the latter end of 1773, ſome of the natives informed him of a ſhip's having put into a port on the coaſt of Teerawitte.</p>
                     <p>We had another piece of information from Taweiharooa, importing that their are here ſnakes and lizard of an enormous ſize. The latter were deſcribed by him as being eight feet long, and equal to a man's body in circumference. He ſaid that they burrow in the ground; that they ſometimes ſeize and devour men, and are killed by making fires at the mouths of their holes. We could not miſunderſtand him with reſpect to the animal; for, in order to ſhew us what he meant, he drew, with his own hand, very good repreſentations of a lizard and ſnake on a piece of paper.</p>
                     <p>Though much has been ſaid concerning this country and its inhabitants, in the accounts of Captain Cook's two former voyages, yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of Mr. Anderſon, being the reſult of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate obſervation, muſt not be conſidered as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuperfluous. The reader will find them in the ſucceeding chapter.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ABOUT Queen Charlotte's Sound the land is uncommonly mountainous, riſing immediately from the ſea into large hills. At remote diſtances are vallies, terminating each towards the ſea in a ſmall cove, with a pebbly or ſandy beach; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind which are flat places, where the natives uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally built their huts. This ſituation is the more convenient, as a brook of fine water runs through every cove, and empties itſelf into the ſea.</p>
                     <p>The baſes of theſe mountains, towards the ſhore, are conſtituted of a brittle yellowiſh ſand-ſtone, which acquires a blueiſh caſt where it is laved by the ſea. At ſome places it runs in horizontal, and, at others, in oblique ſtrata. The mould or ſoil by which it is covered reſembles marle, and is, in general, a foot or two in thickneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="unknown:030274_0128_0FE56BA46440C6E8"/>The luxuriant growth of the productions here, ſufficiently indicates the quality of the ſoil. The hills, except a few towards the ſea, are one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued foreſt of lofty trees, flouriſhing with ſuch uncommon vigour, as to afford an auguſt proſpect to the admirers of the ſublime and beautiful works of nature.</p>
                     <p>This extraordinary ſtrength in vegetation is, doubtleſs, greatly aſſiſted by the agreeable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the climate; for, at this time, though anſwering to our month of Auguſt, the weather was not ſo warm as to be diſagreeable; nor did it raiſe the thermometer, higher than 66°. The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo ſeems equally mild with reſpect to cold; for in the month which correſponds to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, the mercury was never lower than 48°, the trees at the ſame time retaining their verdure, as if in the height of ſummer. It is ſuppoſed their foliage remains, till puſhed off in ſpring by the ſucceeding leaves.</p>
                     <p>Though the weather is generally good, it is ſometimes windy, with heavy rain; which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is never exceſſive, and does not laſt above a day. In ſhort, this would be one of the fineſt countries upon earth, were it not ſo extremely hilly; which, ſuppoſing the woods to be cleared away, would leave it leſs proper for paſturage than flat land, and infinitely leſs ſo for cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which could never be effected here by the plough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:030274_0129_0FE56BAA6CD3CCB0"/>The large trees on the hills are principally of two ſorts. One of them, of the ſize of our largeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>irs, grows nearly after their manner. This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the place of ſpruce in making beer; which we did, with a decoction of its leaves fermented with ſugar or treacle; and this liquor was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be little inferior to American ſpruce-beer. The other ſort of tree is like a maple, and often grows very large, but is fit only for fuel; the wood of that, and of the preceding, being too heavy for maſts, yards, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A greater variety of trees grow on the flats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the beaches: two of theſe bear a kind of plumb, of the ſize of prunes; the one, which is yellow, is called karraca, and the other, which is black, called maitao; but neither of them had a pleaſant taſte, though eaten both by our people and the natives.</p>
                     <p>On the eminences which jut out into the ſea, grows a ſpecies of philadelphus, and a tree bearing flowers almoſt like myrtle. We uſed the leaves of the philadelphus as tea, and found them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſubſtitute for the oriental ſort.</p>
                     <p>A kind of wild celery, which grows plentifully in almoſt every cove, may be reckoned among the plants that were uſeful to us; and another that we uſed to call ſcurvy-graſs. Both ſorts were boiled daily with wheat ground in a mill, for the people's breakfaſt, and with their peaſe-ſoup for dinner. Sometimes alſo they were uſed as ſalled,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030274_0130_0FE56BAC2A9BB318"/>
or dreſſed as greens. In all which ways they are excellent; and, together with the fiſh, with which we were amply ſupplied, they formed a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>The known kinds of plants to be found here are bindweed, night-ſhade, nettles, a ſhrubby ſpeed-well, ſow-thiſtles, virgin's bower, vanelloe, French willow, euphorbia, crane's-bill, cudweed, ruſhes, bulruſhes, flax, all-heal, American night-ſhade, knot-graſs, brambles, eye-bright, and groundſel; but the ſpecies of each are different from any we have in Europe.</p>
                     <p>There are a great number of other plants, but one in particular deſerves to be noticed here, as the garments of the natives are made from it. A fine ſilky flax is produced from it, ſuperior in appearance to any thing we have in this country, and, perhaps, as ſtrong. It grows in all places near the ſea, and ſometimes a conſiderable way up the hills, in bunches or tufts, bearing yellowiſh flowers on a long ſtalk.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable that the greateſt part of the trees and plants were of the berry-bearing kind; of which, and other ſeeds, Mr. Anderſon brought away about thirty different ſorts.</p>
                     <p>The birds, of which there is a tolerable good ſtock, are almoſt entirely peculiar to the place. It would be difficult and fatiguing to follow them, on account of the quantity of underwood, and the climbing plants; yet any perſon, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030274_0131_0FE56BADB3D6E790"/>
in one place, may ſhoot as many in a day as would ſerve ſeven or eight perſons. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal kinds are large brown parrots, with grey heads, green parroquets, large wood-pigeons, and two ſorts of cuckoos. A groſs-beak, about the ſize of a thruſh, is frequent; as is alſo a ſmall green bird, which is almoſt the only muſical one to be found here; but his melody is ſo ſweet, and his notes ſo varied, that any one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine himſelf ſurrounded by a hundred different ſorts of birds, when the little warbler is exerting himſelf. From this circumſtance it was named the mocking-bird. There are alſo three or four ſorts of ſmaller birds, and, among the rocks, are found black ſea-pies with red bills, and crefted ſhags of a leaden colour. About the ſhore, there are a few ſea-gulls, ſome blue herons, wild ducks, plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſome ſand-larks. A ſnipe was ſhot here, which differs but little from that of Europe.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the fiſh we caught by the ſeine were elephant-fiſh, mullets, ſoles, and flounders; but the natives ſupplied us with a ſort of ſea-bream, large conger eels, and a fiſh of five or ſix pounds weight, called a mogge by the natives. With a hook and line we caught a blackiſh fiſh, called cole-fiſh by the ſeamen, but differing greatly from that of the ſame name in Europe. We alſo got a ſort of ſmall ſalmon, ſkate, gurnards, and nurſes. The natives ſometimes furniſhed us with hake, paracutas, parrot-fiſh, a ſort of mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karel,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030274_0132_0FE56BAF9F30D530"/>
and leather jackets; beſides another, which is extremely ſcarce, of the figure of a dolphin, a black colour, and ſtrong bony jaws. Theſe, in general, are excellent to eat; but the ſmall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, cole-fiſh, and mogge, are ſuperior to the others.</p>
                     <p>Great quantities of excellent muſcles inhabit among the rocks; one ſort of which exceeds a foot in length. Many cockles are found buried in the ſand of the ſmall beaches; and, in ſome places, oyſters, which, though very ſmall, have a good flavour. There are alſo perriwincles, lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, wilks, ſea-eggs, ſtar-fiſh, and ſome beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſea-ears, many of which are peculiar to the place. The natives alſo furniſhed us with ſome excellent cray-fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Inſects here are not very numerous; we ſaw ſome butterflies, two ſorts of dragon-flies, ſome ſmall graſshoppers, ſeveral ſorts of ſpiders, ſome black ants, and ſcorpion flies innumerable, with whoſe chirping the woods reſounded. The ſand-fly, which is the only noxious one, is very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous here, and is almoſt as diſagreeable as the muſquitoe. The only reptiles we ſaw here, were two or three ſorts of inoffenſive lizards.</p>
                     <p>In this extenſive land, it is remarkable that there ſhould not even be the traces of any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druped, except a few rats, and a kind of fox dog, which is kept by the natives as a domeſtic animal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="unknown:030274_0133_0FE56BB35B374518"/>They have not any mineral deſerving notice, but a green jaſper or ſerpent ſtone, of which the tools and ornaments of the inhabitants are made. This is held in high eſtimation among them; and they entertain ſome ſuperſtitious notions about the mode of its generation, which we could not comprehend; they ſay it is taken from a large river far to the ſouthward; it is diſpoſed in the earth in detached pieces like flints, and, like them, the edges are covered with a whitiſh cruſt.</p>
                     <p>The natives, in general, are not ſo well formed, eſpecially about the limbs, as the Europeans, nor do they exceed them in ſtature. Their ſitting ſo much on their hams, and being deprived, by the mountainous diſpoſition of the country, of uſing that kind of exerciſe which would render the body ſtraight and well-proportioned, is probably the occaſion of the want of due proportion. Many of them, indeed, are perfectly formed, and ſome are very large boned and muſcular; but very few among them were corpulent.</p>
                     <p>Their features are various, ſome reſembling Europeans, and their colour is of different caſts, from a deepiſh black to an olive or yellowiſh tinge. In general, however, their faces are round, their lips rather full, and their noſes (though not flat) large towards the point. An aquiline noſe was not to be ſeen among them: their eyes are large, and their teeth are commonly broad, white, and regular. The hair, in general, is
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030274_0134_0FE56BB543545B20"/>
black, ſtrong, and ſtraight; it is commonly cut ſhort on the hinder part, and the reſt tied on the crown of the head. Some, indeed, have brown hair, and others a ſort that is naturally diſpoſed to curl. The countenance of the young is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally free and open; but, in many of the men, it has a ſerious or ſullen caſt. The men are larger than the women; and the latter are not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by peculiar graces, either of form or features.</p>
                     <p>Both ſexes are cloathed alike; they have a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made of the ſilky flax already mentioned, about five feet in length, and four in breadth. This appears to be their principal manufacture, which is performed by knotting. Two corners of this garment paſs over the ſhoulders, and they faſten it on the breaſt with that which covers the body: it is again faſtened about the belly with a girdle made of mat. Sometimes they cover it with dog-ſkin or large feathers. Many of them wear mats over this garment, extending from the ſhoulders to the heels. The moſt common co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, however, is a quantity of the ſedgy plant above-mentioned, badly manufactured, faſtened to a ſtring, and thrown over the ſhoulders, whence it falls down on all ſides to the middle of the thighs. When they ſat down in this habit, they could hardly be diſtinguiſhed from large grey ſtones, if their black heads did not project beyond their coverings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:030274_0135_0FE56BB6CD81C768"/>They adorn their heads with feathers, combs of bone or wood, with pearl ſhell, and the inner ſkin of leaves. Both men and women have their ears ſlit, in which are hung beads, pieces of jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or bits of cloth. Some have the <hi>ſeptum</hi> of the noſe bored in its lower part, but we never ſaw any ornament worn in that part; though a twig was paſſed through it by one of them, to ſhew that it was occaſionally uſed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>Many are ſtained in the face with curious figures, of a black or dark blue colour; but it is not certain whether this is intended to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental, or as a mark of particular diſtinction: the women are marked only on their lips and chins; and both ſexes beſmear their heads and faces with a greaſy reddiſh paint. The women alſo wear necklaces of ſhark's teeth, or bunches of long beads; and a few of them have ſmall triangular aprons, adorned with feathers or pieces of pearl ſhells, feſtened about the waiſt with a double or treble ſet of cords.</p>
                     <p>They live in the ſmall coves already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſometimes in ſingle families, and ſometimes in companies of perhaps forty or fifty. Their huts, which are in general moſt miſerable lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, are built cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

length. The inſide was ſtrong and regular, well faſtened by means of withes, &amp;c. and painted red and black. At one end it had a hole ſerving as a door to creep out at, and another conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſmaller, ſeemingly for the purpoſe of letting out the ſmoke. This, however, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one of their palaces, for many of their huts are not of half the ſize, and ſeldom are more than four feet in height.</p>
                     <p>They have no other furniture than a few ſmall bags or baſkets, in which they depoſit their fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hooks and other trifles. They ſit down in the middle round a ſmall fire, and probably ſleep in the ſame ſituation, without any other covering that what they have worn in the day.</p>
                     <p>Fiſhing is their principal ſupport, in which they uſe different kinds of nets, or wooden fiſh-hooks pointed with bone; but made in ſo extraordinary a manner, that it appears aſtoniſhing how they can anſwer ſuch a purpoſe.</p>

Sometimes they faſten two together with rafters, which we call a double canoe: they frequently carry upwards of thirty men, and have a large head, ingeniouſly carved and painted, which ſeems intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a man enraged. Their paddles are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, pointed, and about five feet long. Their
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030274_0137_0FE56BBDE5072428"/>
ſail, which is very little uſed, is a mat formed into a triangular ſhape.</p>
                     <p>They dreſs their fiſh by roaſting, or rather baking them, being entirely ignorant of the art of boiling. It is thus they alſo dreſs the root of the large fern-tree, in a hole prepared for that purpoſe: when dreſſed, they ſplit it, and find a gelatinous ſubſtance within, ſomewhat like ſago powder. The ſmaller fern-root ſeems to be their ſubſtitute for bread, being dried and carried about with them, together w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>h great quantities of dried fiſh, when they go far from their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>When the weather will not ſuffer them to go to ſea, muſcles and ſea-ears ſupply the place of other fiſh. Sometimes, but not often, they kill a few penguins, rails, and ſhags, which enable them to vary their diet. Conſiderable numbers of their dogs are alſo bred for food; but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend principally on the ſea for their ſubſiſtence, by which they are moſt bountifully ſupplied.</p>
                     <p>They are as filthy in their feeding as in their perſons, which often emit a very offenſive ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia, from the quantity of greaſe about them, and from their never waſhing their cloaths: their heads are plentifully ſtocked with vermin, which they ſometimes eat. Large quantities of ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing train oil, and blubber of ſeals, they would eagerly devour. When on board the ſhips, they not only emptied the lamps, but actually ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030274_0138_0FE56BBFE650AB88"/>
the cotton with equal voracity. Though the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land would not even taſte our bread, theſe people devoured it with the greateſt eagerneſs, even when it was rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and mouldy.</p>
                     <p>In point of ingenuity, they are not behind any uncivilized nations under ſimilar circumſtances: for, without the aſſiſtance of metal tools, they make every thing by which they procure their ſubſiſtence, cloathing, and warlike weapons, with neatneſs, ſtrength, and convenience. Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal mechanical tool is formed in the manner of an adze, and is made of the ſerpent-ſtone or jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: their chiſſel and gouge are furniſhed from the ſame material, though they are ſometimes compoſed of black ſolid ſtone. Carving, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is their maſter-piece, which appears upon the moſt trifling things; the ornaments on the heads of their canoes not only diſplay much deſign, but execution. Their cordage for fiſhing lines is not inferior to that in this country, and their nets equally good. A ſhell, a bit of flint, or jaſper, is their ſubſtitute for a knife; and a ſhark's tooth fixed in the end of a piece of wood, is their auger. They have a ſaw made of ſome jagged fiſhes teeth, fixed on a piece of wood nicely carved; but this is uſed for no other purpoſe than to cut up the bodies of thoſe whom they kill in battle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:030274_0139_0FE56BC16C6F84D0"/>Though no people are more ready to reſent an injury, yet they take every opportunity of being inſolent, when they apprehend there is no danger of puniſhment; whence it may be concluded, that their eagerneſs to reſent injuries, is rather an effect of a furious diſpoſition than genuine bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. They are naturally miſtruſtful, and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, for ſuch as are ſtrangers never venture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to viſit our ſhips, but keep at a ſmall diſtance in their boats, obſerving our motions, and heſitating whether they ſhould riſk their ſafety with us. They are to the laſt degree diſhoneſt, and ſteal every thing within their reach, if they ſuppoſe they can eſcape detection; and, in trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſeem inclined to take every poſſible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for they never truſt an article out of their hands for examination, and ſeem highly pleaſed if they have over-reached you in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>Such conduct indeed is not ſurpriſing, when it is conſidered that there appears to be but little ſubordination, and few, if any, laws for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of tranſgreſſors. No man's authority extends beyond his own family; and when they join, at any time, for mutual defence or ſafety, thoſe among them who are moſt eminent for valour and prudent conduct, are directors.</p>
                     <p>Their public contentions are almoſt perpetual, for war is their principal profeſſion, as appears from their number of weapons, and their dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030274_0140_0FE56BC344F32A88"/>
in uſing them. Their arms are ſpears, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toos and halberts, and ſometimes ſtones, The firſt are from five to thirty feet long, made of hard wood and pointed. The patoo is about eighteen inches long, of an elliptical ſhape, with a handle made of wood, ſtone, &amp;c. and appears to be their principal dependance in battle. The halbert is about five or ſix feet in length, tapering at one end with a carved head, and broad or flat, with ſharp edges, at the other.</p>
                     <p>Before the onſet, they join in a war ſong, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exacteſt time; and, by degrees, work themſelves into a kind of frantic fury, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the moſt horrid diſtortions of their tongues, eyes and mouths, in order to deter their enemies. To this ſucceeds a circumſtance that is moſt horrid, cruel, and diſgraceful to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, which is mangling and cutting to pieces (even when not perfectly dead) the bodies of their enemies; and, after roaſting them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the fleſh with peculiar pleaſure and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                     <p>It might naturally be ſuppoſed, that thoſe who could be capable of ſuch exceſs of cruelty, muſt be totally deſtitute of every humane feeling; and yet they lament the loſs of their friends in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the moſt tender and affectionate. Both men and women, upon the death of their relations or friends, bewail them with the moſt miſerable cries; at the ſame time cutting large gaſhes in

their cheeks and foreheads, with ſhells, or pieces of flint, till the blood flows copiouſly, and mixes with their tears. They alſo carve a reſemblance of an human figure, and hang it about their necks, as a memorial of thoſe who were dear to them. They alſo perform the ceremony of lamenting and cutting for joy, at the return of a friend who has been ſome time abſent.</p>
                     <p>The practices of the fathers, whether good or bad, their children are, at an early age, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; ſo that you find a child of either ſex, of the age of nine or ten years, able to imitate the frightful motions and geſtures of the men. They alſo ſing, and with ſome degree of melody, the traditions and actions of their forefathers, with which they are immoderately delighted, and paſs much of their time in theſe amuſements, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied ſometimes with a kind of flute.</p>
                     <p>Their language is neither harſh nor diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Whatever qualities are requiſite to make a language muſical, obtain to a conſiderable degree in this, if we may judge from the melody of their ſongs. It is not, indeed, ſo comprehenſive as our European languages, which owe their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to long and gradual improvement.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030274_0143_0FE56BC94E400688"/>
ſoon as we had loſt ſight of land, our two young New-Zealanders heartily reperted of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous ſtep they had taken. Though we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, as far as lay in our power, to ſooth them, they wept, both in public and private; and gave vent to their ſorrows in a kind of ſong, which ſeemed to expreſs their praiſes of their country and people, from which they were now, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, to be for ever ſeparated. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in this ſtate for ſeveral days, till, at length, the agitation of their minds began to ſubſide, and their ſea-ſickneſs, which had aggravated their grief, wore off. Their lamentations then became leſs and leſs frequent; their native country, their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and friends, were gradually forgotten, and they appeared to be firmly attached to us.</p>
                     <p>On the 28th at noon, being in the latitude of 41° 17′ ſouth, and in the longitude of 177° 17′ eaſt, we tacked about and ſtood to the ſouth-eaſt, with a gentle breeze at eaſt north-eaſt, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards veered to north-eaſt, in which point the wind remained two days, ſometimes blowing a freſh gale with ſqualls and rain. On the 2d of March it ſhifted to north-weſt, and afterwards to ſouth-weſt, between which point and the north it continued to blow, ſometimes very moderately, and at other times a ſtrong gale. With this wind we ſteered north-eaſt by eaſt and eaſt, with all the ſail we could carry, till Tueſday the 11th, when
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030274_0144_0FE56BCB04DCEB38"/>
it veered to north-eaſt and ſouth-eaſt; we then ſtood to the north and the north-eaſt, as the wind would permit, till the 16th, when having a gale from the north, we ſtood to the eaſt. The next day we proceeded to the north-eaſt; but, as the wind frequently veered to eaſt and eaſt-north-eaſt, we often made no better than a northerly courſe. The hopes, however, of the wind coming more ſoutherly, or from the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a little without the Tropic of Capricorn, encouraged the Commodore to continue this courſe. It was indeed neceſſary that we ſhould run all hazards, as our proceeding to the north this ſummer, in proſecution of the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the expedition, entirely depended on our having a quick paſſage to Otaheite, or the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety Iſles.</p>
                     <p>We croſſed the Tropic on the 27th, the wind, for a conſiderable time before, having remained almoſt invariably fixed at eaſt ſouth-eaſt. In all this run, we obſerved nothing that could induce us to ſuppoſe we had ſailed near any land, except occaſionally a tropic bird. In the latitude of 34° 20′, longitude 199°, we paſſed the trunk of a tree, which appeared much weather-beaten, and was covered with barnacles. On the 29th, as we were ſtanding to the north-eaſt, the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very made a ſignal of ſeeing land. We ſoon found it to be a ſmall iſland, and ſtood for it till the evening, when it was at the diſtance of two
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030274_0145_0FE56BCCF8B50378"/>
or three leagues. The next morning, at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, we bore up fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the weſt ſide of the iſland, and ſaw ſeveral people wading to the reef, where, as they obſerved the ſhip leaving them quickly, they remained. But others, who ſoon appeared, followed her courſe; and ſome of them aſſembled in ſmall bodies, making great ſhouts.</p>
                     <p>Upon our nearer approach to the ſhore, we ſaw many of the natives running along the beach, and, by the aſſiſtance of our glaſſes, could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they were armed with long ſpears and clubs, which they brandiſhed in the air with ſigns of threatening, or, as ſome of us ſuppoſed, with invitations to land. Moſt of them were naked, except having a kind of girdle, which was brought up between their thighs; but ſome of them wore about their ſhoulders pieces of cloth of various colours, white, ſtriped, or chequered; and almoſt all of them had about their heads a white wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in ſome degree reſembling a turban. They were of a tawny complexion, robuſt, and about the middle ſize.</p>
                     <p>A ſmall canoe was now launched from the moſt diſtant part of the beach, and a man get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into it, put off, as with a view of reaching the ſhip; but his courage failing, he quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned towards the beach. Another man ſoon after joined him in the canoe; and then both of them paddled towards us. They ſeemed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, afraid to approach, till their apprehenſions
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030274_0146_0FE56BD2DD5E5F20"/>
were partly removed by Omai, who addreſſed them in the language of Otaheite. Thus encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, they came near enough to receive ſome nails and beads, which, being tied to ſome wood, were thrown into the canoe. They however put the wood aſide without untying the things from it, which may perhaps have proceeded from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; for we were informed by Omai, that when they obſerved us offering preſents to them, they requeſted ſomething for their <hi>Eatooa.</hi> On Omai's aſking them whether they ever eat human fleſh, they replied in the negative, with equal abhorrence and indignation. One of them, named Mourooa, being queſtioned with regard to a ſcar on his forehead, ſaid it was the conſequence of a wound he had received in fighting with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of an iſland lying towards the north-eaſt, who ſometimes invaded them. They afterwards laid hands on a rope, but would not venture on board, telling Omai, that their countrymen on ſhore had ſuggeſted to them this caution; and had likewiſe directed them to enquire whence our ſhip came, and to procure information of the name of the Captain. Their chief, they ſaid, was called Orooaeeka. Upon our enquiring the name of the iſland, they told us it was <hi>Mangya,</hi> or <hi>Mangeea,</hi> to which they ſometimes added <hi>nooe, nai, naiwa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The features of Mourooa were agreeable, and his diſpoſition, to all appearance, was no leſs ſo;

The lobe of their ears was ſlit to ſuch a length, that one of them ſtuck their a knife and ſome beads, which we had given them. The ſame perſon had hung about his neck, by way of ornament, two poliſhed pearl-ſhells, and a bunch of human hair, looſely twiſted together. They wore a kind of girdles, which we found were a ſubſtance manufactured from the <hi>morus papyrifera,</hi> and glazed like thoſe uſed in the Friendly Iſlands. They had on their feet a ſort of ſandals, made of a graſſy ſubſtance interwoven, which we obſerved were alſo worn by thoſe whom we had ſeen on the beach. The canoe in which they came was the only one we ſaw. It was very narrow, and not above ten feet long, but ſtrong and neatly made. The lower

part was of white wood; but the upper part was black, and their paddles were made of wood of the ſame colour: theſe were broad at one end, and blunted, and about three feet long. The fore part had a flat board faſtened over it, which projected out, to prevent the water from getting in. It had an upright ſtern, five feet high, which terminated at the top in a kind of fork. They paddled indifferently either end of the canoe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the ſhips were in a proper ſtation, Captain Cook ſent out two boats to endeavour to find a convenient place for landing. In one of them he went himſelf, and had no ſooner put off from the ſhip, than the two men in the canoe paddled towards his boat; and when they were come along-ſide, Mourooa, without heſitation, ſtept into her. Omai, who was with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, was deſired to enquire of the iſlander where we could land; upon which he directed us to two places. But we ſoon obſerved, with regret, that the attempt at either place was impracticable, on account of the ſurf, unleſs at the riſque of having our boats deſtroyed. Nor were we more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in our ſearch for anchorage, as we could find no bottom till within a cable's length of the breakers, where we met with from forty to twenty fathoms depth, over ſharp rocks of coral.</p>
                     <p>While we thus reconnoitred the ſhore of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geea, the natives thronged down upon the reef,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030274_0150_0FE56BDBE5607758"/>
all armed. Mourooa, who ſtill remained in the boat with Captain Cook, thinking, perhaps, that this warlike appearance deterred us from land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, commanded them to retire. As many of them complied, we imagined, that he was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome conſequence: indeed, if we did not miſunderſtand him, he was brother to the king of the iſland. Several of them, inſtigated by curioſity, ſwam from the ſhore to the boats, and came on board them without reſerve. We even found ſome difficulty in keeping them out, and could ſcarce prevent their pilfering whatever they could lay hands upon. At length, when they obſerved us returning to the ſhips, they all left us except Mourooa, who, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifeſt indications of fear, accompanied the Commodore on board the Reſolution. The cattle and other new objects that he ſaw there, did not ſtrike him with much ſurprize; his mind, perhaps, benig too much occupied about his own ſafety, to allow him to attend to other things. He ſeemed very uneaſy, and gave us but little new intelligence; and therefore, after he had continued a ſhort time on board, Captain Cook ordered a boat to carry him towards the land. In his way out of the cabin, happening to ſtumble over one of the goats, he ſtopped, looked at the animal, and aſked Omai what bird it was; but not receiving an immediate anſwer from him, he put the ſame queſtion to ſome of the people who
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030274_0151_0FE56BDE43BE0200"/>
were upon deck. The boat having conveyed him near the ſurf, he leaped into the water, and ſwam aſhore. His countrymen, eager to learn from him what he had ſeen, flocked round him as ſoon as he had landed; in which ſituation they remained when we loſt ſight of them. We hoiſted in the boat as ſoon as ſhe returned, and made ſail to the northward. Thus were we obliged to leave this fine iſland unviſited, which ſeemed capable of ſupplying all our neceſſities. It is ſituate in the longitude of 210° 53′ eaſt, and in the latitude of 21° 57′ ſouth.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe parts of the coaſt of Mangeea which fell under our obſervation, are guarded by a reef of coral rock, againſt which a heavy ſurf is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually breaking. The iſland is about five leagues in circumference, and though of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and pretty equal height, may be ſeen in clear weather at the diſtance of ten leagues. In the interior parts, it riſes into ſmall hills, whence there is an eaſy deſcent to the ſhore, which, in the ſouth-weſt part, is ſteep, though not very high, and has ſeveral excavations made by the daſhing of the waves againſt a browniſh ſand-ſtone, of which it conſiſts. The deſcent here abounds with trees of a deep green, which ſeem to be all of one ſort, except neareſt the ſhore, where we obſerved numbers of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſpecies of <hi>dracoena</hi> found in the woods of New-Zealand. The ſhore, on the north-weſt part, terminates in a ſandy,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030274_0152_0FE56BDFCD4579E8"/>
beach, beyond which the land is broken into ſmall chaſms, and has a broad border of trees which reſemble tall willows. Further up, on the aſcent, the trees were of the deep green above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, which ſome of us imagined to be the <hi>rima,</hi> intermixed with cocoa-palms, and a few other ſorts. Some trees of a higher ſort were thinly ſcattered on the hills, the other parts of which were either covered with ſomething like fern, or were bare, and of a reddiſh colour. The iſland, upon the whole, has a pleaſing appearance, and might, by proper cultivation, be made a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſpot.</p>
                     <p>The natives appearing to be both numerous and well-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, it is highly probable that ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of proviſion as the iſland produces are found in great abundance. Our friend Mourooa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that they had no hogs nor dogs, though they had heard of both thoſe animals; but that they had plaintains, taro, and bread-fruit. The only birds we obſerved, were ſome terns, noddies, white egg-birds, and one white heron.</p>
                     <p>The language of the Mangeeans is a dialect of that of Otaheite; but their pronunciation is more guttural. They reſemble the inhabitants of Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite and the Marqueſas in the beauty of their perſons; and their general diſpoſition alſo ſeems to correſpond with that of the firſt-mentioned people; for they are not only lively and chearful, but are acquainted with all the laſcivious geſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030274_0153_0FE56BE19D982430"/>
practiſed by the Otaheiteans in their dances. We had likewiſe reaſon to ſuppoſe, that they have ſimilar methods of living: for, though we had not an opportunity of ſeeing many of their habitations, we obſerved one houſe near the beach, which, in its mode of conſtruction, differed little from thoſe of Otaheite. It appeared to be ſeven or eight feet high, and about thirty in length, with an open end, which repreſented an ellipſe, or oval, tranſeverſely divided. It was pleaſantly ſituated in a grove.</p>
                     <p>Theſe people ſalute ſtrangers by joining noſes, and taking the hand of the perſon whom they accoſt, which they rub with ſome force upon their mouth and noſe. It is worthy of remark, that the inhabitants of the Palaos, New Philippine, or rather Caroline Iſlands, though at the diſtance of near 1500 leagues from Mangeea, have a ſimilar method of ſalutation.</p>

                     <p>WE quitted Mangeea in the afternoon of the 30th of March, and proceeding on a nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly courſe, we again diſcovered land, on the 31ſt, at the diſtance of nine or ten leagues.— The next morning we were abreſt of its north end, within four leagues of it. It now appeared to us to be an iſland nearly of the ſame extent with that which we had juſt left. Another iſland, much ſmaller, was alſo deſcried right a-head. Though we could ſoon have reached this, we preferred the larger one, as being moſt likely to
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030274_0155_0FE5489366C896C0"/>
furniſh food for the cattle. We therefore made ſail to it; but there being little wind, and that unfavourable, we were ſtill about two leagues to leeward at eight o'clock the ſucceeding morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Commodore, ſoon after, diſpatched three armed boats, under the command of Mr. Gore, his Firſt Lieutenant, in ſearch of a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place and anchoring-ground. Mean while we plied up under the iſland with the ſhips. As our boats were putting off, we ſaw ſeveral canoes coming from the ſhore, which repaired firſt to the Diſcovery, as that ſhip was the neareſt. Not long after, three of theſe canoes, each conducted by one man, came along-ſide of the Reſolution. They are long and narrow, and are ſupported by out-riggers: the head is flat above, but prow-like below; and the ſtern is about four feet high. We beſtowed on our viſitors, ſome knives, beads, and other trifles; and they gave us ſome cocoa-nuts, in conſequence of our having aſked for them; but they did not part with them by way of exchange, as they ſeemed to have no idea of barter or traffic. One of them, after a little perſuaſion, came on board; and the other two ſoon followed his example. They appeared to be perfectly at their eaſe, and free from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. After their departure, a man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in another canoe, bringing a bunch of plantains as a preſent to Captain Cook, who gave him, in return, a piece of red cloth and an axe.
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030274_0156_0FE56BE8181B0540"/>
We were afterwards informed by Omai, that this preſent had been ſent from the king of the iſland. Soon after, a double canoe, containing twelve of the iſlanders, came towards us. On approaching the ſhip, they recited ſome words in concert, by way of chorus, one of them firſt giving the word before each repetition. Having finiſhed this ſolemn chant, they came along-ſide, and aſked for the chief. As ſoon as Captain Cook had made his appearance, a pig and ſome cocoa-nuts were conveyed into the ſhip; and the Captain was alſo preſented with a piece of matting, by the principal perſon in the canoe, when he and his companions had got on board.</p>
                     <p>Theſe new viſitors were introduced into the cabin, and conducted to other parts of the ſhip. Though ſome objects ſeemed to ſurpriſe them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could fix their attention. They were afraid to venture near the cows and horſes, of whoſe nature they could form no conception. As for the ſheep and goats, they gave us to underſtand, that they knew them to be birds. It is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of aſtoniſhment, that human ignorance could ever make ſo ridiculous a miſtake, as there is not the ſmalleſt reſemblance between any winged animal and a ſheep or goat. But theſe people ſeemed unacquainted with the exiſtence of any other terreſtrial animals, than hogs, dogs, and birds; and as they ſaw that our goats and ſheep were very different from the two former, they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030274_0157_0FE56BE99F114EE0"/>
inferred, that they muſt belong to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter claſs, in which they knew there was a great variety of ſpecies. Though the Commodore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on his new friend what he ſuppoſed would be the moſt acceptable preſent, yet he ſeemed ſomewhat diſappointed. The Captain was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards informed, that he eagerly wiſhed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a dog, of which kind of animals this iſland was deſtitute, though the natives knew that the race exiſted in other iſlands of the Pacific Ocean. Captain Clerke had received a ſimilar preſent, with the ſame view, from another man, who was equally diſappointed in his expectations.</p>
                     <p>The iſlanders whom we had ſeen in thoſe canoes were in general of the middle ſtature, and not unlike the Mangeeans. Their hair either flowed looſely over their ſhoulders, or was tied on the crown of the head; and though in ſome it was frizzled, yet that, as well as the ſtraight ſort, was long. Some of the young men were handſome. Like the inhabitants of Mangeea, they were gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of glazed cloth, or fine matting, the ends of which were brought between their thighs.— Their ears were bored, and they wore about their necks, by way of ornament, a ſort of broad graſs, ſtained with red, and ſtrung with berries of the night-ſhade. Many of them were curiouſly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or <hi>tatooed</hi> from the middle downwards, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon their legs; which made them appear as if they wore boots. Their beard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> were long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and they had a kind of ſandals on their feet. They were frank and chearful in their deportment, and very friendly and good-natured.</p>
                     <p>Lieutenant Gore returned from his excurſion in the afternoon, and informed Captain Cook, that he had examined the weſt ſide of the iſland, without being able to find a place where the ſhips could ride in ſafety, or a boat could land, the ſhore being bounded by a ſteep coral rock, againſt which a continual ſurf broke with extraordinary violence. But as the inhabitants ſeemed extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friendly, and as deſirous of our landing as we ourſelves were, Mr. Gore was of opinion, that they might be prevailed upon to bring off to the boats beyond the ſurf, ſuch articles as we were moſt in need of. As we had little or no wind, the delay of a day or two was of ſmall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore the Commodore reſolved to try the experiment the next morning. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſoon after day-break, ſome canoes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

part with them. However, to gratify theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Omai gave them a favourite dog he had brought from Great-Britain; with which acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they were highly pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſame morning, which was the 3d of April, Captain Cook detached Mr. Gore with three boats, to make trial of the experiment which that officer had propoſed. Two of the natives, who had been on board, accompanied him; and Omai ſerved as an interpreter. The ſhips being a full league from the iſland when the boats put off, and the wind being inconſiderable, it was twelve o'clock before we could work up to it. We then perceived our three boats juſt without the ſurf, and an amazing number of the iſlanders on the ſhore, abreaſt of them. Concluding from this, that Lieutenant Gore, and others of our people had landed, we were impatient to know the event. With a view of obſerving their motions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to afford them ſuch aſſiſtance as they might occaſionally require, the Commodore kept as near the ſhore as was conſiſtent with prudence. He was convinced, however, that the reef was a very effectual barrier between us and our friends who had landed, and put them completely out of the reach of our protection. But the natives, in all probability, were not ſo ſenſible of this circumſtance as we were. Some of them, now and then, brought a few cocoa-nuts to the ſhips, and exchanged them for whatever was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030274_0160_0FE56BF15BE82658"/>
them. Theſe occaſional viſits diminiſhed the Captain's ſolicitude about our people who had landed; for, though we could procure no intelligence from our viſitors, yet their ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board ſeemed to imply, that their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on ſhore had made no improper uſe of the confidence repoſed in them. At length, towards the evening, we had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing the boats return. When our people got on board, we found that Mr. Gore, Mr. Anderſon, Mr. Burney, and Omai, were the only perſons who had landed. The occurrence of the day were now fully reported to the Commodore by Mr. Gore. Mr. Anderſon's account of their tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which was very circumſtantial, and includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome obſervations, on the iſland and it's inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, was to the following purport.</p>
                     <p>They rowed towards a ſandy beach, where a great number of the natives had aſſembled, and came to an anchor at the diſtance of an hundred yards from the reef. Several of the iſlanders ſwam off, bringing cocoa-nuts with them; and Omai gave them to underſtand, that our people were deſirous of landing. Soon after, two canoes came off; and to inſpire the natives with a greater confidence, Mr. Gore and his companions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go unarmed. Mr. Anderſon and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Burney went in the canoe, a little before the other; and their conductors watching with great attention the motions of the ſurf, landed
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030274_0161_0FE56BF355480B38"/>
them ſafely on the reef. A native took hold of each of them, with a view of ſupporting them in walking over the rugged rocks to the beach, where ſeveral others, holding in their hands the green boughs of a ſpecies of <hi>mimoſa,</hi> met them, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by the junction of noſes. They were conducted from the beach amidſt a vaſt multitude of people, who flocked around them with the moſt eager curioſity; and being led up an avenue of of cocoa palms, ſoon came to a number of men, arranged in two rows, and armed with clubs. Proceeding onward among theſe, they found a perſon, who appeared to be a chief, ſitting croſs-legged on the ground, and cooling himſelf with a kind of triangular fan, made from the leaf of the cocoa-palm, with a poliſhed handle of black wood. He wore in his ears large bunches of beautiful feathers of a red colour; but had no other mark to diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of the people. Our two countrymen having ſaluted him as he ſat, marched on among the men armed with clubs, and came to a ſecond chief, adorned like the former, and occupied, like him, in fanning himſelf. He was remarkable for his ſize and corpulence, though he did not appear to be above thirty years of age. They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in the ſame manner to a third chief, who ſeemed older than the two former: he alſo was ſitting, and was ornamented with red feathers. After they had ſaluted him as they had done the

others, he deſired them both to ſit down: which they willingly conſented to, being greatly fatigued with walking, and with the extreme heat they felt amidſt the ſurrounding multitude.</p>
                     <p>The people being ordered to ſeparate, Meſſrs. Anderſon and Burney ſaw, at a ſmall diſtance, about twenty young women, adorned like the chiefs with red feathers, engaged in a dance, which they performed to a ſlow and ſolemn air, ſung by them all. Our two gentlemen roſe up, and walking forward to ſee theſe dancers, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying them the ſmalleſt attention, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their dance. They ſeemed to be directed by a man, who, in the capacity of a prompter, mentioned the ſeveral motions they were to make. They never changed the ſpot, as Europeans do in dancing, and though their feet were not entirely at reſt, this exerciſe conſiſted more in mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fingers very nimbly, holding their hands at the ſame time in a prone poſition near the face, and occaſionally clapping them together<note n="*" place="bottom">The dances here deſcribed, bear a great reſemblance to thoſe of the natives of the Caroline Iſlands.</note>. Their dancing and ſinging were performed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt concert. They had probably been inſtructed with extraordinary care, and ſelected for this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, being ſuperior in beauty to moſt of thoſe who were in the crowd. They were, in general, rather ſtout, and of an olive complexion, with black hair flowing in ringlets down their necks.
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030274_0163_0FE56BFBA6E9AF68"/>
Their ſhape and limbs were elegantly formed; for, their dreſs conſiſting only of a piece of glazed cloth tied round the waiſt, which ſcarcely reached ſo low as the knees, our gentlemen had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of obſerving almoſt every part. Their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were rather too full to conſtitute a perfect beauty. Their eyes were of a deep black, and their countenances expreſſed a great degree of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and complacency.</p>
                     <p>Before theſe beauteous females had finiſhed their dance, our two countrymen heard a noiſe, as if ſome horſes had been galloping towards them; and on turning their eyes aſide, they ſaw the people armed with clubs, who had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to entertain them, as they ſuppoſed, with an exibition of their mode of fighting; which they now did, one party purſuing another who ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>Lieutenant Burney and Mr. Anderſon began now to look about for Mr. Gore and Omai, whom they at length found coming up, as much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded by the crowds of people as themſelves had been, and introduced in the ſame manner to the three chiefs; the names of whom were Otteroo, Taroa, and Fatouweera. Each of theſe expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a preſent, Mr. Gore gave them ſuch things as he had brought with him for that purpoſe; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he informed the chiefs of his views in coming on ſhore, but was deſired to wait till the next day before he ſhould have what was wanted.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030274_0164_0FE56C6DA22F2CC8"/>
They now ſeemed to endeavour to ſeparate our gentlemen from each other, every one of whom had his reſpective circle to ſurround, and gaze at him. Mr. Anderſon was, at one time, upwards of an hour apart from his friends; and when he told the chief, who was near him, that he wiſhed to ſpeak to Omai, his requeſt was peremptorily refuſed. At the ſame time he found that the people pilfered ſeveral trifling things which were in his pocket; and on his complaining of this treatment to the chief, he juſtified their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. From theſe circumſtances, Mr. Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon began to apprehend, that they deſigned to detain our party among them. In this ſituation he aſked for ſomething to eat; upon which they brought him ſome cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and a ſort of ſour pudding; and when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the heat, occaſioned by the multitude of people, the chief himſelf condeſcended to fan him.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Burney going to the place where Mr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon was, the latter informed him of his ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions; and to try whether they were well founded or not, they both attempted to get to the beach: but they were ſoon ſtopped by ſome of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who ſaid they muſt return to the place which they had left. On their coming up they found Omai under the ſame apprehenſions; but he had, as he imagined, an additional motive of terror; for, having obſerved that they had dug a
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030274_0165_0FE56C6FEEEB6210"/>
hole in the ground for an oven, which they were then heating, he could aſſign no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, than that they intended to roaſt and devour our party: he even went ſo far as to aſk them whether that was their intention, at which they were much ſurpriſed, aſking, in return, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that cuſtom prevailed among us.</p>
                     <p>Thus were Mr. Anderſon and the others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the greateſt part of the day, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeparated, and ſometimes together; but continually in a croud, who frequently deſired them to uncover parts of their ſkin, the ſight of which ſtruck the iſlanders with admiration. They at the ſame time rifled the pockets of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; and one of them ſnatched from Mr. Gore a bayonet, which hung by his ſide. This being repreſented to one of the chiefs, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſend a perſon in ſearch of it, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably countenanced the theft; for Omai, ſoon after, had a dagger ſtolen from his ſide in the ſame manner. They now brought ſome green boughs as emblems of friendſhip, and ſticking the ends of them in the ground, deſired that our party would hold them as they ſat, giving them to underſtand, that they muſt ſtay and eat with them. The ſight of a pig lying near the oven which they had prepared and heated, removed Omai's apprehenſions of being put into it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and made him think it might be intended for the repaſt of him and his three friends.
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030274_0166_0FE56C758B1F61B0"/>
The chief alſo ſent ſome of his people to provide food for the cattle, and they returned with a few plantain trees, which they conveyed to the boats. In the mean time, Meſſrs. Burney and Anderſon made a ſecond attempt to get to the beach; but, on their arrival, they found themſelves watched by people who ſeemed to have been ſtationed there for that purpoſe; for, when Mr. Anderſon endeavoured to wade in upon the reef, one of them dragged him back by his clothes. They alſo inſiſted upon his throwing down ſome pieces of coral that he had picked up, and on his refuſal to comply, they took them from him by force. Nor would they ſuffer him to retain ſome ſmall plants which he had gathered. They likewiſe took a fan from Mr. Burney, which on his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhore he had received as a preſent. Finding that obedience to their will was the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of procuring better treatment, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men returned to the place they had quitted; and the natives now promiſed, that after they had partaken of a repaſt which had been prepared for them, they ſhould be furniſhed with a canoe to carry them off to their boats. Accordingly, the ſecond chief to whom they had been preſented, having ſeated himſelf on a low ſtool, and directed the multitude to form a large ring, made them ſit down by him. A number of cocoa-nuts were now brought, with a quantity of baked plantains, and a piece of the pig that had been dreſſed was
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030274_0167_0FE56C77A157E768"/>
placed before each of them. Their fatigue, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had taken away their appetites; but they eat a little to pleaſe their entertainers. It being now near ſun-ſet, the iſlanders ſent down to the beach the remainder of the proviſions that had been dreſſed, to be carried to the ſhips. Our gentlemen found a canoe prepared to put them off to their boats, which the natives did with great caution; but as they were puſhing the canoe into the ſurf, one of them ſnatched a bag out of her, which contained a pocket-piſtol belonging to Mr. Anderſon, who calling out to the thief with marks of the higheſt diſpleaſure, he ſwam back to the canoe with the bag. The iſlanders then put them on board the boats, with the cocoa-nuts, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and other proviſions; and they immediately rowed back to the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>The reſtrained ſituation of theſe gentlemen gave them very little opportunity of obſerving the country: for they were ſeldom a hundred yards from the place where they had been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the chiefs, and conſequently were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the ſurrounding objects. The firſt thing that attracted their notice was the number of people, which muſt have been at leaſt two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Except a few, thoſe who had come on board the ſhips were all of an inferior claſs; for a great number of thoſe that our gentlemen met with on ſhore, had a ſuperior dignity of demeanor, and their complexion was much whiter. In gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030274_0168_0FE56C792B4D6360"/>
they had their hair, which was long and black, tied on the crown of the head. Many of the young men were perfect models in ſhape, and of a delicate complexion. The old men were, many of them, corpulent; and they as well as the young, had a remarkable ſmoothneſs of ſkin. Their general dreſs conſiſted of a piece of cloth wrapped about the waiſt, but ſome had pieces of mats, very curiouſly variegated with black and white, formed into a kind of a jacket without ſleeves; while others wore conical caps made of the core of a cocoa-nut, interwoven with beads. In their ears, which were pierced, they hung pieces of the membraneous part of ſome plant, or ſtuck there ſome odoriferous flower. The chiefs, and other perſons of rank, had two little balls, with a common baſe, made of bone; which they hung round their necks with ſmall cord. Red feathers are here conſidered as a particular mark of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction; for none but chiefs, and the young women who danced, aſſumed them. Some of the men were punctured all over the ſides and back, and ſome of the women had the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament (if it deſerves that name) on their legs. The elderly women had their hair cropped ſhort, and many of them were cut all over the fore part of the body in oblique lines. The wife of a chief appeared with her child, laid in a piece of red cloth, which had been preſented to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; ſhe ſuckled the infant much after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030274_0169_0FE56C7B04988380"/>
of our women. Another chief introduced his daughter, who was young, beautiful, and modeſt. No perſonal deformities were obſerved in either ſex, except in a few individuals who had ſcars of broad ulcers remaining on the face and other parts.</p>
                     <p>Many of the natives were armed with ſpears and clubs, the latter of which were generally about ſix feet long, made of a hard black wood, neatly poliſhed. The ſpears were formed of the ſame wood, ſimply pointed, and were in general twelve feet long; but ſome were ſo ſhort as to ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for darts.</p>
                     <p>They preſerved their canoes from the ſun under the ſhade of various trees. Our gentlemen ſaw eight or ten of them, all double ones; that is, two ſingle ones faſtened together by rafters laſhed acroſs. They were about four feet deep, and in length about twenty feet, and the ſides were round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a plank raiſed upon them. Two of theſe canoes were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uriouſly ſtained all over with black, in innumerable ſmall figures, as triangles, ſquares, &amp;c. and were far ſuperior to any thing of the kind Mr. Anderſon had ever ſeen at any other iſland in the South Sea. The paddles were almoſt elliptical, and about four feet long.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the trees obſerved by Mr. Anderſon, were cocoa-palms, ſome ſpecies of <hi>hibiſcus,</hi> a ſort of <hi>euphorbia,</hi> and many of the ſame kind he had ſeen at Mangeea. The latter are tall and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030274_0170_0FE56C810ED17118"/>
reſembling a cypreſs; and are called by the natives <hi>etoa.</hi> He alſo ſaw a ſpecies of <hi>convolvulus,</hi> and ſome treacle-muſtard; beſides which there are doubtleſs other plants and fruit-trees which he had not an opportunity of ſeeing. The ſoil, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea, is nothing more than a bank of coral, generally ſteep and rugged, which, though it has probably been for many centuries expoſed to the weather, has ſuffered no further change than becoming black on its ſurface. The reef or rock, with which the ſhore is lined, runs to different breadths into the ſea, where it reſembles a high ſteep wall: it is of a browniſh colour, and nearly even with the ſurface of the water; and though its texture is rather porous, it is capable of withſtanding the waſhing of the ſurf which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly breaks upon it.</p>
                     <p>Though the landing of our gentlemen was the means of enriching the narrative of the voyage with the preceding particulars, the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in view was partly unattained; for we ſcarce procured any thing worth mentioning from the iſland.</p>
                     <p>It has been already obſerved, that Omai was ſent upon this expedition as Mr. Gore's interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which, perhaps, was not the only ſervice he performed this day. He was queſtioned by the natives concerning us, our country, our ſhips and arms; in anſwer to which, he told them, among many other particulars, that our country
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030274_0171_0FE56C8296ED9D18"/>
had ſhips as large as their iſland, on board of which were implements of war (deſcribing our guns) of ſuch dimenſions, as to contain ſeveral people within them; one of which would demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the iſland at one ſhot. As for the guns in our two ſhips, he acknowledged they were but ſmall in compariſon with the former; yet even with theſe, he ſaid we could with great eaſe, at a conſiderable diſtance deſtroy the iſland and every ſoul in it. On their enquiring by what means this could be done, Omai produced ſome cartridges from his pocket, and having ſubmitted to inſpection the balls, and the gunpowder by which they were to be ſet in motion, he diſpoſed the latter upon the ground, and, by means of a piece of lighted wood, ſet it on fire. The ſudden blaſt, the mingled flame and ſmoke, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly ſucceeded, filled the natives with ſuch aſtoniſhment, that they no longer doubted the formidable power of our weapons. Had it not been for the terrible ideas they entertained of the guns of our ſhips, from this ſpecimen of their mode of operation, it was imagined that they would have detained the gentlemen the whole night; for Omai aſſured them, that, if he and his friends did not return on board the ſame day, they might expect that the Commodore would fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the iſland.</p>
                     <p>Though this iſland had never before been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by Europeans, there were other ſtrangers
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030274_0172_0FE56C841F3C0860"/>
now reſiding in it; and it was entirely owing to Omai's accompanying Mr. Gore, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumſtance came to our knowledge. He had ſcarcely landed on the beach, when he found among the crowd, three of his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, natives of the Society Iſles. At the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about two hundred leagues from thoſe iſlands, an immenſe ocean intervening, with ſuch miſerable ſea-boats as their inhabitants make uſe of, ſuch a meeting, at ſuch a place, ſo acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally viſited by us, may be conſidered as one of thoſe extraordinary and unexpected ſituations, which ſtrike a curious obſerver with wonder and amazement. The mutual ſurprize and pleaſure with which Omai and his countrymen engaged in converſation, may eaſily be imagined. Their ſtory, as related by themſelves, is a very affecting one. About twenty perſons, male and female, had embarked in a canoe at Otaheite, with an intention of croſſing over to Ulietea; but they were prevented by contrary winds from reaching the latter, or returning to the former iſland. Their ſtock of proviſions being ſoon exhauſted, they ſuffered inconceivable hardſhips. They paſſed many days without ſuſtenance, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which their number gradually dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, worn out by famine and fatigue. Only four men ſurvived, when their canoe was overſet. The deſtruction of this ſmall remnant now ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inevitable; however, they continued hanging
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030274_0173_0FE56C85A7ABBF18"/>
by the ſide of the veſſel, during ſome of the laſt days, till they providentially came in ſight of the inhabitants of this iſland, who ſent out canoes and brought them on ſhore. One of theſe four had ſince died. The other three were ſo well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied with the generous treatment they met with here, that they refuſed the offer made them by our gentlemen, at the requeſt of Omai, of taking them on board our ſhips, and reſtoring them to their native iſlands. They had arrived upon this coaſt at leaſt twelve years ago. Their names were Tavee, Otirreroa, and Orououte: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was born at Huahenie, the ſecond at Ulietea, and the latter at Otaheite. The application of the preceding narrative is obvious. It will ſerve to explain, in a more ſatisfactory manner than the flimſy conjectures of ſome ſpeculative reaſoners, how the detached parts of the world, and, in particular, the iſlands of the Pacific Ocean, may have been firſt peopled; thoſe eſpecially which lie at a conſiderable diſtance from each other, or from any inhabited continent.</p>
                     <p>The natives of this iſland call it by the name of Wateeoo. It is ſituated in the longitude of 201° 45′ eaſt, and in the latitude of 20° 1′ ſouth; and is about ſix leagues in circuit. It is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſpot, with a ſurface covered with verdure, and compoſed of hills and plains. The ſoil, in ſome parts, is light and ſandy: but, further up the country, we ſaw from the ſhip, by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030274_0174_0FE56C89D7CE2D60"/>
of our glaſſes, a reddiſh caſt on the riſing grounds. There the iſlanders build their houſes, for we could perceive ſeveral of them, which were long and ſpacious. Its produce is nearly the ſame with that of Mangeea Nooe Nainaiwa, the iſland we had laſt quitted.</p>
                     <p>If we may depend on Omai's report of what he learned from his three countrymen in the courſe of converſation, the manners of the people of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeoo, their general habits of life, and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treating ſtrangers, greatly reſemble thoſe that prevail at Otaheite, and its neighbouring iſlands. There is alſo a great ſimilarity between their religious opinions and ceremonies. From every circumſtance, indeed, it may be conſidered as indubitable, that the inhabitants of Wateeoo derive their deſcent from the ſame ſtock which has ſo remarkably diffuſed itſelf over the immenſe extent of the Southern Ocean. Omai aſſured us that they dignified their iſland with the pompous appellation of <hi>Wenooa no te Eatoa,</hi> implying <hi>a land of Gods;</hi> eſteeming themſelves a kind of divinities, poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of the <hi>Eatoa.</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>CALMS and light airs having alternately prevailed all the night of the 3d. of April, before day-break the eaſterly ſwell nad carried the ſhips ſome diſtance from <hi>Wateeoo</hi>; but having failed of procuring, at that place, ſome effectual ſupply, there appeared no reaſon for our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing there any longer; we therefore willingly quitted it, and ſteered for the iſland which we had diſcovered three days before.</p>
                     <p>We got up with it about ten o'clock in the morning, when Captain Cook immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Mr. Gore with two boats, to ſee if he could land, and get ſubſiſtence for our cattle. Though a reef ſurrounded the land here, as at <hi>Wateeoo,</hi> and a conſiderable ſurf broke againſt the rocks, our boats no ſooner reached the weſt ſide
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030274_0176_0FE56C8D5F45A938"/>
of the iſland, but they ventured in, and Mr. Gore and his attendants arrived ſafe on ſhore. Captain Cook, ſeeing they had ſo far ſucceeded, ſent a ſmall boat to know if farther aſſiſtance was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. She waited to take in a lading of the produce of the iſland, and did not return till three o'clock in the afternoon: being cleared, ſhe was ſent again for another cargo; the jolly boat was alſo diſpatched upon the ſame buſineſs, with orders for Mr. Gore to return vith the boats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night, which orders were punctually obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>The ſupply obtained here was about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred cocoa-nuts for ourſelves, and for our cattle ſome graſs, and a quantity of the leaves and branches of young cocoa trees, and the pandanus.</p>
                     <p>This iſland lies about three or four leagues from <hi>Wateeoo,</hi> the inhabitants of which call it <hi>Otakootaia.</hi> It is in the latitude of 19° 15′ ſouth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he longitude of 201° 37′ eaſt, and is ſuppoſed not to exceed three miles in circuit.</p>
                     <p>This iſland is entirely deſtitute of water. Cocoa-palms were the only common trees found there, of which there were ſeveral cluſters, and great quantities of the <hi>wharra,</hi> or <hi>pandanus.</hi> There were alſo the <hi>callophyllum, ſuriana,</hi> with a few other ſhrubs; alſo a ſort of <hi>bind-weed, treacle-muſtard,</hi> a ſpecies of <hi>ſpurge,</hi> and the <hi>morinda citri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folia</hi>; the fruit of which is ſometimes eaten by the natives of Otaheite. Omai, who landed with
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030274_0177_0FE56C8EE5F98AD8"/>
the party, dreſſed ſome of it for their dinner, but they thought it very indifferent.</p>
                     <p>A beautiful cuckoo, of a cheſnut brown, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with black, was the only bird ſeen amongſt the trees; but, upon the ſhore, were a ſmall ſort of curlew, blue and white herons, ſome egg-birds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and great numbers of noddies.</p>
                     <p>One of the company caught a lizard running up a tree; though ſmall it had a moſt forbidding aſpect. Many of another ſort were alſo ſeen. Infinite numbers of a kind of moth, elegantly ſpeckled with black, white, and red, frequented the buſhes towards the ſea. Some other ſorts of moths and pretty butterflies were ſeen.</p>
                     <p>At this time there were no fixed inhabitants upon the iſland; but we diſcovered a few empty huts, which convinced us of its being, at leaſt occaſionally viſited. Monuments, conſiſting of ſeveral large ſtones, were alſo erected under the ſhade of ſome trees: there were alſo ſome ſmaller ones, with which ſeveral places were incloſed, where we ſuppoſed their dead had been buried. We found in one place a great many cockle-ſhells of a particular ſort, finely grooved, and larger than the fiſt; from which it was conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, that the iſland had been viſited by perſons who ſometimes feed on ſhell-fiſh. Mr. Gore left ſome nails and a hatchet in one of the huts, for the uſe of thoſe who might viſit the iſland in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="unknown:030274_0178_0FE56C960EF96790"/>The boats being hoiſted in, we made ſail again to the northward, reſolving to try our fortune at Hervey's iſland, which was diſcovered by Captain Cook in 1773, during his laſt voyage, We got ſight of it about day break in the morning of the 6th, at the diſtance of about three leagues. We approached it about eight o'clock, and obſerved ſeveral canoes coming from the ſhore towards the ſhips. We were rather ſurprized at this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as no traces or ſigns of inhabitants were ſeen when the iſland was firſt diſcovered: this indeed, might be owing to a briſk wind that then blew, and prevented their canoes venturing out.</p>
                     <p>Advancing ſtill towards the iſland, ſix or ſeven double canoes immediately came near us, with from three to ſix men in each of them. At the diſtance of about a ſtone's throw from the ſhip they ſtopped, and it was with difficulty that Omai prevailed on them to come along ſide; but they could not be induced to truſt themſelves on board. They attempted to ſteal ſome oars out of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery's boat, and ſtruck a man for endeavouring to prevent them. They alſo cut away a net contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meat, which hung ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r the ſtern of that ſhip, and at firſt would not reſtore it, though they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards permitted us to purchaſe it from them. Thoſe who were about the Reſolution behaved equally diſorderly and daring; for, with a ſort of hooks
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030274_0179_0FE56C97F362F7E0"/>
made of a long ſtick, they openly endeavoured to rob us of ſeveral things, and actually got a frock belonging to one of our people. It appeared that they had a knowledge of bartering, for they exchanged ſome fiſh for ſome of our ſmall nails, of which they were extravagantly fond, and called them <hi>goore.</hi> Pieces of paper, or any other trifling articles that was thrown to them, they caught with the greateſt avidity; and if what was thrown fell into the ſea, they immediately plunged in to ſwim after it.</p>
                     <p>Though the diſtance between Hervey's Iſland and Wateeoo is not very great, the inhabitants differ greatly from each other, both in perſon and diſpoſition. The colour of the natives of Hervey's Iſland is of a deeper caſt, and ſeveral of them had a fierce ſavage aſpect, like the natives of New-Zealand, though ſome were fairer. Their hair was long and black, either hanging looſe about their ſhoulders, or tied in a bunch on the top of the head. Some few, indeed, had it cropped ſhort, and, in two or three of them, it was of a red or browniſh colour. Their clothing was a narrow piece of mat, bound ſeveral times round the lower part of the body, and paſſing between the thighs. We ſaw a fine cap of red feathers lying in one of the canoes, and ſome amongſt them were ornamented with the ſhell of a pearl-oyſter, poliſhed, and hung about the neck.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="unknown:030274_0180_0FE56C998098DCD0"/>The mode of ornament, ſo prevalent among the natives of this ocean, of puncturing or tatooing their bodies, not one of them had adopted; but though they were ſingular in this reſpect, their being of the ſame common race is not to be doubted. Their language more reſembled the dialect of Otaheite, than that of Mangeea or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeoo. Like the natives of thoſe iſlands, they enquired from whence we came, whither bound, the ſhip's name, the name of our chief, and the number of men on board. Such queſtions as we propoſed to them, they very readily anſwered. They informed us, among other things that they had before ſeen two large ſhips like ours, but had not ſpoken to them as they paſſed. Theſe were, doubtleſs, the Reſolution and Adventure. They acquainted us, that the name of their iſland was Terouggemou Atooa; and that they were ſubject to Teerevatooeah, King of Wateeoo.</p>
                     <p>Their food, they ſaid, conſiſted of cocoa-nuts, fiſh, and turtle; being deſtitute of dogs and hogs, and the iſland not producing bread fruit or plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Their canoes (near thirty of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared one time in ſight) are tolerably large, and well built, and bear ſome reſemblance to thoſe of Wateeoo.</p>
                     <p>We drew near the north-weſt part of the iſland about one o'clock. This ſeemed to be the only part where we could expect to find anchorage, or a landing-place for our boats. Captain Cook
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030274_0181_0FE56C9BCBA46860"/>
immediately diſpatched Lieutenant King, with two armed boats, to ſound and reconn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tre the coaſt. The boats were no ſooner hoiſted out, than our new viſitors ſuſpended their traffic with us, puſhing for ſhore as faſt as poſſible, and came no more near us.</p>
                     <p>The boats returned at three o'clock, and Mr. King informed Captain Cook that he could find no anchorage for the ſhips; and that the boats could advance no farther than the outer edge of the reef, which was almoſt a quarter of a mile from the dry land. That a number of the natives came upon the reef, armed with clubs and long pikes, meaning, as he ſuppoſed, to oppoſe his landing; though, at the ſame time, they threw cocoa-nuts to our people, and requeſted them to come on ſhore; and notwithſtanding this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friendly treatment, the women were very active in bringing down a freſh ſupply of darts and ſpears.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook conſidered that as we could not bring the ſhips to an anchor, the attempt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure graſs here would be attended with delay and danger. Being thus diſappointed in all the iſlands after our leaving New-Zealand, and having, from variety of circumſtances, been unavoidably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded in our progreſs, it was in vain to think of doing any thing this year in the high latitudes of the nothern hemiſphere, from which we were then ſo far diſtant, though it was then the ſeaſon
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030274_0182_0FE56CA2B89F7FA8"/>
for our operations there. Thus ſituated, it was neceſſary to purſue ſuch meaſures as appeared beſt calculated to preſerve our cattle, and ſave the ſtores and proviſions of the ſhips; the better to enable us to proſecute our nothern diſcoveries, which could not now commence till a year later than was intended.</p>
                     <p>If we could fortunately have procured a ſupply of water and graſs, at any of the iſlands we had lately viſited, Captain Cook intended to have ſtood back to the ſouth till he had got a weſterly wind. But, without ſuch a ſupply, the certain conſequence of doing this, would have been the loſs of the cattle before it was poſſible for us to reach Otaheite, without gaining a ſingle point of advantage reſpecting the grand object of our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                     <p>The Captain, therefore, determined to bear away for the Friendly Iſlands, where he knew he could be well ſupplied with everything he wanted: and, it being neceſſary to run night and day, he ordered Captain Clerke to keep a league a-head of the Reſolution; becauſe his ſhip could beſt claw of the land, which we might poſſibly fall in with in our paſſage.</p>
                     <p>We ſteered weſt by ſouth, with a fine breeze. Captain Cook propoſed to proceed firſt to Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburgh, or Eooa, thinking we might, perhaps, have proviſion enough for the cattle, to laſt till we ſhould arrive at that iſland. But the next day
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030274_0183_0FE56CA4D1A4FF90"/>
about noon, thoſe faint breezes that had ſo long retarded us, again returned; and we found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to get into the latitude of Palmerſton's and Savage Iſlands, which Captain Cook diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in 1774; that, in caſe of neceſſity, recourſe might be had to them.</p>
                     <p>In order to ſave our water, Captain Cook or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſtill to be kept at work a whole day; during which time we procured about fifteen gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of freſh water.</p>
                     <p>Theſe light breezes continued till Thurſday the 10th, when the wind blew ſome hours freſh from the north, and north north-weſt. In the afternoon we had ſome very heavy rain, attended with thunder ſqualls. We collected as much rain-water as filled five of our puncheons. When theſe ſqualls had blown over, the wind was very unſettled, both in ſtrength and in poſition, till the next day at noon, when it fixed at north-weſt, and north north-weſt, and blew a freſh breeze.</p>
                     <p>We were thus perſecuted with a wind in our teeth, and had the additional mortification to find thoſe very winds here, which we had reaſon to expect farther ſouth. At day break, however, on the 13th, we perceived Palmerſton's Iſland, bearing weſt by ſouth, at the diſtance of about five leagues; but did not get up with it till the next morning at eight. Captain Cook then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched three boats from the Reſolution, and one from the Diſcovery, with a proper officer in each,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030274_0184_0FE56CA65A800EC0"/>
to ſearch for a convenient landing place; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now under an abſolute neceſſity of procuring here ſome provender for our cattle, or we muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have loſt them.</p>
                     <p>What is called Palmerſton's Iſland, conſiſts of a group of ſmall iſlets, about nine or ten in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, connected together by a reef of coral rocks, and lying in a circular direction. The boats firſt examined the moſt ſouth eaſterly iſlet; and not ſucceeding there, ran down to the ſecond, where they immediately landed. Captain Cook then bore down with the ſhips, till we were a-breaſt of the place, where we kept ſtanding off and on, there being no bottom to be found to anchor upon. This, however, was of no material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as there were no human beings upon the iſland, except the party who had landed from our boats.</p>
                     <p>At one o'clock one of the boats returned, laden with ſcurvy-graſs and young cocoa-trees, which was, at this time, a moſt excellent repaſt for our animals on board. A meſſage was alſo brought from Mr. Gore, who commanded the party upon this expedition, acquainting us that the iſland abounded with ſuch produce, and alſo with the wharra-tree and cocoa-nuts. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this information, Captain Cook re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to get a ſufficient ſupply of theſe articles before he quitted this ſtation, and accordingly went a-ſhore in a ſmall boat, accompanied by the
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030274_0185_0FE56CA82ED6BCE8"/>
Captain of the Diſcovery. The iſland does not exceed a mile in circumference, and is not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above three feet beyond the level of the ſea. It conſiſted almoſt entirely of a coral ſand, with a ſmall mixture of blackiſh mould, which appeared to be produced from rotten vegetables.</p>
                     <p>This poor ſoil is, however, covered with the ſame kind of ſhrubs and buſhes as we had ſeen at Otakootia or Wenooa-ette, though not in ſo great variety. We perceived a great number of man of war birds, tropic birds, and two ſorts of boobies, which were then laying their eggs, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly tame as to permit us to take them off their neſts, which conſiſts only of a few ſticks looſely put together. Theſe tropic birds differ eſſentially from the common ſort, being of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful white, ſlightly tinged with red, and having two long tail feathers of a deepiſh crimſon. Our people killed a conſiderable number of each ſort, which, though not the moſt delicate kind of food, were highly acceptable to us, who had been for a long time confined to a ſalt diet. We ſaw plenty of red crabs creeping about among the trees; and caught ſeveral fiſh, which, when the ſea retreated, had been left in holes upon the reef.</p>
                     <p>At one part of the reef, which bounds the lake within, almoſt even with the ſurface, there was a large bed of coral, which afforded a moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting proſpect. Its baſe, which was fixed to
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030274_0186_0FE56CADC03377C8"/>
the ſhore, extended ſo far that it could not be ſeen, ſo that it appeared to be ſuſpended in the water. The ſea was then unruffled, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgence of the ſun expoſed the various ſorts of coral, in the moſt beautiful order; ſome parts luxuriantly branching into the water; others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in vaſt variety of figures; and the whole greatly heightened by ſpangles of the richeſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, glowing from a number of large clams, interſperſed in every part. Even this delightful ſcene was greatly improved by the multitude of fiſhes, that gently glided along, ſeemingly with the moſt perfect ſecurity. Their colours were the moſt beautiful that can be imagined; blue yellow, black, red, &amp;c. far excelling any thing that can be produced by art. The richneſs of this ſubmarine grotto was greatly increaſed by their various forms; and the whole could not poſſibly be ſurveyed without a pleaſing tranſport, accompanied, at the ſame time, with regret, that a work ſo aſtoniſhingly elegant ſhould be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a place ſo ſeldom explored by the human eye.</p>
                     <p>Except a piece of a canoe that was found upon the beach, no traces were diſcoverable of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants having ever been here; and probably that may have been drifted from ſome other iſland. We were ſurpriſed, however, at perceiving ſome ſmall brown rats on this little iſland; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, perhaps, not eaſily accounted for, unleſs
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030274_0187_0FE56CB0227D21D0"/>
we admit the poſſibility of their being imported in the canoe, of which we ſaw the remnant.</p>
                     <p>The boats being laden, Captain Cook returned on board, leaving Mr. Gore and his party to paſs the night on ſhore, to be ready for buſineſs early the next morning.</p>
                     <p>The 15th. like the preceding day, was ſpent in collecting ſubſiſtence for the cattle, conſiſting principally of tender branches of the wharra tree, palm-cabbage, and young cocoa-nut trees. A ſufficient ſupply of theſe having been procured by ſun-ſet, Captain Cook ordered all the people on board: but having very little wind, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to employ the next day, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the next iſland to leeward, to get ſome cocoa-nuts for our people: for this purpoſe, we kept ſtanding off and on all the night; and, about nine o'clock in the morning, we went to the weſt-ſide of the iſlands, and landed, from our boats, with little difficulty. The people immediately employed themſelves in gathering cocoa-nuts, which we found in the greateſt plenty; but it was a tedious operation to convey them to our boats, being obliged to carry them half a mile over the reef, up to the middle in water. Omai, who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied us, preſently caught, with a ſcoop-net, as many fiſh as ſupplied the party on ſhore for din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, beſides ſending a quantity to each ſhip. Men of war, and tropic-birds, were found here in abundance; ſo that we fared moſt ſumptuouſly.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030274_0188_0FE56CB1C089A648"/>
In theſe excurſions to the uninhabited iſlands, Omai was of the greateſt ſervice to us. He caught the fiſh, and dreſſed them, as well as the birds we killed, after the faſhion of his country, with a dexterity and cheerfulneſs that did him hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Before night the boats had made two trips, and were each time heavy laden: with the laſt, Captain Cook returned on board, leaving his Third Lieutenant, Mr. Williamſon, with a party, to prepare another lading for the boats againſt the next morning.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, Capt. Cook diſpatched them about ſeven o'clock, and, by noon, they returned laden. No delay was made in ſending them back for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cargo, with orders for all to be on board by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. Theſe orders being punctually obeyed, we hoiſted in the boats, and ſailed to the weſtward, with a light air from the north.</p>
                     <p>The iſlet we laſt came from is ſomewhat larger than the other, and almoſt covered with cocoa-palms. The other productions were the ſame as at the firſt iſlet. On the beach were found two pieces of board, one of which was rudely carved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an elliptical paddle. Theſe were, perhaps, a part of the ſame canoe, the remains of which we had ſeen on the other beach, the two iſlets being within half a mile of each other. There were not ſo many crabs here as at the laſt place, but we found ſome ſcorpions and other inſects, and a much greater number of fiſh upon the reefs.
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030274_0189_0FE56CB356397FB8"/>
Among the reſt were ſome beautiful large ſpotted eels, which would raiſe themſelves out of the water, and endeavour to bite their purſuers. There were alſo ſnappers, parrot-fiſh, and a brown ſpotted rock-fiſh, not larger than a haddock, ſo tame, that it would remain fixed, and gaze at us. If we had been really in want, a ſufficient ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply might eaſily have been had, for thouſands of the clams ſtuck upon the reef, many of which weighed two or three pounds. There were alſo ſome other ſorts of ſhell-fiſh; and, when the tide flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeveral ſharks came with it, ſome of which were killed by our people; but their preſence rendered it, at that time, unſafe to walk into the water.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Williamſon and his party, who were left on ſhore, were much peſtered in the night with muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitoes. Some of them ſhot two curlews, and ſaw ſome plovers upon the ſhore; one or two cuckoos, like thoſe at Wenooa-ette, were alſo ſeen.</p>
                     <p>The iſlets comprehended under the name of Palmerſton's Iſland, may be ſaid to be the ſummits of a reef of coral-rock, covered only with a thin coat of ſand; though clothed with trees and plants, like the low grounds of the high iſlands of this ocean.</p>
                     <p>Having left Palmerſton's Iſland, we ſteered weſt, in order to proceed to Annamooka. We had variable winds, with ſqualls, ſome thunder, and much rain. The ſhowers being very copious, we ſaved a conſiderable quantity of water; and,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030274_0190_0FE56CB8C7D8CDE8"/>
as we could procure a greater ſupply in one hour, by the rain, than by diſtilation in a month, we laid the ſtill aſide, as being attended with more trouble than advantage.</p>
                     <p>The heat, which had continued in the extreme for about a month, became much more diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this cloſe rainy weather, and we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it would ſoon be noxious. It is however, remarkable, that there was not then a ſingle perſon ſick on board either of the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed Savage Iſland, which Captain Cook diſcovered in 1774, in the night between the 24th and 25th; and on the 28th, about ten o'clock in the morning, we ſaw the iſlands to the eaſtward of Annamooka, bearing north by weſt about five leagues diſtant. We ſteered to the ſouth, and then hauled up for Annamooka. At the approach of night, the weather being ſqually, with rain, we anchored in fifteen fathoms water.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE had not long anchored, when two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes paddled towards us, and came along ſide without delay or heſitation: there were four men in one of the canoes, and three in the other. They brought with them ſome ſugar-cane, bread-fruit, plaintains, and cocoa-nuts, which they bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with us for nails. After theſe canoes had left us, we were viſited by another; but as night was approaching, he did not long continue with us. The iſland neareſt to us was Komango, which was five miles diſtant, this ſhews how theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſregard trouble or danger, to get poſſeſſion of a few of our moſt trifling articles.</p>
                     <p>At four o'clock the next morning, Captain Cook diſpatched Leutenanat King with two boats to Komango, in order to procure refreſhments;
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030274_0192_0FE56CBC31DC7B08"/>
and at five made the ſignal to weigh, to proceed to Annamooka.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as day-light apppeared, we were viſited by ſix or ſeven canoes, bringing with them two pigs, ſome fowls, ſeveral large wood-pidgeons, ſmall rails, and ſome violet coloured coots, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides fruits and roots of various kinds; which they exchanged with us for nails, hatchets, beads, &amp;c. They had other articles of commerce, but Captain Cook gave particular orders that no cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities ſhould be purchaſed, till the ſhips were ſupplied with proviſions, and till they had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed permiſſion from him.</p>
                     <p>About noon Mr. King's boat returned with ſeven hogs, ſome fowls, a quantity of fruit and roots; and alſo ſome graſs for our animals. His party was treated with great civility at Komango. The inhabitants did not appear to be numerous: and their huts, which almoſt joined to each other, were but indifferent. Tooboulangee, the chief of the iſland, and another, named Taipa, came on board with Mr. King. They brought a hog, as a preſent to Captain Cook, and promiſed to bring ſome more the next day.</p>
                     <p>The boats being a-board, we ſtood for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namooka; and, having little wind, we intended to go between Annamooka-ette<note n="*" place="bottom">Little Annamooka.</note>, and the breakers at the ſouth-eaſt; but, on drawing near, we met
<pb facs="unknown:030274_0193_0FE56C6BF93E1938"/>
                        <figure/>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:030274_0194_0FE56CBDB956AA48"/>
with very irregular ſoundings, which obliged us to relinquiſh the deſign, and go to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This carried us to leeward, and we found it neceſſary to ſpend the night under ſail. It was dark and rainy, and we had the wind from every direction. The next morning at day-light, we were farther off than we had been the preceding evening; and the wind was now right in our teeth.</p>
                     <p>We continued to ply, to very little purpoſe, the whole day, and, in the evening, anchored in thirty-nine fathoms water; the weſt point of Annamooka bearing eaſt north-eaſt, four miles diſtant. Tooboulangee and Taipa, agreeable to their promiſe, brought off ſome hogs for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook: we obtained others, by bartering, from the different canoes that followed us, and a large quantity of fruit. It is remarkable, that thoſe who viſited us from the iſland on that day, would hardly part with any of their commodities to any one but Captain Cook.</p>
                     <p>At four the next morning, Captain Cook or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a boat to be hoiſted out, and the maſter to ſound the ſouth-weſt ſide of Annamooka. When he returned, he reported, that he had founded between Great and Little Annamooka, where he found ten and twelve fathoms depth of water; that the place was very well ſheltered from winds; but that no freſh water was to be had but at a conſiderable diſtance inland, and that, even there,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030274_0195_0FE56CC32AD12A98"/>
it was neither plentiful nor good. For this very ſufficient reaſon, Captain Cook reſolved to anchor on the north ſide of the iſland, where, in his laſt voyage, he had found a convenient place for water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and landing.</p>
                     <p>Though not above a league diſtant, we did not reach it till about five o'clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, being retarded by the quantity of canoes that crowded round the ſhips, laden with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſupplies of the produce of their iſland. Several of the canoes, which were double, had a large ſail, and carried between forty and fifty men each. Several women too appeared in the canoes, incited, perhaps, by curioſity to viſit us; though they were as earneſt in bartering as the men, and uſed the paddle with equal ſkill and dexterity. We came to an anchor in eighteen fathoms water, the iſland extending from eaſt to ſouth-weſt, about three quarters of a mile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Thus Captain Cook reſumed the ſtation, which he had occupied when he viſited Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooka three years before; and probably where Taſman, who firſt diſcovered this iſland, anchored in 1643.</p>
                     <p>The next day, during the preparations for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ering, Captain Cook went aſhore, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, accompanied by Captain Clerke, and others, to fix on a place for ſetting up the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatories, the natives having readily granted us permiſſion. They ſhewed us every mark of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030274_0196_0FE56CC4CCFEC458"/>
and accommodated us with a boat-houſe, which anſwered the purpoſe of a tent. Toobou, the chief of the iſland, conducted Captain Cook and Omai to his houſe, ſituated on a pleaſant ſpot, in the centre of his plantation. It was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a graſs-plot, which he ſaid was for the purpoſe of cleaning their feet, before they entered his habitation. Such an attention to cleanlineſs we had never obſerved before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we had viſited in this ocean; though we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards found it to be very common at the Friendly Iſlands. No carpet in an Engliſh draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room could be kept neater, than the mats which covered the floor of Toobou's houſe.</p>
                     <p>While we were on ſhore, we bartered for ſome hogs and fruit; and, when we arrived on board, the ſhips were crowded with the natives. As ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few of them came empty-handed, we were ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſupplied with every refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, Captain Cook landed again, with a party of marines, and ſuch of the cattle as were in a weakly ſtate, were ſent on ſhore with him. Having ſettled every thing to his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction, he returned to the ſhip in the evening, leaving Mr. King in command upon the iſland. Taipa was now become our truſty friend, and, in order to be near our party, had a houſe carried a quarter of a mile, upon men's ſhoulders, and placed by the ſide of the ſhed which our party oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="unknown:030274_0197_0FE56CC65525F0C0"/>Our various operations on ſhore began the next day. Some were buſied in making hay, others in filling our water-caſks, and a third party in cutting wood. On the ſame day, Meſſrs. King and Baily began to obſerve equal altitudes of the ſun, in order to get the rate of our time-keepers. In the evening, Taipa harangued the natives, for ſome time; but we could only gueſs at the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſuppoſed he was inſtructing them how to treat us, and adviſing them to bring of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the iſland to market. His eloquence had the deſired effect, and occaſioned us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a plentiful ſupply of proviſions the next day.</p>
                     <p>On the 4th of May, the Diſcovery loſt her ſmall bower anchor, the cable being cut in two by the rocks.</p>
                     <p>We were viſited, on the 6th, by a chief from Tongataboo, whoſe name was Feenou: he was introduced by Taipa, as King of all the Friendly Iſles. Captain Cook was now informed, that, on our arrival, a canoe had been immediately diſpatched to Tongataboo with the news; which occaſioned his coming to Annamooka. We were informed, by the officer on ſhore, that, on his arrival, all the natives were ordered out to meet him, who ſaluted him by bowing their heads as low as his feet, the ſoles of which they touched with the palms of each hand, and afterwards with the back part. A perſonage received with ſuch
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030274_0198_0FE56CC82993B128"/>
extraordinary marks of reſpect, could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be any thing leſs than a King.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook in the afternoon, went to pay a viſit to this great man, having firſt received from him a preſent of two fiſh, brought on board by one of his attendants. As ſoon as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain landed, Feenou came up to him. He was tall and thin, and appeared to be about thirty years of age: his features were more of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean caſt than any we had ſeen here. After the firſt ſalutation, Captain Cook requeſted to know if he was king; as he entertained ſome doubts on that ſcore, perceiving that he was not the man whom he remembered to have ſeen in that character during his former voyage. Taipa ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly anſwered for him, and mentioned no leſs than one hundred and fifty three iſlands, of which he was the ſovereign. Soon after, our grand vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, attended by five or ſix ſervants, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied us on board. Captain Cook made them ſuitable preſents, and entertained them in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which he thought would be moſt agreeably to them.</p>
                     <p>Towards the evening, the Captain attended them on ſhore in his boat, into which, by order of the chief, three hogs were conveyed, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for preſents he had received. We were then informed of an accident, the relation of which will convey ſome idea of the extent of the authority exerciſed here over the inferior people.
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030274_0199_0FE56CCD350793A8"/>
While Feenou was on board the Reſolution, an inferior chief ordered all the natives to retire from the poſt we occupied. Some of them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, having ventured to return, he beat them moſt unmercifully, with a large ſtick. One, in particular, received ſo violent a blow on the ſide of the face, that the blood guſhed from his mouth and noſtrils: and, after lying motionleſs for ſome time, he was removed from the place in convulſions. The perſon who gave the blow, on being told that he certainly had killed the man, only laughed at the circumſtance; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it was very evident, that he did not grieve for what had happened. We had afterwards the ſatisfaction of hearing that the poor ſufferer was out of danger.</p>
                     <p>On the 7th, the Diſcovery having found her ſmall bower anchor, ſhifted her birth; but not till after her beſt bower cable had met with the fate of the other. This day, Feenou dined with Captain Cook; and alſo on the next, when he was attended by Taipa, Toobou, and ſome other chiefs. None but Taipa, however was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſit at table with Feeuou, or even to eat in his preſence. The Captain was highly pleaſed on account of this etiquette; for before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of Feenou, he had generally a larger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany than he choſe, his table being overflowed with viſitors of both ſexes. For though, at Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite, the females are denied the privilege of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030274_0200_0FE56CCEBB879BD8"/>
in company with the men, this is not the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at the Friendly Iſlands.</p>
                     <p>A large junk axe having been ſtolen out of the ſhip by one of the natives on the firſt day of our arrival at Annamooka, application was made to Feenou to exert his authority to get it reſtored; who gave orders for this purpoſe, which exacted ſuch implicit obedience, that it was brought on board before we had finiſhed our dinner. We had, indeed, many opportunities of remarking, how expert theſe people were in thievery. Even ſome of their chiefs were not aſhamed of acting in that profeſſion. On the 9th of May, one of them was detected carrying out of the ſhip, the bolt belonging to the ſpun-yarn winch, which he had carefully concealed under his clothes. For this offence Captain Cook ſentenced him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a dozen laſhes, and to be confined till he paid a hog for his liberty. Though, after this circumſtance, we were troubled with no more thieves of rank, their ſervants or ſlaves were conſtantly employed in this dirty buſineſs; and they received a flogging with as much ſeeming indifference, as if it had been upon the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt. When any of them were caught in the act of thieving, inſtead of interceding in their behalf, their maſters would often adviſe us to kill them. This being a puniſhment we were not fond of inflicting, they uſually eſcaped without any kind of puniſhment; they were alike inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030274_0201_0FE56CD04A3B2FB8"/>
of the ſhame and torture of corporal chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement. At length, however, Captain Clerke contrived a mode of treatment, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed had ſome effect. Immediately upon detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ordered their heads to be completely ſhav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thus pointed them out as objects of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule to their countrymen, and put our people upon their guard, to deprive them of future opportunites for a repetition of their thefts.</p>
                     <p>Feenou was ſo fond of our company, that he dined on board every day, though he did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways partake of our fare. On the 10th, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants brought him a meſs, which had been dreſſed on ſhore, conſiſting of fiſh, ſoup, and yams; cocoa-nut liquor had been uſed inſtead of water, in which the fiſh had been boiled or ſtewed, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in a wooden veſſel with hot ſtones) and it was carried on board on a plantain leaf. Captain Cook taſted of the meſs, and was ſo well pleaſed with it, that he afterwards ordered ſome fiſh to be dreſſed in the ſame way; though his cook ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded tolerably well, it was much inferior to the diſh he attempted to imitate.</p>
                     <p>Having, in a great meaſure, exhauſted the iſland of almoſt every article of food, on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 11th of May, we removed, from the ſhore, the obſervatories, horſes, and other things that we had landed; intending to ſail as ſoon as the Diſcovery ſhould have found her beſt bower anchor. Feenou, hearing that the Captain meant to
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030274_0202_0FE56CD21920A1E8"/>
proceed to Tongataboo, earneſtly entreated him to alter his plan; expreſſing as much averſion to it, as if, by diverting him from it, he wiſhed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſome particular intereſt of his own. He warmly recommended a group of iſlands, called Hapaee, lying to the north-eaſt; where, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us, we could be eaſily and plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with every refreſhment; and even offered to attend us thither in perſon. In conſequence of his advice, Hapaee was made choice of; and, as it had not been viſited by any European ſhips, the ſurveying it became an object to Captain Cook.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 13th, Captain Clerke's anchor was happily recovered; and, on the morning of the 14th, we got under ſail, and left Annamoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka.</p>
                     <p>Though this iſland is ſomewhat higher than the other ſmall iſles that ſurround it, yet it is lower than Mangeea and Wateeoo; and even thoſe are but of a moderate height. The ſhore, where our ſhips lay, conſiſts of a ſteep, rugged, coral rock, about nine or ten feet high, except two ſandy beaches, which were defended from the ſea, by a reef of the ſame ſort of rock. In the centre of the iſland there is a ſalt water lake, about a mile and an half in breadth, round which the ground riſes with a gradual aſcent; and we could not trace its having any communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſea. On the riſing parts of the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030274_0203_0FE56CD58DF27710"/>
iſland, and eſpecially towards the ſea, the ſoil is either of a blackiſh looſe mould, or a reddiſh clay; but there is not a ſtream of freſh water to be found in any part of the iſland.</p>
                     <p>The land here is well cultivated, except in a few places; and, though ſome parts appear to lie waſte, they are only left to recover the ſtrength exhauſted by conſtant culture; for we often ſaw the natives at work upon theſe ſpots, in order to plant them again. Yams and plantains form their principal plantations; many of which are very extenſive, and encloſed with fences of reed about ſix feet high. Fences of leſs compaſs were often ſeen within theſe, ſurrounding the houſes of the principal people. The bread-fruit and cocoa-nut-trees are interſperſed without any regular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but principally near the habitations of the natives. The other parts of the iſland, eſpecially towards the ſea, and round the lake, are covered with luxuriant trees and buſhes; among which there are a great many mangroves and faitanoo-trees. All the rocks and ſtones about the iſland are of coral, except in one place, to the right of the ſandy beach, where there is a rock of about twenty five feet in height, of a calcareous ſtone, and of a yellowiſh colour; but, even here, ſome large pieces are to be ſeen of the ſame coral rock as that which compoſe the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>We ſometimes amuſed ourſelves in walking up the country and ſhooting wild ducks, reſembling
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030274_0204_0FE56CD765F8D728"/>
our widgeon, which are very numerous on the ſalt lake, as well as on the pool where we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured our water. We found, in theſe excurſions, that the inhabitants frequently deſerted their houſes to repair to the trading place, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the leaſt ſuſpicion that ſtrangers would take away or deſtroy any property that belonged to them. From this circumſtance it might be ſuppoſed, that moſt of the natives were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times collected on the beach, and that there would be no great difficulty in forming an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate computation of their number; but the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual reſort of viſitors, from the other iſlands, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it impoſſible. However, as we never ſaw more than a thouſand perſons collected at one time, it may be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that there are about twice that number upon the iſland.</p>
                     <p>In the direct track to Hapaee, whither we were now bound, to the north and north-eaſt of Annamooka, a great number of ſmall iſles are ſeen. Amidſt the rocks and ſhoals adjoining to this group, we were doubtful whether there was a free paſſage for ſhips of ſuch magnitude as ours; though the natives ſailed through the intervals in their canoes; therefore, when we weighed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor from Annamooka, we ſteered to go to the weſtward of the above iſlands, and north north-weſt towards Kao, and Tooſoa, two iſlands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their great height, and the moſt weſterly of thoſe in ſight. Feenou, with his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030274_0205_0FE56CD8F1FF7FE0"/>
remained in the Reſolution till about noon, and then entered the large ſailing canoe, which had brought him from Tongataboo, and ſtood in amongſt the cluſter of iſlands, of which we were now abreaſt.</p>
                     <p>They are ſcattered at unequal diſtances, and moſt of them are as high as Annamooka. Some of them are two or three miles in length, and others only half a mile. Many of them have ſteep rocky ſhores, like Annamooka; ſome have reddiſh cliffs, and others have ſandy beaches, extending almoſt their whole length. In general, they are entirely clothed with trees, among which are many cocoa-palms, each having the appearance of a beautiful garden placed in the ſea. The ſerene weather we now had, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted greatly to heighten the ſcene; and the whole might convey an idea of the realization of ſome fairy land. It appears, that ſome of theſe iſlands have been formed, as Palmerſton's iſland was ſuppoſed to have been; for one of them is now entirely ſand, and another has but a ſingle buſh or tree upon it.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, about four o'clock, we ſteered to the north, leaving Toofoa and Kao on our lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. We intended to have anchored for the night, but it arrived before we could find a place, in leſs than fifty fathoms water; and we rather choſe to ſpend the night under ſail, than come to in ſuch a depth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="unknown:030274_0206_0FE56C63927D3B08"/>In the afternoon, we had been within two leagues of Toofoa, and obſerved the ſmoke of it ſeveral times in the day. There is a volcano upon it, of which the Friendly iſlanders entertain ſome ſuperſtitious notions, and call it <hi>Kollofeea,</hi> ſaying, it is an Otooa, or divinity. We were informed, that it ſometimes throws up very large ſtones, and the <hi>crater</hi> is compared to the ſize of a ſmall iſlot, which has not ceaſed ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the memory of the inhabitants; nor have they any traditions that it ever did. We ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaw the ſmoke from the centre of the iſland, even at Annamooka, the diſtance of at leaſt ten leagues. We were told that Toofoa was but thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited, but that the water upon it was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                     <p>At day-break, on the 15th, we were not far from Kao, which is a large rock of a conic figure; we ſteered to the paſſage between Footooha and Hafaiva, with a gentle breeze at ſouth-eaſt. About ten o'clock, Feenou came on board, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with us all day. He brought with him a quantity of fruit and two hogs; and, in the courſe of the day, ſeveral canoes came to barter quantities of the former article, which was very acceptable to us, as our ſtock began to be low. At noon, our latitude was 19° 49′ 45″ ſouth, and we had made ſeven miles of longitude from Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooka.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="unknown:030274_0207_0FE56CDAC8DD1AA0"/>After having paſſed Footooha, we met with a reef of rocks, and, there being but little wind, it was attended with ſome difficulty to keep clear of them. Having paſſed this reef, we hauled up for Neeneeva, a ſmall low iſle in the direction of eaſt-north-eaſt from Footooha, in hopes of finding an anchorage, but were again diſappointed; for notwithſtanding we had land in every direction, the ſea was unfathomable. We plainly ſaw, in the courſe of this night, flames iſſuing from the volcano upon Toofoa.</p>
                     <p>At day-break on the 16th, we ſteered with a gentle breeze at ſouth-eaſt, for Hapaee, which was now in ſight; and perceived it to be low land, from the trees only appearing above the water. At nine o'clock we ſaw it plainly forming three iſlands nearly equal in ſize; and, ſoon after, a fourth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the ſouthward of theſe, as large as any of the others. Each of theſe iſlands ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be of a ſimilar height and appearance, and about ſix or ſeven miles in length. The moſt northern of them is called Haanno, the next Foa, the third Lefooga, and the fourth Hoolaiva; but they are all four included under the general name of Hapaee.</p>
                     <p>By ſun-ſet, we got up with the nothernmoſt of theſe iſles, where we experienced the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs for want of anchorage, that we did the two preceding evenings; having another night to ſpend under ſail, with land and breakers in
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030274_0208_0FE56C65645AD2E0"/>
every direction. Feenou, who had been on board all day, went forward to Hapaee in the evening, and took Omai with him in the canoe. He was not unmindful of our diſagreeable ſituation, and kept up a good fire the whole night, by way of a land-mark.</p>
                     <p>At the return of day-light, on the 17th, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then cloſe in with Foa, we perceived it was joined to Haanno, by a reef running from one Iſland to the other, even with the ſurface of the ſea. Captain Cook diſpatched a boat to look for anchorage; and a proper place was found abreaſt of a reef which joins Lefooga or Foa, having twenty-four fathoms depth of water. In this ſtation the nothern point of Hapaee bore north, 16° eaſt. We were not above three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a mile from the ſhore; and, as we lay before a creek in the reef, it was convenient landing at all times.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AS ſoon as we had anchored, we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a multitude of canoes, and our ſhips were preſently filled with the natives. They brought with them hogs, fowls, fruit, and roots, which they exchanged for cloath, knives, beads, nails, and hatchets. Feenou and Omai having come on board, early the next morning, in order to introduce Captain Cook to the people of the iſland, he ſoon accompanied them on ſhore for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Chief conducted the Captain to a hut, ſituated cloſe to the ſea-beach, which was brought thither but a few minutes before for his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this Feenou, Omai, and Captain Cook, were ſeated. The other chiefs, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, appeared fronting them on the outſide; and they alſo ſeated themſelves. Captain Cook be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſked how long he intended to ſtay, anſwered
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030274_0210_0FE56CE18FA75AD0"/>
five days. Taipa was, therefore, ordered to ſit by him, and declare this to the people. He then harangued them in words nearly to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing purport, as we afterwards were informed by Omai. He exhorted both old and young, to look upon Captain Cook as a friend, who meant to continue with them a few days; and that, during his ſtay among them, they would not ſteal any thing from him or offend him in any other manner. He informed them, that it was expected they ſhould bring hogs, fowls, fruit, &amp;c. to the ſhips; for which they would receive in exchange, ſuch articles as he enumerated. Soon after Taipa had delivered his addreſs to the aſſembly, Feenou left them; on which Captain Cook was informed by Taipa, that it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary he ſhould make a preſent to Earoupa, the chief of the iſland. The Captain being not unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this gave him ſuch articles as far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his expectation. This liberality created ſimilar demands from two chiefs of other iſles who were preſent, and even from Taipa himſelf. Soon after he had made the laſt of theſe preſents, Feenou returned, and expreſſed his diſpleaſure with Taipa for ſuffering me to be ſo laviſh of my favours. But this was, doubtleſs, a fineſſe, as he certainly acted in concert with the others.</p>
                     <p>Feenou now reſumed his ſeat, ordering Earoupa to ſit by him, and harangue the people as Taipa
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030274_0211_0FE56CE3495841F8"/>
had done, which he did nearly to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ceremonies over, the Chief, at the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's requeſt, conducted him to three ſtagnant pools of what he called freſh water; in one of which the water was indeed tolerable, and the ſituation convenient for filling our caſks. On his return to his former ſtation, he found a baked hog and ſome yams, ſmoaking hot, ready to be conveyed on board for his dinner. He invited Feenou and his friends to partake of the repaſt, and they embarked for the ſhip, though none but himſelf ſat down with us at table. Dinner being over, the Captain conducted them on ſhore; and, before he returned, received, as a preſent from the chief, a fine large turtle, and a quantity of yams. We had a plentiful ſupply of proviſions, for in the courſe of the day we got, by bartering with the natives, about twenty ſmall hogs, together with a large quantity of fruit and roots.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the 18th, early in the morning, Feenou and Omai, who now ſlept on ſhore with the Chief, came on board, to requeſt Captain Cook's preſence upon the iſland. He accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, and, upon landing, was conducted to the place where he had been ſeated the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day, and where he beheld a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people already aſſembled. Though he imagined that ſomething extraordinary was in

                        <figure/>

agitation, yet he could not conjecture what, nor could Omai give him any information.</p>
                     <p>Soon after he was ſeated, about an hundred of the natives appeared and advanced, laden with yams, plantains, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and ſugar-canes; their burdens were depoſited on our left. A number of others arrived ſoon after, bearing the ſame kind of articles, which were collected into two piles on the right ſide. To theſe were faſtened two pigs, and half a dozen fowls; and to thoſe upon the left, ſix pigs and two turtles. Earoupa ſeated himſelf before the articles on the left ſide, and another chief before thoſe upon the right; they being, it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the two chiefs who had procured them by order of Feenou, who was as implicitly obeyed here, as he had been at Annamooka, and who had probably laid this tax upon the chiefs of Hapaee for the preſent occaſion.</p>
                     <p>When this munificent collection of proviſions was placed in order and advantageouſly diſpoſed, the bearers of it joined the multitude, who form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a circle round the whole. Immediately after, a number of men, armed with clubs, entered this circle, or area; where they paraded about for a few minutes and then one half of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to one ſide, and the other half to the other ſide, ſeating themſelves before the ſpectators. Preſently after, they ſucceſſively entertained us with ſingle combats; one champion from one
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030274_0214_0FE56CEB1B432810"/>
ſide challenging thoſe of the other ſide, partly by words but more by expreſſive geſtures, to ſend one of their party to oppoſe him. The challenge was, in general, accepted; the two combatants placed themſelves in proper attitudes, and the engagement began, which continued till one of them yielded, or till their weapons were broken. At the concluſion of each combat, the victor ſquatted himſelf down before the chief, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately roſe up and retired. Some old men who ſeemed to preſide as judges, gave their plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in a very few words; and the multitude, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe on the ſide of the conqueror, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the glory he had acquired in two or three loud huzzas.</p>
                     <p>This entertainment was ſometimes ſuſpended for a ſhort ſpace, and the intervals of time were filled up with wreſtling and boxing-matches. The firſt were performed in the method practiſed at Otaheite, and the ſecond differed very little from the Engliſh manner. A couple of ſtout wenches next ſteped forth, and without cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, began boxing with as much dexterity as the men. This conteſt, however, was but of ſhort duration, for in the ſpace of half a minute, one of them gave it up. The victorious heroine was applauded by the ſpectators, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the ſucceſsful combatants of the other ſex. Though we expreſſed ſome diſapprobation at this part of the entertainment, it did not hinder two

other females from entering the liſts; who ſeemed to be ſpirited girls, and, if two old women had not interpoſed to part them, would probably have given each other a good drubbing. At leaſt three thouſand ſpectators were preſent when theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats were exhibited, and every thing was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt perfect good humour on all ſides; though ſome of the champions, of both ſexes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived blows which they muſt have felt the effect of for ſome time after.</p>
                     <p>The diverſions being finiſhed, the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Captain Cook that the proviſions on our right hand were a preſent to Omai; and that thoſe on our left (making about two-thirds of the whole quantity) were intended for him, and that he might ſuit his own convenience in taking them on board.</p>
                     <p>Four boats were loaded with the munificence of Feenou, whoſe favours far exceeded any that Captain Cook had ever received from the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns of any of the iſlands which he had viſited in the Pacific Ocean. He, therefore, embraced the firſt opportunity of convincing Feenou that he was not inſenſible of his liberality, by beſtowing upon him ſuch commodities as he ſuppoſed were moſt valuable in his eſtimation. Feenou was ſo highly pleaſed with the return that was made him, that he left the Captain ſtill indebted to him by ſending him two large hogs, ſome yams, and a conſiderable quantity of cloth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="unknown:030274_0217_0FE56CEE76273478"/>Feenou having expreſſed a deſire to ſee the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines perform their exerciſe, Captain Cook or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them all aſhore on the morning of the 20th of May. After they had gone through various evolutions, and fired ſeveral vollies; which ſeemed to give pleaſure to our numerous ſpectators, the chief, in his turn, entertained us with an exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was performed with an exactneſs and dexterity, far ſurpaſſing what they had ſeen of our military manoeuvres. It was a kind of dance, performed by men, in which one hundred and five perſons were engaged; each having an inſtrument in his hand, reſembling a paddle, two feet and an half long, with a thin blade, and a ſmall handle. With theſe inſtruments various flouriſhes were made, each of which was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a different movement, or a different attitude of the body. At firſt, the dancers ranged themſelves in three lines and ſo changed their ſtations by different evolutions, that thoſe who had been in the rear came into the front. At one part of the performance, they extended themſelves in one line; afterwards they formed themſelves into a ſemi circle; and then into two ſquare co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns. During the laſt movement, one of them came forward, and performed an antic dance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Captain Cook, with which the entertainment ended.</p>
                     <p>The muſic that accompanied the dances was produced by two drums, or rather hollow logs of
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:030274_0218_0FE56C69C9A35C88"/>
wood, from which they forced ſome varied notes by beating on them with two ſticks. The dancers, however, did not appear to be much aſſiſted or directed by theſe ſounds; but by a chorus of vocal muſic, in which all the performers joined. Their ſong was rather melodious, and their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding motions were ſo ſkilfully executed, that the whole body of dancers appeared as one regular machine. Such a performance would have been applauded even on an European theatre. It far exceeded any attempt that we had made to entertain them; inſomuch that they ſeemed to plume themſelves on their ſuperiority over us. They eſteemed none of our muſical inſtruments, except the drum, and even thought that inferior to their own. They held our French horns in the higheſt contempt, and would not pay the ſmalleſt attention to them, either here or at any other of the iſlands.</p>
                     <p>To give them a more favourable opinion of the amuſements and ſuperior attainments of the Engliſh, Captain Cook ordered ſome fire-works to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; and, after it was dark exhibited them in the preſence of Feenou, and a vaſt multitude of people. They were highly entertained with the performance in general: but our water and ſky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rockets, in particular, aſtoniſhed them beyond all conception. They now admitted that the ſcale was turned in our favour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="unknown:030274_0219_0FE56CF08B2B6000"/>This, however, ſerved only as an additional ſtimulus to urge them to proceed to freſh exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their ſingular dexterity. As ſoon as our fire-works were ended, a ſucceſſion of dances, which Feenou had prepared for our entertainment, began.</p>
                     <p>A band of muſic, or chorus conſiſting of eighteen men, ſeated themſelves before us, in the centre of a circle formed by the numerous ſpectators. About four or five of the performers had each pieces of large bamboo, from three to ſix feet in length, each played on by one man, who held it almoſt vertically; the upper end of which was open, but the other cloſed by one of the joints. They kept conſtantly ſtriking the ground, though ſlowly, with the cloſe end, and thus produced variety of notes, according to the different lengths of the inſtruments, but all were of the baſe or hollow kind; which was counteracted by a perſon who ſtruck nimbly a piece of the ſame ſubſtance, ſplit and lying upon the ground; furniſhing a tone as acute, as the others were grave and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn. The whole of the band (including thoſe who performed upon the bamboos) ſung a ſlow ſoft air, which ſo finely tempered the harſher notes of the inſtruments, that the moſt perfect judge of the modulation of ſweet ſounds could not avoid confeſſing the vaſt power, and pleaſing effect of this ſimple harmony.</p>
                     <p>About a quarter of an hour after the concert began, twenty women entered the circle, whoſe

heads were adorned with garlands of crimſon-flowers; and many of their perſons were deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with leaves of trees, curiouſly ſcolloped, and ornamented at the edges. They encircled thoſe of the chorus, with their faces towards them, and began by ſinging a ſoft air, to which reſponſes were made by the chorus; and thoſe were alternately repeated. The women accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied their ſong with many graceful motions of their hands, and continually advancing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating with one foot, while the other remained fixed. After this, they turned their faces to the aſſembly, and having ſung ſome time, retreated ſlowly in a body, and placed themſelves oppoſite the hut, where the principal ſpectators ſat. One of them next, advanced from each ſide, paſſing each other in the front, and progreſſively moving till they came to the reſt. On which two advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from each ſide, two of whom returned, but the other two remained; and to theſe, from each ſide, came on by intervals, till they all had, once more, formed a circle about the chorus.</p>
                     <p>Dancing to a quicker meaſure now ſucceeded, in which the performers made a kind of half-turn by leaping; then clapping their hands, and ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their fingers, repeated ſome words in uniſon with the chorus. As they proceeded in the dance, the rapidity of their muſic increaſed; their geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and attitudes were varied with wonderful dexterity; and ſome of their motions would, by
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030274_0222_0FE56C004B93DA18"/>
an European, be thought rather indecent; though, perhaps, they meant only to diſplay the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variety of their movements.</p>
                     <p>This female ballet was ſucceeded by one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by fifteen men; and, though ſome of them were old, time ſeemed to have robbed them of but little of their agility. They were diſpoſed in a ſort of circle, divided at the front. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſung ſlowly in concert with the chorus, making ſeveral graceful motions with their hands but differing from thoſe of the women; at the ſame time inclining the body alternately to either ſide, by raiſing one leg outward, and reſting on the other; the arm of the ſame ſide being alſo ſtretched upward. Then they recited ſentences, which were anſwered by the chorus; and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally increaſed the meaſure of the dance, by clapping the hands, and quickening the motions of the feet. Towards the concluſion, the rapidity of the muſic and dancing ſo much increaſed, that the different movements were hard to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
                     <p>This dance being ended, after a conſiderable interval, twelve other men advanced, placing themſelves in double rows, fronting each other. On one ſide was ſtationed a kind of prompter, who repeated ſeveral ſentences, to which reſponſes were made by the performers and the chorus. They ſung and danced ſlowly; and gradually grew quicker, like thoſe whom they had ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="unknown:030274_0223_0FE56C07E78756C8"/>The next who exhibited themſelves were nine women, who ſat down oppoſite the hut where the chief had placed himſelf. A man immediately roſe, and gave the firſt of theſe women a blow on the back with both his fiſts joined. He treated the ſecond and third in the ſame manner; but when he came to the fourth, he ſtruck her upon the breaſt. Upon ſeeing this, a perſon inſtantly riſing up from among the crowd, knocked him down with a blow on the head, and he was quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried away. But this did not excuſe the other five women from ſo extraordinary a diſcipline; for they were treated in the ſame manner by a perſon who ſucceeded him. When theſe nine women danced, their performance was twice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved of, and they were obliged to repeat it again. There was no great difference between this dance and that of the firſt women, except that theſe ſometimes raiſed the body upon one leg, and then upon the other, alternately, by a ſort of double motion.</p>
                     <p>Soon after a perſon unexpectedly entered, making ſome ludicrous remarks on the fire-works that had been exhibited, which extorted a burſt of laughter from the crowd. We had then a dance by the attendants of Feenou: they formed a double circle of twenty-four each round the chorus, and joined in a gentle ſoothing ſong, accompanied with motions of the head and hands. They alſo began with ſlow movements, which
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:030274_0224_0FE56C09A9462598"/>
gradually became more and more rapid, and finally cloſed with ſeveral very ingenious tranſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the two circles.</p>
                     <p>The feſtivity of this memorable night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a dance, in which the principal peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſiſted. In many reſpects it reſembled the preceding ones, but they increaſed their motions to a prodigious quickneſs, ſhaking their heads from ſhoulder to ſhoulder, inſomuch that they appeared in danger of diſlocating their necks. This was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a clapping of the hands, and a kind of ſavage holla! or ſhriek. A perſon on one ſide, repeated ſomething in a truly muſical recitative, and with an air ſo graceful, as might put ſome of our applauded performers to the bluſh. He was anſwered by another, and this was repeated ſeveral times by the whole body on each ſide; and they finiſhed, by ſinging and dancing, as they had begun.</p>
                     <p>The two laſt dances were univerſally approved by all the ſpectators. They were perfectly in time, and ſome of their geſtures were ſo expreſſive, that it might juſtly be ſaid, they ſpoke the language that accompanied them.</p>
                     <p>The theatre for theſe performances was an open ſpace among the trees, bordering on the ſea, with lights, placed at ſmall intervals, round the inſide of the circle. Though the concourſe of people was pretty large, their number was much inferior to that aſſembled in the forenoon, when the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines performed their exerciſe. At that time

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE next day, which was the 21ſt of May, Captain Cook made an excurſion into the Iſland of Lefooga, on foot, which he found to be, in ſome reſpects, ſuperior to Annamooka, the plantations being not only more numerous, but alſo more extenſive. Many parts of the country, near
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:030274_0227_0FE56C0CF966DAD0"/>
the ſea, are ſtill waſte; owing perhaps to the ſandineſs of the ſoil. But, in the internal parts of the iſland, the ſoil is better; and the marks of conſiderable population, and of an improved ſtate of cultivation, are very conſpicuous. Many of the plantations are incloſed in ſuch a manner, that the fences, running parallel to each other, form ſpacious public roads. Large ſpots covered with the paper mulberry-trees, were obſerved; and the plantations in general, were abundantly ſtocked with ſuch plants and fruit-trees as the iſland produces. To theſe the Commodore made ſome addition, by ſowing the ſeeds of melons, pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Indian corn, &amp;c. At one place was a houſe, about four times as large as the ordinary ones, with an extenſive area of graſs before it, to which the people probably reſort on ſome public occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Near the landing place we obſerved a mount two or three feet high, on which ſtood four or five little huts, wherein the bodies of ſome perſons of diſtinction had been in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erred. The iſland is but ſeven miles in length; and its breadth, in ſome places, is not above three miles. The eaſt-ſide has a reef, projecting conſiderably, againſt which the ſea breaks with great violence. It is a continuation of this reef that joins Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooga to Foa, which is but half a mile diſtant; and, at low water, the natives can walk upon this reef from one iſland to the other. The ſhore is either a ſandy beach, or a coral rock.</p>

                        <pb n="173" facs="unknown:030274_0228_0FE56C1212A577D0"/>When the Captain returned from his excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and went on board, he found a large ſailing canoe faſtened to the ſtern of the Reſolution. In this canoe was Latooliboula, whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore had ſeen, during his laſt voyage, at Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gataboo, and who was then ſuppoſed by him to be the king of that iſland<note n="*" place="bottom">In Captain Cook's narrative of that voyage the name of this chief is ſaid to be <hi>Kohagee-too Fallangou,</hi> which is total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from <hi>Latooliboula.</hi> This may perhaps be accounted for by ſuppoſing one to be the name of the perſon, and the other the deſcription of his rank or title.</note>. He could not be prevailed upon to come on board, but continued ſitting in his canoe with an air of uncommon gravity. The iſlanders call him <hi>Areekee,</hi> which ſignif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es King; a title which we had not heard any of them give to Feenou, however extenſive his authority over them had appeared to be. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooliboula remained under the ſtern till the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then departed. Feenou was on board the Reſolution at that time; but neither of theſe chiefs took the ſmalleſt notice of the other.</p>
                     <p>The next day, ſome of the natives ſtealing a tarpaulin and other things, Captain Cook applied to Feenou, deſiring him to exert his authority, for the purpoſe of getting them reſtored; but this application was of no effect. On the 23d, as we were preparing to leave the Iſland, Feenou and his prime-miniſter Taipa came along-ſide in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe, and informed us that they were going to
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030274_0229_0FE56C14F98E0240"/>
Vavaoo: an iſland ſituate, as they ſaid, about two days ſail to the northward of Hapaee. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us, that the object of their voyage was to procure for us an additional ſupply of hogs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome red-feathered caps for Omai to carry with him to Otaheite; and deſired us not to ſail till their return, which would be in four or five days; after which Feenou would accompany us to Tongataboo. Captain Cook conſented to wait the return of this chief, who immediately ſet out for Vavaoo. On the 24th, a report was induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly ſpread about by ſome of the iſlanders, that a ſhip reſembling ours had arrived at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namooka ſince we left it, and was now at anchor there. It was alſo reported, that Toobou, the chief of that iſland, was haſtening thither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe new viſitors. After enquiry, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it appeared, that this report was totally void of foundation. It is difficult to conjecture, what purpoſe the invention of this tale could anſwer; unleſs we ſuppoſe it was contrived with a view of getting us removed from one iſland to the other.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the 25th, Captain Cook went into a houſe where a woman was dreſſing the eyes of a child, who ſeemed blind. The inſtruments uſed by this female oculiſt were two ſlender wooden probes, with which ſhe bruſhed the eyes ſo as to make them bleed. In the ſame houſe he found another woman ſhaving a child's head with a
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:030274_0230_0FE56C1683FDE190"/>
ſhark's tooth, ſtuck into the end of a ſtick: ſhe firſt wetted the hair with a rag dipped in water, and then making uſe of her inſtrument, took off the hair as cloſe as if a razor had been employed. Captain Cook ſoon after tried upon himſelf one of theſe remarkable inſtruments, which he found to be an excellent ſubſtitute. The natives of theſe iſlands however, have a different method of ſhaving their beards, which operation they perform with two ſhells; one of which they place under a part of the beard, and with the other, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied above, they ſcrape off that part: in this manner they can ſhave very cloſe, though the proceſs is rather tedious. There are among them ſome men who ſeem to profeſs this trade: for it was as common for our ſailors to go aſhore to have their beards ſcraped off after the mode of Hapaee, as it was for their two chiefs to come on board to be ſhaved by our barbers.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook finding that little or nothing of what the iſland produced was now brought to the ſhips, determined to change his ſtation, and to wait Feenou's return in ſome other anchoring-place, where we might ſtill meet with refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We accordingly, on the 26th, made ſail to the ſouthward along the reef of the iſland, and having paſſed ſeveral ſhoals, hauled into a bay, that lies between the north end of Hoolaiva, and the ſouth of Lefooga, and there anchored. We had no ſooner caſt anchor, than Mr. Bligh, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030274_0231_0FE56C1856389170"/>
of the Reſolution, was ſent to ſound the bay where we were now ſtationed; and Captain Cook, accompanied by Lieutenant Gore, landed on the ſouthern part of Lefooga, to look for freſh water, and examine the country. On the weſt ſide of the iſland, they obſerved an artificial mount of conſiderable antiquity, about forty feet high, and meaſuring fifty feet in the diameter of its ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. At the bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tom of this mount was a ſtone fourteen feet high, two and a half thick, and four broad, hewn out of a coral rock; and they were informed by the iſlanders, that not more than half its length was to be ſeen above ground. They called it <hi>Tangata Areekee</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Tangata,</hi> in the language of theſe people, is man; <hi>Aree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kee,</hi> king.</note>; and ſaid it had been ſet up, and the mount raiſed, in memory of one of their kings. On the approach of night, the Captain and Mr. Gore returned on board, and Mr. Bligh came back from ſounding the bay, in which he found from fourteen to twenty fathoms water with a bottom principally of ſand.</p>
                     <p>Lefooga and Hoolaiva are ſeparated from each other by a reef of coral rocks, dry at low water. Some of our gentlemen, who landed in the laſt mentioned iſland, found not the ſmalleſt mark of cultivation or habitation upon it, except a ſingle hut, in which a man employed to catch fiſh and turtle reſided. It is remarkable that it ſhould
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:030274_0232_0FE56C1CEC84F518"/>
remain in this deſolate condition, ſince it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ſo immediately with Lefooga, which is ſo well cultivated. The weſt ſide of it has a bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where there ſeems to be good anchorage; and the eaſt ſide has a reef, as well as Lefooga. Uninhabited as Hoolaiva is, an artificial mount has been raiſed upon it, equal in height to ſome of the ſurrounding trees.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 27th, at break of day, the Commodore made the ſignal to weigh; and as he intended to attempt, in his way to Tonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taboo, a paſſage to Annamooka, by the ſouth-weſt, among the intermediate iſles, he ſent Mr. Bligh in a boat to ſound before the ſhips. But before we got under ſail, the wind became ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and unſettled, as to render it unſafe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a paſſage with which we were ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted: we therefore lay faſt, and made ſignal for the Maſter to return. He and the Maſter of the Diſcovery were afterwards ſent, each in a boat to examine the channels. Towards noon, a large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ailing canoe came under our ſtern, in which was a perſon named Poulaho, or Futtafaihe, or both; who was ſaid, by the natives then on board, to be king of Tongataboo, Annamooka, Hapaee, and all the neighbouring iſlands. We were ſurpriſed to find a ſtranger dignified with this title, which we had been taught to believe appertained to another: but they perſiſted in their aſſertions, that the ſupreme dignity belonged to Poulaho; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

now for the firſt time acknowledged, that Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou was not the king, but a ſubordinate chief, though of great power. Poulaho was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the Captain on board, where he was not an unwelcome gueſt, as he brought with him two fat hogs, by way of preſent. This great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, though not very tall, was extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy, and almoſt ſhapeleſs with corpulence. He appeared to be about forty; his hair was ſtraight, and his features conſiderably different from thoſe of the majority of his people. We found him to be a man of gravity and good ſenſe. He viewed the ſhip, and the various new objects, with particular attention; and aſked many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent queſtions. When he had gratified his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in looking at the cattle, and other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, he was requeſted to walk down into the cabin; to which ſome of his retinue objected, ſaying, that, if he ſhould go down thither, it would doubtleſs happen that people would walk over his head; a circumſtance that could not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Though the Captain offered to obviate this objection, by ordering that no one ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to walk over the cabin, Poulaho waved all ceremony, and went down without any previous ſtipulation. He now appeared to be no leſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous than his people were, to convince us that he was ſovereign, and not Feenou. He ſat down to dinner with us, but eat and drank very little; and afterwards deſired our Commodore to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company

him on ſhore. Omai was aſked to be one of the party; but he was too faithfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to Feenou, to ſhew much reſpect to his competitor, and therefore declined the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Captain Cook attended the chief in his own boat, having firſt made him ſuch preſents as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his expectations; in return for which, Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laho ordered two more hogs to be ſent on board. The chief was then carried out of the boat, by his own ſubjects, on a board reſembling a hand-barrow; and immediately ſeated himſelf in a ſmall houſe near the ſhore. He placed the Captian at his ſide, and his attendants formed a ſemi-circle before them, on the outſide of the houſe. An old woman ſat cloſe to the chief, with a kind of fan in her hand, to prevent his being incommoded by the flies. The various articles which his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had procured by trading on board the ſhips, being now diſplayed before him, he attentively looked over them all, inquired what they had given in exchange, and, at length, ordered every thing to be returned to the reſpective owners, except a glaſs-bowl, which he reſerved for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thoſe who brought theſe things to him, firſt ſquatted themſelves down before him, then depoſited their purchaſes, and inſtantly roſe and retired. They obſerved the ſame ceremony in taking them away; and not one of them preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak to him ſtanding. His attendants, juſt before they left him, paid him obeiſance, by
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:030274_0236_0FE56C277673AE98"/>
bowing their heads down to the ſole of his foot and touching it with the upper and under ſide of the fingers of each hand. Captain Cook was charmed with the decorum that was maintained on this occaſion, having ſcarce ſeen the like any where, even among more civilized nations.</p>
                     <p>When the Captain arrived on board, he found me Maſter returned from his expedition, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that, as far as he had proceeded, there was a paſſage for the ſhips, and tolerable anchorage; but that towards the ſouth and ſouth-eaſt, he obſerved numerous ſhoals, breakers, and ſmall iſles. In conſequence of this report, we relinquiſhed all thoughts of a paſſage that way; and being reſolved to return to Annamooka by the ſame route which we had ſo lately experienced to be a ſafe one, we ſhould have ſailed the next morning, which was the 28th, if the wind had not been very unſettled. Poulaho came early on board, bringing a red-feather'd cap as a preſent to Captain Cook. Theſe caps were greatly ſought after by us, as we knew they would be highly valued at Otaheite: but not one was ever brought for ſale, though very large prices were offered nor could a perſon in either ſhip make himſelf the proprietor of one, except the two Captains and Omai. They are compoſed of the tail feathers of the tropic bird, intermixed with the red fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the paroquet; and are made in ſuch manner, as to tie on the forehead without any
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030274_0237_0FE56C2A76F0A6C8"/>
crown, and have the form of a ſemi-circle, whoſe radius is eighteen or twenty inches. But the beſt idea of them will be conveyed by Mr. Webber's repreſentation of Poulaho, ornamented with one of theſe caps or bonnets. The chief left the ſhip in the evening; but his brother, whoſe name alſo was Futtafaihe, and ſome of his attendants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained all night on board.</p>
                     <p>On the 29th, at day-break, we weighed with a fine breeze at eaſt north-eaſt, and made ſail to the weſtward, followed by ſeveral ſailing canoes, in one of which was Poulaho the king, who, getting on board the Reſolution, enquired for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the others who had continued with us all night. We now found that they had ſtaid without his permiſſion, for he gave them ſuch a reprimand as brought tears from their eyes: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he was ſoon reconciled to their making a longer ſtay; for, on his departure from the ſhip, he left his brother, and five attendants, on board. We were alſo honoured with the company of a chief named Tooboueitoa, juſt then arrived from Tongataboo; who, as ſoon as he came, ſent away his canoe, declaring, that he, and five others who came with him, would ſleep on board; ſo that Captain Cook now had his cabin filled with viſitors. This inconvenience he the more willingly endured, as they brought with them plenty of proviſions as preſents to him, for which they met with ſuitable returns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="unknown:030274_0238_0FE56C2C41BB09F8"/>In the afternoon the eaſterly wind was ſucceeded by a freſh breeze at ſouth ſouth-eaſt. Our courſe being now ſouth ſouth-weſt, we were obliged to ply to windward, and barely fetched the northern ſide of Footooha, by eight o'clock in the evening. The next day we plied up to Lofanga, and got ſoundings, under the lee or north-weſt ſide of forty fathoms water; but the bottom being rocky and a chain of breakers lying to leeward, we ſtretched away for Kotoo, expecting to find bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anchorage there. It was dark before we reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that iſland, where finding no convenient place to anchor in, we paſſed the night in making ſhort boards. On the 31ſt, at break of day, we ſtood for the channel which is between Kotoo, and the reef of rocks lying to the weſtward of it; but, on our approach we found the wind inſufficient to lead us through. We therefore bore up on the outſide of the reef, and ſtretched to the ſouth-weſt till near twelve o'clock, when, perceiving that we made no progreſs to windward, and being apprehenſive of loſing the iſlands while we had ſo many of the natives on board, we tacked and ſtood back, and ſpent the night between Footooha and Kotoo. The wind now blew freſh, with ſqualls and rain; and, during the night, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, by a ſmall change of the wind, fetching too far to the windward was very near running full upon a low ſandy iſle, named Pooto Poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooa, encompaſſed with breakers. Our people
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030274_0239_0FE56C2DCBF1C510"/>
having fortunately been juſt ordered upon deck, to put the ſhip about, and moſt of them being at their reſpective ſtations, the neceſſary movements were performed with judgment and alertneſs; and this alone preſerved us from deſtruction. The Diſcovery, being aſtern, incurred no danger.</p>
                     <p>This narrow eſcape ſo alarmed the natives who were on board, that they were eagerly deſirous of getting aſhore: accordingly, on the return of day-light, a boat was hoiſted out, and the officer who commanded her was ordered, after landing them at Kotoo, to ſound for anchorage along the reef that projects from that iſland. During the abſence of the boat, we endeavoured to turn the ſhips through the channel between the reef of Kotoo and the ſandy iſle; but meeting with a ſtrong current againſt us, we were obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and caſt anchor in fifty fathoms water, the ſandy iſle bearing eaſt by north, about the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of one mile. Here we remained till the 4th of June, being frequently viſited by the king, by Tooboueitoa, and by people who came from the neighbouring iſlands to traffic with us. Mr. Bligh was, in the mean time diſpatched to ſound the channels between the iſlands ſituate to the eaſtward; and Captain Cook himſelf landed on Kotoo, to take a ſurvey of it. This iſland, on account of the coral reefs that environ it, is ſcarcely acceſſible by boats. Its north-weſt end is low; but it riſes ſuddenly in the middle, and
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030274_0240_0FE56C32C46D0E80"/>
terminates at the ſouth eaſt: end in reddiſh clayey cliffs. It produces the ſame fruits and roots with the adjacent iſlands, and is tolerably cultivated, though thinly inhabited. It is about two miles in length. While the Commodore was walking all over it, our people were occupied in cutting graſs for the cattle; and we planted ſome melon ſeeds. On our return to the boat, we paſſed by ſome ponds of dirty brackiſh water, and ſaw a burying-place, which was conſiderably neater than thoſe of Hapaee.</p>
                     <p>We weighed in the morning of the 4th, and with a freſh gale at eaſt ſouth-eaſt, made ſail to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Annamooka, where we anchored the next morning, nearly in the ſame ſtation which we had ſo lately occupied. Captain Cook ſoon after went on ſhore, and found the iſlanders very buſy in their plantations, digging up yams for traffic. In the courſe of the day, about two hundred of them aſſembled on the beach, and traded with great eagerneſs. It appeared, that they had been very diligent, during our abſence, in cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for we now obſerved ſeveral large plantain fields, in places which, in our late viſit, we had ſeen lying waſte. The yams were now in the higheſt perfection: and we obtained a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them, in exchange for iron. Before the Captain returned on board, he viſited the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places where he had ſown melon and cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeeds; but found to his great regret, that
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:030274_0241_0FE56C349850BB40"/>
moſt of them had been deſtroyed by vermin; though ſome pine-apple plants, which he had alſo left, were in a thriving condition.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 6th, about noon, Feenou ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Vavoo, and informed us, that ſeveral canoes, laden with hogs and other proviſions, had ſailed with him from that iſland, but had been loſt in the late tempeſtuous weather, and every perſon on board of them had periſhed. This melancholy tale did not gain much credit with us, as we were by this time ſufficiently acquainted with the character of the relater. The truth perhaps was, that he had been unable to procure at Vavoo the expected ſupplies; or, if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any there, that he had left them at Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paee, which lay in his way back, and where he muſt have heard that Poulaho had come to viſit us; who therefore, he knew, would, as his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, reap all the merit and reward of procuring theſe ſupplies, without having had any partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the trouble. The invention, however, of this loſs at ſea, was not ill managed; for we had lately had very ſtormy weather. On the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding morning Poulaho, and ſome other chiefs, arrived; at which time Captain Cook happened to be aſhore with Feenou, who now appeared to be ſenſible of the impropriety of his conduct, in arrogating a character to which he had no juſt claim; for he not only acknowledged Poulaho as ſovereign of Tongataboo and the adjacent iſles,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030274_0242_0FE56C3628DDF5B8"/>
but affected to inſiſt much on it. The Captain left him, and went to pay a viſit to the King, whom he found ſitting with a few of the natives before him; but great numbers haſtening to pay their reſpects to him, the circle increaſed very faſt. When Feenou approached, he placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the reſt that ſat before Poulaho, as attendants on his majeſty. He at firſt ſeemed to be ſomewhat confuſed and abaſhed; but ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from his agitation. Some converſation paſſed between theſe two chiefs, who went on board with the Captain to dinner; but only Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laho ſat at table. Feenou, after having made his obeiſance in the uſual mode, by ſaluting the foot of his ſovereign with his head and hands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the cabin, and it now appeared, that the could neither eat nor drink in the king's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>On the 18th, we weighed anchor, and ſteered for Tongataboo, with a gentle breeze at north-eaſt. We were accompanied by fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſailing veſſels belonging to the Iſlanders, every one of which outran the ſhips. The royal canoe was diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by a ſmall bundle of graſs, of a red colour, faſtened to the end of a pole, and fixed in the ſtern of the canoe in the ſame manner as our enſign ſtaffs. At five in the afternoon we deſcried two ſmall iſlands, at the diſtance of four leagues to the weſtward; one was called Hoonga Hapaee, and the other Hoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030274_0243_0FE56C37FB0BD458"/>
Tonga. They are ſituated in the latitude of 20° 36′ ſouth, about ten leagues from the weſtern point of Annamooka. According to the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of two iſlanders who had been ſent on board by Feenou as pilots, only five men reſided on Hoonga Hapaee, and Hoonga Tonga had no inhabitants. We ſtill proceeded on a ſouth-weſt courſe, and on the 9th ſaw ſeveral little iſlands, beyond which Eooa and Tongataboo appeared. We had at this time twenty-five fathoms water, the bottom conſiſting of broken coral and ſand; and the debth gradually decreaſed, as we approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the above-mentioned ſmall iſles. Steering, by the direction of our pilots, for the wideſt ſpace between thoſe iſles, we were inſenſibly drawn upon a large flat, on which lay innumerable rocks of coral below the ſurface of the ſea. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our utmoſt care and attention to avoid theſe rocks, we were unable to prevent the ſhip from ſtriking on one of them: nor did the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, though behind us, keep clear of them. It fortunately happened, that neither of the ſhips ſtuck faſt, nor ſuſtained any damage. We ſtill continued our courſe; and the moment we found a place where we could anchor with any degree of ſafety, we came to; and the Maſters were diſpatched, with the boats, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound. Soon after we had caſt anchor, ſeveral of the natives of Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gataboo came to us in their canoes; and they, as well as our pilots, aſſured us, that we ſhould
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030274_0244_0FE56C3D0F9741B8"/>
meet with deep water further in, free from rocks. Their intelligence was true; for, about four o'clock, the boats made a ſignal of having found good anchoring ground. We therefore weighed, and ſtood in till dark, when we anchored in nine fathoms water, with a clear ſandy bottom. During the night, we had ſome rain; but early in the morning, the wind becoming ſoutherly, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on fair weather, we weighed again, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the ſhore of Tongataboo. While we were plying up to the harbour, the King conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſailing round us in his canoe; and at the ſame time there was a great number of ſmall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes about the ſhips. Two of theſe not getting out of the way of his royal veſſel, he ran quite over them, with the greateſt unconcern. Among theſe who came on board the Reſolution, was Otago, who had been ſo uſeful to Captain Cook when he viſited Tongataboo in his laſt voyage; and one Toobou, who had, at that time, attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to Captain Furneaux. Each of them brought ſome yams and a hog, in teſtimony of friendſhip; for which they received a ſuitable return.</p>
                     <p>We arrived at our intended ſtation about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th of June. It was a very convenient place, formed by the ſhore of Tongataboo on the ſouth-eaſt, and two little iſles on the eaſt and north-eaſt. Here both our ſhips anchored over a ſandy bottom, where the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030274_0245_0FE56C3F5F555CC0"/>
depth of water was ten fathoms. Our diſtance from the ſhore exceeded a quarter of a mile.</p>

They found the King waiting for them on the beach, who conducted them to a ſmall neat houſe near the woods, with an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030274_0246_0FE56C40EA1FA160"/>
area before it, and told the Captain, that it was at his ſervice during his continuance in the iſland. Before they had been long in the houſe, a large circle of the natives aſſembled before them, and ſeated themſelves upon the area. A root of the <hi>kava</hi> plant being brought to the king he commanded it to be ſplit into pieces, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ſeveral people, of both ſexes, who began to chew it and ſoon prepared a bowl of their favourite liquor. Mean while a baked hog, and a quantity of baked yams, were produced, and divided into ten portions. Theſe ſhares were given to ſome of thoſe who were preſent, except one, which remained undiſpoſed of, and which was probably reſerved for the King himſelf. The liquor was next ſerved out; and the firſt cup be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought up to his majeſty, he ordered it to be given to a perſon who ſat near him: the ſecond was alſo brought to him, which he kept: the third was given to Captain Cook; but, their mode of preparing the liquor having given him a diſtaſte for it, it was brought to Omai. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of it was diſtributed to different people; and one of the cups being carried to Poulaho's brother, he retired with this, and with his ſhare of the proviſions. Some others alſo withdrew from the circle with their portions, becauſe they could neither eat nor drink in his majeſty's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: but there were others of an inferior rank, of both ſexes, who both eat and drank before

him. Soon afterwards, the greater part of them went away, carrying with them what they had not eat of their ſhare of the feaſt. It is worthy of remark, that the ſervants, who diſtributed the meat and the <hi>kava,</hi> delivered it ſitting, not only to the king, but to the others.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook, before he returned on board, went in ſearch of a watering place, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to ſome ponds, in one of which the water was tolerable, but it was at ſome diſtance inland. Being informed that the ſmall iſland of Pangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modoo, near which the ſhips were ſtationed, could better ſupply this important article, he went over to it the next morning, and found there a pool containing freſher water than any he had met with amongſt theſe iſlands. This pool being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dirty, he cauſed it to be cleaned; and here it was that we filled our water-caſks. The ſame morning, a tent was pitched near the houſe which the king had aſſigned for our uſe. The horſes, cattle, and ſheep, were then landed, and a party of marines ſtationed there as a guard. The obſervatory was ſet up at an inconſiderable diſtance from the other tent; and Mr. King took up his reſidence on ſhore, to direct the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and ſuperintend all other neceſſary buſineſs. A party was occupied in cutting wood for fuel, and planks for the ſhips; and the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were appointed to conduct the traffic with the inhabitants, who flocked from all parts of the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030274_0249_0FE56C501CF72558"/>
iſland with hogs, yams, cocoa-nuts, and other articles, inſomuch, that our land ſtation reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a fair, and our ſhips were remarkably crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with viſitants. Feenou reſiding in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, we had daily proofs of his opulence and generoſity, by the continuance of his valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able donations. Poulaho was equally attentive to us in this reſpect, as ſcarcely a day paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſavouring us with coſiderable preſents. We were now informed, that a perſon of the name of Mareewagee was of very high rank in the iſland, and was treated with great reverence; nay, if our interpreter Omai did not miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his informers, that, he was ſuperior to Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laho himſelf; but that, being advanced in years, he lived in retirement, and therefore was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to pay us a viſit. This intelligence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the curioſity of Captain Cook, he ſignified to Poulaho his intention of waiting upon Maree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagee; and the king having agreed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, they ſet out the next morning in the pinnace, Captain Clerke joining them in one of his own boats. They proceeded to the eaſtward of the little iſles which form the harbour, and then, turning towards the ſouth, entered a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bay, upon which they rowed about three miles, and landed amidſt a great concourſe of people, who received them with ſhouts and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. The crowd inſtantly ſeparated, that Poulaho might paſs, who took our gentlemen
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030274_0250_0FE56C51A2B3BA60"/>
into a ſmall encloſure, and changed the piece of cloth he wore, for a new piece, very neatly folded: an old woman aſſiſted in dreſſing him, and put a large mat over his cloth. Being now aſked where Mareewagee was, he ſaid, to the great ſurprize of the gentlemen, that he was gone down to the ſhips. However, he requeſted them to accompany him to a <hi>malaee,</hi> or houſe of public reſort; and when they came to a large area before it, he ſeated himſelf in the path, while they, at his deſire, walked up to the houſe, and ſat down in the front. After waiting a little while, they repeated their enquiries, by the medium of Omai, whether they were to be introduced to Mareewagee? But receiving no ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and being inclined to ſuſpect that the aged chief was purpoſely concealed from them, they returned to their boats much piqued at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. It afterwards appeared, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reewagee had not been there; and that, in this affair, ſome groſs miſtakes had been made, Omai either having been miſinformed, or having miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood what was told him concerning the old chief.</p>
                     <p>The place our gentlemen went to was a very pleaſant village, delightfully ſituated on the banks of the bay or inlet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where moſt of the principal perſons of the iſland reſide. Each of theſe has his houſe in the midſt of a ſmall plan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation, with a kind of out-houſes, and offices for
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030274_0251_0FE56C5376005358"/>
ſervants, Theſe plantations are neatly fenced round, and, in general, have only one entrance, which is by a door faſtened on the inſide with a prop of wood. Between each plantation there are public roads and narrow lanes. A conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of ſome of theſe encloſures is laid out in graſs-plots, and planted with ſuch things as ſeem leſs adapted for uſe than for ornament. In ſuch other plantations as were not the reſidence of perſons of high rank, every article of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable produce of the iſland was in great plenty. Near the public roads are ſome large houſes, with ſpacious graſs-plots before them, which are ſaid to belong to the king, and are probably the places where their public meetings are held.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 13th, about twelve o'clock, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reewagee came within a ſmall diſtance of our poſt on ſhore, attended by a great number of people of all ranks. In the courſe of the afternoon, the two Captains, and others of our gentlemen, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Feenou, went aſhore to viſit him. They found a perſon ſitting under a tree, with a piece of cloth, about forty yards long, ſpread before him, round which numbers of people were ſeated. They imagined that this was the great perſonage, but were undeceived by Feenou, who informed them, that another, who was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a piece of mat, was Mareewagee. To him they were introduced by Feenou; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them very graciouſly, and deſired them to
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:030274_0252_0FE56C5732492758"/>
ſit down by him. The chief, who ſat under the tree, was named Toobou, whom we ſhall for the future call Old Toobou, to diſtinguiſh him from his nameſake, who has been already mentioned as Captain Furneaux's friend. Both he and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reewagee were venerable in their appearance. The latter was ſlender in his perſon, and ſeemed to be near ſeventy years of age. Old Toobou was ſomewhat corpulent, and almoſt blind from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in his eyes; he was younger than Maree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagee. Captain Cook not expecting on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to meet with two chiefs, had brought on ſhore a preſent for one only: this therefore he was obliged to divide between them; but, as it happened to be conſiderable, both of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſatisfied, our party now entertained them about an hour with the performance of two French horns and a drum; but the firing of a piſtol that Captain Clarke had in his pocket, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eemed to pleaſe them moſt. Before our gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men took their leave of the two chiefs, the large piece of cloth was rolled up, and preſented to Captain Cook, together with a few cocoa-nuts. The next morning, Old Toobou came on board to return the Commodore's viſit; he alſo viſited Captain Clarke; and if our former preſent was not ſufficiently conſiderable, the deficiency was now ſupplied. In the mean time, Mareewagee went to ſee our people who were ſtationed on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hore; and Mr. King ſhewed him whatever we
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030274_0253_0FE56C59229C0FC8"/>
had there. He was ſtruck with admiration at the ſight of the cattle; and the croſs-cut ſaw rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his attention. Towards noon, Poulaho came on board, bringing with him his ſon, who was about twelve years of age. He dined with Captain Cook; but the ſon, though preſent, was not permitted to ſit down with him. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain found it very convenient to have him for his gueſt; for whenever he was preſent, (which was frequently the caſe) every other native was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the table, and few of them would continue in the cabin: whereas, if neither he nor Feenou were on board, the chiefs of inferior rank were very importunate to be of the dining party, or to be admitted at that time into the cabin, which became conſequently very much crowded. The king was ſoon reconciled to our cookery, and was fond of our wine. He now reſided at the <hi>malaee</hi> near our tent, where he this evening entertained our people with a dance, in which he himſelf, though ſo corpulent and unwieldy, engaged.</p>
                     <p>On the 15th, Captain Cook received a meſſage from Old Toobou, importing, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſeeing him on ſhore. He and Omai accordingly waited on that chief, whom they found ſitting, like one of the ancient patriarchs, under the ſhade of a tree, with a large piece of cloth, the manufacture of the iſland, ſpread out before him. He deſired them to place themſelves
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030274_0254_0FE56C5AAA7FCA90"/>
by him; after which he told Omai, that the cloth, with ſome cocoa-nuts, and red feathers, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted his preſent to Captain Cook. The latter thanked him for the donation, and requeſted him to go on board with him. Omai, being ſent for by Poulaho, now left the Captain, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Feenou, that young Fattafaihe, the king's ſon, deſired to ſee him. He immediately obeyed the ſummons, and found the young prince and Omai ſeated under a canopy of fine cloth, with a piece of a coarſer kind, ſeventy-ſix yards long, and ſeven and a half broad, ſpread before them and under them. On one ſide was a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of cocoa-nuts; and, on the other, a large boar. A multitude of people ſat round the cloth; and among them was Mareewagee, with other perſons of rank. The Captain was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to ſeat himſelf by the prince; and then Omai informed him, that he had been inſtructed by Poulaho to tell him, that as his majeſty and the Captain were friends, he hoped that his ſon Fattafaihe might be comprehended in this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and that the Captain, as a teſtimony of his conſent, would accept of the prince's preſent. Captain Cook readily agreed to this propoſal, and invited them all to dine with him on board. Accordingly, the young prince, Old Toobou, Mareewagee, three or four ſubordinate chiefs, and two old ladies of high rank, accompanied the Commodore to the ſhip. Mareewagee was
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030274_0255_0FE56C5C8CE8B7D0"/>
dreſſed in a new piece of cloth, with ſix patches of red feathers on the ſkirts of it. This dreſs was probably made on purpoſe for this viſit; for, as ſoon as he arrived on board, he put it off, and preſented it to Captain Cook. When dinner was ſerved up, not one of them would even ſit down, or eat a morſel of any thing, as they were all <hi>taboo,</hi> they ſaid; which word, though it has a very comprehenſive meaning, generally ſignifies that a thing is prohibited. Why they were thus reſtrained at preſent, was not accounted for. Having made preſents to them all, and gratified their curioſity by ſhewing them every part of the ſhip, the Captain conducted them aſhore. When the boat had reached the land, Feenou and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others immediately ſtepped out; and the young prince following them, was called back by Mareewagee, who now paid the heir apparent the ſame obeiſance which the king was accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to receive; and when Old Toobou, and one of the old ladies, had honoured him with the ſame marks of reſpect, he was ſuffered to land. After this ceremony, the old people ſtepped out of the boat into a canoe, which was waiting to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them to their place of reſidence. Capt. Cook was pleaſed at being preſent on this occaſion, as he was thus furniſhed with the moſt convincing proofs of the ſupreme dignity of Poulaho and his ſon. By this time, indeed, he had gained ſome certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation with regard to the relative ſituation of
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030274_0256_0FE56C60267A1900"/>
ſeveral of the chiefs. He now knew, that old Toobou and Mareewage were brothers. Both of them were men of very conſiderable property, and in high eſtimation with the people: Maree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagee, in particular, had obtained the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appellation of <hi>Motooa Tonga,</hi> which implies father of Tonga, or of his country. We alſo now underſtood, that he was the king's-father-in-law, Poulaho having eſpouſed, one of his daughters, by whom he had young Fattafaihe: ſo that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reewagee was grandfather to the prince. As for Feenou, he was one of the ſons of Mareewagee, and Tooboueitoa was another.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook, on his landing found Poulaho in the houſe adjoining to our tent, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately made him a preſent of a quantity of yams and a hog. Towards evening a number of the iſlanders came, and having ſeated themſelves in a circle, ſung in concert with the muſic of bamboo-drums, which were placed in the centre. Three of them were long ones, and two were ſhort. With theſe they ſtruck the ground end-wiſe. There were two others that lay ſide by ſide on the ground, one of which was partly ſplit: on theſe a perſon continued beating with two ſticks. They ſung three ſongs while the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtaid; and the entertainment laſted, after he left them, till ten o'clock. They burned the leaves of the <hi>wharra</hi> palm for a light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="200" facs="unknown:030274_0257_0FE56DE61EC9D218"/>In the mean time, Mr. Anderſon, with ſeveral others, made an excurſion into the country, which furniſhed him with obſervations to the following effect. Weſtward of the tent, the country for about two miles is entirely uncultivated, though covered with trees and buſhes growing naturally with the greateſt vigour. Beyond this a pretty large plain extends itſelf, on which are cocoa-trees, and ſome ſmall plantations. Near the creek, which runs weſt of the tent, the land is perfectly flat, and partly overflowed every tide by the ſea. When the water retires, the ſurface is ſeen to conſiſt of coral-rock, interſperſed with holes of yellowiſh mud; and near the edges, where it is rather more firm, are vaſt numbers of little openings, whence iſſue innumerable ſmall crabs, which ſwarm upon the ſpot, but are ſo very nimble, that, when approached, they inſtantaneouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear, and baffle all the dexterity of the natives who endeavour to catch them. At this place is a work of art, which teſtifies ſome degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and perſeverance: on one ſide is a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cauſeway, which, gradually increaſing in breadth, riſes with a gentle aſcent to the height of ten feet, where its breadth is five paces, the whole length being about ſeventy-four paces. Adjacent to this is a kind of circus, thirty paces in diameter, about one or two feet higher than the cauſeway that joins it; and in the middle of this circus ſome trees are planted. On the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:030274_0258_0FE56CF824C77B48"/>
ſide, another cauſeway deſcends, which is partly in ruins, and not above forty paces in length. The whole is built of large coral-ſtones, with earth on the ſurface, which is overgrown with ſhrubs and low trees. From its decaying in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, it is probably of ſome antiquity. It ſeems to be of no ſervice at preſent, whatever may have been its uſe in former times. All the intelligence concerning it, that Mr. Anderſon could procure from the natives, was, that it was called Etchee, and belonged to the king.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 16th, Captain Cook and Mr Gore took a walk into the country; in the courſe of which they met with an opportunity of ſeeing the whole proceſs of making cloth, the principal manufacture of theſe iſlands, as well as of many others in the South Sea. An account of this operation, as performed here, may not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſubjoined. The manufacturers, who are of the female ſex, take the ſlender ſtalks or trunks of the paper mulberry, which rarely grows more than ſeven feet in height, and about thickneſs of four fingers. From theſe ſtalks they ſtrip the bark, and ſcrape off the exterior rind: after which the bark is rolled up, and macerated for ſome time in water; it is then beaten with a ſquare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of wood, full of coarſe grooves, but ſometimes with a plain one. The operation is often repeated by another perſon or the bark is ſolded ſeveral times, and beat longer, which is
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030274_0259_0FE56CF9D958EC10"/>
probably intended to cloſe rather than divide its texture. It is then ſpread out to dry: the pieces being from four, to ſix or ſeven feet in length, and about half as broad. Theſe pieces are join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſmearing part of them with the glutinous juice of a berry called <hi>tooo</hi>; and, after being thus lengthened, they are placed over a large piece of wood, with a ſort of ſtamp, compoſed of a fibrous ſubſtance, laid beneath them. The manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers then take a bit of cloth, and having dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it in a juice extracted from the bark of a tree called <hi>kokka,</hi> rub it briſkly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver the piece that is making. This leaves upon the ſurface a dry gloſs, and a dull brown colour; and the ſtamp makes, at the ſame time, a ſlight impreſſion. Thus they proceed, joining and ſtaining by degrees, till a piece of cloth, of the requiſite length and breadth, is produced. They generally leave a border, about a foot broad, at the ſides, and rather lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the ends, unſtained. If any parts of the original pieces have holes, or are too thin, they giue ſpare bits upon them, till their thickneſs equals that of the reſt. Whenever they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of producing a black colour, they mix the juice of the <hi>kokka</hi> with the ſoot procured from an oily nut called <hi>dooedooe.</hi> They aſſert, that the black cloth, which is uſually moſt glazed, makes a cold dreſs, but the other a warm one.</p>
                     <p>The Commodore and Mr. Gore, meeting with Feenou on their return from their excurſion, took
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:030274_0260_0FE56CFBD2750D48"/>
him, and another chief, on board to dinner; which being ſerved up, neither of them would eat a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, alledging that they were <hi>taboo avy;</hi> but when they found, that, in dreſſing a pig and ſome yams no avy (water) had been made uſe of, they both ſat down, and eat very heartily, and drank ſome wine, on being aſſured that there was no water in it. From this circumſtance we inferred, that they were at this time, for ſome particular reaſon, forbidden to uſe water; or that, perhaps, they did not like the water we then uſed, it being taken out of one of the places where the iſland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bathed.</p>
                     <p>The following day, which was the 17th, was fixed upon by Mareewagee for giving a grand <hi>haiva,</hi> or entertainment, at which we were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to attend. Before the temporary hut of this chief, near our land ſtation, a large ſpace had been cleared for that purpoſe. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vaſt numbers of the natives came in from the country, every one of whom bore on his ſhoulder a long pole, at each end of which a yam was ſuſpended. Theſe poles and yams being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited on each ſide of the open ſpace, or area, formed two large heaps, decorated with ſmall fiſh of different kinds. They were Mareewagee's preſent to the Captains Cook and Clerke. The neceſſary preparations being made, the iſlanders began, about eleven o'clock, to exhibit various dances, which they call <hi>mai.</hi> The band of muſic
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030274_0261_0FE56D01CDC26A48"/>
at firſt conſiſted of ſeventy men as a chorus, amidſt whom were placed three inſtruments that we called drums, though they did not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them. They are cylindrical pieces of wood, from three to four feet in length, ſome of them twice as thick as a man of ordinary ſize, and ſome not ſo large. They are entirely hollow, but cloſe at each end, and open only by a chink, about the breadth of three inches, running nearly the whole length of the drums. By this opening, the reſt of the wood is hallowed; which muſt be an operation of ſome difficulty. This inſtrument is called by the natives <hi>naffa</hi>; and, having the chink turned towards them, they ſit and beat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly upon it, with two cylindrical pieces of wood, as thick as the wriſt, and about a foot in length; by which means a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rude, but loud and powerful ſound, is produced. They occaſionally vary the ſtrength and rate of their beating: and likewiſe change the tones, by beating towards the end, or in the middle of the inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>There were four ranks, of twenty-four men each, in the firſt dance. Theſe held in their hands a ſmall thin wooden inſtrument, above two feet in length, reſembling in its ſhape an oblong pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. With theſe inſtruments, which are called <hi>pagge,</hi> they made many different motions; ſuch as pointing them towards the ground on one ſide, and inclining their bodies that way at the ſame inſtant: then ſhifting them to the oppoſite ſide
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030274_0262_0FE56D035EEB92B8"/>
in the ſame manner; paſſing them with great quickneſs from one hand to the other, and twirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them about with remarkable dexterity; with various other manoeuvres. Their motions, which were ſlow at firſt, quickened as the drums beat faſter; and they repeated ſentences the whole time in a muſical tone, which were anſwered by the chorus; but in a ſhort time, they all joined, and ended with a ſhout. After a ceſſation of a few minutes, they began as before, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, with ſhort intervals, upwards of a quarter of an hour; and then the rear rank dividing, moved ſlowly round each end, met in the front, and formed the firſt rank: during which time the whole number continued to recite ſentences. The other ranks ſucceſſively did the ſame, till that which was foremoſt became the rear; and this evolution did not ceaſe till the laſt rank regained its former ſituation. A much quicker dance, though ſlow at firſt, was then begun, and they ſung for ten minutes, when the whole body, in a two-fould diviſion, retreated, and then advanced, forming a kind of circular ugure, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the dance; the chorus retiring, and the drums being removed, at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond dance, there were forty men as a chorus, with only two drums; and the dancers (or rather actors) conſiſted of two ranks, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of which had ſeventeen perſons, and the other fifteen. Feenou was in the middle of the
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030274_0263_0FE56D04E4A28270"/>
firſt rank, which is conſidered, on theſe occaſions, as the principal place. They danced and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſentences, with very ſhort intervals, for half an hour, ſometimes ſlowly, and at other times quickly, with the higheſt degree of exactneſs and regularity. Towards the cloſe, the rear-rank divided, came round, and occupied the place of the front, which afterwards reſumed its priſtine ſituation. This dance being finiſhed, the drums were taken away, and the chorus retired, as in the preceding dance.</p>
                     <p>Three very large drums were now brought in, and ſeventy men ſerved as a chorus to the third dance. This conſiſted of two ranks, of ſixteen men each, having young Toobou at their head, who was ſplendidly ornamented with a kind of garment covered with red feathers. Theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons danced, ſung, and twirled the <hi>pagge,</hi> ſo as to meet with the continual applauſes of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, who were particularly pleaſed with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which they held the face aſide as if aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the <hi>pagge</hi> before it. The hindmoſt rank cloſed before the front one, which ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſumed its place, as in the firſt and ſecond dances: then beginning again, they formed a triple row, divided, retreated to each end of the area, and left the ground in a great meaſure clear. Two men ruſhing in at that inſtant, began to exerciſe the clubs which they make uſe of in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. They firſt twirled them in their hands, and
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030274_0264_0FE56D066BD40FF0"/>
made circular ſtrokes before them with great quickneſs, managing with ſuch ſkill, that, though they ſtood cloſe to each other, they never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. They ſhifted the clubs, with uncommon dexterity, from one hand to the other; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time, kneeled down, and made various motions, toſſing up their clubs in the air, and catching them as they fell. They then retired as haſtily as they had entered. They had pieces of white cloth about their heads, faſtened at the crown with a wreath of foliage round their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and, that they might be free from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, they had only a very ſmall piece of cloth tied round the waiſt. A man, armed with a ſpear, then ruſhed in, and put himſelf in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing attitude as if he intended to ſtrike with his weapon at one of the people in the crowd; at the ſame time bending the knee a little, and trembling as it were with fury. He continued in this poſition near a minute, and then moved to the other ſide, where having ſtood in the ſame poſture, he haſtily retreated from the area. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all this time the dancers, who had divided themſelves into two parties, continued to repeat ſomething ſlowly; and they now came forward, and joined again, concluding the dance with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral applauſe. This dance was probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a capital performance, as ſome of the principal people were engaged in it; one of the drums being beat by Futtafaihe, the king's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030274_0265_0FE56D0C0EE8D948"/>
another by Feenou, and the third by Maree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagee himſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth and laſt dance, there were forty men as a chorus, with two drums. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers were ſixty men, arranged in three rows having twenty-four in front. Before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, we were entertained with a preliminary harangue, in which the whole number made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponces to an individual ſpeaker. They recited ſentences alternately with the chorus, and made with the <hi>pagge</hi> many quick motions. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two parties, with their backs to each other; formed again, ſhifted their ranks (as in the preceding dances) divided, and retreated, being ſucceeded by two men who exerciſed their clubs, as before, after whom came two others; the dancers in the mean time repeating in their turns with the chorus: they then advanced, and terminated the dance.</p>
                     <p>Theſe amuſements continued from eleven o'clock till near three. The number of iſlanders who attended as ſpectators, together with thoſe who were round the trading-place at the tent, or ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about, amounted to at leaſt ten thouſand, all within the compaſs of a quarter of a mile. If we had underſtood what was ſpoken in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, we might probably have gained much information with regard to the genius and cuſtoms of theſe people. Though the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors conſtantly applauded the different motions,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030274_0266_0FE56D0DF6EB24A0"/>
when well made, a conſiderable ſhare of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they received, ſeemed to ariſe from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental part, or what the performers recited. However, the mere acting part well deſerved our notice, on account of the extenſiveneſs of the plan, the variety of the motions, and the exact unity, eaſe, and gracefulneſs, with which they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>In the evening we were entertained with the <hi>bomai,</hi> or night dances, on a large area before the temporary dwelling-place of Feenou. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three hours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during which time about twelve of them were performed, nearly in the ſame manner as thoſe at Hapaee. In two of them, which were performed by women, a party of men came and formed a circle within their's. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which conſiſted of twenty-four men, many motions that we had not before ſeen, were made with the hands, and met with great applauſe. The muſic was once changed in the courſe of the evening; and in one of the dances, Feenou him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf appeared at the head of fifty men: he was well dreſſed in linen, and ſome ſmall pictures were hung round his neck.</p>
                     <p>Though the whole entertainment was conducted with better order than could reaſonably have been expected, yet our utmoſt care and attention could not prevent our being plundered by the natives, in the moſt daring and inſolent manner. There was ſcarcely any thing which they did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030274_0267_0FE56D0F840A5510"/>
to ſteal. They once, in the middle of the day, attempted to take an anchor from off the Diſcovery's bows; but without effect. The only violence of which they were guilty, was, the breaking the ſhoulder-bone of one of our goats; in conſequence of which ſhe died ſoon after. On Wedneſday the 18th, an iſlander got out of a canoe into the Reſolution, and ſtole a pewter-baſon; but being detected, he was purſued, and brought along-ſide the ſhip. Upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, three old women in the canoe made loud lamentations over the priſoner. beating their faces and breaſts with the palms of their hands in a very violent manner, but without ſhedding a tear. This mode of expreſſing ſorrow occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the mark which moſt of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On ſome occaſions, they cut this part of the face with an inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day Captain Cook beſtowed ſome preſents on Mareewagee, in return for thoſe which had been received from that chief the preceding day; and as the entertainments then exhibited called upon us to make ſome exhibition in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he ordered all the marines to go through their exerciſe, on the ſpot where the late dances
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030274_0268_0FE56D116A21ACD0"/>
had been performed; and, in the evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome fire-works were alſo played off at the ſame place. The King, the principal chiefs, and a vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people, were preſent. The platoon fiiring ſeemed to pleaſe them; but, when they beheld our water-rockets, they were filled with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and admiration. They did not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the fife and drum, or French horns, that were playing during the intervals. Poulaho ſat behind every one, no perſon being permitted to ſit behind him; and, that his view might receive no obſtruction, none ſat immediately before him; but a lane, as it were, was made by the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors from him, quite down to the ſpace allotted for playing off the fire-works.</p>
                     <p>While the natives were in expectation of this evening's exhibition, they engaged, for the greateſt part of the afternoon, in wreſtling and boxing. When a perſon is deſirous of wreſtling, he gives a challenge by croſſing the ground in a kind of meaſured pace, and clapping ſmartly on the elbow joint of one arm, which is bent, and ſends forth a hollow ſound. If no opponent ſteps forth, he returns and ſits down; but if an antagoniſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, they meet with marks of the greateſt good-nature, generally ſmiling, and deliberately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting the piece of cloth that is faſtened round the waiſt. They then lay hold of each other by this cloth, and he who ſucceeds in drawing his opponent to him, inſtantly endeavours to lift him
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030274_0269_0FE56D182516A4E8"/>
upon his breaſt, and throw him on his back; and if he can turn round with him in that poſition two or three times, before he throws him, he meets with great applauſe for his dexterity. If they are more equally matched, they quickly cloſe, and attempt to throw each other by entwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their legs, or raiſing each other from the ground; in which ſtruggles they diſplay an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exertion of ſtrength. When one of them is thrown, he immediately retires; while the conqueror ſits down for near a minute then riſes, and goes to the ſide from which he came, where the victory is proclaimed aloud. After ſitting for a ſhort time, he riſes again, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges; and if ſeveral antagoniſts appear, he has the privilege of chooſing which of them he pleaſes to engage wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he may alſo, if he ſhould throw his competitor, challenge again, till he himſelf is vanquiſhed; and then the people on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide chant the ſong of victory in favour of their champion. It frequently happens, that five or ſix riſe from each ſide, and give challenges together; ſo that it is not uncommon to ſee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſets engaged on the field at the ſame time. They preſerve great temper in this exerciſe, and leave the ſpot without the leaſt diſpleaſure in their countenances. When they find that they are too equally matched, they deſiſt by mutual conſent; and if it does not clearly appear which of them has had the advantage, both ſides proclaim the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030274_0270_0FE56D19F99B5C38"/>
victory, and then they engage again. But no one, who has been vanquiſhed, is permitted to engage a ſecond time with his conqueror.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who intend to box advance ſide-ways, changing the ſide at every pace, having one arm ſtretched out before, the other behind; and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one hand a piece of cord, which they wrap cloſely about it, when they meet with an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. This is probably intended to prevent a diſlocation of the hand or fingers. Their blows are dealt out with great quickneſs and activity, and are aimed principally at the head. They box equally well with either hand. One of their moſt dexterous blows i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, to turn round on the heel, juſt after they have ſtruck their adverſary, and to give him another pretty violent blow with the other hand backward. In boxing-matches, unleſs a perſon ſtrikes his antagoniſt to the ground they never ſing the ſong of victory; which ſhews, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> this diverſon is leſs approved among them than wreſtling. Not only boys engage in both theſe exerciſes; but it not unfrequently happens, that little girls box with great obſtinacy. On all theſe occaſions, they do not conſider it as any diſgrace to be overcome; and the vanquiſhed perſon ſits down with as much indifference as if he had never engaged. Some of our people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with them in both exerciſes, but were generally worſted.</p>
                     <p>

He therefore, on the 10th, aſſembled the chiefs before our houſe, and marked out his intended preſents to them. To the king he gave a bull and a cow; to Mareewagee, a Cape ram, and two ewes; and to Feenou, a horſe and a mare. He inſtructed Omai to tell them, that no ſuch animals exiſted within ſeveral months ſail of their iſland; that he had brought them, with a great degree of trouble and expence, for their uſe; that, therefore, they ought to be careful not to kill any of them till they had multiplied conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably; and, finally, that they and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ought to remember, that they had received them from the natives of Britain. Omai alſo explained to them their reſpective uſes, as far as his limited knowledge in ſuch points would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him. The Captain had intended to give old Toobou two or three goats; but finding that chief indifferent about them, he added them to the ſhare of Poulaho. It ſoon appeared, that ſome of the natives were diſſatisfied with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotment of our animals; for, the next morning, two of our turkey-cocks, and one kid, were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Our Commodore being determined to get them reſtored, ſeized on three canoes that were along-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>de the ſhips; then went on ſhore, and having found his majeſty, his brother, Feenou,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030274_0272_0FE56D1D59E94918"/>
and ſome other chiefs, in our houſe, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately appointed a guard over them, and intimated to them, that they muſt continue under reſtraint, till not only the turkeys and the kid, but the other things of which he had been plundered at various times, were reſtored to us. They aſſured him, that the things in queſtion ſhould all be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; and then ſat down to drink <hi>kava,</hi> with an appearance of unconcern. Soon afterwards, an axe, and an iron wedge, were brought to us. Some armed natives, in the mean time, began to aſſemble behind the houſe; but they diſperſed when a part of our guard marched againſt them; and the chiefs, at the inſtigation of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, gave orders that no more ſhould appear. When he invited them to dine with him on board, they readily conſented. Some of them having afterwards objected to Poulaho's going, he roſe up immediately, and declared that he would be the firſt man. Accordingly, the chiefs went on board with Captain Cook, and remained in the ſhip till near four o'clock. He then conducted them aſhore; and, not long after, the kid and one of the turkeys were reſtored to him. On their promiſing that the other turkey ſhould be brought back the next morning, he releaſed both them and the canoes.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook now walked out with Omai, with a view of obſerving how the natives in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood fared; for this was the uſual time of
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030274_0273_0FE56D2104C1F4E0"/>
their meals. He found that they were, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ill ſupplied; a circumſtance not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, ſince moſt of the yams, and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that they brought with them, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of to us; and they were unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own habitations, while they could procure any ſuſtenance near our poſt. That par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part of the iſland, where our ſtation was, being uncultivated, there were none of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives who had a fixed reſidence within half a mile of us. Thoſe therefore who were at our poſt, were obliged to live under trees and buſhes, or in temporary ſhades; and the cocoa-trees were ſtripped of their branches, for the purpoſe of erecting huts for the chiefs.</p>
                     <p>Omai and the Captain, in the courſe of their walk, found ſix or ſeven women at ſupper toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, two of whom were fed by the others. On their aſking the the reaſon of this circumſtance, the women replied, <hi>taboo mattee.</hi> Upon further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry it appeared, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> one of them, about two months before, had waſhed the corpſe of a chief, on which account ſhe was not allowed to handle any food for five months; and that the other had performed the ſame office to the dead body of a perſon of inferior rank, and was therefore under a ſimilar reſtriction though not for ſo long a ſpace.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 21ſt, early in the morning, Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laho came on board, to invite Captain Cook to an
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:030274_0274_0FE56D23563FA208"/>
                        <hi>baiva</hi> or entertainment, which he deſigned to give the ſame day. He had already had his head beſmeared with red pigment, in order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a red colour to his hair, which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of a dark brown. The Captain, after breakfaſt, attended him to the ſhore, and found the iſlanders very buſy in two places, fixing, in a ſquare and upright poſition, four very long poſts, at the diſtance of near two feet from each other. They afterwards filled up with yams the ſpace between the poſts; and faſtened ſticks acroſs, from one poſt to another, at the diſtance of every four feet, to prevent the poſts from ſeparating, by the weight of the incloſed yams, and alſo to aſcend by. As ſoon as the yams had reached the ſummit of the firſt poſts, they continued to faſten others to them, till each pile was thirty feet or more in height. They placed, on the top of one of the piles, two bakedhogs; and, on the top of the other, a living one: and they tied another by the legs half-way up. The facility and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch with which theſe two piles were raiſed, were remarkable. After they had completed them, they accumulated ſome other heaps of yams, and alſo of bread-fruit, on each ſide of the area; to which a turtle, and a great quantity of excellent fiſh, were added. The whole of this, with ſome red feathers, a mat, and a piece of cloth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the king's preſent to Captain Cook. About one o'clock the <hi>mai,</hi> or dances, were begun.
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:030274_0275_0FE56D24DF46E988"/>
The firſt of theſe very nearly reſembled the firſt that was performed at Mareewagee's entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſecond was conducted by young Toobou; and in this, four or five women were introduced, who equalled the men in the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and regularity of their motions. Near the end, the performers divided, in order to leave room for two champions, who exerciſed their clubs. In the third dance, which was the laſt, two other men, with clubs, exibited their ſkill and activity. The dances were ſucceeded by boxing and wreſtling; and one man entered the liſts with a kind of heavy club, made from the ſtem of a cocoa-leaf, but could meet with no opponent to engage him in ſo rough a diverſion. Towards the evening, the <hi>bomai,</hi> or night-dances, began, in which the king himſelf, apparelled in Engliſh manufacture, was a performer: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe, nor the dances in the day-time, were ſo capital as thoſe of Feenou, or Mareewagee.</p>
                     <p>The Commodore, in order to be preſent the whole time, dined on ſhore. Poulaho ſat down with him, but neither eat nor drank, which was owing to the preſence of a female, who had been admitted, at his requeſt, to the dining party, and who, as we were informed in the ſequel, was of ſuperior rank to himſelf. This lady had no ſooner dined, then he walked up to Poulaho, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his hands to her feet; after which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retired. He immediately dipped his fingers into
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030274_0276_0FE56D26B26C3018"/>
a glaſs of wine, and then all her attendants paid him obeiſance. At his deſire, ſome of our fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works were played off in the evening: but being damaged, they did not anſwer the expectations of the ſpectators.</p>

Still, however, we had thieves among us, and had continual inſtances of their depredations.</p>
                     <p>Some of the officers of both ſhips, who had made an excurſion into the interior parts of the iſland, returned the 22d of June in the evening after an abſence of two days. They had taken their muſkets and neceſſary ammunition with them, beſides ſeveral ſmall articles of the favourite commodities; the whole of which the natives had the dexterity to ſteal from them, in the courſe of their ſhort journey. Inconvenient conſequences were likely to have attended this affair; for, when our plundered travellers returned, they employed Omai, without conſulting Captain Cook, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the king of the treatment they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. He, not knowing how the Captain would proceed in this affair, and apprehending that he might again lay him under reſtraint, ſet off early the next morning, and Feenou followed his example; ſo that not a chief of authority was now remaining in our neighbourhood. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was offended at this buſineſs, and repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Omai for having preſumed to interfere in it. This reprimand induced him to endeavour to bring back his friend Feenou, and he ſucceeded in his negociation, by aſſuring him that no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meaſures would be purſued to oblige the natives to return what they had ſtolen. Truſting to this declaration, Feenou came back in the
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:030274_0278_0FE56D2DD5444660"/>
evening, and was favourably received. Poulaho alſo favoured us with his company the next day.</p>
                     <p>Upon this occaſion, the two chiefs very juſtly obſerved to Captain Cook, that, whenever any of his people wanted to take an excurſion into the country, they ought to be made acquainted with it, that they might order proper people to attend them, to prevent ſuch outrages. And, had this precaution been taken, it is not to be doubted but that a man and his property would have been as ſafe here, as in other parts of the more civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized world. Though the Captain did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endeavour to recover the articles taken upon this occaſion, the whole of them were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned through the interpoſition of Feenou, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one muſket, and a few other inſignificant articles. By this time alſo, we recovered the tools and other matters, that had been ſtolen from our workmen.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday the 25th of June, two boats, which Captain Cook had ſent in ſearch of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious channel to ſea, returned. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of them reported, that the channel to the north, through which we came in, was imminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous, being full of coral rocks; that there was a good channel to the eaſtward, though contracted, in one place, by the ſmall iſlands; conſequently a weſterly wind would be neceſſary to get through it. We had now recruited our ſhips, and repaired our ſails, and had little more
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:030274_0279_0FE56D2F5DC3C040"/>
to expect of the produce of the iſland; but as an eclipſe of the ſun was to happen on the 5th of July, the Captain determined to ſtay till that time, to have a chance of obſerving it.</p>
                     <p>Having now ſome leiſure before us, Captain Cook, and a party of us accompanied by Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laho, ſet out the next morning, in a boat, for Mooa, a kind of village, where he and the other men of conſequence, uſually reſide. Rowing up the inlet, we ſaw fourteen canoes fiſhing in company; in one of which was Poulaho's ſon. They had then taken ſome fine mullets, about a dozen of which they put into a boat. They ſhewed us their whole method of fiſhing, which appeared to be an effectual one.</p>
                     <p>Taking leave of the prince and his fiſhing party, we were rowed to the bottom of the bay, and landed where we had done before, when we went to ſee Mareewagee. As ſoon as we got on ſhore we were conducted to one of Poulaho's houſes; which, though tolerably large, ſeemed to be his private place of reſidence, and was ſituated within a plantation. The king ſeated himſelf at one end of the houſe, and thoſe who came to viſit him, ſat down in a ſemi-circle at the other end. A bowl of <hi>kava</hi> was immediately prepared for us, and directions were given to bake ſome yams. While theſe were getting ready, ſome of us, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a few of the king's attendants, and Omai as our interpreter, went to take a view of a

They greatly reſemble the cypreſs, and had a very ſolemn effect. A row of low palms was alſo planted near one of the houſes.</p>
                     <p>After refreſhing ourſelves with ſome proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we had brought from our ſhips, we took a pretty large circuit into the country, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by one of the king's miniſters, who would not ſuffer any of the rabble to follow us, and obliged thoſe whom we met upon our progreſs, to ſit down while we were paſſing; a mark of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due only to their ſovereigns. The greateſt part of the country was cultivated, and moſt of their plantations fenced round. Some parts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, lay fallow, and others in a ſtate of nature; the latter afforded large quantities of timber.</p>
                     <p>We found many public and well-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>aten paths, leading to different parts of the iſland. Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling here was, indeed, very commodious, the roads being excellent, and the country level. We were conducted to ſeveral pools and ſprings of water, but they were, in general, either brackiſh or ſtinking.</p>
                     <p>In the duſk of the evening, we returned from or walk, and found our ſupper in readineſs. It conſiſted of ſome fiſh and yams, and a baked hog in which all the culinary arts of the iſland had been diſplayed. There being nothing to amuſe us after ſupper, we lay down to ſleep, according to the cuſtom of the country, on mats ſpread upon the floor, and had a covering of cloth.
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:030274_0283_0FE56D3BCB35F6F0"/>
The king, who became happy with ſome wine and brandy which we had brought, alſo ſlept in the houſe, as did ſeveral others of the natives. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day-break, they all roſe, and entered into converſation by moon-light. As ſoon as it was day they diſperſed different ways, but it was not long before they all returned, accompanied by ſeveral of their countrymen.</p>
                     <p>While they were preparing a bowl of <hi>kava,</hi> Captain Cook went to pay a viſit to Toobou, Captain Furneaux's friend, who had a houſe not far diſtant, which for ſize and neatneſs was hardly exceeded in the place. Here alſo we found a company preparing a morning draught. The cheif made a preſent to the Captain of a living hog, and one that was baked; alſo a quantity of yams, and a large piece of cloth. Returning to the king, we found him and his attendants drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond bowl of <hi>kava.</hi> That buſineſs being performed, he informed Omai that he was immediately going to perform a morning cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, called <hi>tooge,</hi> in memory of a ſon who had been ſome time dead, and deſired us to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him. Naturally expecting to ſee ſomewhat new or curious, we readily complied with the requeſt.</p>
                     <p>The king ſtepped out of the houſe, attended by two old woman, and put on a new cloathing, over which was placed an old ragged mat, which might probably have ſerved his grandfather upon
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030274_0284_0FE56D3D519B85C8"/>
a ſimilar ſolemn occaſion. His attendants were habited in the ſame manner, excepting that, in point of antiquity, none of their mats could vie with that of their maſter. Thus equipped, we marched off, preceded by eight or ten perſons in the ſame uniform, each of them having likewiſe a green bough about his neck. Poulaho, who held his bough in his hand till he approached the place of rendezvouz, then alſo put it about his neck. We now entered a ſmall incloſure, wherein was a neat houſe, and a man ſitting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. As the company entered, they took the branches from their necks, and threw them away. The king ſeated himſelf, and the others ſat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the uſual manner. By the arrival of other perſons, the circle increaſed to upwards of an hundred, principally old men, all dreſſed in the manner above deſcribed. The company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled, a large root of <hi>kava</hi> was produced by one of the king's ſervants, and a capacious bowl that would contain five or ſix gallons. Many perſons now began to chew the root, and the bowl that was filled with liquor up to the brim. Others were employed in making drinking-cups of plantain leaves. The firſt cup that was filled, being preſented to the king, he ordered it to be given to another perſon; the ſecond was alſo preſented to him, and he drank it; the third was offered to Captain Cook. Afterwards a cup was given to ſeveral others, till the liquor was
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030274_0285_0FE56D430BDD8D48"/>
exhauſted; and though not half the company partook of it, no one appeared in the leaſt diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Each cup, as it was emptied, was thrown upon the ground, whence it was taken up, and carried to be filled again. All this time the chief, and his whole circle, ſat with a great deal of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity hardly ſpeaking a ſyllable to each other.</p>
                     <p>All this while we were in expectation of ſeeing the mourning ceremony begin, when, to our great ſurpriſe, as ſoon as the kava was drank out, they all roſe up and diſperſed; and Poulaho informed us, he was now ready to attend us to the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>We had ſometimes ſeen the drinking of kava at other iſlands, but no where ſo frequently as here. The <hi>kava</hi> is a ſpecies of pepper, which they eſteem a valuable article, and cultivate for this purpoſe, carefully defending the young plants from any injury; and it is uſually planted about their houſes. It does not often exceed the height of a man, though they are ſometimes ſeen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> higher. It has large heart-ſhaped leaves, and jointed ſtalks.</p>
                     <p>Only the root of the kava is uſed at the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iſlands: after being dug up, it is given to the ſervants; who, breaking it in pieces, ſcrape the dirt off, and each chews his portion, which he afterwards ſpits into a piece of plantain leaf. Thoſe, who are to prepare the liquor, collect theſe mouthfuls together, and depoſit them in a large wooden bowl, adding a ſufficient quantity
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030274_0286_0FE56D44D34B06A0"/>
of water to make it of a proper ſtrength. It is then well mixed up with the hands, and wrung hard, in order to make it productive of as much liquid as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>About a quarter of a pint of this beverage is uſually put into each cup. It has no perceptible effect upon theſe people, who uſe it ſo frequently: but, on ſome of ours, it operated like our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, occaſioning intoxication, or rather ſtupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The mourning ceremony being over, we left Mooa, and ſet out on our return to the ſhips. Rowing down the inlet, we met with two canoes returning from fiſhing. Poulaho ordered them to approach him, and took from them every fiſh and ſhell. He afterwards ſtopped two other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes, ſearched them, and found nothing. He gave us ſome of the fiſh, and the reſt were ſold by his ſervants on board the ſhip. Proceeding down the inlet, we overtook a large ſailing canoe, when every perſon on board her ſat down till we had paſſed; even the man who ſteered, though he could not poſſibly manage the helm, but in a ſtanding poſture.</p>
                     <p>Having been informed, by Poulaho and others, that there was ſome good water at Onevy, a ſmall iſland, about a league off the mouth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; we landed there, in order to taſte it, but found it to be extremely brackiſh. This iſland is quite in a natural ſtate, and only frequented as a
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030274_0287_0FE56D465CB2F068"/>
fiſhing-place; having nearly the ſame producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Palmerſton's iſland.</p>
                     <p>When we returned to the ſhip, Captain Cook was informed that every thing had been quiet during his abſence; not a ſingle theft having been committed; of which Feenou, and Futta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faihe, the king's brother, who had undertaken the management of his countrymen in the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's abſence, boaſted not a little. This evinces what power the chiefs have, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to execute it; which is not often to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; for whatever was ſtolen from us, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conveyed to them.</p>
                     <p>The next day, ſix or eight of the natives, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted ſome of our people who were ſawing planks; in conſequence of which they were fired on by the ſentry; one of them was ſuppoſed to be wounded, and three were taken. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were confined till night, when they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and ſet at liberty. After this their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour was very decent and circumſpect; occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, as we imagined, by the man being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for, till this time, they had only <hi>heard</hi> of the effect of fire-arms, but now they had <hi>felt</hi> it. We were not miſtaken in our conjecture, for Mr. King, and Mr. Anderſon, in an excurſion they took into the country, met with the very man, and found indubitable marks of his having been wounded with a muſket-ball.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="230" facs="unknown:030274_0288_0FE56D47E50708D0"/>Nothing worthy of notice happened at the ſhips for two days; we ſhall therefore fill up that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval with an account of Mr. Anderſon's excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, above mentioned. On Monday the 30th of June, Mr. King, and he accompanied Futta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faihe as viſitors to his houſe, which is not far from that of his brother Poulaho, at Mooa. Soon after they arrived, a largiſh hog was killed, which was effected by repeated ſtrokes upon the head. The hair was then curiouſly ſcraped off, with the ſharp edge of pieces of ſplit bamboo, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails taken out by the ſame ſimple inſtrument. Previous to this an oven had been prepared, which is a large hole dug in the earth, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of which is covered with ſtones, about the ſize of a man's fiſt, which are made red hot by kindling a fire over them; then they wrapt up ſome of theſe ſtones in leaves of the bread fruit tree, with which they filled the hog's belly; ſtuffing in a quantity of leaves to prevent their falling out, and thruſting a plug of the ſame kind in the anus. This being done, the carcaſe was placed upon ſome ſticks laid acroſs the ſtones, and covered with plantain-leaves. The earth was afterwards dug up all round; and the oven being thus effectually cloſed, the operation of baking required no farther aid.</p>
                     <p>They afterwards amuſed themſelves by walking about the country, but ſaw nothing remarkable, except a fiatooka of about thirty feet high. At a
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030274_0289_0FE56D4E45C39DD0"/>
ſmall diſtance, there, was a number of etooa-trees, on which were vaſt quantities of <hi>Ternate</hi> bats, making a moſt horrible noiſe. Not having their muſkets, at this time, they could not kill any of them, but ſome, taken at Annamooka, meaſured almoſt a yard, when the wings were extended.</p>
                     <p>On their return to Futtafaihe's houſe, the bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hog was produced, accompanied with ſome cocoa-nuts, and ſeveral baſkets of baked yams. The perſon who prepared the hog in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, now cut it up in a very maſterly manner, with a knife made of ſplit bamboo. Though the weight of it was at leaſt fifty pounds, the whole was placed before them; when they took a ſmall part, and deſired the reſt might be partaken of by the people ſitting round. Fattafaihe could hardly be prevailed upon to eat a morſel.</p>
                     <p>Dinner being ended, they went, with him, and his attendants, towards the ſpot where Poulaho's mourning-ceremony was performed. They ſaw nothing but a kind of continuation of the ſame ſolemn rites, by way of condolence. Upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring upon whoſe account it was now tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, they were informed, that it was in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a chief who had long ſince died at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaoo, that they had practiſed it ever ſince, and ſhould continue to do ſo for a conſiderable length of time to come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="unknown:030274_0290_0FE56D501CAD5EA0"/>They were entertained in the evening, with a pig for ſupper, dreſſed like the hog, and, like that accompanied with yams and cocoa-nuts. When the ſupper was over, a large quantity of cloth was brought for them to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eep in; but they were diſturbed in their repoſe, by a ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of luxury, in which their men of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence indulge themſelves; that of being thump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or beat while they are aſleep. Two women, who ſat by Futtafaihe, performed this operation, which they call <hi>tooge tooge,</hi> by ſtriking his body and legs, with both fiſts, till he fell aſleep, and, with ſome intervals, continued it the whole night. The perſon being faſt aſleep, they abate a little of the ſtrength and briſkneſs of the beating; but, if they obſerve any appearance of his awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they reſume it. In the morning they were informed, that Futtafaihe's women relieved each other, and went alternately to ſleep. Such a practiſe as this in any other country, would be ſuppoſed to be deſtructive of all reſt; but here it operates like an opiate, and ſtrongly ſhews what habit may effect.</p>
                     <p>They ſet out with Futtafaihe the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and walked to the point, down the eaſt-ſide of the bay. The country all along this ſide ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be well cultivated, but not ſo much incloſed as at Mooa. They found, that, in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, Futtafaihe exerciſed a power, which ſhewed the great authority the principal men are
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030274_0291_0FE56D51A61DE770"/>
inveſted with. To one place, he ſent for fiſh; and to another, for yams; and his orders were as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obeyed, as if he had been abſolute maſter of all the people's property.</p>
                     <p>They croſſed the bay, in the evening, to their ſtation, in a canoe procured by Futtafaihe, by exerciſing his authority in calling to the firſt that appeared; he had alſo a large hog at this place, and wanted them to accept of a bundle of cloth; but, the boat being ſmall, they objected; and he ordered it to be taken to them the next day. Thus ends Mr. Anderſon's account of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook had prolonged his ſtay at this iſland, on account of the approaching eclipſe; but, on looking at the micrometer, (on the 2d of July) he found ſome accident had happened to it, and that it was rendered uſeleſs, till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; which could not be done before the time it was intended to be uſed. We therefore got on board, this day, all the cattle and other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, except thoſe that were deſtined to remain. The Captain deſigned to have left a turkey-cock and hen, but two hens being deſtroyed by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and wiſhing to carry the breed to Otaheite, he reſerved the only remaining pair for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>We took up our anchor the next day, and moved the ſhips behind Pangimodoo, to be ready for the firſt favourable wind to take us through
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:030274_0292_0FE56D53A48A9D40"/>
the narrows. The king, who this day dined with us, took particular notice of the plates; which the Commodore obſerving, made him an offer of one, either of pewter, or of earthen ware. He made choice of the firſt, and mentioned the ſeveral uſes to which he intended to apply it; two of which were ſo very extraordinary that they deſerve to be related.</p>
                     <p>Whenever he ſhould viſit any of the other iſlands, he ſaid he would leave this plate behind him at Tongataboo, as his repreſentative, that the people might in his abſence, pay it the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage due to himſelf in perſon. On being aſked, how he had uſually been repreſented in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, before he was in poſſeſſion of this plate, he informed us, that this ſingular honour had always been conferred on a wooden bowl, in which he waſhed his hands. The other uſe to which he meant to apply the plate inſtead of the bowl, was to diſcover a thief. When any thing had been ſtolen, and the thief not detected, the people were aſſembled before him, when he waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hands in this veſſel. After this it was cleaned, and every man advanced, and touched it with his hand, in the ſame manner that they touch his foot when they offer him obeiſance. If touched by the guilty perſon, he dropped down dead immediately; and, if any one refuſed to touch, it, ſuch refuſal was conſidered as a ſufficient proof of his guilt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="235" facs="unknown:030274_0293_0FE56D58CF08E850"/>In the morning of Saturday the 5th of July, the day of the eclipſe, the weather was cloudy, with ſome ſhowers of rain. About nine o'clock, the ſun broke out at ſmall intervals for about half an hour, but was totally obſcured juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the eclipſe. The ſun again appeared at intervals till about the middle of the eclipſe; but was ſeen no more during the remainder of the day, ſo that we could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the end. This diſappointment was the leſs to be lamented, as the longitude was ſufficiently determined by lunar obſervations.</p>
                     <p>The eclipſe being over, we packed up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and every thing was conveyed on board. None of the natives having taken any care of the three ſheep allotted to Mareewagee, the Commodore ordered them to be carried back to the ſhips. He was apprehenſive that, if they had been left there, they would probably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by dogs. Theſe animals did not exiſt upon the iſland in 1773, when the Commodore firſt viſited it; but there is now a plenty of them; partly from the breed left by him, and partly from ſome imported from an iſland, called <hi>Feejee.</hi> At preſent, however, the dogs have not got into any of the Friendly Iſlands, except Tongataboo.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Anderſon has given us the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this iſland. Amſterdam, Tonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taboo, or Tonga (as it is ſometimes called by the natives) is about twenty leagues in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,

rather oblong, though broadeſt at the eaſt-end, and its greateſt length is from eaſt to weſt. The ſouth-ſhore is ſtraight, conſiſting of coral-rocks of about eight or ten feet high, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating perpendicularly, except in ſome few places, where there are ſandy beach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The weſt-end is about five or ſix miles broad, and has a ſhore like that of the ſouth-ſide; but the north-ſide is environed with ſhoals and iſlands; and the eaſt ſide is, moſt probably, like the ſouth.</p>
                     <p>This iſland may, with propriety, be called a low one; the only eminent part, to be obſerved from a ſhip, is the ſouth-eaſt point, though many gently riſing and declining grounds are perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by thoſe who are on ſhore. Though the general appearance of the country does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit that beautiful kind of landſcape, produced by a variety of hills and valleys, rivulets, and lawns, yet it conveys an idea of the moſt exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant fertility. The ſurface, at a diſtance, ſeems entirely clothed with trees of various ſizes: but the tall cocoa-palms raiſe their tufted heads high above the reſt, and are a noble ornament to any country that produces them. The boogo, which is a ſpecies of the fig, is the largeſt ſized tree upon the iſland: and the moſt common buſhes and ſmall trees, on the uncultivated ſpots, are the pandanus, the faitanoo, ſeveral ſorts of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſcus, and a few others.</p>

                        <pb n="237" facs="unknown:030274_0295_0FE56D5BE7422008"/>The climate of Tongataboo, from the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the tropic, is more variable than in countries far within that line; though that might, perhaps, be occaſioned by the ſeaſon of the year which was now the winter ſolſtice. The winds are generally from ſome point between ſouth and eaſt. The wind, indeed, ſometimes veers to the north-eaſt, or even north-weſt, but never conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues long, nor blows ſtrong from thence, though often accompanied by heavy rain, and cloſe ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try weather.</p>
                     <p>The vegetable productions are never ſo much affected, reſpecting the foliage, as to ſhed it all at once; but every leaf, as it falls, is ſucceded by another, which cauſes the appearanee of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſpring.</p>
                     <p>A coral rock appears to be the baſis of the iſland, that being the only ſort that preſents itſelf on the ſhore. There was not the appearance of any other ſtone, except ſome ſmall blue pebbles about the <hi>fiatookas</hi> and the ſmooth black ſtone, of which the natives make their hatchets; and theſe have, perhaps, been brought from other iſlands in the neighbourhood. Though, in many places, the coral projects above the ſurface, the ſoil is, in moſt parts, of a conſiderable depth. In cultivated places, it is generally of a looſe black colour, ſeemingly produced by the rotten vegetables.</p>

                        <pb n="238" facs="unknown:030274_0296_0FE56D5DC65BB750"/>The principal of the cultivated fruits in this iſland, are plantains, of which they have fifteen varieties; the jambu, and the eeevee: the latter being a kind of plum; and vaſt quantities of ſhaddocks, as often found in a natural ſtate as planted.</p>
                     <p>Of yams there are two ſorts; one black and ſo large as to weigh from twenty to thirty pounds; the other white and long, ſeldom exceeding a pound in weight.

                     <p>They have vaſt numbers of cocoa-nut-trees, and three other ſorts of palms. One is called beeoo, growing almoſt as high as the cocoa-tree, and having very large leaves plaited like a fan. The other is a kind of cabbage-tree, much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the cocoa, but rather thicker. A third ſort is called ongo ongo; it ſeldom grows higher than five or ſix feet. Plenty of excellent ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane is cultivated here; alſo gourds, bamboo, turmeric, and a ſpecies of fig, called matte; but the catalogue of uncultivated plants is too large to be enumerated.</p>
                     <p>There are no quadrupeds in this iſland, but hogs, dogs, and a few rats. Fowls of a large breed, are domeſticated here.</p>
                     <p>Among the birds, are parrots, and parroquets, cuckoos, king-fiſhers, and a bird of the thruſh kind, of a dull green colour, which is the only

ſinging-bird we could find here; but it compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſates, in a great degree, for the want of others, by the force and melody of its voice.</p>
                     <p>Among the other land birds are rails about the ſize of a pigeon, of a variegated grey colour; a black ſort with reddiſh eyes: large violet coots, with red bald crowns; two ſorts of fly-catchers; a ſmall ſwallow; and three ſorts of pidgeons.</p>
                     <p>Of water-fowl, are the ducks ſeen at Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooka; tropic birds; blue and white herons; noddies; white terns; a new ſpecies of a leaden colour; a ſmall bluiſh curlew; and a large ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted plover.</p>
                     <p>Among the animals of the reptile, or inſect tribe, are ſea ſnakes, (though often ſeen on ſhore) about three feet long, with alternate black and white circles; ſome ſcorpions, and centipedes; alſo green guanoes, about eighteen inches long, and two ſmaller ſorts.

                     <p>Though the ſea abounds with fiſh, the variety is leſs than might be imagined: thoſe in the greateſt plenty are mullets, ſilver fiſh, old wives, parrot fiſh, ſoles, leather jackets, albicores, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netos, eels like thoſe about Palmerſton's Iſland, rays, a ſort of pike, and ſome devil fiſh.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THOUGH we were now ready to ſail, we had not ſufficient day-light to turn through the narrows; the morning flood falling out too early and the evening flood too late. We were therefore under a neceſſity of waiting two or three days, unleſs we ſhould be fortunate enough to have a leading wind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="241" facs="unknown:030274_0299_0FE56D65154FB428"/>This delay gave us an opportunity to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at a public ſolemnity, to which the king had invited us, and which was to be performed on the 8th. He and all the people of conſequence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Mooa on the 7th, where the ſolemnity was to be exhibited. Several of us followed them the next morning. Poulaho had informed us, that his ſon was now to be initiated into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain privileges; one of which was, that of eating with his father; an honour he had not hitherto enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>About eight o'clock in the morning we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Mooa, where we found the king, with a number of attendants ſitting before him, within a ſmall dirty encloſure. They were, as uſual, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in preparing a bowl of <hi>kava.</hi> As this was not liquor for us, we went to pay a viſit to ſome of our friends, and to obſerve what preparations were making for the ceremony, which was ſoon expected to begin.</p>
                     <p>About ten o'clock, the people aſſembled in a large area before the <hi>malace,</hi> or great houſe. At the end of a road, opening into this area, ſtood ſeveral men with ſpears and clubs, inceſſantly reciting ſhort ſentences, in mournful accents, which conveyed an idea of diſtreſs. This was contined about an hour; during which time, many people came down the road, each having a yam tied to the middle of a pole, which they laid down before thoſe who continued repeating
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:030274_0300_0FE56D66E84908B8"/>
the ſentences. At length, the king and prince ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and ſeated themſelves upon the area; and we were requeſted to ſit down by them, to take off out hats and to untie our hair. The bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the yams having all entered, each pole was taken up between two men, who carried it over their ſhoulders. They afterwards formed themſelves into companies, of ten or twelve each, and marched acroſs the place, with a rapid pace, each company headed by a man who had a club or ſpear, and defended, on the right, by ſeveral others, armed with different weapons. About two hundred and fifty perſons walked in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which was cloſed by a man carrying on a perch a living pigeon.</p>
                     <p>Omai was deſired by Captain Cook to aſk the chief where the yams were to be carried, with ſo much ſolemnity; but he ſeemed unwilling to give us the information we required; ſome of us, therefore, followed the proceſſion, ſeemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his inclination.</p>
                     <p>They ſtopped before a <hi>morai</hi> or <hi>fiatooka</hi> of one houſe ſtanding upon a mount, about a quarter of a mile from where they firſt aſſembled. Here they depoſited the yams, and gathered them into bundles; but for what purpoſe, we could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly learn. Our preſence ſeeming to give them offence or uneaſineſs, we quitted them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Poulaho, who adviſed us to amuſe ourſelves by walking about, as nothing would be

done for a conſiderable time. The fear of loſing the ſight of any part of the ceremony prevented our being long abſent. When we returned to the king, he deſired Captain Cook to order the boat's crew not to preſume to ſtir from the boat, for every thing would, very ſoon, be <hi>taboo</hi>; and if any of our people, or of there own, ſhould be ſeen walking about, they would certainly be knocked down with clubs; nay <hi>mateed,</hi> that is, killed. He alſo informed us that we could not be preſent at the ceremony; but that we ſhould be placed in ſuch a ſituation, as to be able to ſee every thing that paſſed. Our dreſs was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly objected to, and we were told, that, to qualify us to be preſent, we muſt be naked as low as the breaſt, and our hats muſt be taken off and our hair untied. Omai readily agreed to conform to theſe requiſites, and immediately began to ſtrip; but other objections were then ſtarted, and he was excluded equally with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Not reliſhing this reſtriction, the Captain ſtole out, to ſee what might now be going forward. Very few people, however, were to be ſeen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe who were dreſſed to attend the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money; ſome having in their hands ſmall poles, about four feet in length, to the under part of which were faſtened two or three other ſmall ſticks, about ſix inches long. Theſe men were going towards the <hi>morai.</hi> Captain Cook took the ſame
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:030274_0303_0FE56D7036DC5F60"/>
road, and was frequently ſtopped by them, all crying out <hi>taboo.</hi> However, he ventured to go forward till he came in ſight of the <hi>morai,</hi> and of the people ſitting before it. He was now ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged to go back, and, not knowing what might be the conſequence of a refuſal, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. He had obſerved, that thoſe who carried the poles, paſſed the <hi>morai</hi>; and gueſſing, from this circumſtance, that ſomething was tranſacting beyond it, he had ſome thoughts of advancing, by making a round for this purpoſe; but he was ſo narrowly obſerved by three men, that he had no opportunity of putting his deſign in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In order to ſhake off theſe fellows, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the <hi>malaoo,</hi> where he had parted from the king, and afterwards made an elopement a ſecond time; but he inſtantly met with the ſame three men, who had doubtleſs received inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to watch him. He paid no attention to them, till he came within ſight of the king's principal <hi>

Seeing that he could obſerve the proceedings of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany from the king's plantation, he repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, accompanied by ſeveral of his people.</p>
                     <p>The number of perſons at the <hi>fiatooka</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued increaſing for ſome time, and at length they quitted their ſitting poſture, and marched
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:030274_0304_0FE56D71DE9B1540"/>
off in proceſſion. They walked in pairs, every pair carrying between them, one of the ſmall poles on their ſhoulders. We were informed, that the ſmall pieces of ſticks faſtened to the poles, were yams; it is therefore probable, that they were meant to repreſent this root emblemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. The hindmoſt man of each couple placed one of his hands to the middle of the pole, as if it were not ſtrong enough to carry the weight that hung to it, and under which they all ſeemed to bend, as they proceeded. This proceſſion conſiſted of one hundred and eight pairs, and principally men of rank.</p>
                     <p>Having ſeen them all paſs, we repaired to Poulaho's houſe, and ſaw him going out. We were not permitted to follow him; but were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conducted to the place allotted to us, behind a fence adjoining to the area of the <hi>fiatooka</hi> where the yams had been depoſited in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Arriving at our ſtation, we ſaw two or three hundred people ſitting on the graſs, near the end of the road opening into the area of the <hi>morai</hi>; and others were continually joining them. At length, arrived a few men, each carrying ſome ſmall poles and branches, or leaves of the cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut tree. As ſoon as they appeared, an old man ſeated himſelf in the road, and pronounced a long oration in a ſerious majeſtic tone. He then retired, and the others advancing to the middle
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:030274_0305_0FE56D8CE067C2D8"/>
of the area, began to erect a ſmall ſhed or hut; employing, for that purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the materials al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned. Their work being finiſhed, they all ſquatted down, for a moment, before it, then roſe up and joined the reſt of the company. Poulaho's ſon arrived ſoon after, preceded by four or five men. After them appeared about twelve or fourteen women of the firſt rank, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing ſlowly in pairs, each pair carrying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them a narrow piece of white cloth, about two or three yards in length. They approached the prince, ſquatted down before him, and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſome of the pieces of the cloth round his body; they then roſe up and retired in the ſame order, to ſome diſtance on his left, where they ſeated themſelves. Poulaho now made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, preceded by four men, walking two and two abreaſt, and ſat down on his ſon's left hand, at a ſmall diſtance from him. The young prince then quitted his firſt poſition, and ſeated himſelf under the ſhed, with his attendants; many others placed themſelves on the graſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this royal canopy. The prince ſat facing the people, with his back to the <hi>morai.</hi> Three companies, of about ten or a dozen men in each, ſtarted up from among the crowd, ſoon after each other, and, running haſtily to the oppoſite ſide, ſat down for a few ſeconds; and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, in the ſame manner, to their former ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To them ſucceeded two men, each hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:030274_0306_0FE56D8E68797728"/>
a ſmall green branch in his hand, who roſe and advanced towards the prince, ſitting down, for a few ſeconds, three different times, as they approached; and retired in the ſame manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining there branches to each other as they ſat. Afterwards two others repeated the ſame cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                     <p>The grand proceſſion, which marched from the other <hi>morai,</hi> now began to come in. As they entered the area, they proceeded to the right of the ſhed, and having proſtrated themſelves on the graſs, depoſited their pretended heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens (the poles), and faced round to the prince. They then roſe up, and retired in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cloſing their hands with the moſt ſerious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and ſeated themſelves along the front of the area. While this numerous band where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and depoſiting their poles, three men who ſat with the prince continued pronouncing ſeparate ſentences, in a mournful melancholy tone.</p>
                     <p>A profound ſilence then enſued for a ſhort time, after which a man who ſat in the front of the area, began a kind of oration, during which, at ſeveral different times, he broke one of the poles which had been brought in. Having concluded his oration, the people, ſitting before the ſhed ſeparated to make a lane through which the prince and his attendants paſſed, and the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cloſed.</p>

The ſmall poles, which had been brought by thoſe who walked in proceſſion, being left on the ground, after the crowd had diſperſed, the Commodore examined them, and found that, to the middle of each, two or three ſmall ſticks were tied, as has been related. They were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably intended as only artificial repreſentations of ſmall yams.</p>
                     <p>Our ſupper, conſiſting of fiſh and yams, was got ready about ſeven o'clock. The king ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with us and drank ſo freely of brandy and water, that he retired to bed with a ſufficient doſe. We continued the whole night in the ſame houſe with him and his attendants.</p>
                     <p>All, except Poulaho himſelf, roſe at day-break; ſoon after which, a woman, one of thoſe who gennerally attended upon the chief, came in, and, ſitting down by him, immediately began the ſame operation which had been practiſed upon Futta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faihe, tapping or beating gently, with her clinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fiſts, on his thighs. This, inſtead of adding to his repoſe, had the contrary effect, and he awoke.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook and Omai now paid a viſit to the prince, who had parted from us early the
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:030274_0308_0FE56D974B9C2B00"/>
preceding evening; for he did not lodge with the king, but in apartments of his own, at ſome diſtance from his father's houſe. We found him with a circle of boys, about his own age, ſitting before him; and an old man and woman. There were others, of both ſexes, employed, about their neceſſary affairs, who, probably, belonged to his houſhold.</p>
                     <p>We then returned to the king, who had a crowded levee before him, conſiſting principally of old men. While a bowl of <hi>kava</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, a baked hog and yams, ſmoking hot, were introduced; the greateſt part of which fell to our ſhare, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e people, eſpecially the <hi>kava</hi> drinkers, eat very little in a morning.</p>
                     <p>We afterwards walked out, and viſited ſeveral other chiefs; all of whom were taking their morning draught, or they had already taken it. Returning to the king, we found him aſleep in a retired hut, with two women tapping or ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his breech. About eleven o'clock he aroſe again, and ate ſome fiſh and yams, and again lay down to ſleep. We now left him, and waited on the prince, with a preſent of cloth beads, and other articles. There was a ſufficient quantity of cloth to make him a complete ſuit, and he was immediately clad in his new habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Proud of his dreſs, he firſt went to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit himſelf to his father, and then conducted Captain Cook to his mother, with whom were
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:030274_0309_0FE56D98D4366488"/>
about a dozen other women of a very reſpectable appearance. Here the prince changed his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and made Captain Cook a preſent of two pieces of the cloth which had been manufactured in the iſland.</p>
                     <p>It was now about noon, when, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Captain repaired to the palace to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which was ſoon after ſerved up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of two pigs and ſome yams. The drowſy monarch was rouzed to partake of what he had appointed, for our entertainment. Two mullets, and ſome ſhell-fiſh, were introduced, as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for his ſeparate portion. But he added it to our fare, ſat down with us, and made a very hearty meal.</p>
                     <p>Dinner being over, we were informed that the ceremony would ſoon begin, and were ſtrictly enjoined not to venture out. The Commodore had reſolved, however, to peep no longer from behind the curtain, but, if poſſible to mix with the actors themſelves. With this view he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the <hi>morai,</hi> the ſcene of the ſolemnity. He was frequently deſired to return, but he paid no regard to the admonitions he received, and was permitted to paſs on. When arrived at the <hi>morai,</hi> he ſaw a number of men ſeated on the ſide of the area. A few were alſo ſitting on the oppoſite ſide, and two men in the middle, with their faces turned to the <hi>morai.</hi> When Captain Cook had got into the midſt of the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:030274_0310_0FE56D9A5E1314D8"/>
he was deſired to ſit down, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did. Where he ſat, there were lying a number of ſmall bundles, compoſed of cocoa-nut leaves, and faſtened to ſticks made into the form of hand-borrows. All the information he could get concerning them was, that they were <hi>taboo.</hi> From time to time, one or another of the company turned to thoſe who were coming to join us, and made a ſhort ſpeech, in which we remarked, that the word <hi>arekee</hi> (king) was generally mentioned. Something was ſaid by one man that produced loud burſts of laughter from all around; others, of the ſpeakers, were alſo much applauded. The Captain was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſired to leave the place; but at length, finding him determined to ſtay, they requeſted him to uncover his ſhoulders as theirs were. This he readily complied with, and then they no longer ſeemed uneaſy at his preſence.</p>
                     <p>The prince, the woman, and the king, at length appeared, as they had done the preceding day. The prince being placed under the ſhed, two men, each with a piece of mat, came, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating ſomething in a very ſerious ſtrain, and put them about him. The people now began their operations, and different companies ran backward and forward acroſs the area, as in the former day. Preſently afterwards, the two men, in the middle of the area, made a ſhort ſpeech, and then the whole company roſe up and placed
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:030274_0311_0FE56D9C04CEA6E0"/>
themſelves before the ſhed in which the prince, and three or four men were ſeated. One of the company who ſeemed very deſirous of obliging Captain Cook, procured him ſuch a ſituation, that if he could have made uſe of his eyes, nothing could have eſcaped him. But it was neceſſary to have a demure countenance and downcaſt looks.</p>
                     <p>The proceſſion ſoon after arrived as on the preceding day; a pole, with a cocoa-nut leaf plaited round the middle of it being carried on the ſhoulders of every two perſons. Theſe were depoſited with the ſame ceremonies as on the day before. After this ſucceeded another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, compoſed of men who brought baſkets, made of palm-leaves, ſuch as are generally uſed by this people to carry proviſions in. A third proceſſion followed, in which a variety of ſmall fiſh, each placed at the end of a forked ſtick, were brought. An old man, who ſat on the prince's right-hand, without the ſhed, received the baſkets; each of which he kept in his hand, making a ſhort ſpeech or prayer; then laying that aſide, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> called for another, repeating the ſame kind of prayer; he proceeded in this manner till he had gone through the whole number of baſkets. Two men, who, till this time, had in their hands green branches, and were ſeated on the left, received the fiſh one by one, as they were preſented to them on the forked ſticks. The
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:030274_0312_0FE56D76AF4205C0"/>
firſt fiſh they laid down on their right, and the ſecond on their left. The third being preſented, a ſtoutiſh man, who was ſeated behind the other two, endeavoured to ſeize it, as did alſo the other two at the ſame time. Thus every fiſh was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for; but the man behind, on account of his diſadvantageous ſituation, got only pieces; for he never quitted his hold till the fiſh was torn out of his hand. What the others got, were laid on the right and left. At laſt the perſon behind got poſſeſſion of a whole fiſh, the other two not even touching it. Upon this, the word <hi>mareeai</hi> (very good) was pronunced in a low voice throughout the whole crowd. It appeared, that he had now done all that was expected from him; for he did not contend for the other fiſh. The perſons who brought in theſe baſkets and fiſh, delivered them ſitting; and in the ſame manner, the poles, carried in the firſt proceſſion, had been placed upon the ground. At the cloſe of the laſt proceſſion, there was ſome ſpeaking or praying by different perſons. Then, on a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal being given, we all roſe up, ran ſeveral paces, and ſat down, with our backs to the prince. The Commodore was requeſted not to look behind him; but he was not diſcouraged by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, from facing about. The prince had now turned his face to the <hi>morai,</hi> and from that moment he was admitted to the honour of eating with his father; and a piece of roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:030274_0313_0FE56D7924021038"/>
yam was preſented to each of them for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Soon after, we all turned about, forming a kind of ſemicircle before the prince, and leaving an open ſpace between us. Preſently ſome men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards us, two and two, bearing large poles upon their ſhoulders, waving their hands as they proceeded, and making a noiſe like ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When they came near us, they made a ſhew of walking quick, without advancing a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſtep. Several men, armed with large ſticks, immediately ſtarted from the crowd, and ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the new viſitors, but they inſtantly made off having thrown down the poles from their ſhoulders. The others attacked the poles, and having beat them moſt unmercifully, returned to their places. The former, as they ran off, gave the challenge uſed here in wreſtling; and, in a ſhort time, ſome luſty fellows came from the ſame quarter, repeating the challenge as they approached. Theſe were reſiſted by a company, who arrived at that inſtant from the oppoſite ſide. Both parties, however, returned to their own quarter, after having paraded about the area for ſome minutes. Afterwards, for the ſpace of half an hour, wreſtling and boxing-matches ſucceeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Speeches were then delivered by two men, who ſeated themſelves before the prince, with which the ſolemnity ended, and the whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly broke up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="255" facs="unknown:030274_0314_0FE56D7AAB43A730"/>In vain did we endeavour to find out the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ſolemnity, called <hi>Natche.</hi> All the anſwer we received to our enquiries, was <hi>taboo</hi>; which as has been already obſerved, is applied to many things. There was a myſterious ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the whole tranſaction; and from the manner of performing it, as well as the place where it was performed, it was evident, that there was a mixture of religion in the inſtitution. Upon no occaſion had they regarded our dreſs and deportment; but now it was required, that our hair ſhould ſlow about our ſhoulders; that we ſhould be uncovered to the waiſt; ſit croſs-legged; and have our hands locked together. It ſhould be obſerved alſo that none but the chief people and thoſe who were concerned in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, were admitted to aſſiſt in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of it. All theſe circumſtances evidently pointed out that they ſuppoſed themſelves acting under the inſpection of a Supreme Being, upon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>From the above account of the preſent <hi>Natche,</hi> it may be conſidered as merely figurative. The few yams, which were ſeen the firſt day, could not be meant as a general contribution; and it was intimated to us, that they were a portion conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the <hi>Otooa,</hi> or Divinity.</p>
                     <p>We were however, informed that, in the ſpace of three months, there would be repreſented a more important ſolemnity; on which occaſion,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:030274_0315_0FE56D7C87495B40"/>
the tribute of Tongataboo, Hapaee, Vavaoo, and all the other iſlands, would be brought to the chief, and more awfully confirmed, by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing ten human victims from amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A horrid ſolemnity indeed! On our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the occaſion of ſo barbarous a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, we were informed, that it was a neceſſary part of the Natche; and that, if omitted, the Deity would deſtroy their king.</p>
                     <p>The day was far ſpent, before the breaking up of the aſſembly; and as we were at ſome diſtance from the ſhips, we were impatient to ſet out from Mooa. Taking leave of Poulaho, he preſſed us earneſtly to ſtay till the next day, in order to be preſent at a funeral ceremony. The wife of Mareewagee, his mother-in-law, had lately died: and, on account of the Natche, her corps had been carried on board a canoe in the <hi>lagoon.</hi> Poulaho told Captain Cook, that when he had paid the laſt offices to her, he would attend him to Eooa; but if he did not chuſe to wait, that he would follow him thither. He would gladly have ſeen this ceremony, had not the tide been now favourable. The wind too, which had been very boiſterous, was now moderate and ſettled. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we were informed that the funeral cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies would continue five days, which, as the ſhips lay in ſuch a ſituation, that we could not get to ſea at pleaſure, was too long a time to ſtay. The Captain, however, aſſured the king, that if
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:030274_0316_0FE56D8093F29528"/>
he did not immediately ſail, he would viſit him again the next day. Whereupon we all took leave of him, and arrived at our ſhips about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
                     <p>While the Commodore was attending the <hi>Natche,</hi> at Mooa, he ordered the horſes, bull, and other cattle, to be brought thither, thinking they would be ſafer there, than at a place that would be, in a great meaſure, deſerted, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after our departure. Beſides, we had left with our friends here, a young Engliſh boar, and three young Engliſh ſows. They were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſirous of them, naturally ſuppoſing that they would greatly improve their own breed, which is but ſmall. Feenou alſo got two rabbits from us, a buck and doe, from which young ones were produced before we ſailed. If the cattle ſucceed, the acquiſition to theſe iſlands will be great; and as Tongataboo is a fine level country, the horſes will be extremely uſeful.</p>
                     <p>We weighed anchor on the 10th, about eight o'clock in the morning, and, with a ſteady gale, turned through the channel, between the ſmall iſles called Makkahaa and Monooafai. The flood, at firſt, ſet ſtrong in our favour, till lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the <hi>lagoon,</hi> where the eaſtward flood meets that from the weſt. This, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draught of the <hi>lagoon,</hi> and of the ſhoals before it, occaſions, ſtrong riplings and whirlp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ols. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe diſadvantages, the depth of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:030274_0317_0FE56D82A23AB9D0"/>
exceeds the length of a cable; conſequently there can be no anchorage, except cloſe to the rocks, in forty and forty-five fathoms water, where a ſhip would be expoſed to the whirlpools. The Captain, therefore, abandoned the deſign he had formed of coming to an anchor, when we were through the narrows, and afterwards of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an excurſion to ſee the funeral. He rather choſe to be abſent from that ceremony, than to leave the ſhips in ſo dangerous a ſituation. We plied to windward, between the two tides, till it was near high water, without either gaining or loſing an inch, when we ſuddenly got into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the eaſtern tide, where we expected the ebb to run ſtrong to the eaſtward in our favour. It proved, however, very inconſiderable. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we could not get to ſea before it was dark, we anchored under the ſhore of Tongataboo, in forty-five fathoms water. The Diſcovery drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped anchor under our ſtern; but drove off the bank before the anchor took hold, and did not recover it till about midnight.</p>
                     <p>After remaining in this ſtation till eleven o'clock the next day, we weighed, and plied to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. At ten o'clock at night we weathered the eaſt end of the iſland, and ſtretched away, for Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburg, or Eooa (as the inhabitants call it) where we anchored,, about eight the next morning, in forty fathoms water; being nearly the ſame place
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:030274_0318_0FE56D842A6610A0"/>
where the Captain took his ſtation in 1773, when he named it <hi>Engliſh Road.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as we had anchored, Taoofa the chief, and ſeveral of the natives viſited us on board, and ſeemed rejoiced at our arrival. This Taoofa had been Captain Cook's <hi>Tayo</hi> when he was here in 1773, and therefore they were not ſtrangers to each other. The Captain accompanied him on ſhore in ſearch of freſh water, the procuring of which was the chief object that brought him to Eooa. He had heard at Tongataboo of a ſtream here, which ran from the hills into the ſea; but this was not the caſe at preſent. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to a brackiſh ſpring, among rocks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween low and high water mark. When they perceived that we did not approve of this we were ſhewn a little way into the iſland; where, in a deep chaſm, we found ſome excellent water; which, though attended with ſome trouble, might be conveyed to the ſhore, by means of ſpouts or troughs, that might be provided for that purpoſe: but rather than undertake that tedious taſk, the Captain contented himſelf with the ſupply the ſhips had received at Tongataboo.</p>
                     <p>Before he returned on board, he began a traffic for hogs and yams. Of the former we could not procure many; but of the latter, plenty. At this iſland we landed the ram and two ewes, of the Cape of Good Hope breed, and committed them to the care of Taoofa, who ſeemed delighted
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:030274_0319_0FE56D8601189038"/>
with his charge. It was, perhaps, a fortunate circumſtance that Mareewagee, to whom they had been given, as before related, ſlighted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: as Eooa had no dogs upon it at preſent, it ſeemed to be a fitter place for the rearing of ſheep than Tongataboo.</p>
                     <p>While we were lying at anchor, this iſland had a very different aſpect from any that we had lately ſeen, and formed a moſt pleaſing landſcape. It is the higheſt of any we had ſeen ſince we had left New-Zealand, and from its top, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be almoſt flat, declines gradually towards the ſea. The other iſles, which form this cluſter, being level, the eye cannot diſcover any thing except the trees that cover them, but here the land, riſing gently upwards, preſents an extenſive proſpect, where groves of trees in beautiful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, are interſperſed at irregular diſtances. Near the ſhore, it is quite ſhaded with a variety of trees, among which are erected the habitations of the natives; and to the right of where we were ſtationed, was one of the moſt extenſive groves of cocoa-palms that we had ever ſeen.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon of the 13th, a party of us aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the higheſt part of the iſland, a little to the right of our ſhips, to have a perfect view of the country. Having advanced about half way up, we croſſed a deep valley, the bottom and ſides of which were clothed with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ees. We found plenty of coral till we approached the ſummits of
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:030274_0320_0FE56D8B59277BD0"/>
the higheſt hills; the ſoil near the top is, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, a reddiſh clay; which in many places, is very deep. On the moſt elevated part of the iſland we ſaw a round platform, ſupported by a wall of coral ſtones. Our conductors informed us that this mount had been raiſed by the direction of their chief; and that they met there, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, to drink <hi>kava.</hi> They called it <hi>Etchee;</hi> by which name an erection was diſtinguiſhed which we had ſeen at Tongataboo. At a ſmall diſtance from it was a ſpring of moſt excellent water; and, about a mile lower down, a ſtream, which, we were told, ran into the ſea when the rains were copious. We alſo diſcovered water in ſeveral ſmall holes; and ſuppoſed that plenty might be found by digging.</p>
                     <p>From this elevation we had a complete view of the whole iſland, except a ſmall part to the ſouth. The ſouth-eaſt ſide, from which the hills we were now upon are not far diſtant, riſes with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities, immediately from the ſea; ſo that the plains and meadows lie all on the north-weſt ſide; which being adorned with tufts of trees, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with plantations, form a moſt delightful landſcape in every point of view. While Captain Cook was ſurveying this enchanting proſpect, he enjoyed the pleaſing idea, that ſome future navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators might, from the ſame eminence, behold theſe meadows ſtocked with cattle, brought by the ſhips of England; and that the completion of this
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:030274_0321_0FE56DA1AE17B2A8"/>
ſingle benevolent purpoſe, excluſive of all other conſiderations, would ſufficiently prove that our voyages had not been uſeleſs. We found, on this height, beſides the plants common on the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring iſles, a ſpecies of <hi>acroſticum, melaſtoma,</hi> and fern-tree.</p>
                     <p>All, or moſt of the land on this iſland, we were told, belonged to the chiefs of Tongataboo; the inhabitants being only tenants, or vaſſals, to them. This ſeemed, indeed, to be the caſe at all the neighbouring iſles, except Annamooka, where ſome of the chiefs ſeemed to act with ſome kind of independence. Omai, who was much eſteemed by Feenou, and many others, was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the offer of being appointed a chief of this iſland, if he would continue among them; and he ſeemed inclinable to have accepted the offer, had he not been adviſed to the contrary by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook, though not becauſe he thought he would do better for himſelf in his native iſle.</p>
                     <p>Returning from our country excurſion, we heard that a party of the natives, in the quarter where our people traded, had ſtruck one of their own people with a club, which fractured his ſkull, and afterwards broke his thigh with the ſame inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No ſigns of life were remaining, when he was carried to a neighbouring houſe, but, in a ſhort time, he recovered a little. On our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to know the reaſon of ſuch ſeverity we were informed, that he had been diſcovered in an
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:030274_0322_0FE56DA334B73570"/>
indelicate ſituation with a woman who was <hi>taboo'd,</hi> we ſoon underſtood, however, that ſhe was no otherwiſe <hi>taboo'd</hi> than by belonging to another perſon, who was ſuperior in rank to her gallant. We diſcovered from this circumſtance, how theſe people puniſh ſuch infidelities. But the female ſinner, as we were informed, has a much milder puniſhment for her miſdemeanour, and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a remonſtrance and a very ſlight beating.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook, the next morning, planted a pine-apple, and ſowed the ſeeds of melons and other articles, in the chief's plantation. He had reaſon, indeed to ſuppoſe, that his endeavours of this kind would not be fruitleſs; for a diſh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Captain having fixed upon the 15th for ſailing, Taoofa preſſed him to ſtay a little longer, in order to receive a preſent which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him. His entreaties, together with the daily expectation of receiving a viſit from ſome of his friends at Tongataboo, induced him to defer his departure. The next day he received from the chief the preſent; conſiſting of two little heaps of yams, and a quantity of fruit, which ſeemed to be collected as at the other iſles. On this occaſion the greateſt part of the inhabitants of the iſland had aſſembled; and, as we had many times experienced on ſuch numerous meetings
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:030274_0323_0FE56DA4C4A846A8"/>
among their neighbouring iſlanders, gave us no ſmall trouble to prevent their pilfering. Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelling, wreſtling and boxing, were exhibited for our entertainment; and in the latter, comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, of both ſexes engaged. The diverſions were intended to have been finiſhed with the <hi>bomai</hi> or night-dance; but an accident happened that either put a total ſtop to it, or, at leaſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented our ſtaying on ſhore to ſee it. One of our people was ſurrounded by twenty or thirty of the natives, ſome of whom knocked him down, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him, and carried off all his clothes. Hearing of this, the Commodore ſeized two canoes, and a large hog; and inſiſted on the chief's not only cauſing the apparel to be reſtored, but alſo on the offenders being delivered up to him. Taoofa ſeemed greatly concerned at what had happened, and took the neceſſary ſteps to ſatisfy him. The people who were aſſembled were ſo alarmed at this affair, that moſt of them immediately fled. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when they were informed that the Captain meant to take no other meaſures to revenge the inſult, they returned. One of the delinquents was ſoon delivered up to him, and a ſhirt and at pair of trowſers reſtored. The remainder of the ſtolen goods not coming in before the evening, the Commodore was obliged to leave them, in order to go aboard; the ſea running ſo high, that it was extremely difficult for the boats to get out of the creek even with day-light, and would be
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:030274_0324_0FE56DA69B676950"/>
attended with much more danger in the dark. He came aſhore again the next morning, bringing with him a preſent for Taoofa, in return for what he had received from him. Being early, there were but few people at the landing-place, and even thoſe few not without their fears and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; but on the Captain's deſiring Omai to aſſure them, that we did not mean to injure them; and having reſtored the canoes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed the offender, who had been delivered up to him, they reſumed their uſual chearfulneſs, and a large circle was preſently formed, in which the chief and the principal men of the iſland took their reſpective places.</p>
                     <p>The remainder of the cloths were at length brought in, but, having been torn off the man's back by pieces, they were not thought worth carrying on board. Taoofa ſhared the preſent he had received, with three or four other chiefs, reſerving a ſmall part only for himſelf. This donation ſo far exceeded their expectation, that a venerable old chief told the Captain, they were not deſerving of it, conſidering how little he had received from them, and the ill treatment one of his people had met with. Captain Cook con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with them, till they had emptied their bowl of <hi>kava;</hi> and then, after paying for the hog, which he had taken the day before, returned on board, in company with Taoofa, and one of Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laho's ſervants, by whom he ſent a piece of bar
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:030274_0325_0FE56DAC67B920E0"/>
iron, as a parting mark of his eſteem for that chief, that being as valuable a preſent a any he could poſſibly make.</p>
                     <p>We weighed ſoon after and with a light breeze at ſouth-eaſt, ſtood out to ſea, when Taoofa, and ſome other natives, left us. We found, on heaving up the anchor, that the cable had been much injured by the rocks. Beſides this, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, that a moſt aſtoniſhing ſwell rolls in there from the ſouth-weſt. Preſently we obſerved a ſailing canoe entering the creek before which we had anchored our ſhips. A few hours after, a ſmall canoe, conducted by four men, came off to us: for, having but very little wind, we were ſtill at no conſiderable diſtance from the land. We were informed, by theſe men, that the ſailing canoe, which we had ſeen arrive, had brought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the people of Eooa, to furniſh us with hogs; and that the king, and other chiefs, would be with us in the ſpace of two or three days. They requeſted, therefore, that we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our former ſtation. There was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt the truth of this information; but being now clear of the land, it was not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inducement to bring us back: eſpecially, as we had, already, a ſufficient ſtock of freſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to laſt us in our paſſage to Otaheite. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Taoofa's preſent, we received a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of yams at Eooa, in exchange for nails, &amp;c. and added conſiderably to our ſupply of hogs.
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:030274_0326_0FE56DAE76349640"/>
Finding that we would not return, theſe people left us in the evening, as did ſome others who had come off in two canoes, with cocoa-nuts and ſhaddocks, to barter for what they could get; their eagerneſs to poſſeſs more of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, inducing them to follow us out to ſea, and to continue their intercouſe with us even to the laſt moment.</p>

                     <p>WE have now taken leave of the Friendly Iſlands, and their inhabitants, after a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial intercourſe with the latter for between two and three months. Some differences, indeed,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:030274_0327_0FE56DB05413F808"/>
occaſionally happened on account of their natural propenſity to thieving, though too frequently encouraged by the negligence and inattention of our people. Theſe differences, however, were never attended with any fatal conſequences; and few, belonging to our ſhips, parted from their friends without ſome regret. The time we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued here was not thrown away; and as we, in a great meaſure, ſubſiſted upon the produce of the iſlands, we expended very little of our ſea proviſions. We carried with us a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of refreſhments, to ſupply us till our arrival at another ſtation, where we could again recruit. The Commodore rejoiced at having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſerving theſe poor people by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome uſeful animals among them; and that thoſe intended for Otaheite, had acquired freſh ſtrength in the paſtures of Tongataboo. The advantages we received by touching here, were great, and they were received without retarding the proſecution of our great object; the ſeaſon for proceeding to the north being loſt, before we formed the reſolution of viſiting theſe iſlands.</p>
                     <p>Iron tools are the beſt articles for traffic here. Axes, hatchets, nails of all ſizes, knives, raſps, and files, are much demanded. Red cloth, white and coloured linen; looking-glaſſes and beads, are alſo in great eſtimation; but, of the latter, thoſe which are blue are preferred to all others eſpecially the white ones. A hog might, at any
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:030274_0328_0FE56DB1DB875530"/>
time, be purchaſed, by a ſtring of large blue beads; it ſhould, nevertheleſs, be obſerved, that articles, merely ornamental, may be highly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed at one time, and diſregarded at another. On our firſt arrival at Annamooka, the people were unwilling to take them in exchange for fruit; but when Feenou arrived, his approbation of them brought them into vogue, and ſtamped them with the value above-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>In return for the commodities juſt enumerated, all the refreſhments that the iſlands produce may be procured. The yams, produced by the Friendly Iſlands, are excellent, and, when grown to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, preſerve well at ſea: but their pork, plantains, and bread-fruit, are inferior in quality to the ſame articles at Otaheite.</p>
                     <p>Good water is ſcarce in theſe iſlands. It may be found, indeed, in all of them, but not to ſerve the purpoſes of navigators; for either the ſituations are too inconvenient, or the quantities too inconſiderable. Whilſt we lay at anchor under Kotoo, we were informed, that there was a ſtream of water at Kao, which ran from the mountains into the ſea, on the ſouth-weſt ſide of the iſland. This intelligence may probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the attention of future navigators.</p>
                     <p>We muſt include, under the denomination of Friendly Iſlands, not only the group at Hapaee, but alſo thoſe which have been diſcovered to the north, nearly under the ſame meridian, as well as
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:030274_0329_0FE56DB622611620"/>
ſome others under the dominion of Tongataboo which is the capital, and ſeat of government.</p>
                     <p>From the beſt information we could receive, this archipelago is very extenſive. One of the natives enumerated one hundred and fifty iſlands: and Mr. Anderſon procured all their names. Sixty-one of them are marked upon our chart of the Friendly Iſlands, and upon the ſketch of the harbour of Tongataboo. Keppel's and Boſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen's Iſlands, two of Captain Wallis's diſcoveries in 1765, are doubtleſs comprehended in Mr. Anderſon's liſt.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt conſiderable iſlands that we heard of in this neighbourhood, are Hamoa, Vavaoo, and Feejee; each of which is larger than Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gataboo; but it does not appear that any Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean has ever yet ſeen any one of them.</p>
                     <p>Hamoa lies two days ſail north-weſt from Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaoo. It is ſaid to be the largeſt of all their iſlands; affords harbours and good water, and produces, in abundance, all the articles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment that are found at the places we viſited. Poulaho frequently reſides upon this iſland; and the people here are in high eſtimation at Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gataboo.</p>
                     <p>Feejee lies in the direction of north-weſt by weſt, about three days ſail from Tongataboo. It abounds with hogs; dogs, fowls, and ſuch fruits and roots as are to be found in any of the others and is much larger that Tongataboo; but not
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:030274_0330_0FE56DB8875B9350"/>
ſubjec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> its dominion, as the other iſlands of this archipelago are. Feejee and Tongataboo often engage in war againſt each other; and the inhabitants of the latter are often ſo much afraid of this enemy, that they bend the body forward, and cover the face with their hands, to expreſs the ſenſe of their own inferiority to the Feejee men. This is, indeed, no matter of ſurpriſe, for thoſe of Feejee have rendered themſelves formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by their dexterity in the uſe of bows and ſlings; but more ſo, by their ſavage practice of eating ſuch of their enemies as they kill in battle.</p>
                     <p>It has been inſiſted on, that extreme hunger firſt occaſioned men to feed on human fleſh; but where could be the inducement for the Feejee people to continue the practice in the midſt of plenty? It is held in deteſtation by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Tongataboo, who ſeem to cultivate the friendſhip of their ſavage neighbours of Feejee through fear; though they, occaſionally, venture to ſkirmiſh with them on their own territory, and carry off large quantities of red feathers as tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies. When a profound peace reigns between the two iſlands, they have frequent intercourſe together; though, it is probable they have not long been known to each other; or, it might be ſuppoſed that Tongataboo, and its neighbouring iſlands, would, before this time, have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with a breed of dogs, which are numerous
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:030274_0331_0FE56DBA0D8D44D0"/>
at Feejee, and were not introduced at Tongata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boo, when Captain Cook firſt viſited it, in 1773.</p>
                     <p>The colour of the natives of Feejee was, at leaſt, a ſhade darker than that of the inhabitants of the other Friendly Iſlands. We ſaw one of the natives of Feejee, who had his left ear ſlit, and the lobe ſo ſtretched, that it almoſt extended to his ſhoulder; which ſingularity had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Captain Cook at other iſlands of the South Sea, during his ſecond voyage. The Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jee men were much reverenced here; not only on account of their power and cruelty in war, but alſo for their ingenuity; for they greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the inhabitants of Tongataboo in workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Specimens were ſhewn us of their clubs and ſpears, which were ingeniouſly carved. We were alſo ſhewn ſome of their beautifully che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered cloth, variegated mats, earthen pots, and other articles, all of which diſplayed ſuperiority in the execution.</p>
                     <p>Feejee, as has been already mentioned, is three days ſail from Tongataboo; theſe people having no other method of diſcovering the diſtance from iſland to iſland, but by mentioning the time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the voyage in one of their canoes. That this might be aſcertained with ſome preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Captain Cook ſailed in one of their canoes, and by repeated trials with the log, found that ſhe went cloſe hauled in a gentle gale, ſeven miles in an hour. He ſuppoſed from this that
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:030274_0332_0FE56DBC0405B960"/>
they will ſail, with ſuch breezes as in general blow in their ſeas ſeven or eight miles an hour on an average. Each day, however, is not to be reckoned at twenty-four hours; for when they talk of one days ſail, they mean no more than from the morning to the evening, or ten or twelve hours at the moſt. From the morning of the firſt day till the evening of the ſecond, is, with them, two days ſail. In the day, they are guided by the ſun; and, in the night, by ſtars. When theſe are obſcured, they can only have recourſe to the points from whence the winds and waves come upon the veſſel. If, at that time the winds and the waves ſhould ſhift they are quit bewildered, often miſſing their intended port, and being never heard of more. The ſtory of Omai's countrymen, who where driven to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeoo, convinces us however, that thoſe who are not heard of, are not always loſt.</p>
                     <p>The harbour and anchoring-place of Tonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taboo, is ſuperior to any we have met with among theſe iſlands, as well from its great ſecurity, as its capacity, and goodneſs of bottom. The riſk we ran in entering it from the north, ſhould cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every future commander from attempting that paſſage again, eſpecially with a ſhip of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſince that, by which we left it, may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with greater eaſe and ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Though the harbour of Tongataboo has the preference, its water is exceeded in goodneſs, by
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:030274_0333_0FE56DC3915B15B0"/>
that at Annamocka, and yet this cannot be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned good. Tolerable water may nevertheleſs, be procured, by digging holes near the ſide of the pond. Beſides, Annamooka being nearly in the centre of the group, is the beſt ſituated for procuring refreſhments from the others. There is a creek in the reef on the north ſide of the iſlands, wherein two or three ſhips may lie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are deſirous of having a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſcription of the Friendly Iſlands, muſt have recourſe to the chart, where every thing is delineated as accurately as circumſtances would permit. To the ſame chart, recourſe may alſo be had for tracing the ſeveral ſtations of the ſhips, and their route.</p>
                     <p>What may have been here omitted; concerning the geography of theſe iſlands, will be found in the hiſtory of Captain Cook's laſt voyage <note n="*" place="bottom">Cook's Voyage, Vol. I p. 211.213.</note>; to which narrative the reader is referred <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 213.225.</note>, for ſuch particulars as he had then obſerved. At preſent, we ſhall only relate ſuch intereſting circumſtances, as either were omitted in that account, or were imperfectly and incorrectly repreſented.</p>
                     <p>After living among them between two and three months, it is reaſonable to expect, that we ſhould be able to clear up every difficulty, and to give a tolerably good account of their manners, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:030274_0334_0FE56DC56FC25568"/>
and inſtitutions, civil as well as religious; particularly as we had a perſon with us, who, by underſtanding their language as well as ours, might be enabled to act as an interpreter. But Omai was not qualified for that taſk. Unleſs we had before us the object or thing, concerning which we wanted information, we found it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to obtain a competent knowledge from his explanations. Omai was certainly more liable to make miſtakes than we were: for having no curioſity, he never troubled himſelf with mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remarks; and when he attempted to explain matters to us, his ideas were apparently ſo limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and, probably, differed ſo much from ours, that his confuſed accounts, inſtead of inſtructing, often only perplexed us. Beſides, we could ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom find a perſon, among the natives, who had both the ability and inclination to give us the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation we required. And many of them, we obſerved, appeared offended at being aſked, what they, perhaps, deemed frivolous queſtions. At Tongataboo, where we continued the longeſt, our ſituation was likewiſe unfavourable; being in a part of the country, where, except fiſhers, there were but few inhabitants. With our viſitors, as well as thoſe we viſited, it was always holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; ſo that we could not obſerve, what was really the domeſtic way of living among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. That we could not, therefore, in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, bring away ſatisfactory accounts of many
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:030274_0335_0FE56DC6F6AD7B78"/>
things, is not the leaſt ſurpriſing. Some of us, indeed, endeavoured by diligent obſervation, to remedy thoſe diſadvantages; and we are indebted to Mr. Anderſon, for a conſiderable ſhare of what is related in this and the following chapter.</p>
                     <p>The friendly iſlanders ſeldom exceed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtature, (though ſome here were above ſix feet in height) and are ſtrong and well proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. Their ſhoulders are, in general, broad; and we ſaw ſeveral who were really handſome, though their muſcular diſpoſition rather conveyed the idea of ſtrength than of beauty. Their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſo various, that, unleſs it be a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the point of the noſe, which is common it is impoſſible to fix any general likeneſs by which to characterize them. On the other hand many genuine Roman noſes, and hundreds of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean faces, were ſeen amongſt them. They have good eyes and teeth; but the latter are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo well ſet, nor ſo remarkably white, as among the Indian nations. Few of them, however have that uncommon thickneſs about the lips, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in other iſlands.</p>
                     <p>The women are leſs diſtinguiſhed from the men by their features, than by their general form, which ſeems deſtitute of that ſtrong fleſhly firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that appears in the latter. Though the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſome are very delicate, and a true index of their ſex, laying claim to a conſiderable ſhare of beauty and expreſſion, yet the rule is not, by
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:030274_0336_0FE56DC8828700D0"/>
any means, ſo general, as in many other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. This is generally, however, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable part; for the bodies of moſt of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males are uſually well proportioned; and ſome are abſolutely perfect models, of a beautiful figure. But the extraordinary ſmallneſs and delicacy of their fingers, which may be put into competition with any in Europe, ſeems to be the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtinction in the women.</p>
                     <p>The general colour among the natives is a caſt deeper than the copper brown; but ſeveral of both ſexes, have a true olive complexion. Some of the women are even much fairer; owing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to their being leſs expoſed to the ſun; as a tendency to corpulence, in ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal people, ſeems to be the natural conſequence of a more indolent life: a ſofter and clearer ſkin is almoſt frequently obſerved among the latter. Among the major part of the people, the ſkin is generally of a dull hue, with ſome degree of roughneſs, particularly the parts that are unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, occaſioned, perhaps, by ſome cutaneous diſeaſe. We ſaw a man at Hapaee, perfectly white, and a child equally ſo at Annamooka. In all black nations, ſuch phenomena are found, but their colour, it is imagined, proceeds from a diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, however, few natural defects or deformities are to be ſeen among them; though we obſerved two or three with their feet bent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:030274_0337_0FE56DCD76911DC0"/>
Neither are they exempt from ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Vaſt numbers of them are effected with the tetter or ringworm, which leaves whitiſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine marks behind it. But they have another diſeaſe of a more miſchievous conſequence, which is alſo very frequent, and appears on every part of the body, in large broad ulcers, diſcharging a thin, clear pus, ſome of which had a very viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent appearance, particularly on the face. Some, however, appeared to be cured of it, and others mending; but it was generally attended with the loſs of the noſe, or a conſiderable part of it. It being certainly known, and even acknowledged by themſelves, that the natives were ſubject to this diſeaſe before they were viſited by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, it cannot be the effect of venereal contagion, notwithſtanding the ſimilarity of the ſymptoms; unleſs we adopt the ſuppoſition, that the venereal diſorder was not introduced here by our people, in 1773. It certainly was amongſt them at this time; for, ſoon after we arrived there, ſome of our people received the infection; and Captain Cook had the mortification to learn from hence, that all the care he took in 1773, to prevent the communication of this dreadful diſeaſe, had prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ineffectual. They do not ſeem, however, to regard it much; and, as we did not ſee many inſtances of its deſtroying effects, perhaps the climate, and the way of living of theſe people, may abate its virulence. Two other diſeaſes are
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:030274_0338_0FE56DD09E8ACD48"/>
common amongſt them; one of which is a firm ſwelling, which effects the legs and arms, the other is a tumour in the teſtacles, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exceed the ſize of the two fiſts. In other reſpects, they are remarkably healthy, not a ſingle perſon having, during our ſtay, being confined to the houſe by any kind of ſickneſs. Their ſtrength and activity are, in every reſpect, anſwerable to their muſcular appearance; and they exert both, in ſuch a manner, as to prove, that they are, as yet, little debilitated by the numerous diſeaſes that are the natural conſequences of indolence.</p>
                     <p>The graceful mien and firmneſs of ſtep with which they walk, are obvious proofs of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal accompliſhments. They conſider this as a thing ſo neceſſary to be acquired, that their laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was excited when they ſaw us frequently ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling upon the roots of trees, or other inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in walking.</p>
                     <p>The mildneſs or good-nature which they abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly poſſeſs, is depicted on their countenance, which are totally free from that ſavage keenneſs, which always marks the nations that are in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſtate. We might almoſt be induced to ſuppoſe, that they had been reared under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt reſtrictions, to acquire ſo ſettled an aſpect, ſuch a command of their paſſions, and ſuch a ſteadineſs of conduct. At the ſame time, they are open, chearful, and good-humoured; though, in the preſence of their chiefs, they ſometimes
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:030274_0339_0FE56DD226625EC8"/>
aſſume a degree of gravity, which has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reſerve.</p>
                     <p>Their pacific diſpoſition is thoroughly evinced, from their friendly reception of all ſtrangers. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of attacking them openly,, or clandeſtinely, they have never appeared, in the ſmalleſt degree, hoſtile; but, like the moſt civilized nations, have even courted an intercourſe with their viſitors, by bartering; a medium which unites all nations in a degree of friendſhip. So perfectly do they underſtand barter, that, at firſt we ſuppoſed they had acquired the knowledge of it by trading with the neighbouring iſlands; but it afterwards appeared, that they had hardly any traffic, except with Feejee. No nation, perhaps, in the world, diſplayed, in their traffic, more honeſty and leſs diſtruſt. We ſafely permitted them to examine our goods, and they had the ſame implicit confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in us. If either party became diſſatisfied with his bargain, a re-exchange was made with mutual conſent and ſatisfaction. They ſeem, upon the whole, to poſſeſs many of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent qualities that adorn the human mind.</p>
                     <p>A propenſity to thieving, ſeems to be the only defect to ſully their fair character. Thoſe of all ages, and both ſexes, were addicted to it in an uncommon degree. It ſhould be conſidered, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that this exceptionable part of their conduct exiſted merely with reſpect to us; for, in their general intercourſe with each other, thefts are
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:030274_0340_0FE56DD41267BF08"/>
not, perhaps, more frequent than in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where the diſhoneſt practices of individuals ſhould not authorize any indiſcriminate cenſure on the people at large. Allowances ſhould be made for the foibles of theſe poor iſlanders, whoſe minds we overpowered with the glare of new and captivating objects. Stealing, among civilized nations, denotes a character deeply ſtained with moral turpitude. But at the Friendly Iſlands, and others which we viſited, the thefts committed by the natives, may have been occaſioned by leſs culpable motives. They were ſtimulated ſolely by curioſity and deſire to poſſeſs ſomething new, and the property of a ſort of people ſo different from themſelves. And, perhaps, if a ſet of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſeemingly as ſuperior to us, as we appear to be to them, ſhould make their appearance among us, it might be poſſible that our natural regard to juſtice would not be able to reſtrain many from being guilty of the ſame error. That this is the true motive for their propenſity to this practice, is evident from their ſtealing every thing indiſcriminately. The thieving diſpoſition of theſe iſlanders, was the means, however, of affording us ſome information as to their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and their quickneſs of intellects. For their petty thefts were managed with much dexterity; and thoſe of greater conſequence, with a ſettled plan or ſcheme, adapted to the importance of the objects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="282" facs="unknown:030274_0341_0FE56DD9A3F60248"/>The hair of theſe iſlanders is in general, thick, ſtraight, and ſtrong; though ſome have it buſhy or frizzled. The natural colour appears to be black, but many of the men, and ſome of the women, ſtain it of a brown, or purple colour; and a few give it an orange caſt. The firſt of theſe colours is produced by applying a ſort of plaiſter of burnt coral mixed with water; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the raſpings of a reddiſh wood, mixed into a poultice, and laid over the hair; and the third is ſaid to be the effect of <hi>turmeric root.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are ſo whimſical in their faſhions of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hair, that it is difficult to ſay which is moſt in vogue. Some have none on one ſide of the head, while it remains long on the other ſide; ſome have only a part cut ſhort, others have parted with the whole, except a ſingle lock on one ſide. Some permit it to grown to its full length, without any of theſe mutilations. The women uſually wear it ſhort. The beards too are cut ſhort, and both ſexes ſtrip the hair from their arm-pits. The men are ſtained with a deep blue colour from the middle of the belly, to half way down the thighs. This is effected with a flat bone inſtrument, full of fine teeth, which by a ſtroke of a bit of ſtick introduce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="283" facs="unknown:030274_0342_0FE56DDB2A5BA0C0"/>
in the inſide of their hands. As a mark of diſtinction, their kings are excepted from this cuſtom. The men are not circumciſed, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperciſed; the operation conſiſts in cutting off only a piece of the foreſkin in the upper part, which is thus rendered incapable of ever cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>glans.</hi> They have no other aim in this operation, and only practiſe it from a notion of cleanlineſs.</p>
                     <p>The dreſs of both ſexes is the ſame; conſiſting of a piece of cloth or matting, about two yards in breadth, and two yards and a half in length. It is double before, and, like a petticoat, hangs down to the middle of the leg. That part of the garment which is above the girdle, is plaited into ſeveral folds, which extended is ſufficient to draw up and wrap round the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. This as to form, is the general dreſs: but the fine matting, and long pieces of cloth, are worn only by the ſuperior claſs of people. The inferior ſort are contented with ſmall pieces and very often, have only a covering made of leaves of plants, or the <hi>maro,</hi> a narrow piece of cloth, or matting, like a ſaſh. They paſs this between the thighs and round the waiſt. It is ſeldom uſed but by the men. In their <hi>haivas,</hi> or grand entertainments, they have various dreſſes, which, though the ſame in form, are embelliſhed, more or leſs, with red feathers.</p>

                     <p>The ornaments, worn by thoſe of either ſex, are the ſame. Thoſe which are moſt common are necklaces, made of the fruit of the <hi>pandanus,</hi> and various ſweet-ſmelling flowers, known by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral name of <hi>kabulla.</hi> Others conſiſt of ſmall ſhells, ſhark's teeth, the wing and leg-bones of birds, &amp;c. all which are pendant upon the breaſt.

This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a fine powder of <hi>turmeric,</hi> which the women rub all over their bodies, in the ſame manner as the European ladies uſe their dry rouge upon their cheeks.</p>
                     <p>Perſonal cleanlineſs is their delight, to produce which, they bathe frequently in the ponds. Though the water has an intolerable ſtench in moſt of them, they always prefer them to the ſea; and they are ſo ſenſible that their ſkin is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juried with ſalt water, that, when they are obliged
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:030274_0344_0FE56DDE9B106BC8"/>
to bathe in the ſea, they have freſh water poured over them to waſh off its bad effects. They are extravagantly fond of cocoa-nut oil; a great quantity of which they pour upon their head and ſhoulders, and rub the body all over with a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler quantity.</p>

                     <p>THE domeſtic life of theſe people is neither ſo laborious as to be diſagreeable, nor ſo free from employment as to ſuffer them to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:030274_0345_0FE56DE3E1F183A0"/>
into indolence. Their country has been ſo favoured by nature, that the firſt can ſcarcely occur; and their diſpoſition appears to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient bar to the laſt. By this fortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of circumſtances, their neceſſary labour ſeems to yield, in its turn, to their amuſements and recreations, which are never interrupted by the thoughts of being obliged to recur to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, till they are induced by ſatiety to wiſh for that tranſition. The employments of the women is not difficult: and is generally ſuch as they can execute in the houſe. The making of cloth is entirely entruſted to their care; the proceſs of which manufacture has been already deſcribed. Their cloth is of different degrees of fineneſs: the coarſer kind does not receive the impreſſion of any pattern: but, of the finer ſort, they have various patterns, differently coloured. The cloth, in general, is able to reſiſt water for ſome time; but that which has the ſtrongeſt glaze, is the leaſt liable to be penetrated by that fluid.</p>
                     <p>Another manufacture which is alſo conſigned to the women, is that of their mats, which excel thoſe of moſt other countries, both with reſpect to their texture and their beauty. Of theſe mats there are ſeven or eight different ſorts, which they either wear or ſleep upon; and many are merely ornamental. The laſt are principally made from the rough, membraneous part of the ſtock of the plantain-tree; thoſe that they wear, are generally
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:030274_0346_0FE56CF67A1EF7A0"/>
compoſed of the <hi>pandanus</hi>; and the coarſer kind, on which they ſleep, are formed from a plant called <hi>evarra.</hi> There are ſeveral other articles of leſs importance, that employ their females; as combs, of which they make great quantities; and ſmall baſkets made of the ſame ſubſtance as the mats, and others compoſed of the fibrous huſk of the cocoa-nut, either interwoven with beads, or plain; all which are finiſhed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary neatneſs and taſte.</p>
                     <p>The province of the men is, as might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be expected, far more laborious and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than that of the other ſex. Architecture, boat-building, agriculture, and fiſhing, are the principal objects of their care. As cultivated roots and fruits form their chief ſubſiſtence, they find it neceſſary to practiſe huſbandry, which they have brought by their diligence to ſome degree of perfection. In planting yams and plantains they dig ſmall holes for their reception, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards root up the ſurrounding graſs. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments uſed by them for this purpoſe, are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>hooo;</hi> and are nothing more than ſtakes of various lengths, flattened and ſharpened to an edge at one end; and the largeſt ones have a ſhort piece fixed tranſverſely, by means of which they preſs the implement into the ground with the foot. When they plant the two above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned vegetables, they obſerve ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar exactneſs, that, whichever way you turn your
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:030274_0347_0FE56DE7A689D840"/>
eyes, the rows preſent themſelves complete and regular.</p>
                     <p>The bread-fruit and cocoa-nut-trees are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed about, without any order; and when they have arrived at a certain height, give them little or no trouble. The ſame may be ſaid of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large tree, which produces a roundiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed nut, called <hi>ecefee</hi>; and of a ſmaller tree being an oval nut, with two or three triangular kernels. The <hi>kappe</hi> is in general, planted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly and in large ſpots but the <hi>mawhaha</hi> is interſperſed among other things, as are alſo the yams and <hi>jeejee.</hi> Sugar-cane is uſually in ſmall ſpots, cloſely crowded. The mulberry, of which the cloth is made, is kept very clean, and has a good ſpace allowed for it. The <hi>pandanus</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly planted in a row, cloſe together, at the ſides of the fields.</p>
                     <p>They diſplay very little taſte or ingenuity in the conſtruction of their houſes. Thoſe of the lower claſs of people are wretched huts, ſcarce ſufficient to ſhelter them from the weather. Thoſe of the better ſort are larger, as well as more commodious and comfortable. A houſe of a middling ſize is of following dimenſions, viz, about twelve in height, twenty in breadth, and thirty in length. Their houſes are, properly ſpeaking, thatched roofs or ſheds, ſupported by rafters and poſts. The floor is raiſed with earth ſmoothed, and covered with thick matting. Some
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:030274_0348_0FE56DE9AD51BEE0"/>
of their habitations are open all round: but the major part of them are encloſed on the weather ſide with ſtrong mats, or with branches of the cocoa-nut tree, plated or interwoven with each other. A thick mat, about three feet broad, bent into a ſemicircular form, and placed edgeways, with the ends touching the ſide of the houſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſes a ſufficient ſpace for the maſter and miſtreſs to ſleep in. The reſt of the family ſleep upon any part of the floor, the unmarried men and women lying apart from each other. If the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is large, there are little huts adjoining, in which the ſervants ſleep. Their whole furniture conſiſts of ſome wooden ſtools, which ſerve them for pillows; baſkets of different ſizes, in which they put their combs, fiſh-hooks, and tools; two or three wooden bowls, in which they make <hi>kava;</hi> ſome cocoa-nut ſhells, a few gourds, and a bundle or two of cloth.</p>
                     <p>They are very ſkillful in building their canoes which, indeed, are the moſt perfect of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical productions. The double ones are made ſufficiently large to carry about fifty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſail at a great rate. Upon them they generally fix a hut or ſhed, for the reception of the maſter and his family. They are made of the bread-fruit tree, and the workmanſhip is extremely neat. They appear on the outſide as if they where compoſed of one ſolid piece; but, upon cloſe inſpection, they are found to conſiſt
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:030274_0349_0FE56DEDC8C911B8"/>
of a great number of pieces, which fit each other exactly, and by means of a ledge on the inſide are ſecured together with cocoa-nut line. The ſingle canoes are furniſhed with an outrigger. The only tools which they make uſe of in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of theſe boats, are hatchets, or adzes, of a ſmooth black ſtone; augers, made of ſhirk's teeth; and raſps, compoſed of the rough ſkin of a fiſh, faſtened on flat pieces of wood. The ſame tools are all they have for other works, except ſhells, which ſerve them for knives. Their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is made of the fibres of the cocoa-nut huſk, which; though not above ten inches long, they plait about the ſize of a quill, to whatever length is required, and roll it up in balls; from which the ropes of a larger ſize are made, by twiſting ſeveral of thoſe together. Their fiſhing-lines are as ſtrong and even as our beſt cord. Their ſmall hooks conſiſt entirely of pearl-ſhell; but the large ones are only covered with it on the back; and the points of both are, in general, of tortoiſe-ſhell. With the large hooks they catch albicores, and bonnetos, by putting them to a bamboo-rod, about twelve feet long, with a line of the ſame length. They have alſo numbers of ſmall ſeines, ſome of which are of the moſt delicate texture.</p>
                     <p>Their muſical reeds or pipes, which reſemble the <hi>ſyrinx</hi> of the ancients, have eight or ten pieces placed parallel to each other, moſt of which are
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:030274_0350_0FE56DEFEE756308"/>
of unequal lengths. Their flutes are made of a joint of bamboo, about eighteen inches long, and are cloſed at both ends, having a hole near each end, and four others; two of which, and only one of the firſt, are uſed by them in playing. They cloſe the left noſtril with the thumb of the left-hand, and blow into the hole at one end with the other noſtril. The fore-finger of the right-hand is applied to the loweſt hole on the right, and the middle finger of the left, to the firſt hole on that ſide. In this manner, with only three notes, they produce a pleaſing, though ſimple, muſic. Their <hi>naffa,</hi> or drum, has been already deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Their warlike weapons are clubs, curiouſly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented, ſpears, and darts. They alſo make bows and arrows; but theſe are intended for amuſement, ſuch as ſhooting at birds, and not for the purpoſes of war. Their ſtools, or rather pillows, are about two feet long, but only four or five inches in height, and near four in breadth, inclining downwards towards the middle, with four ſtrong legs and circular feet; the whole compoſed of brown or black wood, neatly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and ſometimes inlaid with ivory. They likewiſe inlay with ivory the handles of fly-flaps and, with a ſhark's tooth, ſhape bones into figures of men, birds. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Their vegetable diet principally conſiſts of plantains, cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and yams.
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:030274_0351_0FE56DF1C869E288"/>
Their chief articles of animal food are hogs, fiſh, and fowls; but the common people frequently eat rats. The hogs, fowls, and turtle, however, ſeem to be only occaſional dainties, reſerved for perſons of rank. Their food is, in general, dreſſed by baking, as at Otaheite; and they make, from different ſorts of fruit, ſeveral diſhes, which are very good. They ſometimes boil their fiſh in the green leaves of the plantain-tree, which ſerve as a bay to hold both fiſh and water: having tied them up, they wrap them again in three or four other leaves, and place them upon ſtones heated for the purpoſe: when they are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, they not only eat the fiſh, but drink the liquor or ſoup. They are not very cleanly either in their cookery, or their manner of eating. Their uſual drink at their meals is water, or cocoa-nut milk, the <hi>kava</hi> being only their morning beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The food that is ſerved up to the chiefs, is generally laid upon plantain-leaves. The king, at his meals, was commonly attended upon by three or four of the natives, one of whom cut large pieces of the fiſh, or of the joint, another afterwards divided it into mouthfuls, and the reſt ſtood by with cocoa-nuts, and whatever elſe he might happen to want. We never obſerved a large company ſit down to a ſociable meal, by eating from the ſame diſh. The women are not excluded from taking their meals with the men; but there are certain ranks that are not allowed
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:030274_0352_0FE56DF34FD74C40"/>
either to eat or drink together. This diſtinction begins with his majeſty, but we know not where it ends.</p>
                     <p>They riſe at day-break, and retire to reſt as ſoon as it becomes dark. They, for the moſt part, ſleep alſo in the day time, when the weather is very hot. They are fond of aſſociating together; in conſequence of which, it is not uncommon to find ſeveral houſes empty, and the poſſeſſors of them aſſembled in ſome other houſe, or upon ſome convenient ſpot in the neighbourhood, where they relax themſelves by converſation and other amuſements. Their private diverſions chiefly conſiſt of dancing, ſinging, and muſic. When two or three women ſnap their fingers, and ſing in concert, it is called <hi>oobai;</hi> but when there are more, they form ſeveral parties, each of which ſings in a different key, which conſtitutes an agreeable melody, and is termed <hi>heeva</hi> or <hi>haiva.</hi> The ſongs are generally accompanied with the muſic of their flutes. The dances both of the men and women, are performed with an eaſe and grace which are difficult to be deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>We could not determine with preciſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their marriages were rendered durable by any kind of ſolemn contract: it is certain, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the major part of the people contented themſelves with one wife. The chiefs, indeed, commonly have ſeveral women, though there was only one who (as we thought) was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:030274_0353_0FE56DF7E5413B40"/>
in the light of miſtreſs of the family. Though female chaſtity ſeemed to beheld in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſtimation, not a ſingle breach of conjugal fidelity happened, to our knowledge, during our whole continuance at theſe iſlands; nor were the unmarried women of rank more liberal of their favours. But there were great numbers of a very different character.</p>
                     <p>The concern ſhewn by theſe iſlanders for the dead, is a ſtrong proof of their humanity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>tooge,</hi> which we have mentioned before, and burnt circles and ſcars, they ſtrike a ſhark's tooth into their heads till the blood flows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably, beat their teeth with ſtones, and thruſt ſpears not only through their cheeks into their mouths, but alſo into the inner part of their thighs, and into their ſides. The more painful operations, however, are only practiſed when they mourn the death of thoſe who were moſt nearly connected with them. When one of them dies, he is wrapped up in mats and cloth, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred. The <hi>ſiatookas</hi> ſeem to be appropriated to the chiefs and other perſons of diſtinction, as their burial-places; but the inferior people have no particular ſpot ſet apart for their interment. It is uncertain what part of the mourning ceremony follows immediately afterwards; but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides the general one which is continued for a conſiderable time, the funeral of Mareewagee's wife being attended with ceremonies of five days duration. They ſeem to conſider death as a great
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:030274_0354_0FE56DFA0CC7E190"/>
evil, to avert which they practiſe a very ſingular cuſtom. When Captain Cook, during his ſecond voyage, firſt viſited theſe iſlands, he obſerved that many of the natives had one on both of their little fingers cut off; of the reaſon of which mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation he could not then obtain a ſatisfactory account. But he was now informed, that they perform this operation when they are afflicted with ſome dangerous diſorder, which they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine may bring them to the grave. They ſuppoſe that the little finger will be accepted of by the Deity, as a kind of propitiatory ſacrifice ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently efficacious to procure their recovery. In cutting it off, they make uſe of a ſtone-hatchet. There was ſcarcely one perſon in ten who was not thus mutilated; and they ſometimes cut ſo cloſe, as to encroach upon that bone of the hand which joins the amputated finger. It is alſo common for the lower claſs of people to cut off a joint of their little finger, on account of the ſickneſs of the chiefs to whom they reſpectively belong.</p>
                     <p>When the rigid ſtrictneſs with which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their mourning and religious ceremonies is conſidered, it might be expected, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured thereby to ſecure to themſelves eternal happineſs: but their principal object regards things merely temporal; for they have apparently little conception of future puniſhment for ſins committed in the preſent life. They believe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:030274_0355_0FE56DFD87F15728"/>
that they meet with juſt puniſhment upon earth; and, therefore, put every method in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to render their divinities propitious. They admit a plurality of deities, all of them inferior to <hi>Kallafootonga,</hi> who they ſay is a female, and the ſupreme author of moſt things, reſiding in the heavens, and directing the wind, rain, thunder, &amp;c. They are of opinion, that when ſhe is much diſpleaſed with them, the productions of the earth are blaſted, many things conſumed by lightning, and themſelves afflicted with ſickneſs and death; but that when her anger abates, every thing is immediately reſtored to its former ſtate. Among their ſurbordinate deities, they mention <hi>Futtafaihe,</hi> or <hi>Footaſooa,</hi> who has the adminiſtration of the ſea, and its productions; <hi>Toofooa-boolootoo,</hi> god of the clouds and fog; <hi>Talloteboo, Mattaba, Tareeava,</hi> and others. The ſame ſyſtem of religion does not extend all over the Friendly Iſlands; the ſupreme deity of Hapaee, for inſtance, being called <hi>Alo Alo.</hi> They entertain very abſurd opinions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the power and various attributes of theſe beings, who, they ſuppoſe, have no further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with them after death. They have, however, juſter ſentiments reſpecting the immortality and immateriality of the ſoul; which they call life the living principle, or an <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ooa,</hi> that is, a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. They imagine that, immediately after death, the ſouls of their chiefs are ſeparated from their bodies, and go to a delightful region called
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:030274_0356_0FE56E0977216358"/>
                        <hi>Boolootoo,</hi> the god of which is named <hi>Gooleho.</hi> By this <hi>Gooleho</hi> they probably perſonify death. His country, according to their mythology, is the general repoſitory of the dead; and thoſe who are once conveyed thither, are no more ſubject to death, but feaſt on all the favourite productions of their native ſoil, with which this bliſsful abode is plentifully furniſhed. As for the ſouls of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of an inferior claſs, they are ſuppoſed by them to ſuffer a kind of tranſmigration; or are eaten up (they ſay) by a bird called <hi>loata,</hi> which walks upon the graves with that intent.</p>
                     <p>They do nor worſhip any viſible part of the creation, or any thing made by their own hands. They make no offerings of dogs, hogs, and fruit (as is the cuſtom at Otaheite) unleſs emblamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. But there ſeems to be no reaſon to doubt of their offering up human ſacrifices. Their <hi>fia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tookas,</hi> or <hi>morais,</hi> are, in general, burying-grounds and places of worſhip: ſome of them, however, appeared to be appropriated only to the former purpoſe; but theſe were ſmall and greatly inferior to the reſt.</p>
                     <p>We are very little acquainted with their form of government. A ſubordination, reſembling the feudal ſyſtem of our anceſtors in Europe, is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed among them; but of its ſubdiviſions, and the conſtituent parts we are ignorant. Though ſome of them informed us, that the king's power is unbounded, and that he has the abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:030274_0357_0FE56E0B3781F218"/>
of the lives and properties of his ſubjects; yet the few circumſtances that offered themſelves to our obſervation, contradicted, rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, the idea of deſpotic ſway. Mareewagee, Feenou, and Old Toobou, acted each the part of a petty ſovereign, and not unfrequently counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted the meaſures of the king. Nor was his court ſuperior in ſplendor, to thoſe of Old Toobou and Mareewagee, who, next to his majeſty, were the moſt potent chiefs in theſe iſlands; and, next after them, Feenou appeared to ſtand higheſt in rank and authority. But however independent on the king the principal men may be the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior people are totally ſubject to the will of the chiefs to whom they ſeverally belong.</p>
                     <p>The iſland of Tongataboo is divided into nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous diſtricts, each of which has its peculiar chief, who diſtributes juſtice, and decides diſputes, within his own territory. Moſt of theſe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains have eſtates in other iſlands, whence they procure ſupplies. The king, at ſtated times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the product of his diſtant domains at Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gataboo, which is not only the uſual place of his reſidence, but the abode of moſt perſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction among theſe iſlands. Its inhabitants fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently call it the Land of Chiefs, and ſtigmatize the ſubordinate iſles with the appellation of Lands of Servants.</p>
                     <p>The chiefs are ſtilled by the people lords of the earth, and alſo of the ſun and ſky. The royal
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:030274_0358_0FE56E0CC8CFEF88"/>
family aſſume the name of Futtafaihe, from the god diſtinguiſhed by that appellation, who is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conſidered by them as their tutelary patron. The king's peculiar title is ſimply <hi>Tooee Tonga.</hi> The order and decorum obſerved in his preſence, and likewiſe in that of the other chiefs, are truly admirable. Whenever he ſits down, all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants ſeat themſelves before him, forming a ſemi-circle, and leaving a ſufficient ſpace between them and him, into which no one, unleſs he has particular buſineſs, preſumes to come. Nor is any one ſuffered to ſit, or paſs, behind him, or even near him, without his permiſſion. When a perſon wiſhes to ſpeak to his majeſty, he comes forward, and having ſeated himſelf before him, delivers in a few words what he has to ſay; then, after being favoured with an anſwer, retires. If the king ſpeaks to any one, the latter gives an anſwer from his ſeat, unleſs he is to receive an order; in which caſe he riſes from his place, and ſeats himſelf croſs-legged<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be proper to mention here, on the authority of Captain King, that this poſture is peculiar to the men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the females always ſit with both their legs thrown a little on one ſide.</note> before his majeſty. To ſpeak to the king ſtanding, would here be conſidered as a glaring mark of rudeneſs.</p>
                     <p>None of the moſt civilized nations have ever exceeded theſe iſlanders in the great order and regularity maintained on every occaſion, in ready
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:030274_0359_0FE56E0E4F6646A8"/>
and ſubmiſſive compliance with the commands of their chiefs, and in the perfect harmony that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts among all ranks. Such a behaviour mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts itſelf in a remarkable manner, whenever their chiefs harrangue a body of them aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which frequently happens. The greateſt attention and moſt profound ſilence are obſerved during the harrangue; and whatever might have been the purport of the oration, we never ſaw a ſingle inſtance, when any one of thoſe who were preſent ſhewed ſigns of his being diſpleaſed, or ſeemed in the leaſt inclined to diſpute the declared will of the ſpeaker.</p>
                     <p>It is a peculiar privilege annexed to the perſon of the king, not to be punctured, nor circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, or rather ſuperciſed, as all his ſubjects are. Whenever he walks out all who meet him muſt ſit down till he has paſſed. No perſon is ſuffered to be over his head; but, on the contrary, all muſt come under his feet. The method of doing homage to him, and the other chiefs is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: the perſon who is to pay obeiſance, ſquats down before the great perſonage, and bows the head down to the ſole of his foot, which he taps or touches with the under and upper ſide of the fingers of each hand; then riſing up, he retires. We had reaſon to think, that his majeſty cannot refuſe any one who is deſirous of paying him this homage, which is called by the natives <hi>moe moca;</hi> for the people would frequently think proper to
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:030274_0360_0FE56E1621886190"/>
ſhew him theſe marks of ſubmiſſion when he was walking; and he was on thoſe occaſions obliged to ſtop, and hold up one of his feet behind him, till they had performed this reſpectful ceremony. This, to ſo corpulent and unwieldy a man as Poulaho, muſt have been painful and troubleſome; and we have ſome times ſeen him endeavour, by running, to get out of the way, or to reach a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place for ſitting down. The hands after having been thus applied, becomes, in ſome caſes, uſeleſs for a little time; for, till they are waſhed, they muſt not touch food of any ſort. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, in a country where water is far from being plentiful, would be attended with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, if a piece of any juicy plant, which they can immediately procure, being rubbed over the hands, did not ſerve for the purpoſe of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. When the hands are in this ſituation, they term it <hi>taboo rema</hi>; the former word gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſignifying forbidden, and the latter imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand. When the <hi>taboo</hi> is incurred, by doing homage to a perſon of rank, it may thus eaſily be waſhed off; but, in ſeveral other caſes, it muſt continue for a certain period. We have often ſeen women, who have been <hi>taboo rema,</hi> not fed by themſelves, but by others. The interdicted perſon, after the limited time had elapſed, waſhes herſelf in one of their bathes, which are, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, dirty ponds of brackiſh water. She then waits upon the ſovereign, and, after having paid
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:030274_0361_0FE56E17C9B8A9A8"/>
the cuſtomary obeiſance, takes hold of his foot, which ſhe applies to her ſhoulders, breaſt, and other parts: he then embraces her on both ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſhe immediately retires, purified from her uncleanneſs. If it be always neceſſary to have recourſe to his majeſty for this purpoſe (of which we are not certain, though Omai aſſured us it was) it may be one reaſon for his travelling very frequently from one iſland to another.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>taboo</hi> has a great latitude of ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. They call human ſacrifices <hi>tangata taboo</hi>; and when any particular thing is prohibited to be eaten, or made uſe of, they ſay it is <hi>taboo.</hi> They informed us, that, if the king ſhould go into a houſe belonging to one of his ſubject, that houſe would in conſequence become <hi>taboo,</hi> and could never be again inhabited by the owner of it; ſo that, wherever his majeſty travels, there are houſes peculiarly aſſigned for his accommodation. At this time, Old Toobou preſided over the <hi>taboo</hi>; that is, if Omai did not miſunderſtand thoſe who gave him the intelligence, he and his deputies had the inſpection of all the produce of the iſland, taking care that each individual ſhould cultivate and plant his quota, and directing what ſhould, and what ſhould not, be eaten. By ſo prudent a regulation, they take effectual precautions againſt a famine; ſufficient ground is employed in raiſing proviſions; and every article is ſecured from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary conſumption. By another good regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:030274_0362_0FE56E195183DB30"/>
an officer of rank is appointed to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend the police. This department was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered, while we continued among them, by Feenou, whoſe buſineſs (as we were informed) it was, to puniſh all delinquents: he was alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſſimo, or commander in chief of the forces of the iſlands. Poulaho himſelf declared to us, that, if he ſhould become a bad man, Feenou would dethrone, and kill him; by which he doubtleſs meant, that, if he neglected the duties of his high ſtation, or governed in a manner that would prove prejudicial to the public welfare, Feenou would be deſired, by the other chiefs, or by the collective body of the people, to depoſe him from his ſovereignty, and put him to death. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch thus ſubject to controul and puniſhment for abuſe of power, cannot juſtly be deemed a deſpotic prince.</p>
                     <p>When we take into conſideration the mumber of iſlands of which this ſtate conſiſts, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at which ſome of them are removed from the ſeat of government, attempts to throw off the yoke of ſubjection might be apprehended. But they informed us, that this circumſtance never happens. One reaſon of their not being thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled in domeſtic commotions may be this; that all the principal chiefs take up their reſidence at Tongataboo. They alſo ſecure the dependence of the other iſles, by the deciſive celerity of their operations; for if a ſeditious and popular man
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:030274_0363_0FE56E1AD9DD2B88"/>
ſhould ſtart up in any of them, Feenou, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happens to hold his office, is immediately diſpatched thither to put him to death, by which means they extinguiſh an inſurrection while it is yet in embryo.</p>
                     <p>The different claſſes of their chiefs ſeemed to be nearly as numerous as among us; but there are few, comparatively ſpeaking, that are lords of extenſive diſtricts of territory. It is ſaid, that, when a perſon of property dies, all his poſſeſſions devolve on the ſovereign; but that it is cuſtomary to give them to the eldeſt ſon of the deceaſed, with this condition annexed, that he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, out of the eſtate, for the other children. The crown is hereditary; and we know, from a particular circumſtance, that the Futtafaihes, of which family is Poulaho, have reigned, in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line, for the ſpace of at leaſt one hundred and thirty-five years, which have elapſed between our preſent viſit to theſe iſlands, and Taſman's diſcovery of them. Upon our inquiring of them, whether any traditional account of the arrival of Taſman's ſhips had been preſerved among them till this time, we found, that this hiſtory had been delivered down to them, from their anceſtors, with great accuracy: for they ſaid that his two ſhips reſembled ours, and alſo mentioned the place where they had lain at anchor, their having continued but a few days, and their quitting that ſtation to go to Annamoka; and for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:030274_0364_0FE56E1E6CF88320"/>
of informing us how long ago this affair had happened, they communicated to us the name of the Futtafaihe who reigned at that time and thoſe who had ſucceeded him in the ſovereignty, down to Poulaho, who, is the fifth monarch ſince that period.</p>
                     <p>It might naturally be imagined, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſovereign of the Friendly Iſles had the higheſt rank of any perſon in his dominions. But we found it to be otherwiſe; for Latoolibooloo, who has been already mentioned, and three women, are ſuperior, in ſome reſpects, to Poulaho him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                        </gap>ſe great perſonages are diſtinguiſhed by the title of <hi>Tammaha,</hi> which implies a chief. When we made inquiry concerning them, we were informed that the late king, father of Poulaho, left behind, him a ſiſter of equal rank, and older than himſelf; that ſhe, by a native of Feejee, had a ſon and two Daughters; and that theſe three perſons, as well as their mother, are of higher rank than the king. We endeavoured to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the reaſon of this pre-eminence of the <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahas,</hi> but without effect. The mother, and one of her daughters, named Tooeela-kaipa, reſide at Vavaoo. The other daughter, called Moungoula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaipa, and, Latoolibooloo the ſon, dwell at Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gataboo. Moungoula-kaipa is the lady who has been mentioned as having dined with Captain Cook on the 21ſt of June. Latoolibooloo was
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:030274_0365_0FE56E235EDEA620"/>
ſuppoſed, by his countrymen, to be diſordered in his ſenſes. At Eooa, or Middleburgh, they ſhewed us a conſiderable quantity of land, which was ſaid to be his property; and we ſaw there a ſon of his, a child who was honoured with the ſame title that his father enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>The language of theſe iſlands bears a ſtriking reſemblance to that of New-Zealand, of Otaheite, and the Society Iſles. The pronunciation of theſe people differs, indeed, in many inſtances, from that both of Otaheite and New-Zealand; but, notwithſtanding, that, a great number of words are either very little changed, or exactly the ſame. The language, as ſpoken by the Friendly Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is ſufficiently copious to expreſs all their ideas; and, beſides being tolerably harmonious in common converſation, is eaſily adapted to the purpoſes of muſic. They have terms to ſignify numbers as far as a hundred thouſand, beyond which they either would not, or could not, reckon.</p>
                     <p>The latitude of that part of Tongataboo where our obſervatory was erected, which was near the middle of the north-ſide of the iſland, was, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt accurate obſervations, 21° 8′ 19″ ſouth; and its longitude was 184° 55″ 18″ eaſt.</p>

                     <p>WE had now taken our final leave of the Friendly Iſlands. On the 17th of July, at eight o'clock in the evening. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="309" facs="unknown:030274_0368_0FE56E59AED7DDF8"/>
by north, diſtant three or four leagues. The wind blew a freſh gale at eaſt. We ſtood to the ſouth, till about ſix o'clock the next morning, when, from the ſame direction, a ſudden ſquall took our ſhip aback; and before we could trim the ſhips on the other tack, the main-ſail and the top-gallant ſails were conſiderably torn.</p>
                     <p>On the 19th and 20th, the wind kept between the ſouth-weſt, and ſouth-eaſt; then it veered to the eaſt, north-eaſt, and north.</p>
                     <p>We ſtretched to the eaſt ſouth-eaſt, without meeting with any thing remarkable, till the 29th, at ſeven o'clock in the evening, when we had a very heavy ſquall of wind from the north. We were, at this time, under ſingle-reefed top-ſails, courſes, and ſtay-ſails. Two of the latter were almoſt demoliſhed by the wind, and it was with the utmoſt difficulty that we ſaved the other ſails. This ſquall being over, we ſaw ſeveral lights mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about on board the Diſcovery; whence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that ſomething had given way; and, the next morning, we perceived that her main-top-maſt had been loſt. Both wind and weather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained very unſettled till noon, when the latter cleared up, and the former ſettled in the north-weſt quarter. We were now in the latitude of 28° 6′ ſouth, and our longitude was 198° 23′ eaſt. We ſaw ſome pintado-birds, which were the firſt we had ſeen ſince we left the land.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="unknown:030274_0369_0FE56E37A189AD98"/>At noon, on the 31ſt, Captain Clerke made a ſignal to ſpeak with Captain Cook; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards informed him, that the head of the main-maſt had ſprung, and in ſuch a manner as to reader the rigging of another top-maſt extremely dangerous; that he muſt therefore rig ſomething lighter in its place. He further informed him, that he had loſt his main-top-gallant-yard: and had not another on board, nor a ſpar to make one. Captain Cook ſent him the Reſolution's ſprit-ſail-top-fail-yard, which ſupplied this want for the preſent. The next day, by getting up a jury-top-maſt, on which he ſet a mizen-top-ſail, he was enabled to keep way with the Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>We ſteered eaſt-north-eaſt, and north-eaſt, without meeting with any remarkable occurrence till the morning of the 8th of Auguſt, at eleven o'clock; when land was obſerved bearing north-north-eaſt, about nine or ten leagues diſtant. At firſt it appeared like ſo many ſeparate iſlands; but, as we approached, we found it was all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and formed one and the ſame iſland. We ſteered directly for it with a fine gale, and, at half paſt ſix in the afternoon, it extended from north by eaſt, to north-north-eaſt, diſtant three or four leagues.</p>
                     <p>At day-break, the next morning, we ſteered for the north-weſt ſide of the iſland, and as we ſtood round its ſouth-weſt part, we ſaw it guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a reef of coral rock, extending, in ſome
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:030274_0370_0FE56E529360EC18"/>
places, at leaſt a mile from the land, and a high ſurf breaking upon it. As we drew near, we ſaw people walking or running along ſhore, on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the coaſt, and, in a ſhort time after, when we had reached the lee-ſide of the iſland, we ſaw two canoes launched, in which were about a dozen men who paddled towards us.</p>
                     <p>In order to give theſe canoes time to come up with us, as well as to ſound for anchorage, we ſhortened ſail; and, at the diſtance of half a mile from the reef, we found from forty to thirty-five fathoms water. The canoes, after having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced within piſtol-ſhot of the ſhips, ſuddenly ſtopped. Omai was deſired, as was uſual on ſuch occaſions, to endeavour to prevail upon the men in them to come nearer; but no arguments could induce them to truſt themſelves within our reach. They often pointed eagerly to the ſhore with their paddles, at the ſame time calling to us to go thither; and many of their people who were ſtanding upon the beach, held up ſomething white in their hands, which we conſtrued as an invitation for us to land. We could eaſily have accompliſhed this, there being good anchorage without the reef, and an opening in it, through which the canoes had paſſed, which had no ſurf upon it. But the Captain did not chuſe to riſk the advantage of a fair wind, in order to examine an iſland, that appeared to be but of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. We required no refreſhments, if we
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:030274_0371_0FE56E319094B488"/>
had been certain of meeting with them there, and therefore, after making ſeveral unſucceſsful attempts to prevail upon theſe people to come near us, we made ſail to the north, and left them; having firſt learned that the name of their iſland was Toobouai. It is ſituated in the latitude of 23° 25′ ſouth; and in 210° 37′ eaſt longitude.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt extent of this iſland, in any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is not above five or ſix miles. Small, however, as it appears, there are hills in it of a conſiderable elevation; at the foot of which, is a narrow border of flat land, extending almoſt all round it, bordered with a white ſand-beach. The hills were covered with herbage, except a few rocky cliffs, with patches of trees interſperſed to their ſummits. This iſland, as we were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the men in the canoes, is plentifully ſtocked with hogs and fowls; and produces the ſeveral kinds of fruits and roots that are to be met with at the other iſlands in this neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p>From the converſation we had with thoſe who came off to us, we diſcovered that the inhabitants of Toobouai ſpeak the Otaheite language; an indubitable proof that they are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thoſe whom we ſaw in the canoes were a ſtout copper-coloured people; ſome wearing their hair (which was ſtraight and black) flowing about the ſhoulders, and others having it tied in a bunch on the crown of the head. Their faces were roundiſh and full, but the features flat; and their
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:030274_0372_0FE56E4724DD31E0"/>
countenance expreſſed a degree of natural fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Their covering was a piece of narrow ſtuff wrapped round the waiſt, and paſſing between the thighs; but ſome of thoſe whom we beheld upon the beach, were compleatly clothed in white. Some of our viſitors in the canoes, had their necks ornamented with pearl ſhells; and one of them continued blowing a large conchſhell, to which a reed, of about two feet long, was fixed; he began in a long tone, without any variation; and afterwards converted it into a kind of muſical inſtrument. Whether the blowing of the conch portended any thing, we cannot ſay, but we never found it the meſſenger of peace.</p>
                     <p>The length of their canoes appeared to be about thirty feet, and they roſe about two feet above the ſurface of the water, as they floated. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part projected a little; the after-part roſe to the height of two or three feet, with a gradual curve, and, like the upper part of the ſides, was carved all over. The reſt of the ſides were ornamented with flat white ſhells curiouſly diſpoſed. There were eight men in one of the canoes, and ſeven in the other. They were conducted with ſmall pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, whoſe blades were almoſt circular; and they ſometimes paddled, with the two oppoſite ſides ſo cloſe together, that they appeared to be but one boat; the rowers occaſionally turning their faces to the ſtern, and pulling that way, without pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling the canoes round. Seeing we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:030274_0373_0FE56E39E3413138"/>
to leave them, they ſtood up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſomething aloud; but we knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were expreſſing their enmity, or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It is certain, however, that they had not any weapons with them; nor could we with our glaſſes diſcover, that thoſe on ſhore were armed.</p>
                     <p>Leaving the iſland, we ſteered to the north with a freſh gale, and, at day-break, on the 12th, we perceived the iſland of Maitea. Otaheite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſoon after; the point of Oheitepeha-bay bearing weſt, about four leagues diſtant. We ſteered for this bay, intending to anchor there, in order to draw ſome refreſhments from the ſouth-eaſt part of the iſland, before we proceeded to Matavia, where we expected our principal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. We had a freſh gale till two o'clock in the afternoon; when, at about a league from the bay the wind ſuddenly died away. About two hours after, we had ſudden ſqualls, with rain, from the eaſt. About nine o'clock, we were obliged to ſtand out, and ſpend the night at ſea.</p>
                     <p>As we drew near the iſland, we were attended by ſeveral canoes, each conducted by two or three men. But, as they were of the lower claſs, Omai ſeemed to take no particular notice of them, nor they of him. They did not even know, that he was one of their countrymen, though they had for ſome time converſed with him. At length a chief, whom Captain Cook had known before,
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:030274_0374_0FE56E41B75A70D0"/>
named Ootee, and Omai's brother-in-law, who happened to be now at this corner of the iſland, and three or four others, all of whom knew Omai, before he embarked with Captain Furneaux, came on board. Yet there was nothing in the leaſt tender or ſtriking in their meeting, but, on the contrary, a perfect indifference on both ſides, till Omai, conducting his brother into the cabin, opened a drawer, and gave him a few red feathers. This circumſtance being ſoon communicated to the reſt of the natives on deck, Ootee, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would hardly ſpeak to him, now begged, that they might be <hi>tayos</hi> (friends) and exchange names. Omai accepted of the honor, and a preſent of red feathers ratified the agreement; and Ootee, by way of recompence, ſent aſhore for a hog. It was evident, however, to all of us, that it was not the man, but his property, that they eſteemed. Had he not exhibited his treaſure of red feathers, a commodity highly eſtimated in the iſland, it is a matter of great doubt whether they would have beſtowed a ſingle cocoa-nut upon him. Such was Omai's firſt reception among his countrymen, and we never expected it would be otherwiſe; but we ſuppoſed, that the valuable cargo of preſents, with which he had been load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the liberality of his frends in England, would be the certain means of raiſing him into conſequence among the firſt perſons throughout the extent of the Society Iſlands. This, indeed,
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:030274_0375_0FE56E3B699D2708"/>
muſt have been the caſe, had he conducted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with any degree of prudence; but he paid little or no attention to the repeated advice of his well-wiſhers, and laid himſelf open to every impoſition.</p>
                     <p>We underſtood from the natives who came off to us, that ſince Captain Cook laſt viſited this iſland in 1774, two other ſhips had twice been in Oheitepeha-bay, and had left animals there, like thoſe we had on board. But, on enquiry into the particulars, we found, that they conſiſted only of hogs, dogs, goats, a bull, and the male of another animal, which they ſo imperfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that we could not conjecture what it was. Theſe ſhips, they informed us, had come from a place called <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ma;</hi> which we ſuppoſed to be Lima, the capital of Peru, and that theſe late viſitors were conſequently Spaniards. They told us, that the firſt time they arrived, they built a houſe, and left behind them two prieſts, a boy or ſervant, and a perſon called Mateema; taking away with them, when they ſailed, four of the natives; that about ten months afterwards, the ſame ſhips returned, bringing back only two of the natives, the other two having died at Lima; and that, after a ſhort ſtay, they took away the people they had left; but that the houſe which they erected was left ſtanding.</p>
                     <p>News having been propagated on ſhore, of red feathers being on board our ſhips, we were early
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:030274_0376_0FE56E4C0F1AF950"/>
the next morning, ſurrounded by a multitude of canoes, crowded with people, with plenty of hogs and fruits. A quantity of feathers, which might be taken from the body of a tom-tit, would, at that time, purchaſe a hog of forty or fifty pounds weight. But as the whole ſhips crew were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſome of this precious article of trade, it decreaſed above five hundred <hi>per cent.</hi> in its value in a few hours. However, the balance even then, was conſiderably in our favour, and red feathers ſtill preſerved their ſuperiority over every other commodity. Some of the iſlanders would not diſpoſe of a hog, without receiving an axe in exchange; but nai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and beads, and many other trinkets, which, during our former voyages, were held in high eſtimation at this iſland, were now ſo much diſpiſed, that few would even deign to look at them.</p>
                     <p>Not having wind in the morning, it was nine o'clock before we could anchor in the bay, when we moored with the two bowers. We had not long anchored, before Omai's ſiſter came on board to congratulate him on his arrival. It was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obſerve, that, to the honour of each of them, their meeting was marked with expreſſions of the tendereſt affection more eaſily conceived than deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>When this affecting ſcene was cloſed, and the ſhip properly moored, Omai attended Captain Cook on ſhore. The Captain's firſt object was
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:030274_0377_0FE56E5BEB2FADE8"/>
to pay a viſit to a man whom Omai repreſented as a very extraordinary perſonage indeed, ſaying he was the God of Bolabola. They ſaw him ſeated under one of thoſe awnings, which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally carried in their larger canoes. He was old, and had ſo far loſt the uſe of his limbs, that he was carried from place to place upon a hand-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. By ſome, he was called <hi>Olla</hi> or <hi>Orra,</hi> which is the name of the God of Bolabola; but his real name was Erary. From Omai's extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary account of his perſon, the Captain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have ſeen religious adoration paid to him: but he ſaw very little to diſtinguiſh him from their other chiefs. Omai preſented to him a tuft of red feathers, faſtened to the end of a ſmall ſtick; but after a little converſation with this Bolabola man, his attention was excited by the preſence of his mother's ſiſter, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at his feet, and had bedewed them plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with tears of joy. The Captain left him with the old lady in this ſituation, ſurrounded by a number of people, and went to take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the houſe ſaid to have been erected by the ſtrangers who had lately landed here. He found it ſtill ſtanding at a ſmall diſtance from the beach. It was compoſed of wooden materials, which appeared to have been brought hither, ready prepared, in order to ſet up as occaſion might require; for the planks were all number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It conſiſted of two ſmall rooms, in the inner
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:030274_0378_0FE56E4F3646B2F8"/>
of which, were a bedſted, a bench, a table, ſome old hats, and other trifles, of which the natives ſeemed to be remarkably careful, as well as of the building itſelf, which had received no injury from the weather, a kind of ſhed having been erected over it. Scuttles, ſerving as air holes, appeared all round the building; and perhaps, they were alſo meant for the additional pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of firing from with muſkets, if neceſſity ſhould require it. A wooden croſs was placed at a little diſtance from the front, on the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe part of which appeared the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription:
<q>Chriſtus vincit.</q>
On the perpendicular part (which confirmed our conjecture that the two ſhips were Spaniſh) was engraved,
<q>Carolus <hi>III.</hi> imperat, <hi>1774.</hi>
                        </q>
And on the other ſide of the poſt, Captain Cook very properly preſerved the memory of the prior viſits of the Engliſh, by inſcribing,
<q>Georgius tertius rex, Annis <hi>1767, 1769, 1773, 1774,</hi> et <hi>1777.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Near the foot of the croſs the iſlanders pointed out to us the grave of the Commodore of the two ſhips, who died here, while they lay in the bay, on their firſt arrival. His name, as near as we could gather from their pronunciation, was
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:030274_0379_0FE56E43C9FA7568"/>
Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ede. The Spaniards, whatever their intentions might be in viſiting this iſland, ſeemed to have taken infinite pains to have ingratiated themſelves with the natives; who, upon all occaſions, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned them with the ſtrongeſt terms of eſteem and veneration.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion, the Captain met with no chief of any conſiderable note excepting the aged perſonage above deſcribed. Waheiadooa, king of Tiaraboo, (as this part of the iſland is called by the natives) was now abſent; and we were afterwards informed, that (though his name was the ſame) he was not the ſame perſon as the chief whom Captain Cook had ſeen here in 1774; but his brother, a youth of ten years of age, who had ſucceeded the elder Waheiadooa. We alſo diſcovered, that the celebrated Oberea was dead; but that Otoo, and all our other friends, were living.</p>
                     <p>When Captain Cook returned from the houſe erected by the Spaniards, he found Omai harangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very large company; and could with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty diſengage him to accompany him aboard, where he had to ſettle a matter of importance.</p>
                     <p>Knowing that Otaheite, and the neighbouring iſlands, could ſupply us plentifully with cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, the liquor of which is a moſt excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verage, he wiſhed to prevail upon his people to conſent to be abridged, for a ſhort time of their ſtated allowance of ſpirits to mix with water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="321" facs="unknown:030274_0380_0FE56E3CF081A9E0"/>But as this, without aſſigning ſome powerful rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, might have occaſioned a general murmur, he aſſembled the ſhip's company, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to them the entent of the voyage, and the extent of our future operations. He took notice of the generous rewards offered, by parliament, to ſuch as ſhall firſt diſcover a communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the Northern Hemiſphere, as well as to thoſe who ſhall firſt penetrate beyond the 89th degree of northern latitude. He ſaid, that he did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a doubt, that he ſhould find them ready to co-opperate with him in attempting to obtain one, or both theſe rewards; but that it would be neceſſary to be ſtrickly oeconomical in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure of our ſtores and proviſions, as we had not a chance of getting a ſupply after leaving theſe iſlands. He further obſerved, that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our voyage would exceed by a year, at leaſt, what had been originally ſuppoſed, by our having loſt the opportunity of getting to the north this ſummer. He begged them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the various obſtructions, and aggravated hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, they muſt yet labour under, if they ſhould be under the neceſſity of being put to ſhort al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, of any ſpecies of proviſions, in a cold climate. He therefore ſubmitted to them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not be the moſt adviſeable to be prudent in time, and rather than run the riſk of having their ſpirits exhauſted, when they might
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:030274_0381_0FE56E5D947E9CD0"/>
be moſt wanted, to conſent to be without their grog at preſent, when we could ſupply its place with ſo excellent, a liquor as that of cocoa-nuts. He added nevertheleſs, that he would leave the determination entirely to their own choice.</p>
                     <p>This propoſal did not remain a moment under conſideration, and Captain Cook had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to find that it was unanimouſly approved of. He ordered Captain Clerke to make a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar propoſal to his his people; which they alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily agreed to. The ſerving of grog was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately ſtopped, except on Saturday nights, when all the men had a full allowance of it, to enable them to drink the healths of their female friends in England; leſt, amidſt the pretty girls of Otaheite, they ſhould be totally forgotten.</p>
                     <p>We began, the next day, ſome neceſſary ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; ſuch as inſpecting the proviſions in the main and fore-hold, getting the caſks of beef and pork, &amp;c. out of the ground tier, and putting a quantity of ballaſt in their place- The ſhip was ordered to be caulked, which ſhe ſtood in much need of; having, at times, made a conſiderable deal of water on our paſſage from the Friendly Iſlands. Captain Cook alſo put his cattle on ſhore, and appointed two of his men to look after them while grazing; not intending to leave any of them on this part of the iſland.</p>
                     <p>It rained almoſt inceſſantly, the two following days; notwithſtanding which, we were viſited by
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:030274_0382_0FE56E5F3174A118"/>
the natives from every quarter, the news of our arrival having moſt rapidly ſpread. Waheiadooa, though at a conſiderable diſtance, had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of it; and in the afternoon of the 16th, a chief, named Etorea, who was his tutor, brought Captain Cook two hogs as a preſent from him; acquainting him, at the ſame time, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would attend him the day after. He was punctual to his promiſe; for the Captain receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a meſſage from him early the next morning, notifying his arrival, and requeſting he would go aſhore to meet him. In conſequence of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, Omai and he prepared to make him a formal viſit. Omai, on this occaſion, took ſome pains to dreſs himſelf, not after the manner of the Engliſh, nor that of Otaheite, or Tongata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boo, or in the dreſs of any other country upon earth; but in a ſtrange medly of all the habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ornaments he was poſſeſſed of.</p>
                     <p>Thus equipped, they got aſhore, and firſt paid a viſit to Etary; who, carried on a hand-barrow, accompanied them to a large building, where he was ſet down; Omai ſeated himſelf on one ſide of him, and Captain Cook on the other. The Captain cauſed a piece of Tongataboo cloth to be ſpread, on which were placed the preſents he intended to make. The young Chief ſoon after arrived, attended by his mother, and ſeveral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal men, who all ſeated themſelves oppoſite to us. A man who ſat near, the Captain made a
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:030274_0383_0FE56E671E6C4CB0"/>
ſhort ſpeech conſiſting of ſeparate ſentences; parts of which was dictated by thoſe about him. Another, on the oppoſite ſide, near the chief, ſpoke next; Etary after him, and then Omai, &amp;c. The ſubjects of theſe orations were Captain Cook's arrival, and his connexions with them. Amongſt other things, one of them told the Captain, that the men of <hi>Reema</hi> (the Spaniards) deſired they would not ſuffer him to come into Oheitepeha Bay, if he ſhould return again to the iſland, for that it was their property; but that, ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding this requeſt, he was authorized now to ſurrender to him the province of Tiaraboo, and every thing that was in it. It was evident from this, that theſe people are no ſtrangers to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of accommodating themſelves to preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. The young chief, at length, was directed, by his attendants, to embrace Captain Cook; and, as a confirmation of this treaty of friendſhip, they exchanged names. After theſe ceremonies were over, he and his friends accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Captain, to dine with him on board.</p>
                     <p>Omai had prepared, as a preſent for Otoo, the king of the whole iſland, a <hi>maro,</hi> compoſed of red and yellow feathers; and, conſidering where we were, it was a preſent of great value. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook endeavoured to prevail on him not to produce it now, wiſhing him to keep it till he had an opportunity of preſenting it to Otoo with his own hands. But he entertained too good an
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:030274_0384_0FE56E6919380A18"/>
opinion of the fidelity of his countrymen, to be guided by his advice. He was determined to carry it aſhore, on this occaſion, and to give it to Waheiadooa, to be forwarded by him to Otoo, and added to the royal <hi>maro.</hi> By this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, he ſuppoſed he ſhould oblige both chiefs; on the contrary, he highly diſobliged that whoſe favour was of the moſt conſequence to him, without obtaining any reward from the other. The Captain was prophetic upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; for Waheiadooa, as he expected, kept the <hi>maro</hi> for himſelf, and only ſent to Otoo about a twentieth part of what compoſed the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent preſent.</p>
                     <p>On the 19th, Captain Cook received, from the young chief, a preſent of ten or a dozen hogs ſome cloath, and a quantity of fruit. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we exhibited ſome fire works, which both pleaſed and aſtoniſhed the numerous ſpectators.</p>
                     <p>Some of our gentlemen, in their walks, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they thought, a Roman Catholic chapel. They deſcribed the alter which they ſaid they had ſeen, and every other conſtituent part of ſuch a place of worſhip. They mentioned, however, at the ſame time, that two perſons, who had the care of it, would not permit them to go in; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Captain imagined they were miſtaken, and had the curioſity to pay a viſit to it himſelf. The ſuppoſed chapel happened to be a <hi>toopapaoo,</hi> in which the body of the late Waheiadooa lay, in
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:030274_0385_0FE56E6AA09BA418"/>
a kind of ſtate. It was in a pretty large houſe, encloſed with a low paliſade. The <hi>toopapaoo</hi> was remarkably neat, and reſembled one of thoſe little awnings over their large canoes. It was hung and covered with cloaths and mats of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of colours, which had a beautiful effect. One piece of ſcarlet broad cloth of the length of four or five yards, appeared conſpicuous among the other ornaments; which had probably been received as a preſent from the Spaniards. This cloth, and ſome taſſels of feathers, ſuggeſted to our gentlemen the idea of a chapel; and their imagination ſupplied what ever elſe was wanting to create a reſemblance: hearing that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards had viſited this place, might alſo operate on their minds upon this occaſion, and add to the probability of its being a chapel. Small of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of fruits and roots ſeemed to be daily made at this ſhrine, ſome pieces being now quite freſh. Theſe were depoſited on a kind of alter which ſtood without the paliſades; within which we were not permitted to enter. Two men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attended here, both night and day; as well to watch over the place, as to dreſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the <hi>toopapaoo.</hi> When Captain Cook went to ſurvey it, the cloth and its appendages were rolled up; but at his requeſt, the two attendants placed it in order, but not till after they had dreſſed themſelves, in clean white robes. The
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:030274_0386_0FE56E2FA67A76C0"/>
chief we were informed, had been dead about twenty months.</p>
                     <p>Having provided a freſh ſupply of water, and finiſhed all our neceſſary operations, on the 22d we brought off our animals from ſhore, and made ready for ſea. While the ſhips were unmooring, Omai and Captain Cook landed, in the morning of the 23d, to take leave of the young chief. While they were with him, one of thoſe perſons, whom they called <hi>Eatooas,</hi> from a perſuaſion that they poſſeſs the ſpirit of the divinity, preſented himſelf before them. He had all the appearances of inſanity about him, and his only covering was a quantity of planting leaves wrapped round his waiſt. He uttered what he had to ſay in a low, ſqueaking voice, ſo as hardly to be underſtood. But Omai ſaid he perfectly comprehended him, and that he was adviſing Waheiadooa not to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Captain Cook to Matavia, an expedition which he had never known that he intended, nor had the Captain ever made ſuch a propoſal to him. The <hi>Eatooa</hi> alſo predicted, that the ſhips would not arrive that day at Matavai. In this, however, he was miſtaken; though appearances, at that time, favoured his aſſertion, as there was not a ſingle breath of wind in any direction. While he was delivering his prophecy, a heavy ſhower of rain came on, which occaſioned all to run for ſhelter, except himſelf, who appeared to diſregard it. He continued ſqueaking about half
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:030274_0387_0FE56E6C27B2C7E0"/>
an hour, and then retired. No attention was paid to what he uttered, though ſome of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives laughed at him.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook aſked the chief, whether he was an <hi>Earee</hi> or a <hi>Towtow?</hi> The anſwer he received was, that he was <hi>toata eno,</hi> that is, a bad man. And yet, notwithſtanding this, and the little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of the mad prophet, ſuperſtition ſo far governs the natives, that they abſolutely believe ſuch perſons to be poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of the <hi>Eatooa.</hi> Omai ſeemed to be well inſtructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. He ſaid, that during the fits, with which they are ſeized, they know nobody, and that if any one of them is a man of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, he will then give away every moveable he poſſeſſes, if his friends do not put them out of his reach; and when he recovers, he ſeems not to have the leaſt remembrance of what he had done during the time the fit was upon him.</p>
                     <p>Soon after the Captain got on board, a light breeze ſpringing up at eaſt, we got under ſail, and the Reſolution anchored, the ſame evening at Matavai Bay; but the Diſcovery did not get in till the next morning; conſequently the man's prophecy was half fulfilled.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ON Sunday the 24th, in the morning, Otoo, the king of the whole iſland, accompanied by a great number of the natives in their canoes, came from Oparre, his place of reſidence, and having landed on Matai Point, ſent a meſſenger on board, intimating his deſire to ſee Captain Cook there. He accordingly went a ſhore, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Omai, and ſome of the officers. They found a vaſt multitude of people aſſembled on this occaſion, in the midſt of whom was the king, with his father, his two brothers, and three ſiſters. The Captain went towards him and ſaluted him, being followed by Omai, who kneeled and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his legs. Though Omai had prepared himſelf for this ceremony, by dreſſing himſelf in
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:030274_0389_0FE56E72C5B15238"/>
his beſt apparel, and behaved with great reſpect and modeſty, yet very little notice was taken of him. He made the king a preſent of two or three yards of gold cloth, and a large piece of red feathers, and the Captain gave him a gold-laced hat, a ſuit of fine linen, ſome tools, a quantity of read feathers, and one of the bonnets worn at the Friendly iſlands.</p>
                     <p>This viſit being over, the king, and all the royal family, accompanied Captain Cook on board, followed by ſeveral canoes, plentifully laden with all kind of proviſions. Each of the family owned a part; ſo that the Captain had a preſent from every one of them; and each received from him a ſeparate preſent in return. Not long after, the king's mother came on board, bringing with her ſome proviſions and cloth, which ſhe divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Commodore and Omai. Though the latter was but little noticed at firſt by his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they no ſooner gained information of his wealth, than they began to court his friendſhip. Captain Cook encouraged them as far as lay in his power, being deſirous of fixing him with Otoo. intending to leave all his European animals at this iſland, he thought Omai would be able to give the natives ſome inſtruction with regard to their uſe, and the management of them. Beſides, the Captain was convinced, that the farther he was removed from his native iſland, the more he would be reſpected. But unfortunately, Omai rejected
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:030274_0390_0FE56E45516B9070"/>
his advice, and behaved in ſo imprudent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he ſoon loſt the friendſhip of Otoo, and of all the moſt conſiderable perſons at Otaheite. He aſſociated with none but ſtrangers and vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, whoſe ſole intention was to plunder him: and, if the Captain had not interfered, they would not have left him a ſingle article of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. This conduct drew upon him the ill-will of the principal chiefs; who found that they could not obtain, from any one in either ſhip, ſuch valuable preſents as were beſtowed by Omai on the loweſt of the people. After dinner, a party of us accompanied Otoo to Oparre, taking with us ſome poultry, conſiſting of a peacock and hen, a turky-cock and hen, three geeſe, one gander, four ducks, and a drake. All theſe we left at Oparre, in the poſſeſſion of Otoo: and theſe geeſe and ducks began to breed before we ſailed. We found there a gander, that Captain Wallis had given to Oberea ten years before; we alſo met with ſeveral goats, and the Spaniſh bull, whom they kept tied to a tree, near the habitation of Otoo. We never beheld a finer animal of his kind. He now belonged to Etary, and had been conveyed from Oheitepeha to this place, in order to be ſhipped for Bolabola. The next day the Commodore ſent to this bull the three cows that he had on board; and the bull, which he had brought, the horſe, and mare, and ſheep, were now put aſhore at Matavai. Having thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:030274_0391_0FE56E7490F3B0F0"/>
of theſe animals, he found himſelf eaſed of the extraordinary trouble and vexation that had attended the bringing this living cargo to ſuch a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>As Captain Cook intended to continue here a conſiderable time, we ſet up our obſervatories on Matavai Point; and, adjoined to them, two tents were pitched, for the reception of a guard, and of ſuch people as might be left on ſhore, in different departments. The command, at this ſtation, was entruſted to Mr. King; who alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the aſtronomical and other obſervations. While we remained here, the crews of both ſhips were occupied in many neceſſary operations. The Diſcovery's main-maſt was carried aſhore, and made as good as it had ever been before. Our ſails and water-caſks were repaired; both of our ſhips were caulked; and the rigging was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly over-hauled. We likewiſe inſpected the bread that we had on board in caſks, and found that but little of it was damaged.</p>
                     <p>On the 26th, a piece of ground was cleared for a garden, and planted with ſeveral articles; very few of which will, probably, be looked after by the natives. Some potatoes, melons, and pine-apple plants, were in a fair way of ſucceeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we quitted the place. We had brought, from the Friendly Iſlands, ſeveral ſhaddock-trees, which we alſo planted here; and they will in all probability ſucceed, unleſs their growth ſhould
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:030274_0392_0FE56E7618EC2850"/>
be checked by the ſame idle and premature curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which deſtroyed a vine planted at Oheitepeha by the Spaniards. Many of the natives aſſembled to taſte the firſt fruit it produced; but the grapes being ſtill ſour, they conſidered it as a little better than poiſon, and trod it under foot. In that ſtate Omai accidentally found it, and was rejoiced at the diſcovery; for he was confident, that if he had but grapes, he could eaſily make wine. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he had ſeveral ſlips cut off from the tree, with an intention of carrying them away with him; and he pruned, and put in order, the remains of it.</p>
                     <p>Before we had been two days at anchor in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavai Bay, we were viſited by all our old friends, whoſe names are mentioned in the narrative of Captain Cook's laſt voyage. Not one of them came with empty hands; ſo that we had an amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quantity of proviſions, without any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of exhauſting the iſland, which preſented to our eyes every mark of the moſt exuberant fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility and abundance. Soon after we had arrived here, one of the iſlanders, whom the Spaniards had carried with them to Lima, paid us a viſit; but, in his exterior appearance, he was not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable from the reſt of his countrymen. He ſtill remembered ſome Spaniſh words, among which the moſt frequent were, <hi>ſi Sennor.</hi> He alſo found here the young man whom we called Oedidee, but whoſe real name is Heete-heete.
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:030274_0393_0FE56E77E38D5D38"/>
Captain Cook had carried him from Ulieta on board his ſhip in 1773, and brought him back in the ſucceeding year, after he had viſited the Friendly Iſlands, New-Zealand, Eaſter Iſland, and the Marqueſas. He had come from Bolabola (of which he was a native) to Otaheite, about three months before probably with the ſole view of gratifying hid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rioſity. He preferred the modes, and even dreſs, of his countrymen to ours; for, though Captain Cook gave him ſome cloths, which our board of admiralty had thought proper to ſend for his uſe (to which he added a cheſt of tools, and ſeveral other articles, as a preſent for himſelf) he, after a few days, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined wearing them. This inſtance, as well as that of the perſon who had been at Lima, may be adduced as a proof of the ſtrong inclination of mankind in general to habits acquired at an early age; and it is perhaps no unreaſonable ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that even Omai, who had imbibed almoſt the whole Engliſh manners, will in a ſhort time after being left by us, return, like Oedidee, and the viſitor of Lima, to his own native garments, and his original mode of life.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 27th, a man from Ohei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepeha informed us, that two Spaniſh ſhips had achored in that bay the preceeding night; and to confirm this intelligence, he produced ſome coarſe blue cloth, which, he ſaid, he had got out of one of the ſhips. He further ſaid, that Mateema was
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:030274_0394_0FE56E7C37F735A0"/>
in one of the ſhips; and that they would come to Matavai in two or three days. Theſe and ſome other circumſtances, which he mentioned, gave the ſtory ſo much the apperance of truth, that the Commodore diſpatched Lieutenant William<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a boat, to look into Oheitepeha Bay; and, in the mean time, both our ſhips were put in a poſture of defence. For, though England and Spain were at peace when he left England, he did not know but that a different ſcene might, by this time, have opened. Upon enquiry, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we had reaſon to imagine, that the relater of the ſtory had impoſed upon us; and this was put beyond all doubt, when Mr. Williamſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the day following, who made his report to Captain Cook, that he had been at Oheitepeha, and found that no ſhips were there at preſent, nor had any been there ſince we left it. The people of this part of the iſland, were we now were ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, told us indeed, at firſt, that it was a fiction invented by thoſe of Tiaraboo. But what view they could have, we could not conceive, unleſs they ſuppoſed that the report would induce us to quit the iſland, and thus deprive the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Otaheite-nooe of the advantages they might otherwiſe reap from our ſhips remaining there; the natives of the two parts of the iſland being inveterate enemies to each other.</p>
                     <p>Since we arrived at Matavai, the weather had been very unſettled till the 29th; before which
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:030274_0395_0FE56E7E32E023B0"/>
day we were unable to get even altitudes of the ſun for aſcertaining the going of the time-keeper. The caulking, and other repairs of the ſhips, were alſo retarded by the ſame cauſe. In the evening of this day, the iſlanders made a precipitate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, both from our land ſtation, and from on board the ſhips. We conjectured that this aroſe from their knowing that ſome theft had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and apprehending puniſhment upon that account. At length, we became acquainted with the whole affair: one of the ſurgeon's mates had made an excurſion into the country to purchaſe curioſities, and had taken with him four hatchets for the purpoſe of exchange. Having been ſo imprudent as to employ a native to carry them, the fellow took an opportunity of running off with ſo valuable a prize. This was the reaſon of the ſudden flight, in which Otoo himſelf, and all his family had joined; and it was with difficulty that the Captain ſtopped them, after following them for the ſpace of two or three miles. As he had determined to take no meaſures for the recovery of the hatchets, that his people for the future might be more upon their guard againſt ſuch neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, every thing quickly reſumed its former tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>The next morning ſome meſſengers arrived from Eimeo, with intelligence, that the people of that iſland were in arms: and that Otoo's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans there had been obliged by the oppoſite
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:030274_0396_0FE56E7FC5188120"/>
party to retreat to the mountains. The quarrel between the two iſlands, which began in 1774, had partly ſubſiſted every ſince. A formidable armament had ſailed ſoon after Captain Cook left Otaheite in his laſt voyage; but the malecontents of Eimeo had made ſo gallant a reſiſtance, that the fleet had returned without ſucceſs; and now another expedition was deemed neceſſary. On the arrival of theſe meſſengers, the chiefs aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Otoo's houſe, where the Captain actually was at that time, and had the honour of being admitted into their council. One of the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers opened the buſineſs with a ſpeech of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able length, the purport of which was to explain the ſituation of affairs in Eimeo, and to excite the Otaheitean chiefs to arm on the occaſion. This opinion was oppoſed by others who were againſt commencing hoſtilities; and the debate was, for ſome time, carried on with great order and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. At length, however, they became very tumultuous, and the Captain began to expect that their meeting would conclude like a Poliſh diet. But the contending chiefs cooled as faſt as they grew warm, and order was ſpeedily reſtored. In the end, the party for war prevailed; and it was reſolved, though not unanimouſly, that a ſtrong force ſhould be ſent to Eimeo. Otoo ſaid very little during the whole debate. Thoſe of the council, who were inclinable for war, applied to the Captain for his aſſiſtance; and all of them
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:030274_0397_0FE56E814D0E3D48"/>
were deſirous of knowing what part he would take, Omai was ſent for to act as his interpreter; but, as he could not be found, the Captain, being under a neceſſity of ſpeaking for himſelf, told them, as well as he could, that, as he was not perfectly acquainted with the diſpute, and as the natives of Eimeo had never given him the leaſt cauſe of offence, he could not think of engaging in hoſtilities againſt them. With this declaration they either were, or appeared to be, ſatisfied. The council was then diſſolved; but, before the Captain retired, Otoo deſired him to come again in the afternoon, and bring Omai with him.</p>
                     <p>A party of us accordingly waited upon him at the appointed time; and he conducted us to his father, in whoſe preſence the diſpute with Eimeo was again diſcuſſed. The Commodore being very deſirous of effecting an accommodation, ſounded the old chief on that ſubject; but he was deaf to any ſuch propoſal, and fully determined to carry on hoſtilities. On our enquiry into the cauſe of the war, we were informed, that, ſeveral years ago, a brother of Waheiadooa, of Tiaraboo, was ſent to Eimeo, at the deſire of Maheine, a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar chief of that iſland, to be their king; but had not been there many days before Maheine, having cauſed him to be put to death, ſet up for himſelf, in oppoſition to Tierataboonooe, newphew of the deceaſed, who now became the lawful heir, or perhaps had been appointed, by the people of
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:030274_0398_0FE56E87876DEAA0"/>
Otaheite, to ſucceed to the government on the death of the other.</p>
                     <p>Towha, who is related to Otoo, and chief of the diſtrict of Tettaha, and who had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the armament ſent againſt Eimeo in 1774, happened not to be at Matavai at this time, and, therefore, was not preſent at theſe conſultations. It appeared, however, that he was no ſtranger to what was tranſacted; and that he entered into the affair with great eagerneſs and ſpirit. For, on the 1ſt of September, a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger arrived from him to acquaint Otoo, that he had killed a man to be ſacrificed to the <hi>Fatooa,</hi> with the view of imploring the aſſiſtance of the deity againſt Eimeo. This ceremony was to be performed at the great <hi>morai,</hi> at Attahooroo; and Otoo's preſence was neceſſary on the occaſion. Captain Cook was deſirous of being preſent at this ſolemnity, and therefore propoſed to Otoo, that he might be permitted to accompany him. To this the king readily conſented; and they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet out in the Captain's boat, with his old friend Potatou, Mr. Anderſon, and Mr. Webber, while Omai followed them in a canoe. In their way they landed upon a ſmall iſland, lying off Tettaha, where they found Towha and his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. After a little converſation between the two chiefs, on the ſubject of the war, Towha ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to the Captain, ſoliciting his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. When he excluſed himſelf, Towha ſeemed
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:030274_0399_0FE56E890D63DF28"/>
diſpleaſed; thinking it rather extraordinary, that one who had conſtantly declared himſelf the friend of their iſland, ſhould now refuſe to fight againſt its enemies. Before they parted, Towha gave to Otoo two or three red feathers, tied up in a tuft; our party then re-embarked, having taken on board a prieſt, who was to aſſiſt at the ſolemnity.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as they landed at Attahooroo, which was about two o'clock, Otoo deſired that the ſailors might be ordered to continue in the boat; and that Captain Cook, Mr. Anderſon, and Mr. Webber, would take off their hats as ſoon as they ſhould come to the <hi>morai,</hi> to which they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately proceeded, attended by numbers of men, and ſome boys; but not one woman was preſent. They found four prieſts, with their aſſiſtants, waiting for them. The dead body, or ſacrifice, was in a ſmall canoe that lay on the beach, front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>morai.</hi> Two of the prieſts with ſeveral of their attendants, were ſitting by the canoe; the others at the <hi>morai.</hi> Our company ſtopped at the diſtance of twenty or thirty paces from the prieſts. Here Otoo placed himſelf; our gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and a few others, ſtanding by him, while the majority of the people were removed at a greater diſtance.</p>
                     <p>The ceremonies now commenced. One of the attendants of the prieſts brought a young plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-tree, and laid it down before the king. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approached, bearing a ſmall tuft of red fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:030274_0400_0FE56E8A92E29070"/>
twiſted on ſome fibres of the cocoa-nut huſk, with which he touched one of Otoo's feet, and afterwards retired with it to his companions. One of the prieſts who were ſeated at the <hi>morai,</hi> now began a long prayer; and, at particular times, ſent down young plantain-trees, which were placed upon the ſacrifice. During this prayer, an iſlander, who ſtood by the officiating prieſt, held in his hands two bundles, in one of which, as we aftewards found, was the royal <hi>maro;</hi> and the other, if we may be allowed the expreſſion, was the ark of the <hi>Eatooa.</hi> The prayer being finiſhed, the prieſts at the <hi>morai,</hi> with their aſſiſtants, went and ſat down by thoſe who were upon the beach, carrying the two bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with them. They here renewed their prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during which the plantain-trees were taken, one by one, at various times, from off the dead body, which, being wrapped up in cocoa-leaves and ſmall branches, was now taken out of the canoe, and laid upon the beach. The prieſts placed themſelves around it; ſome ſtanding, and others ſitting; and one, or more of them, repeated ſentences for about ten minutes. The body was now ſtripped of the leaves and branches, and placed parallel with the ſea-ſhore. Then one of the prieſts, ſtanding at the feet of the corpſe, pronounced a long prayer, in which he was occaſionally joined by the others, each of them holding a tuft of red feathers in his hand. During this prayer, ſome hair was pulled
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:030274_0401_0FE56E8C677E0028"/>
off the head of the intended ſacrifice, and the left eye was taken out; both which being wrapped up in a green-leaf, were preſented to the king; who, however did not touch them, but gave, to the man who preſented them the tuft of red feathers which he had received from Towha. This, with the eye and hair, was taken to the prieſts. Not long after, his majeſty ſent them another piece of feathers. In the courſe of this laſt ceremony, a king-fiſher making a noiſe in the trees, Otoo turned to Captain Cook, ſaying, "That is the <hi>Eatooa</hi>;" and ſeemed to conſider it as a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prognoſtic.</p>
                     <p>The corpſe was then carried a littie way, and laid under a tree; near which were fixed three thin pieces of wood, variouſly carved. The bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of cloth were placed on a part of the <hi>morai;</hi> and the tufts of red feathers were laid at the feet of the dead body, round which the prieſts ſtationed themſelves; and our gentlemen were now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go as near as they pleaſed. He who ſeemed to be the chief prieſt ſpoke for about a quarter of an hour, with different tones and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſometimes appearing to expoſtulate with the deceaſed; at other times, aſking ſeveral queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then making various demands, as if the dead perſon either had power himſelf, or intereſt with the deity, to engage him to grant ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; among which he deſired him to deliever Eimeo, Maheine its chief, the women, hogs, and
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:030274_0402_0FE56E917A73E9B8"/>
other things of the iſland, into their hands; which was, indeed, the expreſs object of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. He then prayed near half an hour, in a whining tone, and two other prieſts joined in the prayer, in the courſe of which a prieſt plucked ſome more hair from the head of the corpſe, and put it upon one of the bundles: The chief prieſt now prayed alone, holding in his hand the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers received from Towha. Having finiſhed, he gave them to another prieſt, who prayed in like manner; then all the tufts of feathers were placed upon the bundles of the cloth, which concluded the ceremony at this place.</p>
                     <p>The dead body was now carried to the moſt conſpicuous part of the <hi>morai,</hi> with the feathers and the two bundles of cloth, while the drums beat ſlowly. The feathers and bundles were laid againſt the pile of ſtones, and the body at the foot of them. The prieſts having again ſeated themſelves round the corpſe, renewed their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, while ſome of their aſſiſtants dug a hole about the depth of two feet, into which they threw the victim, and covered it over with ſtones and earth. While they were committing the body to the grave, a boy ſqueaked aloud, upon which Omai ſaid to Captain Cook, that it was the <hi>Eatooa.</hi> A fire having been made in the mean time, a lean half-ſtarved dog was produced and killed by twiſting his neck. The hair was then ſinged off, and the entrails being taken out,
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:030274_0403_0FE56E9359E224F8"/>
were thrown into the fire, where they were left to be conſumed; but the kidney, heart, and liver, were only roaſted, by being put on heated ſtones; and the carcaſe of the dog, after being rubbed over with the blood, was, with the liver, &amp;c. laid down before the prieſts, who were ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the grave praying. They for ſome time uttered ejaculations over the dog, while two men, at intervals, beat very loud on two drums; and a boy ſcreamed, in a loud ſhrill voice, three times. This, they ſaid, was to invite the <hi>Eatooa</hi> to feaſt on the banquet that they had provided for him. When the prieſts had finiſhed their prayers, the body, heart, liver, &amp;c. of the dog, were placed on a <hi>whatta,</hi> or ſcaffold, about ſix feet in height, on which lay the remans of two other dogs, and of two pigs, which had been lately ſacrificed. The prieſts and attendants now gave a kind of ſhout, which put an end to the ceremonies for the preſent. The evening being arrived, our gentlemen were conducted to a houſe belonging to Potatou, where they were entertained and lodged for the night. Having been informed, that the religious rites were to be renewed the next morning, they would not quit the place while any thing remained to be ſeen. Some of them repaired to the ſcene of action early in the morning; and, ſoon afterwards, a pig was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and laid upon the ſame ſcaffold with the others. About eight o'clock, Otoo took our
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:030274_0404_0FE56E94E0AF3000"/>
party again to the <hi>morai,</hi> where the prieſts, and a great multitude of people, where by this time aſſembled. The two bundles occupied the place where they had been depoſited the preceding evening; the two drums were in the front of the <hi>morai,</hi> and the prieſts were ſtationed beyond them. The king placed himſelf between the drums, and deſired Captain Cook to ſtand by him.</p>
                     <p>The ceremony of this day began with bringing a young plantain-tree, and laying it at his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's feet. A prayer was then repeated by the prieſts, holding in their hands ſeveral tufts of red feathers, and alſo a plume of oſtrich feathers, which the Commodore had preſented to Otoo on his firſt arrival. When the prieſts had ended the prayer, they changed their ſtation, and placed themſelves between our gentlemen and the <hi>morai.</hi> One of them, the ſame who had performed the principal part the preceding day, began another prayer, which continued near half an hour. During this prayer, the tufts of red feathers were put, one by one, upon the ark of the <hi>Eatooa.</hi> Not long after, four pigs were produced, one of which was immediately killed, and the three others were taken to a neighbouring ſty.</p>
                     <p>One of the bundles was now untied; and it was found to contain the <hi>maro,</hi> with which the Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heiteans inveſt their kings. When taken out of the cloth, it was ſpread on the ground, at full length, before the prieſts. It is a girdle about
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:030274_0405_0FE56E9669242E48"/>
fifteen feet in length, and one foot and a quarter in breadth, and is probably put on in the ſame manner as the common <hi>maro,</hi> or piece of cloth, uſed by theſe iſlanders to wrap round the waiſt. It was ornamented with yellow and red feathers; but principally with the former. One end of it was bordered with eight pieces, about the ſize and figure of a horſe-ſhoe, whoſe edges were fringed with black feathers. The other end was forked, having the points of various lengths. The feathers were ranged in two rows, in ſquare compartments, and produced a pleaſing effect. They had been firſt fixed upon ſome of the cloth of the iſland, and then ſewed to the upper end of the pendant which Captain Wallis had left flying on ſhore, the firſt time of his arrival at Matavai. The prieſts pronounced a long prayer, relative to this part of the ceremony; and after it was ended, the badge of royalty was folded up with great care, and put into the cloth.</p>
                     <p>The other bundle, which we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned under the name of the ark, was next open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at one end; but our party were not permitted to approach near enough to examine its myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious contents. The intelligence they obtained reſpecting it was, that the <hi>Eatooa,</hi> (or rather what is ſuppoſed to repreſent him) was concealed in it. This ſacred repoſitory is compoſed of the twiſted fibres of the huſk of the cocoa-nut; and
<pb facs="unknown:030274_0406_0FE56E2E19297B88"/>
                        <figure/>
                        <pb n="347" facs="unknown:030274_0407_0FE56E9C8941A4E8"/>
its figure is roundiſh, with one end conſiderably thicker than the other.</p>
                     <p>The pig that had been killed was by this time cleaned, and its entrails taken out. Theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to have many of thoſe convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which frequently appear, in different parts, when an animal is killed; and this was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a very favourable omen to the intended expedition. After being expoſed for ſome time, the entrails were carried and laid down before the prieſts. While one of them prayed, another cloſely inſpected the entrials, and continued tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them gently with a ſtick. Having been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently examined, they were thrown into the fire. The ſacrificed pig, and its liver, heart, &amp;c. were now put upon the ſcaffold were the dog had been depoſited; and then all the feathers, except the oſtrich plume, being encloſed in the ark, an end was put to the whole ſolemnity.</p>
                     <p>Four double canoes remained upon the beach, all the morning, before the place of ſacrifice. A ſmall platform, covered with palm-leaves, faſtened in myſterious knots, was fixed on the fore part of each of theſe canoes; and this alſo is called a <hi>morai.</hi> Some plantains, cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, fiſh, and other articles, lay upon each of theſe naval <hi>morais.</hi> The natives ſaid, that they belonged to the <hi>Eatooa,</hi> and that they were to attend the fleet that was to be ſent out againſt Eimeo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="348" facs="unknown:030274_0408_0FE56E9E10C95148"/>The unfortunate victim, offered on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was to appearance, a middle-aged man, and was one of the loweſt claſs of the people. But it did not appear that they had fixed upon him on account of his having committed any particular crime, that deſerved death. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, however, that they uſually ſelect ſuch guilty perſons for their ſacrifices, or elſe, vagabonds, who have no viſible way of procuring an honeſt livelihood. Our gentlemen having examined the appearance of the body of the unhappy ſufferer, now offered up to the object of theſe people's worſhip, obſerved, that it was bloody about the head and face, and much bruiſed upon the right temple, which denoted the manner in which he had been killed. And they were informed, that he had been knocked on the head with a ſtone.</p>
                     <p>The wretches, who are deſtined to ſuffer on theſe occaſions, are never previouſly apprized of their fate. Whenever any one of the principal chiefs deems a human ſacrifice neceſſary, on any great emergency, he fixes upon the victim, and then diſpatches ſome of his truſty ſervants, who fall upon him ſuddenly, and either ſtone him to death, or beat out his brains with a club. The ſovereign is next acquainted with it, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is ſaid to be abſolutely requiſite at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn rites that follow; and, indeed, on the late occaſion, Otoo bore a capital part. The ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity itſelf is termed <hi>Poore Eree,</hi> or the prayer of
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:030274_0409_0FE56E9F990F9E70"/>
the chief; and the victim is called <hi>Taata-tahoo,</hi> or conſecrated man.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>morai,</hi> were the late ſacrifice was offered, is always appropriated for the burial of the king of the whole iſland, and likewiſe of his family, and ſome other perſons of diſtinguiſhed rank. It differs little, except in extent, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>morais.</hi> Its principal part is a large oblong pile of ſtones, about thirteen feet in heigth, and contracted towards the top, with a quadrangular area on each ſide, looſely paved with pebbles, under which the bones of the chiefs are depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Not far from the end neareſt the ſea, is the place of ſacrifice, where is a very large <hi>whatta,</hi> or ſcaffold, on which the offerings of fruits, and other vegetables, are placed; but the animals are laid on a ſmaller one, and the human ſacrifices are interred under the pavement. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reliques ſcattered about the place; ſuch as ſmall ſtones raiſed in various parts of the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome with bits of cloth faſtened round them, others entirely covered with it; and, upon the ſide of the large pile, fronting the area, are a great number of pieces of carved wood, in which their gods are ſuppoſed to reſide occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally. There is a heap of ſtones, at one end of the large ſcaffold, with a ſort of platform on one ſide. On this they depoſit all the ſkulls of the human ſacrifices, which they take up after they have remained under ground for ſome months.
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:030274_0410_0FE56EA1B4E08790"/>
Juſt above them, many of the carved pieces of wood are placed; and here the <hi>maro,</hi> and the other bundle, which was ſuppoſed to contain the God <hi>Ooro,</hi> were laid, during the celebration of the late ſolemn rites.</p>
                     <p>It is probable, that this barbarous cuſtom of offering human victims, prevails in all or moſt of the iſlands of the Pacific Ocean, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from each other ſome of them may be. And though we ſhould ſuppoſe, that not more than one perſon is ſacrificed at one time, either at Otaheite, or other iſlands; yet theſe occaſions, in all probability, occur ſo frequently, as to make a terrible havock of the human ſpecies; for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook reckoned no leſs than forty-nine ſkulls, of former victims, lying before the <hi>morai,</hi> at Attahooroo; and as none of thoſe ſkulls appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ſuffered any conſiderable change, or decay, from the weather, it may be inferred, that but a ſhort time had elapſed ſince theſe victims had been offered. This horrid practice, though no conſideration whatever can make it ceaſe to be deteſtable, might, perhaps, be thought leſs detrimental, in ſome reſpects, if it contributed to impreſs any awe for the Deity, or veneration for religion, upon the minds of the ſpectators. But this was ſo far from being the caſe on the late occaſion, that though a vaſt multitude of people had aſſembled at the <hi>morai,</hi> they ſhewed very little reverence for what was tranſacting.
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:030274_0411_0FE56EA7B4E71740"/>
And Omai happening to arrive, after the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies had begun, many of the iſlanders throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round him, and were engaged, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the time, in making him recount ſome of his adventures; to which they liſtened with great eagerneſs of attention, regardleſs of the ſolemn offices which their prieſts were then performing. Indeed, the prieſts themſelves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the one who ſuſtained the principal part, either from their being familiarized to ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or from their repoſing no great degree of confidence in the efficacy of their religous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, maintained very little of that ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which is neceſſary to give to acts of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their proper effect. Their habit was but an ordinary one; they converſed together with great familiarity; and the only attempt they made to preſerve decorum, was by exerting their authority to prevent the populace from encroaching on the very ſpot where the rites were performed, and to ſuffer our gentlemen, as ſtrangers, to come forward. They were, however, very candid in the anſwers which they gave to any interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that were put to them, with regard to this inhuman inſtitution. And, particularly, on being aſked, what was the deſign of it, they replied that it was an ancient cuſtom and was highly agreeable to their god, who came and fed upon the ſacrifices; in conſequence of which, he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their petitions. It was then objected, that he
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:030274_0412_0FE56EA96C245AA0"/>
certainly did not feed on theſe, as he was neither obſerved to do it, nor were the bodies of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed animals ſoon conſumed; and that as to the corpſe of a human victim, they prevented his feeding on that, by interring it. In anſwer to theſe objections, they gave it as their opinion, that he came in the night, inviſibly, and fed only on the ſoul or immaterial part, which (theſe people ſay) remain about the place of ſacrifice, till the carcaſe of the victim is totally waſted by putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>Human ſacrifices are not the only barbarous cuſtom that ſtill prevails amongſt the inhabitants of Otaheite, though, in many other reſpects, they have emerged from the brutal manners of ſavage life. Beſides cutting out the jaw bones of their enemies ſlain in battle, which they carry about with them as trophies, they, in ſome meaſure, offer up their bodies to the <hi>Eatooa.</hi> Soon after an engagement, in which they have come off vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, they collect all the dead, and bring them to the <hi>morai,</hi> where, with great form and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, they dig a large hole, and bury them all in it, as ſo many offerings to their divinities.</p>
                     <p>They treat, in a different manner, their own cheifs that fall in battle. Their late king Too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taha, Tubourai-tamaide, and another chief, who were all ſlain in an engagement with thoſe of Tiaraboo, were brought to the <hi>morai</hi> at Attahoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roo. There the prieſts cut out the bowels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:030274_0413_0FE56EAAF40788C8"/>
the great alter; and their dead bodies were afterwards interred in three different places, near the great pile of ſtones above-mentioned; and the common men, who loſt their lives in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, were all buried in one hole, at the foot of the ſame pile. This was performed the day after the battle, with much pomp and formality, amidſt a numerous concourſe of people, as a thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offering to the Deity, for the victory they had obtained the preceding day. The vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the mean time, had taken refuge in the mountains, where they remained upwards of a week, till the fury of the victors began to abate. A treaty was then ſet on foot, by which it was agreed, that Otoo ſhould be proclaimed king of the whole iſland; and the ſolemnity of inveſting him with the <hi>maro,</hi> or badge of royalty, was performed at the ſame <hi>morai,</hi> with great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AT the cloſe of the very extraordinary ſcene, exhibited at the <hi>morai,</hi> and particularly deſcribed in the laſt chapter, our party embarked about twelve o'clock, in order to return to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavai; and in their way, paid a viſit to Towha, who had continued in the little iſland, where they met him the preceding day. Some converſation on public affairs paſſed between Otoo and him; and the latter entreated Captain Cook, once more, to join them as an ally, in their war againſt Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo. By his poſitive refuſal he entirely loſt the good opinion of this chief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="unknown:030274_0415_0FE56DFC027AB848"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="355" facs="unknown:030274_0416_0FE56EB4B24435B8"/>Before they ſeparated, he interrogated our gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen concerning the ſolemnity, at which they had been preſent; and aſked, particularly, if it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their expectations; what opinion they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of its efficacy; and whether ſuch acts of worſhip were frequent in their own country? They had been ſilent during the celebration of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ceremony; but, as ſoon as it was completed, freely expreſſed their ſentiments upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to Otoo, and his attendants; conſequently Captain Cook did not conceal his deteſtation of it, in this converſation with Towha. Excluſive of the barbarity of the bloody cuſtom, he urged the unreaſonableneſs of it, alledging that ſuch a ſacrifice, inſtead of making the <hi>Eatooa</hi> propitious to their nation, would excite his vengeance; and that, from this very circumſtance, he concluded, that their intended expedition againſt Maheine, would be unſucceſsful. This was proceeding to great lengths upon conjecture; but there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle danger of being miſtaken; for reſpecting this war, there were three parties in this iſland, one violent for it, another perfectly indifferent about it; and the third avowed ſupporters of Maheine, and his cauſe. Under theſe circumſtances, it was not probable that ſuch a plan of military opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be ſettled, as could inſure ſucceſs. Omai acted as interpreter, in conveying the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's ſentiments to Towha, on the ſubject of the late horrid ſacrifice; and he ſupported his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:030274_0417_0FE56EB6A7390BD0"/>
with ſuch ſpirit, that the chief appeared to be extremely angry; eſpecially, on being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that if he had taken away the life of a man in England, as he had done here, his rank would not have protected him from an ignominious death. Upon this, he exclaimed, <hi>maeno! maeno!</hi> (vile! vile!) and would not hear a ſyllable more about it. Many of the natives were preſent at this debate; particularly the attendants and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Towha; and when Omai mentioned the puniſhment that would in England be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the greateſt man, if he dared to kill the meaneſt ſervant, they liſtened very attentively; and perhaps, on this ſubject, they thought differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently from their maſter.</p>
                     <p>Leaving Towha, our gentlemen proceeded to Oparre, where Otoo ſolicited them to paſs the night. They landed in the evening; and, on their way to his habitation, had an opportunity of obſerving how theſe people amuſe themſelves, in their private <hi>heevas.</hi> They ſaw about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them ſitting in a houſe: in the midſt of whom were two women, and an old man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind each of them, beating gently upon a drum; and the women, at intervals, ſinging with great ſoftneſs and delicacy. The aſſembly were very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, and ſeemed, as it were, abſorbed in the pleaſure the muſic gave them; few of them tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any notice of the ſtrangers, and the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers never once ceaſing. When the party arrived
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:030274_0418_0FE56EB82FD78B18"/>
at Otoo's houſe, it was almoſt dark. Here they were entertained with one of their public <hi>heevas,</hi> or plays, in which his three ſiſters repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the principal characters. This they call a <hi>heeva raä,</hi> and no perſon is ſuffered to enter the houſe or area, where it is exhibited. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the caſe, when the royal ſiſters are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers. Their dreſs on this occaſion, was truly elegant and pictureſque, and they acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves in a very diſtinguiſhed manner; though ſome comic interludes, wherein four men were the performers, ſeemed to afford greater entertainment to the audience, which was numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The Captain and his companions proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the next morning, to Matavai, leaving Otoo at Oparre; but his mother, ſiſters, and many other women, attended the Captain on board, and Otoo followed a ſhort time after.</p>
                     <p>While Otoo and Captain Cook had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the ſhips, they had been ſparingly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with fruit, and had not many viſitors. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their return we had abundance of company and proviſion. On the 4th, a party of us, among whom was Otoo, dined aſhore with Omai, who provided excellent fare, conſiſting of fiſh, fowls, pork, and puddings. Dinner being over, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook accompanied Otoo back to his dewl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where he found all his ſervants buſy in getting a quantity of proviſion ready for him. Amongſt other articles, there was a large hog,
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:030274_0419_0FE56EB9CF3599B8"/>
which they killed in his preſence. There was alſo a large pudding; the whole proceſs in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the Captain ſaw. It was compoſed of bread-fruit, plantains, taro, and plam or pandanus-nuts, each raſped, ſcraped, or beat up fine, and baked by itſelf. A quantity of the juice of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa-nut-kernels, was put into a kind of wooden tray. The other articles, hot from the oven, were put into this veſſel; together with ſome hot ſtones, in order to make the contents ſimmer. Three or four perſons were employed in ſtirring up the ſeveral ingredients till they were perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incorporated, and the juice of the cocoa-nut was, turned to oil; and the whole maſs, at laſt, was nearly of the conſiſtency of a haſty-pudding. The hog being baked, and the pudding being made, they, together with two living hogs, ſome bread fruit and cocoa-nuts, were ſent on board the Captain's ſhip in a canoe, followed by him and all the royal family.</p>
                     <p>A young ram, of the Cape-bread, that had been lambed, and carefully brought up on board Captain Cook's ſhip, was killed by a dog the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day. This was the more to be regretted at it was the only one of that breed that we had; and only one of the Engliſh breed was now remaining.</p>
                     <p>On the 7th, in the evening, we exhibited ſome fire-works before a vaſt concourſe of people, ſome of whom were highly entertained, but the
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:030274_0420_0FE548A86B26E000"/>
greater number were much terrified with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition; inſomuch, that they could hardly be prevailed on to keep together to ſee the whole of the entertainment. What concluded the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, was a table-rocket. It flew off the table and diſperſed the whole crowd in an inſtant; even the moſt reſolute amongſt them now fled with precipitation.</p>
                     <p>A party of us dined, the next day, with Oedidee, on fiſh and pork. The hog, which weighed about thirty pounds, was alive, dreſſed and upon the table within the hour. Soon af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Captain accordingly attended him to his father's where he ſaw ſeveral people employed in dreſſing two girls, with fine cloth, after a very ſingular faſhion. There were ſeveral pieces of cloth, and the one end of each piece was held over the heads of the girls, while the remainder was wrapped round their bodies, under the arm-pits. The upper ends were then ſuffered to fall down, and hang in folds to the ground, over the other. Round the outſide of all, were then wrapped ſeveral pieces of cloth of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours, which conſiderably increaſed the ſize; it being five or ſix yards in circuit; and the weight of this ſingular attire, was as much as the poor girls could well ſupport. To each were
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:030274_0421_0FE56EBDDCF6A088"/>
hung two <hi>taames,</hi> or breaſt-plates, in order to embeliſh the whole, and give it a pictureſque ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. Thus equipped, they were taken on board the ſhip, together with ſeveral hogs, and a quantity of fruit, which, together with this cloth, was a preſent to Captain Cook from Otoo's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thoſe who are dreſſed in this manner, are called <hi>atee;</hi> but, this ceremony is never perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except where large preſents of cloth are to be made. We never ſaw it practiſed upon any other occaſion; but both Captain Cook and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke had cloth preſented to them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, wrapped round the bearers in the ſame manner. The next day, Captain Cook received a preſent of five hogs, and ſome fruit, from Otoo; and one hog, and ſome fruit from each of his ſiſters. Other proviſions were alſo in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Great quantities of mackarel had been caught here by the natives, for two or three ſucceſſive days; ſome of which were ſold on board the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Otoo was equally attentive to ſupply our wants, and contribute to our amuſement. On the 10th, he treated a party of us at Oparre, with a play. His three ſiſters were the performers, and their dreſſes were new and elegant, much more ſo than we had met with in any of theſe iſlands.</p>
                     <p>The principal object, however, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had now in view, in going to Oparre, was to ſee an embalmed corpſe, near the reſidence of Otoo. On enquiry, he found it to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains

of Tee, a chief whom he well knew, when he laſt viſited this iſland. It was lying in an elegant <hi>toopapaoo,</hi> in all reſpects ſimilar to that at Oheitepeha, in which the remains of Waheia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dooa are depoſited. We found the body was under cover, within the <hi>toopapaoo,</hi> and wrapped up in cloth. At the Captain's deſire, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had the care of it, brought it out, and placed it on a kind of bier, ſo as to give a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect view of it; but we were not admitted within the pales that encloſed the <hi>toopapaoo.</hi> The corpſe having been thus exhibited, he ornamented the place with mats and cloths, diſpoſed in ſuch a manner as to produce a pleaſing effect. The body was entire in every part; and putrefaction ſeemed hardly to be begun, not the leaſt diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſmell proceeding from it; though this is one of the hotteſt climates, and Tee had been above four months dead. There was, indeed, a ſhrinking of the muſcular parts and eyes, but the hair and nails were in their original ſtate, and the ſeveral joints were pliable. On enquiry into their method of preſerving their dead bodies, we were informed, that, ſoon after they are dead, they are diſembowelled, by drawing the inteſtines, and other <hi>viſcera,</hi> out at the <hi>anus,</hi> and the whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is ſtuffed with cloth; and when any moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appeared, it was immediately dried up, and the bodies rubbed all over with perfumed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa-nut-oil; which, frequently repeated, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:030274_0424_0FE56EC01D93CED0"/>
them ſeveral months; after which they moulder away gradually. Omai informed us, that the bodies of all their great men, who die a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death, are thus preſerved; and are expoſed to public view for a very conſiderable time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. At firſt, they are exhibited every fine day; afterwards, the intervals become greater and greater; and, at laſt, they are very ſeldom to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>We quitted Oparre in the evening, leaving Otoo, and all the royal family. The Captain ſaw none of them till the 12th; when all, except the chief himſelf, honoured him with a viſit. He was gone, they ſaid, at Attahooroo, to aſſiſt at another human ſacrifice, ſent by the chief of Tiaraboo to be offered up at the <hi>morai.</hi> This ſecond inſtance, within ſo ſhort a period, was a melancholy proof, that the victims of his bloody ſuperſtition are very numerous amongſt this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane people. The Captain would have been preſent at this ſacrifice alſo, had he been earlier informed of it, but now it was too late. For the ſame reaſon, he omitted being preſent at a public tranſaction, at Oparre, the preceeding day, when Otoo, with great ſolemnity, reſtored to the adherents of the late king Tootaha, the lands and poſſeſſions, of which, after his death they had been deprived.</p>
                     <p>Otoo returned the next evening, from exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the moſt diſagreeable of his royal duties;

and, the next day, being honoured with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the Captains Cook and Clerke, mounted on horſeback, and rode round the plain of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavai, to the aſtoniſhment of a vaſt train of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators. Once or twice, before this, Omai had, indeed, attempted to get on a horſe; but he had as often fallen off, before he could contrive to ſeat himſelf properly; this was, therefore, the firſt time they had ſeen any body on horſeback. What the Captains had begun, was repeated dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by one or another of our people; and yet the curioſity of the natives continued unabated. After they had ſeen the uſe that was made of theſe animals, they were exceedingly delighted with them; and we were of opinion, that they conveyed to them a better idea of the greatneſs of other nations, than all the novelties that their European viſitors had carried amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>The next day, Etary, or Olla, the God of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labola, removed from the neighbourhood of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavai, to Oparre, attended by ſeveral ſailing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes. Otoo, we were told, did not approve of his being ſo near our ſtation, where his people could more conveniently invade our property. Otoo, it muſt be acknowledged, took every pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent method to prevent thefts and robberies; and it was principally owing to his regulations, that ſo few were committed. He had erected a ſmall houſe or two, behind our poſt; and two others near our tents, between the river and the
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:030274_0427_0FE548A6DE10EA28"/>
ſea. Some of his own people continually kept watch in all theſe places; and, as his father uſually reſided at Matavai Point, we were, in a manner, ſurrounded by them. They not only defended us in the night from thieves, but they had an opportunity of obſerving every thing that paſſed in the day; and were ready to receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions from ſuch girls, as were privately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with our people, which was uſually done every morning; ſo that the meaſures he had taken to ſecure our ſafety, anſwered the more eſſential purpoſe of enlarging his own profits.</p>
                     <p>Otoo acquainted Captain Cook, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was required at Oparre, where an audience was to be given to the great perſonage from Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labola, and begged he would accompany him thither. The Captain readily conſented, expect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to meet with ſomething deſerving his notice. Accordingly, they ſet out on the 16th, attended by Mr. Anderſon. Nothing, however, occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that was intereſting or curious. Etary and his followers preſented ſome coarſe cloth and hogs to Otoo, with ſome ceremony, and a ſet ſpeech. After this a conſultation was held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and ſome other chiefs, about their expedition to Eimeo. Etary, at firſt, diſapproved of it; but his objections were at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled. It appeared, indeed, the next day, that it was too late to deliberate upon this buſineſs; for, in the evening, a meſſenger arrived with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:030274_0428_0FE56EC8F99FDC90"/>
that there had been ſome ſkirmiſhes, but that the loſs or advantage, on either ſide, was inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook, Mr. Anderſon, and Omai, in the morning of the 18th, went again to Oparre, accompanied by Otoo; taking with them the ſheep which the Captain intended to leave upon the iſland. They conſiſted of an Engliſh ram and ewe, and three Cape ewes; all which he made a preſent of to Otoo. All the three cows had taken the bull; he therefore thought it adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to devide them, and carry ſome to Ulietea. With this view, he ordered them to be brought before him, and propoſed to Etary, that if he would leave his bull with Otoo, he ſhould have this and one of the cows. To this propoſal, Etary, at firſt, ſtarted ſome objections; but, at laſt, agreed to it; however, as the cattle were putting into the boat, one of Etary's followers oppoſed the making an exchange whatever.</p>
                     <p>The Captain, upon this, ſuſpecting that Etary had agreed to the arrangement, for the preſent, only to pleaſe him, dropped the idea of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; and finally determined to leave them all with Otoo; whom he ſtrictly enjoined not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be removed from Oparre, till he ſhould have got a ſtock of young ones; which he might then diſpoſe of to his friends, or ſend to the neighbouring iſlands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="366" facs="unknown:030274_0429_0FE56ECB4BA35308"/>This matter being ſettled, our gentlemen left Etary and his party, and attended Otoo to another place, not far diſtant, where they found the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of a chief, waiting with a hog, a pig, and a dog, as a preſent from their maſter to the king. Theſe were delivered with the uſual ceremonies, and an harangue, in which the ſpeaker enquired after the health of Otoo, and of his principle people. This compliment was re-echoed in the name of Otoo, by one of his miniſters; and then the diſpute with Eimeo was formally diſcuſſed. The deputies of this chief were advocates for proſecuting the war with vigour, adviſing Otoo to offer a human ſacrifice on the occaſion. A chief, who conſtantly attended the perſon of Otoo oppoſed it, ſeemingly with great ſtrength of argument. The Captain was now confirmed in his opinion, that Otoo never entered heartily into the ſpirit of this war. He received repeated meſſages from Towha, urging him to haſten to his aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Having dined with Otoo, our party returned to Matavai, leaving him at Oparre. This day, and the 19th, we were very ſparingly ſupplied with fruit. Otoo being informed of this, he and his brother, who had particularly attached him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Captain Clerke, came from Oparre, with a large ſupply for both ſhips. All the royal family came the next day with preſents, ſo that we now had more proviſions than we could conſume.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="367" facs="unknown:030274_0430_0FE56ECCE7B8F9D0"/>Our water being all on board, and every thing put in order, the Captain began to think of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the iſland, that he might have a ſufficient time for viſiting others in this neighbourhood. We therefore removed our obſervatories and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments from the ſhore, and bent the ſails.</p>
                     <p>Early the next morning, Otoo came on board to inform Captain Cook, that the war canoes of Matavai, and of three other diſtricts, were going to join thoſe belonging to Oparre, and that part of the iſland; and that there would be a general review there. The ſquadron of Matavai was ſoon after in motion; and after parading for ſome time about the bay, aſſembled aſhore, near the middle of it. Captain Cook now went in his boat to take a ſurvey of them.</p>
                     <p>What they call their war canoes, which are thoſe with ſtages, on which they ſight, amount to about ſixty in number; there are nearly as many more of a ſmaller ſize. The Captain was ready to have attended them to Oparre; but the chiefs ſoon after formed a reſolution, that they would not move till the next day. This appeared to be a fortunate delay, as it afforded him ſome opportunity of getting ſome inſight into their manner of fighting. He therefore deſired Otoo to give orders, that ſome of them ſhould go through the neceſſary manoeuvres. Accordingly, two of them were ordered out into the bay; in one of which Otoo Capt. Cook, and Mr. King, embarked,
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:030274_0431_0FE56ECEC0D228C8"/>
and Omai went on board the other. As ſoon as they had got ſufficient ſea-room, they faced, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and retreated by turns, as quick as their rowers could paddle. In the mean time, the warriors on the ſtages flouriſhed their weapons, and played a variety of anticks, which could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no other purpoſe than that of rouſing their paſſions, to prepare them for the onſet. Otoo ſtood by the ſide of one ſtage, giving the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary orders, when to advance, and when to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. Great judgment, and a very quick eye, ſeemed requiſite in this department, to ſeize eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantage, and to avoid every diſadvantage. At length, after ſeveral times advancing to, and retreating from each other, the two canoes, cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtage to ſtage; and after a ſevere, though ſhort conflict, all the troops on Otoo's ſtage were ſuppoſed to be killed, and Omai and his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates boarded them, when inſtantly Otoo, and all the paddlers in his canoe, leaped into the ſea, as if reduced to the neceſſity of preſerving their lives by ſwimming.</p>
                     <p>According to Omai's information; their naval engagements are not always conducted in this manner. They ſometimes laſh the two veſſels together, head to head, and fight till the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors on one ſide or the other are killed. But this cloſe combat it never practiſed, except when the contending parties are determined to conquer or die. Indeed, one or the other muſt infallibly
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:030274_0432_0FE56ED4F4566448"/>
happen; for they never give quarter, unleſs it be to reſerve their priſoners for a more cruel death the day following.</p>
                     <p>All the power and ſtrength of theſe iſlands lie ſolely in their navies. A general engagement on land we never heard of here; and all there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive battles are fought on the water. When the time and place of battle are fixed upon by both parties, the preceding day and night are ſpent in feaſting and diverſions. When the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing approaches, they launch the canoes, make every neceſſary preparation, and, with the day, begin the battle; the fate of which, in general, decides the diſpute. The vanquiſhed endeavour to ſave themſelves by a precipitate flight; and thoſe who reach the ſhore fly, with their friends, to the mountains; for the victors, before their fury abates, ſpare neither the aged, nor women, or children. They aſſemble the next day, at the <hi>morai,</hi> to return thanks to the <hi>Eatooa</hi> for the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and offer up the ſlain and the priſoners, as ſacrifices. A treaty is then ſet on foot; and the conquerors uſually obtain their own terms; by which large diſtricts of land, and even whole iſlands, ſometimes change their owners. Omai ſaid he was once taken a priſoner by the men of Bolabola, and conducted to that iſland, where he and many others would have ſuffered death the next day, had they not been fortunate enough to eſcape in the night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="370" facs="unknown:030274_0433_0FE56ED6A9A6D780"/>This mock-fight being over, Omai put on his ſuit of armour, mounted a ſtage in one of the canoes, and, thus equipped, was pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled all along the ſhore of the bay, that every one might have a perfect view of him. His coat of mail, however, did not engage the attention of the multitude ſo much as was expected. The novelty was in a great degree loſt upon ſome of them, who had ſeen a part of it before; and there were others, who had conceived ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to Omai, from his folly and imprudence at this place, that they would hardly look at any thing that was exhibited by him, however ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and new.</p>

                     <p>OTOO, and his father, came on board, in the morning of the 22d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to know when Captain Cook propoſed ſailing. For, hearing
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030274_0444_0FE56F56728B4520"/>
that there was a good harbour at Eimeo, he had informed them, that he ſhould viſit that iſland on his paſſage to Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>heine; and they propoſed to accompany him, and that their fleet ſhould ſail at the ſame time to reinforce Towha. Being ready to take his departure, he ſubmitted to them the appointment of the day; and the Wedneſday following was determined upon; when he was to receive on board Otoo, his father, mother, and the whole family. Theſe points being agreed on, the Captain propoſed immediately ſetting out for Oparre, where all the fleet was to aſſemble this day, and to be reviewed.</p>
                     <p>As Captain Cook was getting into his boat, news arrived that a treaty had been concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Towha and Maheine, and Towha's fleet had returned to Attahooroo. From this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected event, the war canoes, inſtead of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſing at Oparre, were ordered to their reſpective diſtricts. Captain Cook, however, followed Otoo to Oparre, accompanied by Mr. King and Omai. Soon after their arrival, a meſſenger arrived from Eimeo, and related the conditions of the peace, or rather truce, it being only for a limitted time. The terms being diſadvantageous to Otaheite, Otoo was ſeverely cenſured, whoſe delay, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforcements, had obliged Towha to ſubmit to a diſgraceful accommodation. It was even currently reported, that Towha, reſenting the treatment he had received, had declared, that
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:030274_0445_0FE56F2368639598"/>
immediately after Captain Cook's departure, he would join his forces to thoſe of Tiaraboo, and attack Otoo. This called upon the Captain to declare, that he was determined to eſpouſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his friend: and that whoever preſumed to attack him, ſhould experience the weight of his diſpleaſure, when he returned to their iſland.</p>
                     <p>This declaration, probably, had the deſired effect, and, if Towha did entertain any ſuch hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile intention at firſt, we heard no more of the report. Whappai, the father of Otoo, highly diſapproved of the peace, and cenſured Towha for concluding it. This old man wiſely conſidered that Captain Cook's going with them to Eimeo, might have been of ſingular ſervice to their cauſe, though he ſhould not interfere in the quarrel. He therefore concluded, that Otoo had acted prudently in waiting for the Captain; though it prevented his giving that early aſſiſtance to Towha which he expected.</p>
                     <p>While we were debating on this ſubject at Oparre, a meſſenger arrived from Towha, deſiring the attendance of Otoo the next day, at the <hi>moria</hi> in Attahooroo, to return thanks, to the Gods for the peace he had concluded. Captain Cook was aſked to attend; but being much out of order, choſe rather to decline it. Deſirous, however, of knowing what ceremony might be exhibited on ſo memorable an occaſion, he ſent Mr. King and Omai to obſerve the particulars, and returned to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030274_0446_0FE56F666F66E728"/>
his ſhip, attended by Otoo's mother, his three ſiſters, and ſeveral other woman. At firſt, the Captain imagined that this numerous train came into his boat, in order to get a paſſage to Matavai. But they aſſured him, they intended paſſing the night on board, for the purpoſe of curing the diſorder he complained of; which was a rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic pain, extending from the hip to the foot. He accepted the friendly offer, had a bed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them upon the cabin floor, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to their directions. He was firſt deſired to lie down amongſt them, when all thoſe who could get near him, began to ſqueeze him with both hands all over the body, but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on the parts complained of, till they made his bones crack, and his fleſh became almoſt a mummy. In ſhort, after ſuffering this ſevere diſcipline about a quarter of an hour, he was happy to get away from them. The operation, however, gave him immediate relief, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him to a repetition of the ſame diſcipline, before he retired to bed; and it was ſo effectual, that he found himſelf pretty eaſy the whole night after. His female phyſicians very obligingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated their preſcription the next morning, before they left him, and again in the evening, when they returned; after which, the cure being perfected, they took their leave of the Captain the following morning. This is called <hi>romee,</hi> among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, an operation far exceeding that of the fleſh-bruſh,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030274_0447_0FE56F2888D27BE0"/>
or any external friction. It is univerſally practiſed amongſt theſe iſlanders, and generally by women. If, at any time, a perſon appears languid and tired, and ſits down by any of them, they practiſe the <hi>romee</hi> upon his legs; and it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways has an excellent effect.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 25th of September, Otoo, Mr. King, and Omai, returned from Attahooroo; and Mr. King gave a narrative of what he had ſeen to the following effect: "At ſun-ſet, we embarked in a canoe, and left Oparre. About nine o'clock we landed at that extremity of Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taha, which joins to Attahooroo. The meeting of Otoo and Towha, I expected, would be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting. Otoo and his attendants ſeated themſelves on the beach, near the canoe in which Towha ſat. He was then aſleep; but being awakened, and Otoo's name being metioned to him, a plantain-tree and dog were immediately laid at Otoo's feet; and ſeveral of Towha's people came and converſed with him. After I had been, for ſome time, ſeated cloſe to Otoo, Towha neither ſtirring from his canoe, nor ſaying any thing to us, I repaired to him. He aſked me if <hi>Toote</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with him; I anſwered, No; and that he was his <hi>taio</hi>; and that I was ordered to go to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tahooroo, to let him know it. Omai then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a long converſation with this chief; but I could not gather any information from him. On my returning to Otoo, he deſired that I ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030274_0448_0FE56F602C5B8B88"/>
go to eat, and then to ſleep; in conſequence of which Omai and I left him. On queſtioning Omai on that head, he ſaid, Towha was lame, and therefore could not ſtir; but that Otoo and he would ſoon converſe together in private. This was probably true; for thoſe we left with Otoo came to us in a little time; and about ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after, Otoo himſelf arrived, when we all went to ſleep in his canoe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>kava</hi> was the next morning in great plenty. One man drank to ſuch exceſs that he loſt his ſenſes, and appeared to be convulſed. He was held by two men, who buſied themſelves in pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his hair by the roots. I left this ſpectacle to ſee a more affecting one. It was the meeting of Towha and his wife, and a young girl, who was ſaid to be his daughter. After the ceremony of cutting their heads, and diſcharging plenty of blood and tears, they waſhed, embraced the chief, and ſeemed perfectly unconcerned. But the young girl's ſufferings were not yet concluded. Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diri (Oberea's ſon) arrived; and ſhe, with great compoſure, repeated thoſe ceremonies to him which ſhe had juſt performed on meeting her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Towha having brought a war-canoe from Eimeo, I enquired if he had killed the people belonging to her; and was informed, that there was not a perſon in her when ſhe was captured.</p>
                     <p>About ten or eleven o'clock we left Tettaha, and landed cloſe to the <hi>morai</hi> of Attahooroo early
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030274_0449_0FE56F0DD9E25F90"/>
in the afternoon. Three canoes lay hauled upon the beach, oppoſite the <hi>morai,</hi> having three hogs in each. We expected the ſolemnity would have been performed the ſame afternoon; but nothing was done, as neither Towha nor Potatou had joined us. A chief came from Eimeo with a ſmall pig, and a plantain-tree, which he placed at Otoo's feet. They converſed ſome time together, and the Eimeo chief often repeating the words <hi>Warry, Warry,</hi> "falſe." Otoo was probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to him what he had heard, and the other contradicted it.</p>
                     <p>The next day, Towha and Potatou, with ſeven or eight large canoes, arrived, and landed near the <hi>morai.</hi> Several plantain-trees were brought to Otoo, on behalf of different chiefs. Towha re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his canoe. The ceremony was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced by the principal prieſt, who brought out the <hi>maro,</hi> wrapped up in a bundle of a conic ſhape. Theſe were placed at the head of what I ſuppoſed to be a grave. Then three prieſts ſat down, at the other end of the grave; having with them a plantain-tree, a branch of ſome other kind of tree, and the ſheath of the flower of the cocoa-nut-tree.</p>
                     <p>The prieſts ſeparately repeated ſentences; and at intervals, two, and ſometimes all three, chanted a melancholy ditty, very little attended to by the natives. This kind of recitative continued near an hour. Then, after a ſhort prayer, the chief
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030274_0450_0FE56F0C524FB6B0"/>
prieſt uncovered the <hi>maro,</hi> and Otoo roſe up, and warpped it about him, holding in his hand a bonnet, compoſed of the red feathrs of the tropic bird, mixed with other blackiſh feathers. He ſtooped oppoſite the three prieſts, who continued their prayers for about ten minutes; when a man riſing ſuddenly from the crowd, ſaid ſomething ending with <hi>heiva!</hi> and the crowd echoed back to him three times <hi>Earee!</hi> The company then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the oppoſite ſide of a large pile of ſtones, where is the kings <hi>morai</hi>; which is not much unlike a large grave. Here the ſame ceremony was again performed, and with three cheers. The <hi>maro</hi> was now warpped up, and ornamented by the addition of a ſmall piece of red feathers.</p>
                     <p>The people now proceeded to a large hut, near the <hi>morai,</hi> where they ſeated themſelves in ſolemn order. An oration was then made by a man of Tiaraboo, which ended in about three minutes. He was followed by a man of Attahooroo; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatou ſpoke next, and with much more fluency and grace than any of them. Tooteo, Otoo's orator, exhibited after him, and then a man from Eimeo. Some other Speeches were made, but not attended to. Omai ſaid, that the ſubſtance of their ſpeeches recommended friendſhip, and not fighting; but as many of the ſpeakers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed themſelves with great warmth, there were, perhaps, ſome recriminations and proteſtations of their future good intentions. In the midſt of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030274_0451_0FE56F8A8357A2F8"/>
their harangues a man of Attahooroo roſe up, having a ſling faſtened to his waiſt, and a large ſtone upon his ſhoulder. After parading for about fifteen minutes in the open ſpace, and chanting a few ſhort ſentences, he threw the ſtone down. This ſtone, together with a plantain-tree that lay at Otoo's feet, were, at the concluſion of the ſpeeches, carried to the <hi>morai;</hi> one of the prieſts, and Otoo with him, ſaying ſomething upon the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Returning to Oparre, the ſea-breeze having ſet in, we were obliged to land, and had a pleaſant walk from Tettaha to Oparre. A tree, with two large bundles of dried leaves ſuſpended upon it, pointed out the boundary of the two diſtricts. We were accompanied by the man who had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the ceremony of the ſtone and ſling. With him Otoo's father held a long converſation, and appeared extremely angry. He was enraged, as I underſtood, at the part which Towha had taken in the Eimeo buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>From what can be judged of this ſolemnity, as related by Mr. King, it had not been only a thankſgiving, as Omai told us, but rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the treaty. The grave, mentioned by Mr. King, appears to be the very ſpot where the celebration of the rites began, when the human ſacrifice was offered, at which Captain Cook was preſent, and before which the victim was laid. It is here alſo, that they firſt inveſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030274_0452_0FE56F40E46BDA40"/>
their kings with the <hi>maro.</hi> Omai, who had ſeen the ceremony when Otoo was made king, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the whole ſolemnity, when we were here; which is nearly the ſame as that now deſcribed by Mr. King; though, perhaps, upon a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent occaſion. The plantain-tree is always the firſt thing introduced in all their religious cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as well as in all their public and private debates; and, probably, on many other occaſions. While Towha was at Eimeo, he ſent one or more meſſengers to Otoo every day. Every meſſenger, at all times, carried a young plantain-tree in his hand, which he laid at the feet of Otoo, before he mentioned his errand; then ſeated himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and related the particulars of his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. When two men are in ſuch high diſpute that blows are expected to enſue, if one ſhould lay a plantain-tree before the other, they both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cool, and proceed in the argument without further animoſity. It is, indeed, the olive branch of theſe people on all occaſions.</p>
                     <p>As our friends knew that we were upon the point of ſailing, they all paid us a viſit on the 26th, and brought more hogs with them than we wanted; for, having no ſalt left to preſerve any, we had fully ſufficient for our preſent uſe.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook accompanied Otoo, the next day, to Oparre; and before he left it, took a ſurvey of the cattle and poultry, which he had conſigned to his friend's care. Every thing was in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030274_0453_0FE56F0FB9A1BD08"/>
way; and ſeemed properly attended to. Two of the geeſe, as well as two of the ducks, were ſitting; but the pea-hen and turkey-hen had neither of them begun to lay. He took four goats from Otoo, two of which he intended to leave at Ulietea; and reſerve the other two for the uſe of any other iſlands he might touch at in his paſſage to the north.</p>
                     <p>The following circumſtance concerning Otoo will ſhew, that the people of this iſland are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of much addreſs and art, to accompliſh their purpoſes. Amongſt other things, which Captain Cook had, at different times, given to this chief, was a ſpying-glaſs. Having been two or three days poſſeſſed of it, he, perhaps grew tired of its novelty, or diſcovered that it could not be of any uſe to him, he therefore carried it, privately, to Captain Clerke; telling him, that, as he had ſhewn great friendſhip for him, he had got a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for him, which, he ſuppoſed, would be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. "But, ſays Otoo, <hi>Toote</hi> muſt not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this, becauſe he wanted it, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to let him have it;" accordingly, he put the glaſs into Captain Clerke's hands, aſſuring him, at the ſame time that he came honeſtly by Captain Clerke, at firſt wiſhed to be excuſed from accepting it; but Otoo inſiſted upon it, that he ſhould; and left it with him. A few days after, he reminded Captain Clerke of the glaſs; who, though he did not wiſh to have it, was yet

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> obliging Otoo; and thinking, that a few axes would be more acceptable, produced four to give him in exchange. Otoo immediately exclaimed, "<hi>Toote</hi> offered me five for it." "Well (ſays Captain Clerke) if that be the caſe, you ſhall not be the loſer by your friendſhip for me; and you ſhall have ſix axes." He readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted them; but again deſired, that Captain Cook might not be made acquainted with the tranſaction. For the many valuable things which Omai had given away, he received one good thing in return. This was a very fine double ſailing canoe, completely equipped. Some time before, the Captain had made up a ſuit of Engliſh colours for him; but he conſidered them as too valuable to be uſed at this time; and, therefore patched up a parcel of flags and pendants, to the number of ten or a dozen, which he ſpread on different parts of his canoe. This, as might be expected, drew together a great number of people to look at her. Omai's ſtreamers were a mixture of Engliſh, French, Spaniſh, and Dutch, being all the European colours he had ſeen. He had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſtocked himſelf with cloth and cocoa-nut oil, which are better and more plentiful at Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite, than at any of the Society Iſlands; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they are conſidered as articles of trade. Omai would not have behaved ſo inconſiſtently, as he did in many inſtances, had it not been for his ſiſter and brother-in-law, who, together with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030274_0455_0FE56EE5277B48D8"/>
a few ſelect acquaintances, engroſſed him to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in order to ſtrip him of every article he poſſeſſed. And they would certainly have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, if Captain Cook had not taken the moſt uſeful articles of his property in his poſſeſſion. This, however, would not have ſaved Om<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i from ruin, if he had permitted theſe relations of his to have accompanied him to his intended place of ſettlement at Huaheine. This, indeed was their intention; but the Captain diſappointed their far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther views of plunder, by forbidding them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in that iſland, while he continued in that part of the world; and they knew him two well not to comply.</p>
                     <p>Otoo came on board the 28th of September, and informed Captain Cook that he had got a canoe, which he deſired he would take with him as a preſent from him to the <hi>Eree rahie no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane.</hi> The Captain was highly pleaſed with Otoo, for this mark of his gratitude. At firſt, the Captain ſuppoſed it to have been a model of one of their veſſels of war; but it proved to be a ſmall <hi>ivahab,</hi> about ſixteen feet long. It was double, and probably had been built for the purpoſe; and was decorated with carved work, like their canoes in general. It being too large for him to take on board, he could only thank him for his good intention; but he would have been much better pleaſed, if his preſent could have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:030274_0456_0FE56F3F5CA98E10"/>By calms, and gentle breezes from the weſt, we were detained here ſome days longer than we expected. All this time, the ſhips were crowded with our friends and ſurrounded by canoes; for none of them would quit the place, till we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. At length, on the 29th, at three o'clock in the afternoon, the wind came at eaſt, and we weighed anchor. The ſhips being under ſail, to oblige Otoo, and to gratify the curioſity of his people, we fired ſeven guns; after which, all our friends, except him, and two or three more, took leave of us with ſuch lively marks of ſorrow and affection, as ſufficiently teſtified how much they regretted our departure. Otoo expreſſing a deſire of ſeeing the ſhips ſail, we made a ſtretch out to ſea, and then in again immediately; when he alſo took his laſt farewel, and went aſhore in his canoe.</p>
                     <p>It was ſtrictly enjoined to Captain Cook by Otoo, to requeſt, in his name, the <hi>Earee rahie no Pretane,</hi> to ſend him, by the next ſhip, ſome red feathers, and the birds which produce them; alſo axes; half a doxen muſkets; powder and ſhot; and, by no means, to forget horſes.</p>
                     <p>When theſe people make us a preſent, it is cuſtomary for them to let us know what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in return; and we find it convenient to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them; by which means our preſents come dearer to us than what we get by barter. But, being ſometimes preſſed by occaſional ſcarcity, we could have recourſe to our friends for a ſupply
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030274_0457_0FE56F7ED6CAFDD0"/>
as a preſent, when we could not get it by any other method. Upon the whole, therefore, this way of traffic was full as advantageous to us as to the natives. Captain Cook, in general, paid for each ſeparate article as he received it, except in his intercourſe with Otoo. His preſents where ſo numerous, that no account was kept between him and the Captain. Whatever he aſked for, if it could be ſpared, the Captain never denied him, and he always found him moderate in his demands.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook would not have quited Otaheite ſo ſoon as he did, if he could have prevailed upon Omai to fix himſelf there. There was not even a probability of our being better ſupplied with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions elſewhere, than we continued to be here, even at the time of our leaving it. Beſides, ſuch a friendſhip and confidence ſubſiſted between us and the inhabitants, as could hardly be expected at any other place; and it was rather extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, had never been once interrupted or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by any accident, or miſunderſtanding; nor had there been a theft committed, worthy of notice. It is probable, however, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of conduct reſulted from their fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting a traffic, which might procure them a greater ſhare of our commodities, than they could obtain by plunder or pilfering. This point, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was, in ſome degree, ſettled at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with their chiefs, after our arrival. For
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030274_0458_0FE56EFD86EE71D0"/>
Captain Cook declared then to the natives, in the moſt deciſive terms, that he would not ſuffer them to rob us, as they had formerly done. Omai was ſingularly uſeful in this buſineſs, being inſtructed by the Captain to point out to them the happy conſequences of their honeſt conduct, and the fatal miſchiefs that muſt attend a deviation from it. But the chiefs have it not always in their power to prevent thefts; they are often robbed themſelves; and complain of it as the worſt of evils. The moſt valuable things that Otoo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Captain Cook, were left in the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's poſſeſſion till the day hefore we ſailed; Otoo declaring, at the ſame time, that they were no where ſo ſafe. From the acquiſition of new riches, the inducements to pilfering muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have increaſed; and the chiefs are ſenſible of this, from their being ſo extremely deſirous of having cheſts. The few that the Spaniards left amongſt them are highly prized; and they were continually aſking us for ſome. Captain Cook had one made for Otoo, the dimenſions of which were eight feet in length, five in breadth, and about three in depth. Locks and bolts are not conſidered as a ſufficient ſecurity; but muſt be large enough for two people to ſleep upon, and conſequently guard it in the night.</p>
                     <p>It may appear extraordinary, that we could never get any diſtinct account of the time when the Spaniards arrived, the time they ſtayed, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030274_0459_0FE56F7AB4558D70"/>
when they departed. The more we made enquiry into this matter, the more we were convinced of the incapability of moſt of theſe people to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, calculate, or note the time, when paſt events happened; eſpecially if for a longer period than eighteen or twenty months. It however appeared, by the inſcription upon the croſs, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the moſt intelligent of the natives, that two ſhips came to Oheitepeha in 1774, not long after Captain Cook left Matavai, which was in May the ſame year. The live ſtock they left here, conſiſted of one bull, ſome goats, hogs, and dogs, and the male of another animal; which we were afterwards informed was a ram, and was, at this time at Bolabola.</p>
                     <p>The hogs are large; have already much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the breed originally found by us upon the iſland; and, on our late arrival, were very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Goats are alſo in plenty, there being hardly a chief without ſome. The dogs that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards put aſhore are of two or three ſorts: if they had all been hanged, inſtead of being left upon the iſland, it would have been better for the natives. Captain Cook's young ram fell a victim to one of theſe animals. Four Spaniards remained on ſhore when theſe ſhips left the iſland; two of whom were prieſts, one a ſervant, and the other was much careſſed among the natives, who diſtinguiſh him by the name of Mateema. He ſeems to have ſo far ſtudied their language, as to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030274_0460_0FE56EF2AC1216D8"/>
have been able to ſpeak it tolerably; and to have been indefatigable in impreſſing the minds of the iſlanders with exalted ideas of the greatneſs of the Spaniſh nation, and inducing them to think meanly of that of the Engliſh. He even aſſured them, that we no longer exiſted as an independent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that <hi>Prelane</hi> was but a ſmall iſland, which they had entirely deſtroyed; and as to Captain Cook, that they had met with him at ſea, and with the greateſt eaſe that could be imagined, had ſent his ſhip, and every creature in her, to the bottom; ſo that his viſiting Otaheite was, at this time, very unexpected. Many other improbable falſehoods were propagated by this Spaniard, and believed by the inhabitants; but Captain Cook's returning to Otaheite was conſidered as a complete confutation of all that Mateema had advanced. With what deſign the prieſts remained, cannot eaſily be conceived. If it was their intention to convert the natives to the Cathalic faith, they certainly have not ſucceeded. It does not appear, indeed, that they ever attempted it; for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſay, they never converſed with them, either on this, or any other ſubject. The prieſts reſided the whole time in the houſe at Oheitepeha; but Mateema roved about continually, viſiting many parts of the iſland. After he and his companions had ſtaid ten months, two ſhips arriving at Oheite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peha, took them aboard, and ſailed again in five days. Whatever deſign the Spaniards might have
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030274_0461_0FE56F8C5D058508"/>
had upon this iſland, this haſty departure ſhews they have now laid it aſide. They endeavoured to make the natives believe, that they ſtill intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return; and that they would bring with them houſes, all kinds of animals, and men and women who were to ſettle on the iſland. Otoo, when he mentioned this to Captain Cook, added, that if the Spaniards ſhould return, they ſhould not come to Mataiva Fort, which he ſaid, was ours. The idea pleaſed him; but he did not conſider that the completion of it would deprive him of his kingdom, and his people of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Though this ſhews how eaſily a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be made at Otaheite, it is, hoped that ſuch a circumſtance will never happen. Our occaſional viſits may have been of ſervice to its inhabitants, but (conſidering how moſt European eſtabliſhments are conducted among Indian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) a permanent eſtabliſhment amongſt them would, probably, give them juſt cauſe to lament that our ſhips had ever diſcovered it. Indeed, a meaſure of this kind can hardly ever be ſeriously thought of; as it can neither anſwer the purpoſes of public ambition, nor of private avarice.</p>
                     <p>It has been already obſerved, that Captain Cook received a viſit from one of the two natives of this iſland, who had been taken to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ma by the Spaniards. It is ſomewhat remarkable that he never ſaw him afterwards, eſpecially as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain received him with uncommon civility. The
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030274_0462_0FE56FA12ACA3558"/>
Captain, however, ſuppoſed that Omai had kept him at a diſtance from him, from motives of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, he being a traveller, that in ſome degree, might vie with himſelf. Our touching at Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe was a lucky circumſtance for Omai; who prided himſelf in having viſited a place belonging to Spain, as well as this man. Captain Clerke, who had ſeen the other man, ſpoke of him as a low fellow, a little out of his ſenſes; and his own countrymen entertained the ſame opinion of him. In ſhort, theſe two adventurers ſeemed to be held in little or no eſteem. They had not been ſo fortunate, indeed, as to return home with ſuch valuable property as had been beſtowed upon Omai; whoſe advantages from going to England were ſo great, that if he ſhould ſink into the ſame ſtate of inſignificance, he has only himſelf to blame for it.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ON the 30th of September, at day-break, after leaving Otaheite, we ſtood for the north end of the iſland of Eimeo. Omai, in his canoe, arrived there before us, and endeavoured, by taking ſome neceſſary meaſures, to ſhew us the ſituation. We were not, however, without pilots, having ſeveral natives of Otaheite on board, and, among them, not a few women. Unwilling to rely entirely upon theſe guides, Captain Cook diſpatehed two boats to examine the harbour; when, on a ſignal being made for ſafe anchorage, we ſtood in with both the ſhips, and anchored in ten fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>Taloo is the name of this harbour: it is on the north ſide of the iſland, and in the diſtrict
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030274_0464_0FE56FA7F2814A70"/>
of Oboonohoo, or Poonohoo. It runs above two miles between the hills, ſouth, or ſouth by eaſt. It is not inferior to any harbour that we have met with in this ocean, both for ſecurity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of bottom. It has alſo this ſingular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that a ſhip can ſail in and out with the reigning trade wind. Several rivers fall into it; one of which is ſo conſiderable, as to admit boats a quarter of a mile up, were the water is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly freſh. The banks, on the ſides of this ſtream, are covered with what the natives call the <hi>pooroo</hi> tree, on which they ſet no value, as it only ſerves for firing. So that wood and water may be procured here with great facility.</p>
                     <p>The harbour of Parowroah, on the ſame ſide of the iſland, is about two miles to the eaſtward, and is much larger within than that of Taloo; but the opening in the reef lies to leeward of the harbour, and is conſiderably narrower. Theſe ſtriking defects muſt give the harbour of Taloo a decided preference. There are one or two more harbours on the ſouth ſide of the iſland, but they are not ſo conſiderable as thoſe we have already mentioned.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as we had anchored, great numbers of the inhabitants came aboard our ſhips, from mere motives or curioſity, for they brought nothing with them for the purpoſes of barter: but ſeveral canoes arrived, the next morning, from more diſtant parts, bringing with them an abundant

                        </gap> bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and a few hogs, which were exchanged for beads, nails, and hatchets; red feathers not being ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded here as at Otaheite.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 2d of October, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Captain Cook received a viſit ftom Maheine, the chief of the iſland. He approached the ſhip with as great caution and deliberation, as if he apprehended miſchief from us, as friends of the Otaheiteans; theſe people having no idea that we can be in friendſhip with any one, without adopting his cauſe againſt his enemies. This chief was accompanied by his wife, who, we were told, is ſiſter to Oamo, of Otaheite, whoſe death we heard of while we remained at this iſland. Captain Cook made them preſents of ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as ſeemed moſt to ſtrike their fancy; and, after ſtaying about half an hour they went on ſhore. They returned, ſoon after, with a large hog, meaning it as a return for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's favour; but he made them an additional preſent to the full value of it; after which they went on board the Diſcovery, to viſit Captain Clearke.</p>
                     <p>Maheine, ſupported with a few adherents, has made himſelf, in ſome degree, independent of Otaheite. He is between forty and fifty years of age, and is bald-hended; which, at that age, is rather uncommon in theſe iſlends. He ſeemed aſhamed of ſhewing his head, and wore a kind
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030274_0466_0FE56F875858D190"/>
of turban to conceal it. Whether they conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this deficiency of hair as diſgraceful, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſuppoſed that we conſidered it in that light, it is not eaſy to determine. The latter, however, appears the moſt probable, from the circumſtance of their having ſeen us ſhave the head of one of the natives, whom we detecteed ſtealing. They naturally concluded, therefore, that this was the kind of puniſhment inflicted by us upon all thieves; and ſome of our gentlemen, whoſe heads were but thinly covered with hair, were violently ſuſpected, by them, of being <hi>tetos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Towards the evening, Captain Cook and Omai mounted on horſeback, and rode along the ſhore. Omai having forbid the natives to follow us, our train was not very numerous; the fear of giving offence, having got the better of their curioſity. The fleet of Towha had been ſtationed in this harbour, and though the war was but of ſhort duration, the marks of its devaſtation were every where conſpicuous. The trees had loſt all their fruit, and the houſes in the neighbourhood had been burnt, or otherwiſe deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Having made every preparation for ſailing, we hauled the ſhip off into the ſtream, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 6th, intending to put to ſea the next day, but a diſagreeable accident prevented it.</p>
                     <p>We had, in the day time, ſent our goats aſhore to graze; and, notwithſtanding two men had been appointed to look after them, one of them had
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030274_0467_0FE56F0000DEE298"/>
been ſtolen this evening. This was a conſiderable loſs, as it interfered with the Captain's views of ſtocking other iſlands with theſe animals: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was determined, if poſſible, to recover it. We received intelligence, the next morning, that it had been conveyed to Maheine, who was, at that time, at Parowroah harbour. Two elderly men offered their ſervices to conduct any of our people to him, in order to bring back the goat. Accordingly the Captain diſpatched ſome of his people in a boat, charged with a meſſage to that chief, and inſiſted on both the goat and the thief being immediately given up.</p>
                     <p>Maheine had, only the day before, requeſted the Commodore to give him two goats; but, as he could not ſpare them, without depriving other iſlands, which had none of theſe animals, and was informed that there were two already upon this, he refuſed to gratify him. Willing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to aſſiſt his views, in this reſpect, he deſired an Otaheite chief, then preſent, to beg Otoo, in his name, to convey two of theſe animals to Maheine; and, to induce him to comply with this requeſt, ſent to Otoo, by the ſame chief, a quantity of red feathers, equal in value to the two goats that were required. The Commodore expected that Maheine, and all the other chiefs of the iſland, would have been perfectly ſatisfied with this arrangement; but he was miſtaken, as the event clearly proves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:030274_0468_0FE56F74CC20A510"/>Little ſuſpecting that any one would preſume to ſteal a ſecond, while the neceſſary meaſure were taking to recover the firſt, the goats were again put aſhore this morning; and a boat as uſual, was ſent for them in the evening. While our people were getting them into the boat, one was conveyed away undiſcovered. As it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately miſſed, we expected to recover it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much trouble, as it could not have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to any conſiderable diſtance. Several of the natives ſet out, different ways, to ſeek after it; for they all endeavoured to perſuade us, that it muſt have ſtrayed into the woods; not one of them admitting that it was ſtolen. We were, however, convinced to the contrary, when we perceived that not any of the purſuers returned: their intention was only to amuſe us, till their prize was ſafely depoſited; and night coming on, prevented all future ſearch. At this inſtant, the boat returned with the other goat, and one of the perſons who had ſtolen it.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the inhabitants, the next morning, were moved off, taking with them a corpſe, which lay oppoſite the ſhip, on a <hi>toopapaoo;</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heine, we were informed, had retired to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt part of the iſland. It now plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that a regular plan had been projected to ſteal what the Commodore had refuſed to give; and that, having reſtored one, they were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to part with the other, which was a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030274_0469_0FE56F72736ABC28"/>
female, and with kid: and the Commodore was equally determined to have it back again; he therefore applied to the two elderly men, who had been inſtrumental in recovering the firſt, who informed him that this had been taken to a place on the ſouth ſide of the iſland, called Watea, by Hamoa, who was the chief of that place; but that it would be delivered up if he would ſend for it. They expreſſed a willingneſs to conduct ſome of his people to the ſpot; but finding that a boat might go and return in one day, he ſent one with two of his officers, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleworth; one to remain with the boat, if ſhe could not get to the place, while the other went with the guides, accompanied by ſome of our people. The boat returned late in the evening, when we were informed by the officers, that, after proceeded in the boat as far as rocks and ſhoals would permit, Mr. Shuttleworth landed; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> attended with two marines, and one of the guides, proceeding to the houſe of Hamoa, at Watea; where they where, for ſome time, amuſed by the people, who pretended they had ſent for the goat, and that it would ſoon be produced. It, however, never arrived; and, night approching, Mr. Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleworth was obliged to return to his boat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                     <p>The Commodore lamented that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far in this buſineſs as he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with credit, and without giving encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030274_0470_0FE56F91794E6CE8"/>
to other iſlanders to rob us with impunity. Conſulting with Omai, and the two old men, what methods to take, they adviſed him, without heſitation, to go into the country with a party of men, and ſhoot every perſon he ſhould meet with. The Commodore did not approve of this bloody counſel; but, early the next morning, ſet out with thirty-five of his people, accompanied by Omai, one of the old men, and three or four at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. He alſo ordered Lieutenant William<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon round the weſtern part of the iſland, with three armed boats, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> us.</p>
                     <p>This party had no ſooner landed, than the few remaining natives fled before us. The firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we met with upon our march, was in a kind of perilous ſituation; for Omai, the inſtant he beheld him, aſked Captain Cook if he ſhould ſhoot him; ſo fully was he perſuaded, that the advice he had given, was immediately to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into execution. The Commodore then gave orders, both to him and our guide, to let it be made known, that it was not our intention to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure, much leſs to deſtroy, a ſingle native. Theſe joyful tidings ſoon circulated, and prevented the flight of the inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>Aſcending the ridge of hills, on our road to Watea, we were informed that the goat had been carried the ſame way, and could hardly have paſſed the hills: we therefore marched up in great ſilence, expecting to ſurprize the party who
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030274_0471_0FE56F52DE6A1648"/>
were bearing off the prize; but, when we arrived at the uppermoſt plantation, we were told, that the animal we were in ſearch of, had, indeed, been kept there the firſt night, but had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Watea the next morning. We made no further enquiry, till we came within ſight of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea, where we were directed to Hamoa's houſe, by ſome people who alſo informed us, that the goat was there. We therefore fully expected to obtain it on our arrival; but, when we reached the houſe, the people we ſaw there, denied that they had ever ſeen it, or knew any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Hamoa, himſelf appeared, and expreſſed himſelf to the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>On our firſt coming to Watea, ſeveral men were ſeen, running to and fro in the woods, with clubs and darts in their hands; and Omai, who ran towards them, had ſtones thrown at him. Hence it appeared, that they intended to oppoſe any attempt that we might be induced to make, but on ſeeing the ſtrength of our party, had given up the deſign. We were confirmed in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by obſerving, that all their houſes were empty.</p>
                     <p>After collecting, a few of the natives together, Omai was directed to expoſtulate with them on the abſurdity of their conduct, and tell them that we had received ſufficient evidence that the goat was in their poſſeſſion; and that, if it was not immediately delivered up, we ſhould burn
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030274_0472_0FE56FA97A52C170"/>
all their houſes and canoes; but, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this expoſtulation, they perſiſted in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of having any knowledge of it, In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, the Commodore ſet fire to ſix or eight of their houſes, and two or three war canoes, which were preſently conſumed. After this we marched off to join the boats, which were, at that time, about ſeven or eight miles from us; and, in our road, burnt ſix other war canoes, without any oppoſition. On the contrary, many of the natives aſſiſted us; more, perhaps, from fear, than any other motive. At length Omai, who was at ſome diſtance before us, came back with information, that a multitude of men were aſſembling to attack us. We prepared ourſelves to receive them, but, inſtead of enemies, they were petitioners, with plantain-trees in their hands, which they laid down before us, entreating the Commodore to ſpare a canoe that lay upon the ſpot, which he readily complied with.</p>
                     <p>About four o'clock in the afternoon, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Wharrarade, where our boats were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us. The diſtrict of Wharrarade belongs to Tiaratoboonoue; but this chief together with the other principal people of the place, had fled to the hills; though we made no attack upon their property, they being in amity with Otoo. Here we remained about an hour, in order to reſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and afterwards ſet out for the ſhips, where we arrived at eight o'clock in the evening; but
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030274_0473_0FE56F6C01F042F8"/>
no tidings of the goat had, at that time, been received; and, of courſe, the operations of the day had been ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>Early on Friday morning, the 10th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Captain diſpatched one of Omai's men to Maheine, charged with this peremptory meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that if he perſiſted in his refuſal to deliver up the goat, a ſingle canoe ſhould not be left upon the iſland; and that hoſtilities ſhould never ceaſe, while the ſtolen animal continued in his poſſeſſion. That the meſſenger might perceive that the Commodore was in earneſt, he ordered the carpenter, in his preſence, to break up three or four canoes, that lay at the head of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The planks where, by his direction, taken on board, to ſerve as materials for building a houſe for Omai, at the place where he intended to reſide. The Commodore, properly attended, went afterwards to the next harbour, where he deſtroyed ſeven or eight more canoes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned on board about ſeven in the evening. On his arrival, he was informed, that the goat had been returned about half an hour before; and it appeared, from good intelligence, that it came from the very place, where the inhabitants, the day before, declared they knew nothing about it. But from the meſſage delivered to the chief in the morning, he perceived that the Commodore was not to be trifled with.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:030274_0474_0FE56F70EB96BCB8"/>Thus ended this troubleſome and unfortunate buſineſs; equally to be regretted by the natives, and by Captain Cook. He was grieved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that, after refuſing to aſſiſt his friends at Otaheite, in the invaſion of this iſland, he ſhould ſo ſoon be obliged to engage in hoſtilities againſt its inhabitants; which, perhaps, were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to them, than Towha's expedition.</p>
                     <p>Our intercourſe with the natives was renewed the next morning; ſeveral canoes bringing bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts to the ſhips to barter; whence it was natural to conclude, that they were conſcious they had merited the treatment they had received; and that, the cauſe of Captain Cook's diſpleaſure being now removed, they apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no further miſchief. We weighed, with a breeze, down the harbour, about nine; but it was ſo faint and variable, that we did not get out to ſea till noon, when we ſteered for Hua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heine, Omai attending in his canoe.</p>
                     <p>At Eimeo, the ſhips were abundantly ſupplied with fire-wood. We did not ſupply ourſelves with this article at Otaheite, as there is not a tree at Matavai but what is uſeful to the inhabitants. We alſo received here a large ſupply of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in hogs, bread-fruit, and coco-nuts.</p>
                     <p>There is very little difference between the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of this iſland, and that of Otaheite; but the difference in their woman is remarkable.

                     <p>The appearance of Eimeo bears not the leaſt reſemblance to that of Otaheite. The latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hilly country, has little low land, except ſome deep vallies, and the flat border that almoſt ſurrounds it near the ſea. Eimeo has ſteep rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hills, running in different directions, leaving large vallies, and gently riſing grounds about their ſides. The hills, though rocky, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally covered with trees, almoſt to the tops. At the bottom of the harbour of Taloo, the ground gradually riſes to the foot of the hills; but the flat border, on the ſides becomes quite ſteep at a ſmall diſtance from the ſea. This renders it a proſpect ſuperior to any thing we ſaw at Otaheite. In the low grounds, the ſoil is a yellowiſh ſtiff mould; on the lower hills it is blacker and looſer, and the ſtone which compoſes the hills, is of a bluiſh colour, interſperſed with ſome particles of glimmer. Near the place where our ſhips were ſtationed, are two large ſtones, concerning which ſome ſuperſtitious notions are entertained by the natives. They conſider them as brother and ſiſter; that they are <hi>Eatooas,</hi> or divinities, and that they came from Ulietea, by ſome ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ON the morning that ſucceeded our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Eimeo, we ſaw Huaheine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from ſouth-weſt by weſt, to weſt by north. At twelve o'clock we anchored at the northern entrance of Owharre harbour, ſituated on the weſt ſide of the iſland. Omai, in his canoe, entered the harbour juſt before us, but did not land. Though many of his countrymen crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee him, he did not take much notice of them. Great numbers alſo came off to the ſhips, inſomuch that we were greatly incommoded by them. Our paſſengers immediately informed them of our tranſactions at Eimeo, multiplying, by ten at leaſt, the number of houſes and canoes
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030274_0478_0FE56FB19B833680"/>
that we had deſtroyed. Captain Cook was not much diſpleaſed at their giving this exaggerated account, as he found that it made a conſiderable impreſſion upon all who heard it; ſo that he had hopes it would induce the natives of this iſland to treat him in a better manner than they had done in his prior viſits.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, which was the 13th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, all the principal people of the iſland came to our ſhips. This was juſt what the Commodore wiſhed, as it was now high time to ſettle Omai; and he ſuppoſed, that the preſence of theſe chiefs would enable him to effect it in a ſatisfactory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Omai now ſeemed inclined to eſtabliſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Ulietea; and if he and Captain Cook could have agreed with reſpect to the mode of accompliſhing that deſign, the latter would have conſented to adopt it. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> father had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived by the inhabitants of Bolabola, when they ſubdued Ulietea, of ſome land in that iſland; and the Captain hoped he ſhould be able to get it reſtored to the ſon without difficulty. For this purpoſe, it was neceſſary that Omai ſhould be upon amicable terms with thoſe who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maſters of the iſland; but he would not liſten to any ſuch propoſal, and was vain enough to imagine, that the Captain would make uſe of force to re-inſtate him in his forfeited lands. This preventing his being fixed at Ulietea, the Captain began to conſider Huaheine as the more
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030274_0479_0FE56FB322BBB558"/>
proper place; and therefore determined to avail himſelf of the preſence of the chief men of that iſland, and, propoſe the affair to them.</p>
                     <p>The Captain now prepared to make a formal viſit to Taireetareea, the <hi>Earee rahie,</hi> or king of the iſland, with a view of introducing this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Omai, who was to accompany him, dreſſed himſelf very properly on the occaſion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a handſome preſent for the chief himſelf, and another for his <hi>Eatooa.</hi> Their landing drew moſt of the viſitors from our ſhips, who, with many others, aſſembled in a large houſe. The concourſe of people became very great, the major part of whom ſeemed ſtouter and fairer than thoſe of Otaheite, and the number of men who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of conſequence was alſo much greater, in proportion to the extent of the iſland. The Captain waited ſome time for Taireetareea: but when the chief appeared, he found that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence might eaſily have been diſpenſed with, as he did not exceed ten years of age. Omai began with making his offering to the gods, which conſiſted of cloth, red feathers &amp;c. Another offering ſucceeded, which was to be given to the gods by the young chief; and, after that, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other tufts of red feathers were preſented. The different articles were laid before a prieſt, being each of them delivered with a kind of prayer, which was ſpoken by one of Omai's friends, though in a great meaſure dictated by himſelf,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030274_0480_0FE56FB5046AD048"/>
In theſe prayers he did not forget his friends in England, nor thoſe who had conducted him ſafe back to his native country. The <hi>Earee rahie no Pretane</hi> (king of Great-Britain), the Earl of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, <hi>Toote, Tatee,</hi> (Cook and Clerke) were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in every one of them. Theſe offerings and prayers being ended, the prieſt took each of the articles in order, and after repeating a prayer, ſent every one to the <hi>morai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe religious rites having been performed, Omai ſeated himſelf by the Captain, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a preſent on the young chief, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another in return. Some arrangements were next agreed upon, relative to the mode of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the intercourſe between us and the iſlanders; and the Captain painted out the miſchievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that would attend their plundering us, as they had done on former occaſions. The eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Omai was then propoſed to the chiefs who were aſſembled. He informed then, that we had conveyed him into our country, where he was well received by the great King and his <hi>Earees,</hi> (chiefs or nobles) and treated during his whole ſtay with all the marks of regard and affection; that he had been brought back again, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been enriched, by our generoſity, with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of articles, which would be highly benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to his countrymen; and that, beſides the two horſes which were to continue with him, many other new and uſeful animals had been left at
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030274_0481_0FE56FB8F6DD8070"/>
Otaheite, which would ſpeedily multiply, and furniſh a ſufficient number for the uſe of all the neighbouring iſlands. He then gave them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it was Captain Cook's earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that they would give his friend a piece of land, upon which he might build a houſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aiſe proviſions for himſelf and ſervants: adding, that, if he could not obtain this at Huaheine either by donation or purchaſe, the Captain was reſolved to carry him to Ulietea, and eſtabliſh him there. Theſe topics were dictated to Omai by Captain Cook, who obſerved, that what he concluded with, about going to Ulietea, ſeemed to gain the approbation of all the chiefs; and he immediately perceived the reaſon. Omai had vainly flattered himſelf, that the Captain would uſe force in reſtoring him to his father's lands in Ulietea, and he had talked at random, on this ſubject, to ſome of the aſſembly; who now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the Captain would aſſiſt them in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Ulietea, and driving the Bolabolans out of that iſland. It being proper, therefore, that he ſhould undeceive them, he ſignified in the moſt deciſive manner, that he would neither give them any aſſiſtance in ſuch an enterprize, nor would even ſuffer it to be put in execution, while he remained in their ſeas; and that, if Omai eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed himſelf in Ulietea, he ought to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as a friend, and not forced upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Bolabola as their conqueror.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:030274_0482_0FE56F9335B7DC90"/>This preremptory declaraion immediately gave a new turn to the ſentiments of the council; one of whom expreſſed himſelf to this effect: that, the whole iſland of Huaheine, and whatever it, contained, were Captain Cook's; and that, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he might diſpoſe of what portion he, pleaſed to his friend. Omai was pleaſed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this; thinking that he would be very liberal, and give him what was perfectly ſufficient. But to make an offer of what it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to accept, the Captain conſidered as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering nothing; and therefore deſired, that they would mark out the particular ſpot, and likewiſe the exact quantity of land, which they intended to allot for the ſettlement. Upon this, ſome chiefs, who had already retired from the aſſembly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>re ſent for; and, after a ſhort conſultation, the Commodore's requeſt was unanimouſly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ground immediately fixed upon, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the houſe where the preſent meeting was held. It extended along the ſhore of the harbour, about two hundred yards; its depth to the bottom of the hill was ſomewhat more; and a proportional part of the hill was comprehended in the grant. This affair being ſettled, a tent was pitched on ſhore, a poſt eſtabliſhed, and the obſervatories erected. The carpenters of each ſhip were alſo now enployed in building a ſmall houſe for Omai, in which he might ſecure the various European commodities that he had in his
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030274_0483_0FE56F7D4E228BA8"/>
poſſeſſion; at the ſame time, ſome of our people were occupied in making a garden for his uſe, planting vines, ſhaddocks, melons, pine apples, and the ſeeds of other vegetable articles; all which were in a flouriſhing ſtate before our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the iſland.</p>
                     <p>Omai began now to pay a ſerious attention to his own affairs, and heartily repented of his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged prodigality at Otaheite. He found at Huaheine, a brother, a ſiſter, and a brother-in-law, the ſiſter having been married. But theſe did not plunder him, as his other relations had lately done. It appeared, however, that though they had too much honeſty and good-nature to do him any injury, they were of too little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his perſon. Thus circumſtanced, he ran a great riſque of being ſtripped of every thing he had received from us, as ſoon as he ſhould ceaſe to be within the reach of our power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful protection.</p>
                     <p>He was now upon the point of being placed in the very ſingular ſituation, of being the only rich man in the community of which he was to be a member. And as he had, by his connection with us, made himſelf maſter of an accumulated quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a ſpecies of treaſure which his countrymen could not create by any art or induſtry of their own, it was natural to imagine, that while all
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030274_0484_0FE56FBADF04DF48"/>
were deſirous of ſharing in this envied wealth, all would be ready to join in attempts to ſtrip its ſole proprietor. As the moſt likely means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting this, Captain Cook adviſed him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſome of his moveables among two or three of the principal chiefs; who, on being thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themſelves, might be induced to favour him with their patronage, and ſhield him from the injuries of others. He promiſed to follow this advice; and we heard, before we ſailed, that this prudent ſtep had been taken. The Captain, however, not confiding entirely in the operations of gratitude, had recourſe to the more forcible and effectual motive of intimidation, taking every opportunity of notifying to the inhabitants, that it was his intention to make another viſit to their iſland, after being abſent the uſual time; and that, if he did not find his friend in the ſame ſtate of ſecurity in which he ſhould leave him at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, all thoſe who ſhould then appear to have been his enemies, might expect to become the objects of his reſentment. This menacing decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will, probably, have ſome effect; for our ſucceſſive viſits of late years have induced theſe iſlanders to believe, that our ſhips are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o return at certain periods, and while they continue to entertain ſuch a notion, which the Captain thought it a fair ſtratagem to confirm, Omai has ſome proſpect of being ſuffered to thrive upon his new plantation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:030274_0485_0FE56FBC644B90A0"/>While we remained in this harbour, we carried the bread on ſhore to clear it of vermin. The number of cock-roaches that infeſted the ſhip at this time, is almoſt incredible. The damage we ſuſtained from them was very conſiderable; and every attempt to deſtroy them proved fruitleſs. If any kind of food was expoſed for a few minutes, it was covered with theſe noxious inſects, who ſoon pierced it full of holes, ſo that it reſembled an honey-comb. They proved particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to birds, which had been ſtuffed for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, and were ſo fond of ink, that they eat out the writing on the labels, faſtened to different articles, and the only thing that preſerved books from their ravages, was the cloſeneſs of the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which prevented theſe devourers from inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating themſelves between the leaves. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. Anderſon, they were of two ſorts, the <hi>blatta orientalis,</hi> and <hi>germanica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The intercourſe of trade and friendly offices, between us and the inhabitants of Huaheine, was undiſturbed, by any accident, till the evening of the 22d, when one of the natives found means to get into Mr. Bayly's obſervatory, and carry off a ſextent, unobſerved. Captain Cook was no ſooner informed of this theft than he went aſhore, and deſired Omai to apply to the chiefs, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure reſtitution. He accordingly made applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, but they took no ſteps towards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the inſtrument, being more attentive to
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030274_0486_0FE56FBE4B24D820"/>
a <hi>heeva,</hi> that was then exhibiting, till the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ordered the performers to deſit. Being now convinced that he was in earneſt, they began to make ſome enquiry after the delinquent, who was ſitting in the midſt of them, with ſuch marks of unconcern, that the Captain was in great doubt of his being guilty, particularly as he denied it. Omai, however, aſſuring him that this was the perſon, he was ſent on board the ſhip and there confined. This raiſed an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> univerſal ferment among the aſſembled iſlanders, and the whole body fled with precipitation. The priſoner being examined by Omai, was with ſome difficulty brought to confeſs where he had concealed the ſextent, and it was brought back, unhurt, the next morning. After this, the natives recovered from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and began to gather about us as uſual. As the thief appeared to be a ſhameleſs villain, Captain Cook puniſhed him with greater ſeverity than he had ever done any former culprit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides having his head and beard ſhaved, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that both his ears ſhould be cut off, and then diſmiſſed.</p>
                     <p>This puniſhment, however, did not deter him from committing other offences; for early in the morning of the 25th, a general alarm was ſpread occaſioned, as was reported, by one of our goats being ſtolen by this very man; and though, upon examination, we found every thing ſafe in that quarter, yet it appeared, that he had deſtroyed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030274_0487_0FE56FC503BA8760"/>
and carried off from Omai's ground, ſeveral vines and cabbage-plants; and he publicly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to put him to death, and ſet fire to his houſe as ſoon as we ſhould quit this place. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his doing any further miſchief, the Captain ordered him to be ſeized, and confined again on board the ſhip, with a view of carrying him off the iſland; and this intention ſeemed to give ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſatisfaction to all the chiefs. He was a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Bolabola: but there were two many of the people here ready to co-operate with him in all his deſigns. We had, indeed, always met with more troubleſome perſons in Huaheine than in any other of the adjacent iſlands; and it was only fear and the want of proper opportunities, that induced them to behave better now. Anarchy and confuſion ſeemed to prevail among them. Their <hi>Earce rahie,</hi> as we have already obſerved, was but a child; and we did not find, that there was any individual, or any ſet of men, who held the reins of government for him; ſo that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any miſunderſtanding occured between us, we never knew, with ſufficient preciſion, to whom it was neceſſary to apply, in order to effect an accommodation, or procure redreſs.</p>
                     <p>Omai's houſe being now almoſt finiſhed, many of his moveables were carried aſhore on the 26th; amongſt other articles was a box of toys, which greatly pleaſed the gazing multitude. But, as to his plates, diſhes, drinking mugs, glaſſes,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030274_0488_0FE56FC68D001448"/>
pots, kettles, and the whole train of domeſtic ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus, ſcarce one of his countrymen would even look at them. Omai, himſelf began to think that they would be of no ſervice to him; that a baked hog was more ſavory eating than a boiled one; that a plantain leaf made as good a plate or diſh as pewter; and that a cocoa-nut ſhell was as convenient a goblet as one of our mugs. He therefore diſpoſed of moſt of theſe articles of Engliſh furniture among the crew of our ſhips; and received from them, in return, hatchets, and other iron implements, which had a more intrinſic value in this part of the world. Among the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous preſents beſtowed upon him in England, fireworks had not been omitted; ſome of which we exhibited in the evening of the 28th, before a great multitude of people, who beheld them with a mixture of pleaſure and apprehenſion. Thoſe which remained were put in order, and left with Omai, purſuant to their original deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 30th, early in the morning, the Bolabola-man whom we had in confinement, found means to eſcape out of the ſhip, carrying with him the ſhackle of the bilboo-bolt that had been put about his leg, which was taken from him as ſoon as he arrived on ſhore, by one of the chiefs, and given to Omai; who quickly came on board, to inform the Captain that his mortal enemy was again let looſe upon him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:030274_0489_0FE548AD1A1FCA38"/>We found, upon enquiry, that the ſentry placed over the priſoner, and even the whole watch in that part of the ſhip where he was confined, having fallen aſleep, he ſeized the favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, took the key of the irons out of the drawer into which he had ſeen it put, and ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at liberty. This eſcape convinced the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, that his people had been very remiſs in their neight-duty; which rendered it neceſſary to chaſtize thoſe who were now in fault, and to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh ſome new regulations that might prevent ſimilar negligence in future. He was pleaſed at hearing, afterwards, that the fellow who had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, had gone over to Ulietea.</p>
                     <p>Omai was no ſooner ſettled in his new habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, than Captain Cook began to think of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Huaheine, and got every thing off from the ſhore this evening, except a goat big with kid, and a horſe and mare; which were leſt in the poſſeſſion of our friend, who was now to be finally ſeparated from us. We alſo gave him a boar and two ſows of the Engliſh breed; and he had got two or three ſows of his own. The horſe had covered the mare during our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at Otaheite; ſo that the introduction of a breed of horſes into theſe iſlands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has probably ſucceeded, by this valuable preſent.</p>
                     <p>With regard to Omai's domeſtic eſtabliſhment, he had procured at Otaheite, four or five <hi>toulous,</hi> or people of the lower claſs; the two young New-Zealanders
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030274_0490_0FE56FC9B870F980"/>
remained with him; and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeveral others, joined him at Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heine; ſo that his family now conſiſted of ten or eleven perſons; if that can juſtly be denominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a family, to which not one female belonged. The houſe which our people erected for him was twenty-four feet by eighteen; and about ten feet in height. It was compoſed of boards which were the ſpoils of our military obſervations at Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo; and, in the conſtruction of it, as few nails as poſſible were uſed, leſt there might be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, from the deſire of iron, to pull it down. It was agreed upon, that, immediately after our departure, he ſhould erect a ſpacious houſe after the mode of his own country; one end of which was to be brought over that which we had built, ſo as entirely to encloſe it for greater ſecurity. In this work, ſome of the chiefs of the iſland promiſed to contribute their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and if the intended building ſhould cover the ground which was marked out for it, few of the houſes in Huaheine will exceed it in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>Omai's European weapons conſiſted of a ſowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-piece, two pair of piſtols, ſeveral ſwords or cutlaſſes, a muſquet, bayonet, and a cartouch-box. After he had got on ſhore whatever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to him, he had the two Captains, and moſt of the officers of both our ſhips, two or three times, to dinner; on which occaſions, his
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030274_0491_0FE56F94C1B076F0"/>
table was plentifully ſupplied with the beſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that the iſland could afford. Before we ſet ſail, the Commodore cauſed the following inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be cut upon the outſide of his houſe:

                     <p>On Sunday, the 2d of November, at four o'clock, we took the advantage of an eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breeze, and ſailed out of Owharre harbour. Moſt of our friends continued on board till our veſſels were under ſail; when Captain Cook, to gratify their curioſity, ordered five guns to be fired. Then they all left us, except Omai, who remained till we were out at ſea. We had come to ſail by a hawſer faſtened to the ſhore, which, in caſting the ſhip, parted, being cut by the rocks, and its outer end was left behind: it therefore became neceſſary to diſpatch a boat to bring it on board. In this boat, our friend Omai went aſhore, after having taken a very affectionate fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of all the officers. He ſuſtained this part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a manly fortitude, till he came to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook, when, notwithſtanding all his efforts, he was unable to ſuppreſs his tears; and he wept all the time in going aſhore, as Mr. King, who accompanied him in the boat, afterwards inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Captain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="unknown:030274_0492_0FE56FCFA9955AF0"/>Though we had now, to our great ſatisfaction, brought him ſafe back to the very ſpot from which he was taken, it is probable, that we left him in a ſituation leſs deſirable than that which he was in before his connection with us: not that, having taſted the comforts of civilized life, he muſt become, more wretched from being obliged to relinquiſh all thoughts of continuing them, but merely becauſe the advantages he received from us, have placed him in a more hazardous ſituation, with reſpect to his perſonal ſafety. From being greatly careſſed in England, he had loſt ſight of his primary condition, and did not conſider in what manner his acquiſitions, either of knowledge or of wealth, would be eſtimated by his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at his return; which were the only things whereby he could recommend himſelf to them now, more than before, and on which he could lay the foundation either of his future happineſs or greatneſs. He appeared to have, in ſome meaſure, forgotten their cuſtoms in this reſpect, and even to have miſtaken their genius; otherwiſe he muſt have been convinced of the extreme difficulty there would be in getting himſelf admitted as a man of rank, where there is ſcarce a ſingle inſtance of a perſon's being raiſed from an inferior ſtation even by the greateſt merit. Rank ſeems to be the foundation of all power and diſtinction here, and is ſo pertinaciouſly adhered to, that, unleſs a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030274_0493_0FE56F88F9246B00"/>
has ſome degree of it, he will be contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hated, if he pretends to exerciſe any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This was really the caſe, in a great meaſure, with Omai; though his countrymen were rather cautious of expreſſing their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments while we continued among them.</p>
                     <p>If he had made a proper uſe of the preſents he brought with him from Great-Britain, this, with the knowledge he had gained by travelling, might have enabled him to form the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous connections. But he exhibited too many proofs of a weak inattention to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious means of promoting his intereſt. He had formed ſchemes of a higher nature; it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be ſaid, meaner; for revenge, rather than a deſire of greatneſs, appeared to influence him from the beginning. His father was, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, a man of conſiderable property in Ulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea, when that iſland was ſubdued by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Bolabola; and, with many others, fled for refuge to Huaheine, where he died, and left Omai, with ſeveral other children, who thus became entirely dependent, In this ſituation, Captain Furneaux took him up, and brought him to England. Whether he expected, from the treatment he there met with, that any aſſiſtance would be afforded him againſt the enemies of his father and his country, or whether he had the vanity to ſuppoſe, that his own ſuperiority of knowledge, and perſonal courage, would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030274_0494_0FE56F45FB56D390"/>
to diſpoſſeſs the conquerors of Ulietea, is uncertain; but, from the very commencement of the voyage, this was his conſtant topic. He would not pay any attention to our remonſtrances on ſuch an inconſiderate determinaton, but was diſpleaſed, whenever more reaſonable counſels were propoſed for his benefit. Nay, he was ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly attached to his favourite ſcheme, that he affected to believe the Bolabolans would ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly quit the conquered iſland, as ſoon as they ſhould have intelligence of his arrival in Otaheite. As we proceeded, however, on our voyage, he began to perceive his error; and, by the time of our arrival at the Friendly Iſlands, had ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his reception in his own country, that he was inclined to have remained at Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gataboo, under the protection of his friend Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou. At theſe iſlands, he ſquandered away a conſiderable part of his European treaſure; and he was equally imprudent at Otaheite, till Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook put a ſtop to his profuſion. He alſo formed ſuch improper connections there, that Otoo, though at firſt diſpoſed to countenance him, afterwards openly expreſſed his diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his conduct. He might, however, have recovered the favour of that chief, and have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, to great advantage, in Otaheite, as he had formely lived ſome years there, and was now honoured with the notice of Towha, whoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable preſent of a large double canoe has been
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030274_0495_0FE56F346B738518"/>
already mentioned. But he continued undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to the laſt, and probably would not have adopted the plan of ſettlement in Huaheine, if Captain Cook had not ſo poſitively refuſed to employ force in reſtoring him to the poſſeſſion of his father's property.</p>
                     <p>Omai's greateſt danger, in his preſent ſituation, will ariſe from the very imprudent declarations of his antipathy to the Bolabolans. For theſe people, from the motives of jealouſy, will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly endeavour to render him obnoxious to the inhabitants of Huaheine; as they are now at peace with that iſland, and may eaſily accompliſh their deſigns. This circumſtance, he might, with great eaſe, have avoided. For they were not only free from any averſion to him, but the chief, whom we mentionned before, as a prieſt or god, even offered to reinſtate him in his father's lands. But he peremptorily refuſed this; and, to the very laſt, continued fixed in this reſolution to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the firſt opportunity of ſatisfying his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in battle. To this he is perhaps not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtimulated by the coat of mail he brought from England; clothed in which, and furniſhed with fire-arms, he idly imagines that he ſhall be invincible.</p>
                     <p>The defects of Omai's character were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably over-balanced by his great good-nature, and docile, tractable diſpoſiton. Captain Cook, during the whole time he was with him, ſeldom
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030274_0496_0FE56F5EA665AA88"/>
had reaſon to be ſeriouſly diſpleaſed with his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conduct. His grateful heart ever retained the higheſt ſenſe of the favours conferred on him in England; nor will he ever be unmindful of thoſe who honoured him, while in that kingdom, with their friendſhip and protection. Though he had a tolerable ſhare of underſtanding, he ſhewed little application and perſeverance in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting it, ſo that he had but a general and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect knowledge of things. He was not a man of any great degree of obſervation. There were many elegant amuſements, as well as uſeful arts, among the Friendly Iſlanders, which he might have conveyed to his native country, where they, in all probability, would have been readily adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But we never found that he endeavoured to make himſelf maſter of any one of them. Such indifference is, indeed, the characteriſtic foible of his countrymen. Though they have been viſited by Europeans, at times, for theſe ten years paſt, we could not diſcern the ſlighteſt veſtige of any attempt to profit by this intercourſe; nor have they hitherto imitated us in any reſpect. It muſt not, therefore, be expected, that Omai will be able to introduce among them many of our arts and cuſtoms, or much improve thoſe to which they have been familiarized by long habit. We truſt, however, that he will exert his endeavours to bring to perfection the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fruits and vegetables that were planted by
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030274_0497_0FE56F31028DDAB8"/>
us; which will be no ſmall acquiſition. But the principal advantage theſe iſlands are likely to receive from the travels of Omai, will probably ariſe from the animals that have been left upon them; which, perhaps, they never would have obtained, if he had not come over to England. When theſe multiply, Otaheite, and the Society Iſles, will equal any place in the known world, with reſpect to proviſions.</p>
                     <p>Omai's return, and the ſubſtantial proofs he carried back with him of Britiſh liberality, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged many to offer themſelves as volunteers to accompany us to <hi>Pretane.</hi> Captain Cook took every opportunity of expreſſing his fixed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to reject all applications of that kind. Omai, who was ambitious of remaining the only great traveller among them, being afraid leſt the Captain might be prevailed upon to place others in a ſituation of rivalling him, frequently remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of the declaration of the Earl of Sandwich, that no others of his countrymen were to come to England.</p>
                     <p>Had there been the ſmalleſt probability of any ſhip being again ſent to New-Zealand, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore would have brought the two youths of that country home with him, both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very deſirous of continuing with us. Tawei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harooa, the eldeſt, was endowed with ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe, was extremely well diſpoſed, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving any inſtruction. He appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030274_0498_0FE56F48A3CA5E68"/>
to be ſenſible of the inferiority of his own country to theſe iſlands, and reſigned himſelf, though perhaps not without reluctance, to end his days at Huaheine in eaſe and plenty. But the other, named Kokoa, was ſo ſtrongly attached to us, that it became neceſſary to make uſe of force in carrying him aſhore. He was a ſmart witty boy; and, on that account, great notice had been taken of him on board.</p>

                     <p>AS ſoon as the boat, in which Omai was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed aſhore, had returned, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the hawſer, to the ſhip, we hoiſted
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030274_0499_0FE56F0187DBA090"/>
her in, and ſtood over for Ulietea without delay. The next morning, which was the 3d of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, we made ſail round the ſouthern end of that iſland, for the harbour of Ohamaneno. We met with variable light airs and calms alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, ſo that, at twelve o'clock, we were ſtill at the diſtance of a league from the mouth of the harbour; and while we were thus detained, Oreo, the chief of the iſland, with his ſon and ſon-in-law, came off to pay us a viſit. All the boats were now hoiſted out, and ſent a-head to tow, being aſſiſted by a ſlight ſoutherly breeze. This ſoon failing, and being ſucceeded by an eaſterly one, which blew right out of the harbour, we were obliged to anchor at its entrance, about two o'clock, and to warp in, which employed us till night. We were no ſooner within the harbour than our ſhips were ſurrounded with canoes, filled with the natives, who brought a ſupply of fruit and hogs, which they exchanged for our commodites.</p>
                     <p>The following day, the Reſolution was moored cloſe to the northern ſhore, at the head of the harbour; and the Diſcovery along-ſide the ſouthern ſhore. Captain Cook, in the mean time, returned Oreo's viſit, and preſented that chief with a red-feathered cap from Tongataboo, a ſhirt, a linen gown, and a few other things of leſs value. Oreo, and ſome of his friends, then accompanied him on board to dinner. On Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030274_0500_0FE56F2A5AFF8790"/>
the 6th, the obſervatories were ſet up, and the neceſſary inſtruments carried on ſhore. The two ſucceeding days, Captain Cook, Mr. King, and Mr. Bayly, obſerved the ſun's azimuths, both on ſhore and on board, with all the compaſſes, in order to diſcover the variation. Nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable happened, till very early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 13th, when a marine, named John Harriſon, who was ſentinel at the obſervatory, deſerted, taking with him his muſquet and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>trements. As ſoon as we gained intelligence which way he had gone, a party was detached in ſearch of him; but they returned towards the evening, without ſucceſs. The next day, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook applied to the chief concerning this affair, who promiſed to ſend a party of the iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders after the fugitive, and give us hops that he ſhould be brought back in the courſe of that day. This however, did not happen; and we had reaſon to imagine, that the chief had taken no ſteps towards finding him.</p>
                     <p>We had, at this time, a conſiderable number of the natives about our ſhips, and ſeveral thefts were committed; the conſequences of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended by them, very few of them came to viſit us the next morning. Oreo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf caught the alarm, and fled with his whole family. Captain Cook conſidered this as a good opportunity to inſiſt upon their delivering up the deſerter; and having heard that he was then at
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030274_0501_0FE56F035D8E21B0"/>
a place called Hamoa, ſituated on the other ſide of the iſland he repaired theither with two armed boats, attended by a native. In their way, they met with the chief, who alſo embarked with them. The Captain, with a few of his men, landing about a mile and a half from the ſpot, marched up to it, with great expedition, leſt the ſight of the boats ſhould give the alarm, and allow the offender ſufficient time to make his eſcape to the mountains. This precaution proved unneceſſary; for the natives of that part of the iſland having obtained information of the Captain's approach, were prepared to deliver up the fugitive. He was found, with his muſquet lying before him ſeated betwixt two women, who, the inſtant that the Captain entered the houſe, roſe up to plead in his vindication. As ſuch proceedings deſerved to be diſcouraged, the Captain, with a ſtern look, bid them be gone; upon which they burſt into tears, and retired. Paha, the chief of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, now came with a ſucking-pig, and a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-tree, which he was on the point of preſenting to Captain Cook, as a peace-offering; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it, and having ordered the chief to quit his preſence, embarked with Harriſon in one of the boats, and returned to the ſhips. After this harmony was ſpeedily reſtored. The delinquent made no other excuſe for his conduct, than that the natives had enticed him away: which perhaps was in a great meaſure true, as Paha, and
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030274_0502_0FE56F4A29E60360"/>
the two women above-mentioned, had been at the ſhip the day before his deſertion. As he had remained at his ſtation till within a few minutes of the time in which he was to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by another, the puniſhment he received was not very ſevere.</p>
                     <p>About a fortnight after we had arrived in Ulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea, Omai diſpatched two of his people in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe, with intelligence, that he continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed by the inhabitants of Huaheine, and that every thing ſucceeded with him, except that his goat had died in kidding. This informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was accompanied with a requeſt that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook would ſend him another goat, and alſo two axes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pleaſed with this additional oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſerving his friend, the Captain ſent back the meſſengers to Huaheine, on the 18th, with the axes, and a male and female kid.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday the 19th, the Commodore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Captain Clerke his inſtructions how to proceed, in caſe of ſeparation, after quitting theſe iſlands. The purport of theſe inſtructions was as follows: that, whereas the paſſage from the Society Iſles to the nothern coaſt of America was of conſiderable length, and as a part of it muſt be performed in the depth of winter, when boiſterous weather muſt be expected, which might perhaps occaſion a ſeparation, Captain Clerke ſhould take all poſſible care to prevent this; but that if the two ſhips ſhould chance to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030274_0503_0FE56EE6AF707478"/>
he, after ſearching for Captain Cook, and not finding him in five days, was to proceed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the coaſt of New Albion, and endeavour to fall in with it in the latititude of 45°, where he was to cruize for him ten days; and not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in that time, was to put into the firſt convenient harbour, in or to the north of that latitude, to obtain refreſhments, and take in wood and water that, during his continuance in port he was conſtantly to look out for Captain Cook; and if the latter did not join him before the 1ſt of April following, he was to proceed northward to the latitude of 56°, where, at ſuch a diſtance from the coaſt as did not exceed fifteen leagues, he was to cruize for him till the 10th of May; and not finding him, was to proceed on a north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly courſe, and attempt to diſcover a paſſage into the Atlantice Ocean, either through Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's or Baffin's Bays, as directed by the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Board of Admiralty: that, if he ſhould fail in thoſe endeavours he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamtſchatka, and paſs the winter there: but that if he could not procure refreſhments at that port, he was at liberty to go where he ſhould think proper, leaving with the Governor, before his departure, an account of his deſtination, to be delivered to Captain Cook on his arrival; and that, in the ſpring of the year following (1779) he was to return to the port above-mentioned:
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030274_0504_0FE56F4BB0287DC0"/>
that if he then received no further orders from Captain Cook, ſo as to juſtify his purſuing any other meaſures than thoſe which were pointed out in the inſtructions of the Lords of the Admiralty, his future proceedings were to be directed by them; and that, in caſe of being prevented, by illneſs or any other cauſe, from carrying theſe, and the inſtructions of their Lordſhips, into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he was to leave them with the officer who was next in command.</p>
                     <p>While we lay moored to the ſhore, we ſcrubbed both ſides of the bottoms of our veſſels, and alſo fixed ſome plates of tin under the binds. Theſe plates Captain Cook received from the ingenious Mr. Pelham, Secretary to the Commiſſioners for victualling the royal navy, for the purpoſe of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether tin would ſucceed as well as copper, in ſheathing the bottoms of ſhips.</p>
                     <p>On Monday the 24th, in the morning, the Commodore was informed that two of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery's people, one of whom was a midſhipman, were miſſing. Not long after, we learned from the natives, that they had embarked in a canoe the preceding night, and were now at the other end of the iſland. As the Midſhipman had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a deſire of continuing at one of theſe iſlands, it was extremely probable that he and his companion had gone off with that intent. Captain Clerke therefore, with two armed boats, and a detachment of marines, ſet out in queſt of
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030274_0505_0FE56EE85BADD890"/>
the fugitives, but returned in the evening with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs. From the conduct of the iſlanders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was of opinion, that they intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the deſerters; and, with this view, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with falſe information, directing h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> to ſeek for them where they could not be found. He was not miſtaken; for the next morning, intelligence was brought, that the two runaways were in the Iſle of Otaha. Theſe not being the only perſons in the ſhips who were deſirous of remaining at theſe favourite iſlands, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to give an effectual diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any further deſertion, to recover them at all events. Captain Cook therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go in purſuit of them himſelf, having obſerved that the natives ſeldom attempted to amuſe him with falſe information. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſet out with two armed boats, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by Oreo himſelf. They proceeded, without ſtopping at any place, till they came to the eaſtern ſide of Otaha, where they put aſhore; and the chief diſpatched a man before them, with orders to ſeize the fugitives, and keep them till the Captain and his attendants ſhould arrive with the boats. But when they had got to the place where they expected to find them, they were informed, that they had quitted this iſland, and gone to Bolabola the preceding day. The Captain, not chuſing to follow them thither, returned to the ſhips, with a full determination to have recourſe
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030274_0506_0FE56F5D1DF192B8"/>
to a meaſure, which, he had reaſon to believe, would compel the natives to reſtore them.</p>
                     <p>On the 26th, ſoon after break of day, Oreo, with his ſon, daughter, and ſon-in-law, having come on board the Reſolution, Captain Cook re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to detain the three laſt, till our deſerters ſhould be delivered up. With this wiew, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke invited them on board his ſhip; and, as ſoon as they arrived in his cabin, a ſentinel was placed at the door, and the window ſecured. This proceeding greatly ſurprized them; and Captain Clerke having explained the reaſon of it they burſt into tears, and begged he would not kill them. He aſſured them he would not, and that the moment his people were brought back, they ſhould be releaſed. This however, did not remove their uneaſineſs, and they bewailed their fate in ſilent ſorrow. The chief being with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook when he received intelligence of this affair, immediately mentioned it to him, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that this ſtep had been taking without his knowledge and approbation. The Captain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly undeceived him; and then he began to entertain apprehenſions with reſpect to his own ſituation, and his countenance indicated the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perturbation of mind. But the Captain ſoon quieted his fears, by telling him, that he was at liberty to quit the ſhip whenever he choſe, and to take ſuch ſteps towards the recovery of our two men, as he ſhould judge beſt calculated for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030274_0507_0FE56EEF9B3A3ED0"/>
that purpoſe; and that, if he ſhould meet with ſucceſs, his friends on board the Diſcovery ſhould be releaſed from their confinement: if not, that they ſhould certainly be carried away with us. The Captain added, that the chief's conduct, as well as that of many of his countrymen, in not only aſſiſting theſe two men to make their eſcape, but in endeavouring, at this very time, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon others to follow them, would juſtify any meaſure that would ſerve to put a ſtop to ſuch proceedings. This explanation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives upon which the Commodore acted, ſeemed to remove, in a great degree, that general conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into which Oreo, and his people who were preſent, were at firſt thrown. But, though relieved from all apprehenſions with regard to their own ſafety, they were ſtill under the deepeſt concern for the priſoners in the Diſcovery. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them went under the ſtern of that ſhip in canoes, and lamented their captivity with long and loud exclamations. The name of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dooa (for that was the appellation of Oreo's daughter) reſounded from every quarter; and the women not only made a moſt diſmal howling, but ſtruck their boſoms, and cut their heads with ſhark's teeth, which occaſioned a conſiderable effuſion of blood.</p>
                     <p>The chief now diſpatched a canoe to Bola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola, with a meſſage to Opoony, king of that iſland, informing him of what had happened
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030274_0508_0FE56F5036442A88"/>
and requeſting him to ſeize the two deſerters, and ſend them back. The meſſenger, who was the father of Oreo's ſon-in-law Pootoe, came to receive Captain Cook's commands before his departure; who ſtrictly enjoined him not to return without the fugitives, and to tell Opoony, from him, that if they had left the iſle of Bolabola, he muſt ſend canoes in purſuit of them.</p>
                     <p>The impatient natives, not thinking proper to truſt to the return of our people for the releaſe of the priſoners, were induced to meditate an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which if it had not been prevented might have involved them in ſtell greater diſtreſs. Between five and ſix o'clock, Captain Cook, who was then on ſhore, abreaſt of the ſhip, obſerved that all their conoes, in and about the harbour, began to move off. He enquired, in vain, for the cauſe of this; till our people, calling to us from the Diſcovery, informed us, that ſome of the iſlanders had ſeized Captain Clerke and Mr. Gore, as they were walking at a ſmall diſtance from the ſhips. The Commodore, ſtruck with the boldneſs of this ſcheme of retaliation, which ſeemed to counteract him in his own way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly commanded his people to arm; and, in a few minutes, a ſtrong party, under the conduct of Mr. King, was ſent to the reſcue of our two gentlemen. Two armed boats, and a party under Mr. Williamſon, were diſpatched at the ſame time to intercept the flying canoes in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030274_0509_0FE56F1DD686B558"/>
to the ſhore. Theſe detachments had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone out of ſight, when intelligence arrived that we had been miſinformed; upon which they were immediately called in.</p>
                     <p>It manifeſtly appeared, however, from ſeveral corroborating particulars, that the natives had actually formed the deſign of ſeizing Captain Clerke; and they even made no ſecret in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it the following day. But the principal part of their plan of operations was to have laid hold of the perſon of Captain Cook. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to bathe every evening in the freſh water; on which occaſions he frequently went alone, and always unarmed. Expecting him to go this evening, as uſual, they had reſolved upon ſeizing him, and Captain Clerke likewiſe, if he had accompanied him. But Captain Cook, after confining the chief's family, had taken care to avoid putting himſelf in their power; and had cautioned Captain Clerke and the officers, not to go to any conſiderable diſtance from the ſhips. Oreo, in the courſe of the afternoon, aſked our Commodore, three or four times, if he would not go to the batihing place; till at length finding that he could not be prevailed upon, he retired, with his people, notwithſtanding all our entreaties to the contrary. Having no ſuſpicion, at this time, of their deſign, Captain Cook imagined, that a ſudden panic had ſeized them, which would probably be ſoon over. Being diſappointed with
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030274_0510_0FE56F1A62FED108"/>
reſpect to him, they fixed upon thoſe who were more in their power. It was a fortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that they did not ſucceed in their deſign, and that no miſchief was done on the occaſion; no muſquets being fired, except two or three, to ſtop the canoes; to which firing, perhaps, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke and Mr. Gore owed their ſafety<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not improbable that they were alſo indebted for their ſafety to Captain Clerke's walking with a piſtol in his hand, which he once fired. We mention this circumſtance on the authority of Captain King.</note>; for, at that moment, a party of the iſlanders, armed with clubs, were marching towards them, but diſperſed on hearing the report of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</p>
                     <p>This conſpiracy was firſt diſcovered by a girl who had been brought from Huaheine by one of our officers. Happening to overhear ſome of the Ulieteans ſay, that they would ſeize Meſſrs. Clerke and Gore, ſhe immediately ran to acquaint the firſt of our people that ſhe met with. Thoſe who had been intruſted with the execution of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, threatened to put her to death, as ſoon as we ſhould quit Ulietea, for diſappointing them. Being aware of this, we contrived that the girl's friends ſhould come, a day or two afterwards, and take her out of the ſhip, to convey her to a place where ſhe might remain concealed, till ſhe ſhould find an opportunity of returning to Huaheine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:030274_0511_0FE56F3648E7DC88"/>On Thurſday the 27th, we took down our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatories, and carried on board whatever we had aſhore; we then unmoored the ſhips, and moved a little way down the harbour, where we anchored again. Towards the afternoon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, ſhaking off their apprehenſions, gathered round, and on board, our ſhips, as uſual; and the unpleaſing tranſactions of the preceding day ſeemed to be almoſt forgotten by both parties. In the ſucceeding night the wind blew in hard ſqualls, which were accompanied with heavy ſhowers of rain. In one of theſe ſqualls, the cable by which the Reſolution was riding at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, parted; but, as we had another anchor ready to let go, the ſhip was quickly brought up again.</p>
                     <p>No account of our two fugitives having been received from Bolabola, Oreo now ſet out for that iſland, deſiring Captain Cook to follow him, the next day, with the ſhips. This was the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's intentions; but the wind prevented our getting out to ſea. The ſame wind, however, which detained us in the harbour, brought back Oreo, with the two deſerters, from Bolabola. They had reached Otaha on the night of their deſertion; but being, unable for the want of wind, to get to any of the iſlands lying to the eaſtward, as they at firſt intended, they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Bolalola, and thence to a little iſland called Toobace, where they were apprehended by
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030274_0512_0FE56F54A0C772F0"/>
Pootoe's father. As ſoon as they were brought on board, the three priſoners in the Diſcovery were reſtored to their liberty. Such was the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of an affair, which had given the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore much trouble and vexation.</p>
                     <p>The wind continuing conſtantly between the north and weſt, kept us in the harbour till Sunday the 7th of December; when, at eight o'clock in the morning, we weighed and made ſail, with a light breeze at the north-eaſt point. During the preceding week, we had been viſited by perſons from all quarters of the iſland, who afforded us a plentiful ſupply of hogs and green plantains, ſo that the time we remained wind-bound in the harbour was not totally loſt; for green plantains are an excellent ſuccedaneum for bread, and will keep good for two or three weeks. Beſides being furniſhed with theſe proviſions, we alſo took in plenty of wood and water</p>
                     <p>The Ulieteans appeared to be, in general ſmaller and more black than the natives of the adjacent iſlands, and ſeemed alſo leſs orderly, which may, perhaps, be owing to their having become ſubject to the inhabitants of Bolabola. Oreo, their chief, is only a kind of deputy of the Bolabolan monarch; and the conqueſt ſeems to have diminiſhed the number of ſubordinate chiefs reſident among them: they are, therefore, leſs immediately under the eye of thoſe whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it is to enforce a proper obedience. Though
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030274_0513_0FE56F620DF39FF0"/>
Ulietea is now reduced to this ſtate of humiliating dependence, it was formerly, as we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the moſt eminent of this group of iſlands, and was probably the firſt ſeat of goverment; for we were told, that the preſent royal family of Otaheite derives its deſcent from that which ruled here before the late revolution. The dethroned king of Ulietea, whoſe name is Ooroo, reſides at Huaheine, furniſhing, in his own perſon, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not only of the inſtability of power, but alſo of the reſpect paid by theſe iſlanders to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulur familes of princely rank; for they allow Ooroo to retain all the enſigns which are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated by them to royalty, notwithſtanding his having been deprived of his dominions. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a ſimilar inſtance of this during our ſtay at Ulietea, where one of our occaſional viſitants was Captain Cook's old friend Oree, late chief of Huaheine. He ſtill maintained his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and was conſtantly attended by a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous retinue.</p>

                     <p>HAVING taking our leave of Ulietea, we ſteered for Bolabola. Our principal reaſon for viſiting this iſland was, to procure one of the anchors which had been loſt at Otaheite by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Bougainville. This, we were informed, had been afterwards found by the natives there, and ſent by them to Opoony, the chief of Bola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola. It was not on account of being in want of anchors that we were anxious to get poſſeſſion of it; but, having parted with all our hatchets, and other iron tools and implements in purchaſing refreſhments, we were now obliged to create a freſh aſſortment of trading articles, by fabricating them from the ſpare iron we could find on board, and even the greateſt part of that had been already
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030274_0515_0FE56F1BEBE58C80"/>
expended. Captain Cook, therefore, ſuppoſed Mons. de Bougainville's anchor would, in a great meaſure, ſupply our want of this uſeful material, and he did not entertain a doubt that Opoony might be induced to part with it.</p>
                     <p>Oreo, accompanied by ſix or eight others from Ulietea, attended us to Bolabola; and, indeed, moſt of the natives, except the chief, would gladly have taken a paſſage with us to England. At ſun-ſet, being off the ſouth point of Bolabola, we ſhortened ſail, and paſſed the night making ſhort boards. On the 8th, at day break, we made ſail for the harbour, on the weſt ſide of the iſland. The wind being ſcant, it was nine o'clock before we were near enough to ſend away a boat to found the entrance.</p>
                     <p>The maſter, when he returned with the boat, reported, that the entrance of the harbour was rocky at the bottom, but that there was good ground within; and the debth of water twenty-five and twenty-ſeven fathoms; and that there was room to turn the ſhips in. Upon this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we attempted to work the ſhips in; but, the wind and tide being againſt us, we made two or three trips, and found it could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed till the tide ſhould turn in our favour. Whereupon Captain Cook gave up the deſign of carrying the ſhips into the harbour, and embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one of the boats, attended by Oreo and his companions, was rowed in for the iſland.</p>

The neceſſary formality of compliments being over, he requeſted the chief to give him the anchor; and, to induce him to comply with the requeſt, produced the preſen he intended for him. It conſiſted of a linen night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown, ſome gauze handkerchiefs, a ſhirt, a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, ſome beads and toys, and ſix axes. Opoony, however, refuſed to accept the preſent till the Commodore had received the anchor; and ordered three perſons to go and deliver it to him; with directions to receive from him what he thought proper in return. With theſe meſſengers we ſet out in our boats for a neighbouring iſland, where the anchor had been depoſited; but it was neither ſo large, nor ſo perfect, as we expected. By the mark that was upon it, we found that it had originally weighed ſeven hundred pounds; but it now wanted the two palms, the ring, and part of the ſhank. The reaſon of Opoony's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Captain Cook's preſent was now apparent; he, doubtleſs, ſuppoſed that the anchor, in its preſent ſtate, was ſo much inferior to it in value, that, when he ſaw it, he would be diſpleaſed. The Commodore, notwithſtanding, took the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor as he found it, and ſent the whole of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which he, at firſt, intended. This nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation being completed, the Commodore returned on board, hoiſted in the boats, and made ſail to
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030274_0518_0FE56F96B09DC148"/>
the north. But, while we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> hoiſting in the boats, we were viſited by ſome of the natives, who came off, in three or four canoes, to ſee the ſhips. They brought with them one pig, and a few cocoa-nuts.</p>
                     <p>Had we remained there till the next day, we ſhould probably have been ſupplied with plenty of proviſions; and the natives would, doubtleſs be diſappointed when they found we were gone: but, having already a good ſtock of hogs and fruit on board, and not many articles left to purchaſe more, we had no inducement to defer the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of our voyage.</p>
                     <p>Oteavanooa, the harbour of Bolabola, ſituated on the weſt ſide of the iſland, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Towards the middle of this iſland is a lofty double-peaked mountain, which appeared to be barren on the eaſt ſide, but, on the weſt ſide, has ſome trees or buſhes. The lower grounds, towards the ſea, like the other iſlands of this ocean, are covered with cocoa-palms, and bread-fruit trees. There are many little iſlots that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round it, which add to the number of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and to the amount of its vegetable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:030274_0519_0FE56F09A7DD9100"/>Conſidering the ſmall extent of Bolabola, being only eight leagues in circumference, it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that its people ſhould have been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Ulietea and Otaha; the former of which iſlands is, alone, more than double its ſize. In each of Captain Cook's three voyages, the war which produced this great revolution, was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned; and, as it may amuſe the reader, we ſhall give the hiſtory, of it as related by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Ulietea and Otaha had long been friends; or as the natives emphatically expreſs it, they were conſidered as two brothers, whoſe views and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts where the ſame. The iſland of Huaheine was alſo admitted as their friend, but not in ſo eminent a degree. Like a traitor, Otaha leagued with Bolabola, jointly to attack Ulietea; whoſe people required the aſſiſtance of their friends of Huaheine, againſt theſe united powers. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Bolabola were encouraged by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs, who predicted their ſucceſs; and, that they might rely upon her prediction, ſhe deſired a man might be ſent to a particular part of the ſea, where, from a great depth, would ariſe a ſtone. He was accordingly ſent in a canoe to the place ſpecified, and was going inſtantly to dive after the ſtone, when, behold, it ſpontaneouſly ſtarted up to the ſurface, and came immediately into his hand! All the people were aſtoniſhed at the ſight; the ſtone was deemed ſacred, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030274_0520_0FE56F3DD5D26148"/>
in the houſe of the <hi>Eatooa</hi>; and is ſtill preſerved, as a proof that this propheteſs had great influence with the divinity. Elevated with the hopes of victory, the canoes of Bolabola at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked thoſe of Ulietea and Huaheine; the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter was of long duration, and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miracle, the Bolabola fleet would have been vanquiſhed, had not that of Otaha arrived at the critical moment. The fortune of the day was now turned, and their enemies were totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. Two days after, the men of Bolabola invaded Huaheine, of which they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters; it being weakly defended, as moſt of its warriors were then abſent. Many of its fugitives, however, having got to Otaheite, there related their lamentable tale. This ſo affected their own countrymen, and thoſe of Ulietea whom they found in that iſland, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their aſſiſtance. They were furniſhed with only ten fighting canoes, and with that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force, effected a landing at Huaheine, when dark at night; and, taking the Bolabola men by ſurprize, killed many of them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed the reſt. Thus they again poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own iſland, which now remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and is governed by its own chiefs. When the united fleets of Ulietea and Huaheine were defeated, the men of Bolabola were applied to by their allies of Otaha to be allowed an equal ſhare of the conqueſts. This being refuſed, the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030274_0521_0FE56FD5CF703988"/>
alliance broke; and, during the war, Otaha was conquered, as well as Ulietea, both of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſubject to Bolabola; the chiefs by whom they are governed, being only deputies to Opoony, the king of that iſland.</p>
                     <p>Such was their hiſtory of the war. It has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been obſerved, that theſe people are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely deficient in recollecting the exact dates of paſt events. And, reſpecting this war, though it happened but a few years ago, we could only gueſs at the time of its commencement and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the natives not being able to ſatisfy our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries with any preciſion. The final <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> atchieved before Captain Cook was there in 1769; but it was very apparent that peace had not been long reſtored, as marks of recent hoſtilities having been committed were then to be ſeen. By at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the age of Teereetareea, the preſent chief of Huaheine, ſome additional collateral proof may be gathered. He did not appear to be above ten or twelve years of age, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we were informed, had been killed in one of the engagements.</p>
                     <p>The Bolabola men, ſince the conqueſt of Ulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea and Otaha, are conſidered as invincible; and their fame is ſo far extended, that, even at Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite, if not dreaded, they are reſpected for their valour. It is aſſerted, that they never fly from an enemy, and that they always are victorious
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030274_0522_0FE56FD757CAD200"/>
againſt an equal number of the other iſlanders. Their neighbours, too, aſcribe much to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of their god, who, they believed, detained us by contrary winds at Ulietea.</p>
                     <p>The eſtimation in which the Bolabola men are held at Otaheite, may be gathered from Monſieur de Bougainville's anchor having been ſent to their ſovereign. The intention of tranſporting the Spaniſh bull to their iſland, muſt be aſcribed to the ſame cauſe. And they already poſſeſſed a third European curioſity, a male animal brought to Otaheite by the Spainards. This animal had been ſo imperfectly deſcribed by the natives, that we had been much puzzled to conjecture what it could be. Some good, however, generally ariſes out of evil. When Captain Clerke's deſerters were brought back from Bolabola, they told us the animal had been ſhewn to them, and that it was a ram. If our men had not deſerted, it is probable we ſhould never have known this.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of this intelligence, Captain Cook, when he landed to meet Opoony, carried an ewe on ſhore, of the Cape of Good Hope breed; by which he has probably laid the foundation for a breed of ſheep at Bolabola. He alſo left with Oreo, at Ulietea, two goats, and an Engliſh boar and ſow: ſo that the race of hogs will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably improved, in a few years, at Otaheite, and all the neighbouring iſlands; and they will,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030274_0523_0FE56FD92BF3F018"/>
perhaps, be ſtocked with many valuable Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean animals.</p>
                     <p>When this is really the caſe, theſe iſlands will be unrivalled in abundance, and variety of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſupply of navigators. Even in their preſent ſtate, they are hardly to be excelled. When the inhabitants are not diſturbed by inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine broils, which has been the caſe for ſeveral years paſt, their productions are numerous and plentiful.</p>
                     <p>If we had poſſeſſed a greater aſſortment of goods, and a proper quantity of ſalt, we might have ſalted as much pork, as would have been ſufficient to laſt both ſhips almoſt a year. But we quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted our trading commodities at the Friendly Iſlands, Otaheite, and its neighbourhood. Our axes, in particular, were nearly gone, with which, alone, hogs were, in general, to be purchaſed. The ſalt that remained on board, was not more than was requiſite for curing fifteen puncheons of meat.</p>
                     <p>The following proceſs of curing pork has been adopted by Captain Cook in his ſeveral voyages. The hogs were killed in the evening; when cleaned, they were cut up, and the bone taken out. The meat was ſalted while it was hot, and laid ſo as to permit the juices to drain from it, till the next morning: it was then ſalted again, put into a caſk, and covered with pickle. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, in this ſituation, four or five days; when
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030274_0524_0FE56F76A1D072C8"/>
it was taken out, and carefully examined; and, if any of it appeared to be in the leaſt tainted. which was ſometimes the caſe, it was ſeparated from the reſt, which was repacked, headed up, and filled with good pickle. It was again exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in about eigth or ten days time, but there appeared to be no neceſſity for it, as it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally found to be all perfectly cured. Bay and white ſalt, mixed together, anſwers the beſt, though either of them will do alone. Great care was taken that none of the large blood-veſſels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the meat; and not too much ſhould be packed together at the firſt ſalting, leaſt thoſe pieces which are in the middle ſhould heat, and hinder the ſalt from penetrating them. In tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical climates, meat ought not to be ſalted in rainy ſultry weather.</p>
                     <p>Europeans having, of late, ſo frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited theſe iſlanders, they may, on that account, have been induced to breed a larger ſtock of hogs; knowing that, whenever we come, they may be certain of receiving what they eſteem a valuable conſideration for them. They daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Spainards at Otaheite, and, in two or three years time, they will doubtleſs expect the Engliſh there, as well as the other iſlands. It is uſeleſs to aſſure them that you will not return, for they ſuppoſe you cannot avoid it; though none of them either know, or enquire, the reaſon of your coming. It would, perhaps, have been
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030274_0525_0FE56FDF48FA1498"/>
better of theſe people, to have been ignorant of our ſuperiority, than, after once knowing it, to be abandoned to their original incapacity. They cannot, indeed, be reſtored to their former happy mediocrity, if the intercourſe between us ſhould be diſcontinued</p>
                     <p>It is, in a manner, incumbent on the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans to pay them occaſional viſits (once in three or four years) to ſupply them with thoſe articles, which we, by introducing, have given them a predilection for. The want of ſuch ſupplies may be ſeverely felt, when it is too late to return to their old imperfect contrivances, which they now deſpiſe and diſcard. When the iron tools, with which we have furniſhed them, are worn out, their own will be almoſt forgotten. A ſtone hatchet is now as great a curioſity among them, as an iron one was ſeven or eight years ago; and a chiſſel made of bone, or ſtone, is no where to be ſeen. Spike nails have been ſubſtituted in the room of the latter articles; and they are weak enough to imagine, that their ſtore of them is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible, for they were no longer ſought after.</p>
                     <p>Knives happened at this time, to be in high eſtimation at Ulietea; and axes and hatchets bore unrivalled ſway at all the iſlands. Reſpecting ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles merely ornamented, theſe iſlanders are as changeable as the moſt poliſhed European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for, an article which may be prized by them to-day, may, perhaps, be rejected to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030274_0526_0FE56FE10F6740A8"/>
as a faſhion or wim may alter. But our iron implements are ſo evidently uſeful, that they muſt continue to be high in their eſtimation. They would indeed, be miſerable, if they ſhould ceaſe to receive ſupplies of what appears neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to their comfortable exiſtence; as they are deſtitute of the materials, and ignorant of the art of fabricating them.</p>
                     <p>In our former relations, too much has already been publiſhed, reſpecting ſome of the modes of life, which rendered Otaheite ſo pleaſing an abode to many of our people; and, if we could add any finiſhing ſtrokes to that picture, we ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to exhibit a view of ſuch licentious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as cannot fail to be diſguſting.</p>
                     <p>Having now concluded our account reſpecting theſe iſlands, which ſtand ſo conſpicuous in the liſt of our diſcoveries, we refer the reader to the following chapter, for which we are indebted to Mr. Anderſon.</p>

                     <p>AFTER ſome prefatory remarks, on the accounts of the ſucceſſive voyages of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Wallis, Monſieur de Bougainville, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook, Mr. Anderſon begins to relate ſuch particulars concerning Otaheite, and its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring iſlands, as he was able to procure from Omai, or by converſing with the other natives.</p>
                     <p>For the greateſt part of the year, the wind blows from between eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, and eaſt-north-eaſt. It ſometimes blows with conſiderable
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030274_0528_0FE56FE467257FE8"/>
force, and is called by the natives <hi>Maaraee.</hi> When the wind blows ſtrong, the weather is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cloudy, with ſome rain; but, when it is more moderate, it is clear, ſettled and ſerene: if the wind ſhould veer to ſouth-eaſt, or ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, it blows more gently and is called <hi>Maoai.</hi> In December and January, when the ſun is nearly vertical, both the winds and weather are very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable; but it often blows from weſt-north-weſt, or north-weſt. This wind is called <hi>Toerou</hi>; and is uſually attended by cloudy weather, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rain. It ſeldom continues more than five or ſix days without interruption; and is the only wind that will permit the inhabitants of the iſlands to leeward to viſit this in their canoes. If the wind is ſtill more northerly, it has the different appellation of <hi>Era-potaia.</hi> The wind from ſouth-weſt, and weſt-ſouth-weſt, is more frequent than the former, and is uſually gentle, with occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal calms and breezes, yet it ſometimes blows in very briſk ſqualls. The weather is then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally cloudy and rainy, with the cloſe hot air; often accompanied with much thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Is called by the natives <hi>Etoa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though the natives have no very accurate knowledge of thoſe changes they pretend to have drawn ſome concluſions from their effects. When the ſea has a hollow ſound, and daſhes mildly on the ſhore, they ſay it portends good weather: but, if it ſounds harſhly, and the waves
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030274_0529_0FE56FE8591BE310"/>
rapidly ſucceed each other, the reverſe is to be expected.</p>
                     <p>The ſouth-eaſt part of Otaheite, affords one of the moſt luxuriant proſpects in the univerſe. The hills are high, ſteep, and craggy; but they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the very ſummits with trees and ſhrubs; the rocks ſeeming to poſſeſs the property of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing their verdant clothing. The lower land and vallies teem with various productions, that grow with exuberant vigour, and convey to the mind of the beholders, an idea, that no country upon earth can vie with this in the ſtrength and beauty of vegetation; nature has been equally li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in diſtributing rivulets, which glide through every valley, dividing, as they approach the ſea, into ſeveral branches, fertilizing the land, through which they run.</p>
                     <p>The habitations of the natives are irregularly ſcattered upon the flat land; and many of them, along the ſhore, afforded us a delightful ſcene from our ſhips; eſpecially as the ſea, within the reef, is perfectly ſtill, and affords, at all times, a ſafe navigation for the inhabitants, who are often ſeen paſſing and repaſſing in their canoes. On beholding theſe delightful ſcenes, I have often regretted my inability to tranſmit ſuch a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, as would convey an impreſſion ſomewhat ſimilar to what I felt, who have been fortunate enough to have been on the ſpot. The natural fertility of the country, combined with
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030274_0530_0FE57008684BB838"/>
the mildneſs and ſerenity of the elimate, has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the natives ſo careleſs in their cultivation, that the ſmalleſt traces of it cannot, in many places, be diſcovered, though overflowing with the richeſt productions. The cloth plant, and the <hi>ava,</hi> or intoxicating pepper, are almoſt the only things to which they ſhew any attention.</p>
                     <p>The bread-fruit tree is never planted, but ſprings from the roots of the old ones, which ſpread themſelves near the ſurface of the ground. Hence we may obſerve, that the inhabitants of Otaheite, inſtead of being under a neceſſity of planting their bread, will rather be obliged to prevent its progreſs; which is, perhaps, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done, to afford room for a different ſort of trees, which may enable them to make ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in their food.</p>
                     <p>The principal of theſe trees are the cocoa-nut and plantain; the firſt of which requires no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, after it appears a foot or two above the ground; but the plaintain requires ſome care in the cultivation; for about three months after it ſhoots up, it begins to bear fruit; during which time it puts forth young ſhoots, which ſupply a ſucceſſion of fruit; the old ſtocks being cut down as the fruit is taken off.</p>
                     <p>The products of the iſland are more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their great abundance than for their variety; and curioſities here are not very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Among theſe may be reckoned a large
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030274_0531_0FE5700A50E001E0"/>
lake of freſh water, on the top of one of the higheſt mountains, at the diſtance of almoſt two days journey. It is remarkable for its depth, and abounds with eels of an enormous ſize. This being eſteemed the greateſt natural curioſity of the country, travellers, who come from other iſlands, are uſually aſked, among the firſt things, at their return, whether they have ſeen it. There is alſo a ſmall pond of water on this iſland, which has a yellow ſediment at the bottom. It has the appearence of being very good, but has an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive taſte, and often proves fatal to thoſe who drink a quantity of it; and thoſe who bathe in it, break out in blotches.</p>
                     <p>On our arrival here, we were ſtruck with the remarkable contraſt between the inhabitants of Tongataboo, and thoſe of Otaheite; the former being of a robuſt make, and dark colour, and the latter having a diſtinguiſhed delicacy and whiteneſs. That difference, however, did not immediately preponderate in favour, of the Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heiteans; and, when it did it was, perhaps, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned more by our becoming accuſtomed to them; the marks, which had recommended the others, beginning now to be forgotten.</p>
                     <p>The women however, of Otaheite, poſſeſs all thoſe delicate charecteriſtics, which in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries diſtinguiſh them from the other ſex. The men wear their beards long here, and their hair conſiderably longer than at Tongataboo, which
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030274_0532_0FE5700BD6F73620"/>
gave them a very different appearance. The Otaheiteans are timid and fickle. They are not ſo muſcular and robuſt as the Friendly Iſlanders, ariſing, perhaps, from their being accuſtomed to leſs action; the ſuperior fertility of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try enabling them to lead a more indolent life. They have a plumpneſs and ſmoothneſs of the ſkin; which, though more conſenant with our ideas of beauty, is far from being an advantage; and is attended with a kind of langour in all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is viſible in their boxing and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which diſplay only the feeble efforts of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if compared to the vigour and activity with which ſuch exerciſes are performed at the Friendly Iſlands.</p>
                     <p>As perſonal endowments are in high eſtimation among them, they have various methods of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, according to their ideas of beauty. Among the <hi>Erreoes,</hi> or unmarried men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of ſome conſequence, it is cuſtomary to undergo a kind of phyſical operation, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them fair; which is done by continuing a month or two in the houſe, wearing a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of cloaths the whole time, and eating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bread-fruit, which they ſay is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably efficacious in whitening the ſkin. They alſo intimate, that their corpulence and colour, at other times, depend upon their food; being obliged, as the ſeaſons vary, to uſe different food at different times.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:030274_0533_0FE5700D5DF213A0"/>Nine-tenths, at leaſt, of their common diet, conſiſt of vegetable food; and the <hi>mahee,</hi> or fermented bread-fruit, which is an article in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every meal, prevents coſtiveneſs, and has a ſingular effect in producing coolneſs about them, which was not perceivable in us who fed on animal food. To this temperate courſe of life, may, perhaps, be attributed their having ſo few diſeaſes among them. Indeed, they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only five or ſix chronic or national diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; among which are the dropſy, and the <hi>fefai,</hi> mentioned as frequent at Tongataboo. This was, however, before the arrival of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans; for we have added a diſeaſe to their cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, which abundantly ſupplies the place of all the others, and is become almoſt univerſal; and for which they ſeem to have no effectual remedy. The prieſts, indeed, adminiſter a medly of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but they acknowledge it never cures them. They admit, however, that in ſome few caſes, nature alone has exterminated the poiſon of this loathſome diſeaſe, and produced a perfect reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. They ſay alſo, that thoſe infected with it, communicate it to others, by handling them, or feeding on the ſame utenſils.</p>
                     <p>They ſhew an openneſs, and generoſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, upon all occaſions. Omai, indeed, has frequently ſaid, that they exerciſe cruelty in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their enemies, and torment them with great deliberation; ſometimes tearing out ſmall
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030274_0534_0FE5701253F5A268"/>
pieces of fleſh from different parts of the body; at other times, plucking out the eyes, then cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the noſe; and laſtly, completing the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, by opening the belly. But this is only on very extraordinary occaſions. If cheerfulneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from conſcious innocence, one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine their whole lives had been unſullied with a crime. This, however, may be rather imputed to their feelings, which, though lively, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permanent. Under any misfortune, after the critical moment is paſt, they never labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appearance of anxiety. Care never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a wrinkle on their brow; even the approach of death does not deprive them of their viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. I have ſeen them, when on the brink of the grave by diſeaſe, and when preparing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the enemy; but, in neither of theſe caſes, have I ever obſerved their countenances over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded with melancholy or dread.</p>
                     <p>Diſpoſed, as they naturally are, to direct their aims to what will afford them eaſe or pleaſure, all their amuſements tend to excite their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paſſions; and their ſongs, with which they are greatly delighted, are directed to the ſame purpoſe. A conſtant ſucceſſion of ſenſual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt, however, cloy; and they occaſionally varied them to more refined ſubjects; they chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their triumphs in war, and their amuſements in peace; their travels and adventures; and the peculiar advantages of their own iſland.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:030274_0535_0FE570146ADF43F8"/>This ſhews that they are immoderately fond of muſic, and though they did not reliſh our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated compoſitions, they were much delighted with the more melodious ſounds, when produced ſingly, as they, in ſome degree, reſembled the ſimplicity of their own. They equally experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the ſoothing effects produced, by particular kinds of motion; which, in many caſes, will allay any perturbation of mind, as ſucceſsfully as muſic. Of this, the following may ſerve as a remarkable inſtance. Walking, one day, about Matavi Point, I ſaw a man in a ſmall canoe, paddling with ſuch expedition, and looking ſo eagerly about him, as to command my whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. At firſt, I ſuppoſed he had been pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one of the ſhips, and was purſued; but he preſently repeated his amuſement. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the ſhore to the place where the ſwell begins; and, attentively watching its firſt motion, paddled ſwiftly before it, till he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it overtook him, and had acquired ſufficient ſtrength to force his canoe before it, without paſſing underneath. He then ceaſed paddling, and was carried along as rapidly as the wave, till he was landed upon the beach; when he ſtarted from his canoe, emptied it, and went in purſuit of another ſwell. He ſeemed to experience the moſt ſupreme delight, while he was thus ſwiftly and ſmoothly driven by the ſea. His mind was ſo wholly occupied in this buſineſs, that, though
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030274_0536_0FE57015F1177588"/>
crouds of his countrymen were collected to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our tents and ſhips, as being objects that were both rare and curious to them, he did not notice them in the leaſt. Two or three of the natives drew near, while I was obſerving him, and ſeemed to partake of his felicity; calling out to inform him when there was an appearance of a favourable ſwell. This exerciſe, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand is very frequent among them, is called <hi>chorooe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though the language of Otaheite ſeems radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the ſame as that of New-Zealand and the Friendly Iſlands, it has not that guttural pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and is pruned of ſome of the conſonants, with which thoſe dialects abound; which has rendered it, like the manners of the inhabitants, ſoft and ſoothing. It abounds with beautiful and figurative expreſſions, and is ſo copious, that they have above twenty different names for the bread-fruit; as many for the <hi>taro</hi> root, and half that number for the cocoa-nut.</p>
                     <p>They have one expreſſion correſponding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with the phraſeology of the Scriptures, viz. "Yearning of the bowels." They uſe it upon every occaſion, when affected by the paſſions; conſtantly referring pain from grief, deſire, and other affections, to the bowels, as the ſeat of it; where they imagine, all opperations of the mind are alſo performed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:030274_0537_0FE57017CBB78EB8"/>In the arts, they are extremely deficient; yet they pretend to perform cures in ſurgery, which our knowledge in that branch has not enabled us to imitate. Simple fractures are bound up with ſplints, but if a part of the bone be loſt, they inſert, between the fractured ends, a piece of wood made hollow, to ſupply its place. The <hi>rapaoo,</hi> or ſurgeon, inſpects the wound in about five or ſix days, when he finds the wood is partly covered by the growing fleſh; and, in as many more days, viſits the patient a ſecond time, when it is generally completely covered; and, when he has acquired ſome ſtrength, he bathes in the water and is reſtored.</p>
                     <p>Wounds, it is well known, will heal over leaden bullets, and there are ſome inſtances of their healing over other extraneous bodies. But what makes me entertain ſome doubt of the truth of this relation, is, that in thoſe caſes which fell under my obſervation, they were far from being ſo dexterous. I was ſhewn the ſtump of an arm, which had been taken off, that had not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a ſkilful operation, after making a due allowance for their defective inſtruments. And I ſaw a man going about with a diſlocated ſhoulder, ſome months after he had received the accident, from their being unacquainted with a method of reducing it: though it is one of the ſimpleſt operations of our ſurgery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:030274_0538_0FE5702097E687C0"/>Fractures of the ſpine, they know, are mortal; and they alſo know, from experience, in what particular parts of the body wounds prove fatal. Their phyſical knowledge ſeems yet more limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe, perhaps, their diſeaſes are fewer than their accidents. In ſome caſes, however, the prieſts adminiſter the juices of herbs; and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, afflicted with after-pains, or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints after child-bearing, uſe a remedy which ſeems unneceſſary in a hot country. Having heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ſtones, they lay a thick cloth over them, covered with a quantity of a ſmall plant of the muſtard kind; and over them is ſpread another cloth. On this they ſeat themſelves, and ſweat profuſely to obtain a cure. This method has been practiſed by the men, though ineffectually, for the cure of the venereal <hi>lues.</hi> It is remarkable, that they have no emetic medicines here.</p>
                     <p>A famine frequently happens in this iſland, notwithſtanding its extreme fertility, in which many people are ſaid to periſh. Whether this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity be owing to the ſcanty produce of ſome ſeaſons, to over-population, or to wars, I have not been ſufficiently informed; but it has taught them to exerciſe the ſtricteſt oeconomy, even in the times of plenty.</p>
                     <p>In a ſcarcity of proviſion, when their yams and bread-fruit are conſumed, they have recourſe to various roots which grow uncultivated upon the mountains. The <hi>patarra,</hi> which is found in great
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030274_0539_0FE570229BC92CA8"/>
plenty, is firſt uſed: it ſomewhat reſembles a large potatoe, or yam; and, when in its growing ſtate, is good, but becomes hard and ſtringy when old. They next eat two other roots, one of which appears like <hi>taro;</hi> and then the <hi>ehoee.</hi> Of this there are two ſorts; one of which poſſeſſes dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious qualities, which requires it to be ſliced; and macerated in water, a night before it is baked for eating. It reſembles, in this reſpect, the <hi>caſſava</hi> root of the Weſt-Indies; but in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they dreſs it, has a very inſipid taſte. This and the <hi>patarra</hi> are creeping plants, the latter having ternate leaves.</p>
                     <p>A very ſmall portion of animal food is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the lower claſs of people; and if, at any time, they obtain any, it is either fiſh, ſea-eggs, or other marine productions; for pork hardly ever falls to their ſhare. Only the <hi>Eree de hoi,</hi> is able to afford pork every day; and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior chiefs, according to their riches, perhaps once a week, a fortnight, or a month. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, indeed, they are not allowed that; for, when the iſland is impoveriſhed by war, or any other means, a prohibition is granted againſt the killing of hogs, which ſometimes continues in force for ſeveral months, and even for a year or two. In ſuch an interval, the hogs have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſo faſt, that there have been inſtances of their changing there domeſtic ſtate, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wild.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:030274_0540_0FE57025346EB2F0"/>When this prohibition is taken off, the chiefs aſſemble at the king's habitation, each bringing with him a preſent of hogs. After this, the king orders ſome of them to be killed, of which they all partake, and each returns to his own home, with full permiſſion to kill as many as he pleaſes for his own uſe. On our arrival here, ſuch a prohibition was actually in force, at leaſt in thoſe diſtricts under the immediate direction of Otoo. And, when we quitted Oheitepeha, fearing we ſhould not have gone to Matavai, he ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to aſſure us, that, as ſoon as the ſhips ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, it ſhould be taken off. We found it ſo, but our conſumption of them was ſo great, that there is very little doubt but it would be laid on again, immediately after we had ſailed. A prohibition is ſometimes extended to fowls.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ava</hi> is chiefly uſed among the better ſort of people, but this beverage is differently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, from that which we ſaw in the Friendly Iſlands. Here they pour a ſmall quantity of water upon the root, and often bake, roaſt, or bruiſe the ſtalks, without chewing it before it is infuſed. They alſo bruiſe the leaves of the plant here, and pour water upon them, as upon the root. It is not drank in large companies, in that ſociable way which is practiſed among the people at Tongataboo; but it has more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious effects here, owing, perhaps, to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030274_0541_0FE56FF5CE663010"/>
of its preparation; as we ſaw frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of its intoxicating powers.</p>
                     <p>Many of us, who had viſited theſe iſlands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were ſuprized to find ſeveral of the natives, who were remarkable for their ſize and corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency when we ſaw them laſt, now almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſkeletons; and the cauſe of this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was univerſally attributed to the uſe of the <hi>ava.</hi> Their ſkins were dry, rough, and covered with ſcales; which, they ſay, occaſionally fall off, and their ſkin becomes, in ſome degree, renewed. As an excuſe for ſo deſtructive a practice, they alledge, it is to prevent their growing too cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent; but it e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ervates them exceedingly, and probably ſhortens the duration of their lives.</p>
                     <p>Their meals at Otaheite are every frequent. The firſt is about two o'clock in the morning, after which they go to ſleep; the next is at eight; they dine at eleven, and again, as Omai expreſſed it, at two, and at five; and they go to ſupper at eight. They have adopted ſome very whimſical cuſtoms in this article in domeſtic life: the women are not only obliged to eat by themſelves, but are even excluded from partaking of moſt of the better ſorts of food. Turtle, or fiſh of the tunny kind, they dare not touch, though it is high in eſteem; ſome particular ſorts of the beſt plantains are alſo forbidden them; and even thoſe of the firſt rank are ſeldom permitted to eat pork. The children of both ſexes alſo eat
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030274_0542_0FE57026BB3472C8"/>
apart; and the women uſually ſerve up their own proviſions.</p>
                     <p>In this, and many other cuſtoms, relative to their eating, there is ſomething exceedingly myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious. On our inquiring into the reaſons of it, we were told, it was neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo; and that was the only anſwer we could receive when we interrogated them upon that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>They are not ſo obſcure and myſterious in their other cuſtoms reſpecting the females, eſpecially with regard to their connections with the men. When a young man and women, from mutual choice, agree to cohabit, the man makes a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the father of the girl of the common ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life, as hogs, cloth, or canoes; and if he ſuppoſes he has not received a valuable conſideration for his daughter, he compels her to leave her former friend, and to cohabit with a perſon who may be more liberal. The man, indeed, is always at full liberty to make a new choice; or, ſhould his conſort become a mother, he may deſtroy the child; and afterwards either leave the women, or continue his connection with her. But if he adopts the child, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it to live, the man and women are then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as in the married ſtate; and after that they ſeldom ſeparate. A man may however, without being cenſured, join a more youthful
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030274_0543_0FE5702C06740210"/>
partner to his firſt wife, and live with both of them.</p>
                     <p>The cuſtom of changing their conjugal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections is very general, and is ſo common an occurrence, that they mention it with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The <hi>erreoes,</hi> or thoſe of the better ſort who poſſeſs the means of purchaſing a ſucceſſion of freſh connections, are generally roaming about; and, having no particular attachment, ſeldom adopt the plan of a ſettled cohabitation. And this licentious plan of life is ſo agreeable to their diſpoſition, that the moſt beautiful of both ſexes exhauſt their youthful days in practices which would diſgrace the moſt ſavage tribes. Theſe enormities are peculiarly ſhocking in a country whoſe general character has, in other reſpects, evident traces of the prevalence of humane feelings. When an <hi>erreoe</hi> women brings forth a child, it is ſuffocated by applying a cloth to its mouth and noſe, which has been previouſly dipped in water.</p>
                     <p>As the women, in ſuch a life, muſt contribute greatly to its happineſs, it is ſurpriſing that they ſhould not only ſuffer the moſt humiliating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints with regard to food, but ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten treated with a degree of brutality, which one would ſuppoſe a man muſt be incapable of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an object for whom he had the leaſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or eſteem. It is, however, extremely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to ſee the men beat them moſt unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030274_0544_0FE5702E1B18B8C8"/>
and unleſs this behaviour proceeds from jealouſy, which both ſexes ſometimes pretend to be infected with, it will be difficult to aſſign a reaſon for it. This may the more readily be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a motive, as I have known many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where intereſt has been rejected for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal beauty; though even in theſe caſes, they are not ſuſceptible of thoſe delicate ſentiments that reſult from mutual affection. Platonic love is hardly known in Otaheite.</p>
                     <p>From a notion of cleanlineſs, the cutting of the foreſkin is a practice adopted among them; and they beſtow a reproachful epithet upon thoſe who neglect that operation. When five or ſix lads in a neighbourhood are pretty well grown up, it is made known to a <hi>tahoua</hi> by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one of them. The <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>houa,</hi> attended by a ſervant, conducts the lads to the top of the hills; and after ſeating one of them in a proper manner, places a piece of wood beneath the foreſkin, at the ſame time amuſing him by deſiring him to look aſide at ſomething which he pretends to ſee; the young man's attention being thus engaged, he immediately cuts through the ſkin with a ſhark's tooth, and ſeparates the divided parts; then, after putting on a bandage, he performs the ſame operation on the other lads who attend him.</p>
                     <p>Five days after they have been thus diſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they bathe, the bandages are removed, and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030274_0545_0FE5702FA29610A0"/>
the matter is cleanſed away. When five days more are expired, they bathe again, and are recovered; but, as a thickneſs of the prepuce remains, occaſioned by the cutting, they again aſcend the mountains with the <hi>tahoua</hi> and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, where a fire is prepared, and ſome ſtones heated; between two of which the prepuce is placed by the <hi>tahoua,</hi> and is gently ſqueezed, in order to remove the thickneſs. This done, they return home, adorned with odoriferous flowers; and the <hi>tahoua</hi> is rewarded by the fathers of the lads, according to their ſeveral abilities, with a preſent of hogs and cloth; and if their poverty will not permit them to make a proper acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, there relations on this, occaſion are expected to be liberal.</p>
                     <p>Their religious ſyſtem abounds in ſingularities, and few of the common people have a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge of it, that being principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to their prieſts, which indeed are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. They pay no particular reſpect to one god, as poſſeſſing pre-eminence; but believe in a plurality of divinities, who have each a pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of power.</p>
                     <p>As different parts of the iſland, and the other neighbouring iſlands, have different gods, the reſpective inhabitants imagine they have choſen the moſt eminent, or one who is at leaſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently powerful to protect them, and to ſupply their neceſſities. If he ſhould not give them

ſatisfaction, they think it no impiety to change. An inſtance of this kind has lately happened in Tiaraboo, where two divinities have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded, and Oraa, god of Bolabola, has been adopted in their room. They have probably been induced to make this new choice, becauſe his people have been victorious in war; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſince their new election, been ſucceſsful againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Otaheite-nooe,</hi> it is ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imputed to <hi>Oraa,</hi> who literally fights their battles.</p>
                     <p>In ſerving their gods, their aſſiduity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably conſpicuous. The <hi>whattas</hi> or offering-places of the <hi>morais</hi> are, in general, loaded with fruits and animals; and almoſt every houſe has a portion of it ſet apart for a ſimilar purpoſe. Many of them are ſo rigidly ſcrupulous in their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters, that they will not even begin a meal, till they have laid a ſide a morſel for the <hi>eatooa;</hi> and we have ſeen their ſuperſtitious zeal carried to a moſt pernicious height in their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſacrifices, which are, I fear, too frequent. They probably have recourſe to them to avert misfortunes. Their prayers, which they always chant like the ſongs in their feſtive entertainments, are alſo very frequent.</p>
                     <p>As in other caſes, ſo in religion, the women are obliged to ſhew their inferiority. When they paſs the <hi>morais</hi> they muſt partly uncover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or take an extenſive circuit to avoid them.
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030274_0547_0FE5703973DF6F28"/>
Though they do not entertain an opinion, that their god muſt be continually conferring bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, without ſometimes forſaking them, they are leſs concerned at this, than at the attempts of ſome inauſpicious being to injure them. <hi>Etee,</hi> they ſay, is an evil ſpirit, who delights in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; to whom they make offerings, as well as to their divinity. But all the miſchiefs they apprehend from inviſible beings, are merely temporal.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſoul, they believe it to be both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and immaterial; that during the pangs of death, it keeps fluttering about the lips; and that it aſcends, and is eaten by the deity; that it continues in this ſtate for ſome time; after which it takes its paſſage to a certain place, deſtined to receive the ſouls of men, and has exiſtence in eternal night; or rather in a kind of dawn, or twilight.</p>
                     <p>They expect no permanent puniſhment hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for crimes committed upon earth; the ſouls of good and bad men being indiſcriminately eaten by the deity. But they conſider this coalition as a kind of neceſſary purification before they enter the regions of bliſs; for their doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates, that thoſe who refrain from all ſenſual connection with women ſome months before they depart this life, paſs into their eternal manſion without ſuch a previous union, as if by ſuch an
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030274_0548_0FE5703B677C1BC8"/>
abſtinence they were ſufficiently pure to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the general lot.</p>
                     <p>They have not indeed thoſe ſublime concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of happineſs which our religion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our reaſon, teach us to expect hereafter. Immortality is the only great privilege they think they ſhall acquire by death; for they ſuppoſe that ſpirits are not entirely diveſted of thoſe paſſions by which they were actuated when combined with material vehicles. Thus, at a meeting of ſouls which were formerly enemies, many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts may enſue, which muſt certainly be inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual as thoſe who are in this inviſible ſtate muſt be invulnerable.</p>
                     <p>Their reaſoning is ſimilar with regard to the meeting of a man and his conſort. If the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band departs this life firſt, the ſoul of his wife is no ſtranger to him on its arrival in the land of ſpirits. They renew their former intimacy in a capacious building, called <hi>Tourooa,</hi> where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſouls aſſemble to recreate themſelves with the gods. The huſband then conducts her to his ſeparate habitation, where they eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and have an offspring, which, however, is purely ſpiritual, as their embraces are ſuppoſed to be far different from thoſe of corporeal beings.</p>
                     <p>Many of their notions reſpecting the Deity are extravagantly abſurd. They ſuppoſe him to be under the influence of thoſe ſpirits who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their exiſtence from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030274_0549_0FE5703D15766E38"/>
eat him, though he has power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create himſelf. They cannot converſe about im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material things, without referring to material ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to convey their meaning, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they uſe this mode of expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>They furthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> add, that, in the <hi>tourooa,</hi> the deity inquires whether they mean to deſtroy him, or not; and their determination is unalterable. This is not only known to the ſpirits, but alſo to the inhabitants of the earth; for, when the moon is on its wane, they are ſuppoſed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring their <hi>eatooa;</hi> and, in the proportion that it increaſes, he is renewing himſelf. And the ſuperior, as well as the inferior gods are liable to this accident.</p>
                     <p>Other places, they alſo believe, are prepared for the reception of departed ſouls. Thus they are of opinion, that thoſe who are drowned in the ſea continue there, and enjoy a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full country, ſumptuous habitations, and every thing that can contribute to their happineſs. They even maintain that all other animals have ſouls; and even trees, fruit, and ſtones; which, at their deceaſe, or upon their being conſumed or broken, aſcend to the deity, from whom they paſs into their deſtined manſion.</p>
                     <p>They imagine, that every temporal bleſſing is derived from their punctual performance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious offices. They believe that the powerful influence of the divine ſpirit is univerſally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030274_0550_0FE5703EE77643B0"/>
and therefore it cannot be matter of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that they adopt many ſuperſtitious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning its opperations. Sudden deaths and all other accidents, they ſuppoſe to be effected under the immediate impulſe of ſome divinity. If a man receives a wound in his toe, by ſtumbling againſt a ſtone, it is imputed to an <hi>Eatooa.</hi>

They have implicit confidence in dreams, ſuppoſing them to be communications from their deity, or from the ſpirit of their friends who have departed this life; and that thoſe who are favoured with them can foretell future events: but this kind of knowledge is limited to particular perſons. Omai pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have theſe communications. He aſſured us, that on the 26th of July 1776, his father's ſoul had intimated to him in a dream, that he ſhould land ſomewhere in three days; but he was unfortunate in his firſt prophetic attempt, for we did not get into Teneriſſe till the firſt of Auguſt.</p>
                     <p>Their dreamers, however, are thought little inferior to their inſpired prieſts and priſteſſes, whoſe predictions are univerſally credited; and all undertakings of conſequence are determined

by them. Opoony has a particular eſteem for the prieſteſs who perſuaded him to invade Ulietea, and always conſults her previous to his going to war. Our old doctrine of planetary influence, they, in ſome degree, adopt; and are ſometimes regulated in their public councils by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>They have ſtrange obſcure traditions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creation. Some goddeſs, they ſay, had a lump of earth ſuſpended in a cord, and, by giving it a ſwing round, ſcattered about ſeveral pieces of land, which conſtituted Otaheite and the adjacent iſlands; and that they were all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by one of each ſex, who originally fixed at Otaheite; but this only reſpects their own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate creation; for they admit of an univerſal one before this. Their remoteſt account extends to Tatooma and Tapuppa, who are male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male rocks, and ſupport our globe. Theſe begat Totorro, who was killed and divided into parts or parcels of land; then Otaia and Oroo were produced, who were afterwards married, and firſt begat land, and then a race of gods, Otaia being king, Oroo marries her ſon, a god, named Teorroha, whom ſhe orders to create animals, more land, and every kind of food found upon the earth. She alſo ordered him to create a
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030274_0552_0FE5704A18F44670"/>
ſky, which is ſupported by men, called Teeſerel. The ſpots obſervable in the moon, they ſay, are groves of a certain tree, which once grew in Otaheite and being accidentally deſtroyed, ſome doves carried its ſeeds thither, where they flouriſh at this day.</p>
                     <p>They have many religious and hiſtorical le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends; one of which, relative to eating human fleſh, is in ſubſtance as follows: A very long time ago there lived, at Otaheite, two men who were called <hi>Taheeai;</hi> a name which is now given to cannibals. They inhabited the mountains, whence they iſſued forth and murdered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whom they afterwards devoured, and thus prevented the progreſs of population. Two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, anxious to rid the country of ſuch enemies, ſucceſsfully put in practice a ſtratagem for their deſtruction. They lived farther upward than the <hi>Taheeai,</hi> and were ſo ſituated, that they could converſe with them without hazarding their own ſafety. They invited them to partake of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, to which they readily conſented. The brothers then heated ſome ſtones in a fire, and thruſting them into pieces of <hi>mahee,</hi> requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the <hi>Taheeai</hi> to open his mouth; when one of thoſe pieces was immediately dropped in, and ſome water poured after it, which, in quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtone, made a hiſſing noſe and killed him. The other was intreated to do the ſame; but at firſt declined it, mentioning the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030274_0553_0FE5704C5EDE67A0"/>
of his companion's eating: but upon being aſſured that the food was excellent, that theſe effects were only temporal, and that his companion would ſoon recover, he was ſo credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as to ſwallow the bait, and was alſo killed.</p>
                     <p>Their bodies were then cut to pieces, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the natives, who rewarded the brothers with the government of the iſland, for delivering them from ſuch monſters. They reſided at Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paeenoo, a diſtrict in the iſland, where there now remains a bread-fruit tree, which was once the property of the <hi>Taheeais.</hi> They had a woman who lived with them, that had two enormous teeth. After they were killed, ſhe lived at Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha; and, when ſhe died, ſhe was ranked among their deities. She did not, like the men, feed upon human fleſh; but, from the prodigious ſize of her teeth, the natives ſtill call any animal that has large tuſks <hi>Taheeai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſtory, it muſt be acknowledged, is as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural as that of Hercules deſtroying the hydra, or of Jack the Giant-killer. But it does not appear that there is any moral couched under it, any more than under moſt of the old fables, which have been received as truths in ignorant ages. It, however, was not injudiciouſly introduced, as ſerving to expreſs the deteſtation entertained here againſt cannibals. And yet it appears pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable from ſome circumſtances, that the natives of theſe iſles formerly fed upon human fleſh.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030274_0554_0FE5704DE690CD80"/>
Upon aſking Omai a few queſtions upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he reſolutely denied it; though, at the ſame time, he related a fact within his own knowledge, which almoſt eſtabliſhes ſuch a conjecture.</p>
                     <p>When the Bolabola men defeated thoſe of Huaheine, many of his kinſmen were ſlain; but a relation of his had an opportunity of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, when the people of Bolabola were worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their turn; and, cutting a piece of fleſh from the thigh of one of his enemies, he broiled and devoured it. The offering made to the chief, of the eye of the perſon ſacrificed, appears to be a veſtige of a cuſtom that once exiſted to a greater extent.</p>
                     <p>The principal characteriſtics of the ſovereign are, the being inveſted with the <hi>maro,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding at human ſacrifices, and the blowing of the conch-ſhell. On hearing the latter, every ſubject is obliged to bring food, in proportion to his circumſtances, to his royal reſidence. Their veneration for his name, on ſome occaſions, they carry to a moſt extravagant height. When he accedes to the <hi>maro,</hi> if any words in the language are found to have a reſemblance to it in ſound, they are immediately changed for others; and, if any man ſhould be preſumptuous enough to continue the uſe of thoſe words, not only he, but his whole family are put to death.</p>
                     <p>A ſimilar ſate attends all thoſe who ſhall dare to apply the ſacred name of the ſovereign to any
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030274_0555_0FE570596EE58610"/>
animal. Whence Omai, when in England, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his indignation, that the names of prince or princeſs ſhould be given to our dogs or horſes. But though death is the puniſhment for taking this liberty with the name of the ſovereign, abuſe againſt his government is only puniſhed with the forfeiture of land and houſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſovereign never deigns to enter the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any of his ſubjects; in every diſtrict, where he viſits he has houſes belonging to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And if, by accident, he ſhould ever be obliged to deviate from this rule, the habitation thus honoured with his preſence, together with its furniture, is entirely burnt. When preſent his ſubjects uncover to him as low as the waiſt; and when he is at any particular place, a pole with a piece of cloth affixed to it, is ſet up in ſome conſpicuous part near, on which the ſame honours are beſtowed. To the firſt part of this ceremony his brothers are entitled; but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men only uncover to the royal females.</p>
                     <p>They are even ſuperſtitious in reſpect to their ſovereign, and eſteem his perſon as almoſt ſacred.</p>
                     <p>To theſe circumſtances, perhaps, he is indebted for the quiet poſſeſſion of his dominions. Even the people of Tiaraboo admit his claim to the ſame honours, though they eſteem their own chief as more powerful, and aſſert that, ſhould the reigning family become extinct, he would ſucceed to the government of the whole iſland.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="unknown:030274_0556_0FE5705B8B050798"/>This indeed is probable, as Waheiadooa, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of Tiaraboo, poſſeſſes many diſtricts of Opooreanoo. The extent of his territories is, therefore, almoſt equal to thoſe of Otoo; and his part of the iſland is more populous and fertile. His ſubjects, too, have ſhewn their ſuperiority, by frequently defeating thoſe of Otaheite-nooe, whom they hold in a contemptible light as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; and over whom they might be eaſily vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, if their chief ſhould be inclined to put it to the teſt.</p>
                     <p>The people, excluſive of the <hi>Eree de hoi,</hi> and his family, are claſſed in the following order. The <hi>Erees,</hi> or powerful chiefs; the <hi>Manahoone,</hi> or vaſſals; and the <hi>Teou,</hi> or <hi>Toutou,</hi> ſervants or ſlaves. The men, agreeably to the regular inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, connect themſelves with women of their reſpective ranks; but if with one of an inferior claſs and ſhe brings forth a child, it is not only preſerved, but is entitled to the rank of the father; unleſs he ſhould happen to be an <hi>Eree,</hi> in which caſe the child is killed.</p>
                     <p>If a woman of condition permits a man of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior rank to officiate as a huſband, the children they produce are alſo killed. And if a <hi>Teou</hi> be detected in an intrigue with a female of the royal family he is puniſhed with death. The ſon of the <hi>Eree de hoi,</hi> at his birth, ſucceeds his father in titles and honours; but, if he has no children the government devolves to his brother at his
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030274_0557_0FE56FEE1FC8E2F8"/>
death. Poſſeſſions, in other families, deſcend to the eldeſt ſon, who is, nevertheleſs, obliged to ſupport his brothers and ſiſters, and allow them houſes on his eſtates.</p>
                     <p>Otaheite is divided into ſeveral diſtricts, the boundaries of whch are generally rivulets or low hills; but the ſubdiviſions, by which particular property is aſcertained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are pointed out by large ſtones which have continued from generation to generation. Quarrels are ſometimes produced, by the removal of theſe ſtones, which are decided by battle; each party claiming the aſſiſtance of his friends. But, upon a complaint being proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to the <hi>Eree de hoi,</hi> he determines the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in an amicable manner.</p>
                     <p>Theſe offences, however, are not common; and property ſeems to be as ſecure here, from long cuſtom, as from the ſevereſt laws in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. It is an eſtabliſhed practice among them, that crimes which are not of a general nature, are left to be puniſhed by the party who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, ſuppoſing that he will decide as equitably as a perſon totally unconcerned: and, long cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom having alloted certain puniſhments for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain crimes, he may inflict them, without being amenable to any one. If, for inſtance, any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be detected ſtealing, which is uſually done in the night, the owner of the goods ſtolen may kill the thief immediately. But they ſeldom inflict ſo ſevere a puniſhment, unleſs the property taken is
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030274_0558_0FE5705D12B8D8C0"/>
very valuable; ſuch as plaited hair and breaſt-plates. When only cloth, or hogs, are ſtolen, and the robber eſcapes, if, upon his being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcovered, he engages to return the ſame number of hogs, and pieces of cloth, he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of the offence; or, at moſt, receives a ſlight beating</p>
                     <p>If, in a quarrel, one perſon ſhould kill another, the friend of the deceaſed attack the ſurvivor and his adherents. If they are victorious, they take poſſeſſion of the houſe and property of the other party; but, if they are vanquiſhed, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe takes place. Should a <hi>Manahoone</hi> kill the ſlave of a chief, the latter ſeizes the property of the former, who flies the country. A few months after, he returns, and, finding his ſtock of hogs increaſed, makes a large preſent of theſe, and other valuable articles, to the <hi>Toutou's</hi> maſter, who generally conſiders it as a compenſation, and ſuffers him to repoſſeſs his premiſes. But, it is not ſurpriſing that the killing of a man ſhould be conſidered as ſo trifling an offence, among a people who do not think it a crime to murder their own children. On converſing with them concerning ſuch inſtances of unnatural cruelty, and aſking them if their chiefs were not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and did not puniſh them; they ſaid the chief had no right to interfere in ſuch caſes, every one being at liberty to do what he pleaſed with his own child.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="unknown:030274_0559_0FE56FF76EB4E8C0"/>Though the people, their cuſtoms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the productions of the iſlands in the neighbourhood, may, in general, be conſidered the ſame as at Otaheite, yet there are a few differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. In the little iſland Mataia, or Oſnaburgh Iſland, which lies twenty leagues eaſt of Otaheite, is ſpoken a different dialect from that of Otaheite. The men of Mataia alſo wear long hair, and, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to their fighting, cover their arm with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſet with ſharks teeth, and their bodies with a ſkin of fiſhes, not unlike ſhagreen. They are likewiſe ornamented with poliſhed pearl ſhells, which make a refulgent glittering in the ſun; and they have a very large one before, which covers them like a ſhield.</p>
                     <p>In the language of Otaheite, there are many words and phraſes very different from thoſe of the iſlands to the weſtward of it. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for producing, in great abundance, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious fruit which we call apples, which are not to be found in any of the others, except Eimeo. It alſo produces an odoriferous wood, called <hi>eahoi,</hi> which is much eſteemed at the other iſles. Hua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heine and Eimeo produce more yams than the other iſlands; and, upon the hills at Mourooa, a particular bird is found, which is highly valued for its white feathers.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the number or cluſter of iſlands, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from Mataia to Mourooa, we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the people at Otaheite, that there was
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030274_0560_0FE5705EDE746AD0"/>
a low uninhabited iſland, called Mopeeha; and alſo ſeveral low iſlands, to the north eaſtward, at the diſtance of about two days ſail with a fair wind.</p>
                     <p>At Mataeeva, it is ſaid to be cuſtomary, for men to preſent their daughters to ſtrangers who viſit that iſland. The pairs, however, muſt lie near each other for the ſpace of five nights, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſuming to take any liberties. On the ſixth evening, the father entertains his gueſt with food, and orders the daughter to receive him, that night, as her huſband. Though the bed-fellow be ever ſo diſagreeable to the ſtranger, he muſt not dare to expreſs the leaſt diſlike; for that is an unpardonable affront, and puniſhable with death. Forty men of Bolalola, whom curioſity had incited to go to Mataeeva, were treated in this manner; one of them having declared his averſion to the female who fell to his lot, in the hearing of a boy, who mentioned it to the father. Fired with this information, the Mataeevans fell upon them; but the Bolabolans killed thrice their own number, though with the loſs of the whole party except five. Theſe, at firſt, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in the woods, and afterwards ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected their eſcape in a canoe.</p>
                     <p>The low iſles are, perhaps, the fartheſt navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation performed by the inhabitants of Otaheite, and the Society Iſlands. Monſieur de Bougain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville is certainly in an error, when he ſays, "Theſe
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030274_0561_0FE57062D48F4288"/>

                     <p>UPON our quitting Bolabola, and taking leave of the Society Iſlands, On Monday the 8th of December, we ſteered to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with the wind between north-eaſt and eaſt;
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030274_0562_0FE57001022BBD88"/>
ſcarce ever having it in the ſouth-eaſt point, till after he had croſſed the equator. Though a year and five months had now elapſed ſince our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from England, during which period we had not been, upon the whole, unprofitably employed, Captain Cook was ſenſible, that, with reſpect to the principal object of his inſtructions, our voyage might be conſidered, at this time, as only at its commencement; and therefore, his attention to whatever might contribute towards our ſafety and final ſucceſs, was now to be exerted as it were anew. He had with this view examined into the ſtate of our proviſions at the iſlands we had laſt viſited; and having now, on leaving them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded beyond the extent of the former diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, he ordered an accurate ſurvey to be taken of all the ſtores that were in each ſhip, that, by being fully informed of the quantity and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every article, he might know how to uſe them to the greateſt advantage.</p>
                     <p>Before we quitted the Society Iſles, we had taken every opportunity of enquiring of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whether there were any iſlands ſituated in a northerly or north-weſterly direction from them; but it did not appear that they knew of any; nor did we meet with any thing by which the vicinity of land was indicated, till we began, about the latitude of 8° ſouth, to ſee boobies, men-of-war bidrs, terns, tropic-birds, and a few other ſorts. Our longitude, at this time, was 205° eaſt. in
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030274_0563_0FE57066C1773E80"/>
the night between the 22d and 23d, we croſſed the equinoctial line; and on the 24th, ſoon after day-break, we diſcovered land bearing north-eaſt by eaſt. It was found, upon our making a nearer approach to it, to be one of thoſe low iſlands which are ſo frequently met with in this ocean between the tropics; that is, a narrow bank of land that encloſes the ſea within. We obſerved ſome cocoa-nut trees in two or three places; but the land in general had a very ſterial aſpect. At twelve o'clock it was about four miles diſtant. On the weſtern ſide we found the depth of water to be from forty to fourteen fathoms, over a ſandy bottom.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook being of opinion that this iſland would prove a convenient place for procuring turtle, reſolved to anchor here. We accordingly dropped our anchors in thirty fathoms water; and a boat was immediately diſpatched to ſearch for a commodious landing-place. When ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the officer who had been employed in this ſearch, reported, that he found no place where a boat could land; but that fiſh greatly abounded in the ſhoal-water, without the breakers. Early the next morning, which was Chriſtmas-day, two boats were ſent, one from each ſhip, to examine more accurately whether it was practicable to land; and at the ſame time, two others were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out, to fiſh at a grappling near the ſhore. Theſe laſt returned about eight, with as many fiſh
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030274_0564_0FE56FF95D19E3E0"/>
as weighed upwards of two hundred pounds. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this ſucceſs, the Commodore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched them again after breakfaſt; and he then went himſelf in another boat, to view the coaſt, and attempt landing, which, however, he found to be impracticable. The two boats which had been ſent out on the ſame ſearch, returned about twelve o'clock; and the maſter, who was in that belonging to the Reſolution, reported to Captain Cook, that, about four or five miles to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, there being a break in the land, and a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel into the lagoon, there was conſequently a proper place for landing; and that he had found off this entrance the ſame foundings as we had where we now were ſtationed. In conſequence of this report we weighed, and, after two or three trips, anchored again over a bottom of fine dark ſand, before a little iſland lying at the entrance of the lagoon.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 26th in the morning, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore ordered Captain Clerke to ſend out a boat, with an officer in it, to the ſouth-eaſt part of the lagoon, in queſt of turtle; and went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Mr. King, each in a boat, to the north-eaſt part. It was his intention to have gone to the eaſtern extremity; but the wind not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, he and Mr. King landed more to leeward, on a ſandy flat, where they caught one turtle, which was the only one they ſaw in the lagoon. They waded through the water to an iſland, where
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030274_0565_0FE5706846A58DA8"/>
they found nothing but a few birds. Captain Cook, leaving Mr. King here to obſerve the ſun's meridian altitude, proceeded to the land that bounds the ſea towards the north-weſt, which he found even more barren than the laſt-mentioned iſle; but walking over to the ſea-coaſt, he obſerved five turtles cloſe to the ſhore, one of which he caught: he then returned on board, as did Mr. King ſoon afterwards. Though ſo few turtles were obſerved by theſe two gentlemen, we did not deſpair of a ſupply; for ſome of the officers of the Diſcovery, who had been aſhore to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the channel leading into the lagoon, had more ſucceſs, and caught ſeveral.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, the cutter and pinnace were diſpatched, under the command of Mr. King to the ſouth-eaſt part of the iſland, within the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon, to catch turtle; and the ſmall cutter was ſent towards the north to the ſame purpoſe. Some of Captain Clerke's people having been on ſhore all night, had been ſo fortunate as to turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of forty turtles on the ſand, which were this day brought on board; and, in the courſe of the afternoon, the party detached to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward returned with half a dozen; and being ſent back again, continued there till we departed from the iſland, having, upon the whole, pretty good ſucceſs. The day following (the 28th) Captain Cook, accompanied by Mr. Bayly, landed on the iſland ſituated between the two channels into
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030274_0566_0FE57069CFC6E8F0"/>
the lagoon, to prepare the teleſcopes for obſerving the ſolar eclipſe that was to happen on the 30th. Towards noon, Mr. King returned with one boat, and eight turtles; ſeven being left behind to be brought by the other boat, whoſe people were occupied in catching more; and, in the evening, the ſame boat conveyed them proviſions and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er. Mr. Williamſon now went to ſuperintend this buſineſs in the room of Mr. King, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained on board, in order to attend the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the eclipſe. The next day, the two boates, laden with turtle, were ſent back to the ſhip by Mr. Williamſon, who, at the ſame time, in a meſſage to Captain Cook, requeſted, the the boats might be ordered round by ſea, as he had diſcovered a landing-place on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of the iſland, where the greateſt numbers of turtle were caught; ſo that, by diſpatching the boats thither, the trouble of carrying them over the land (as had hitherto been done) to the inſide of the lagoon, would be ſaved. This advice was followed.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 30th, Captain Cook, and Meſſrs. King and Bayly repaired in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſmall iſland above mentioned, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the eclipſe of the ſun. The ſky was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt at times; but it was clear wen the eclipſe ended. In the afternoon, the party who had been employed in catching turtle at the ſouth-eaſtern part of the iſland, returned on board, except a
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030274_0567_0FE56FF3D4DDD3D0"/>
ſailor belonging to Captain Clerke's ſhip, who had been miſſing for two days. At firſt, there were two men who had loſt their way; but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to diſagree with reſpect to the track that was moſt likely to bring them to their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, they had ſeparated; and one of them found means to rejoin the party, after an abſence of twenty-four hours, during which he had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced great diſtreſs. There being no freſh water in the whole iſland, and not one cocoa-nut tree in that part of it, he, in order to allay his thirſt, had recourſe to the extraordinary expedient of drinking the blood of turtle, which he killed for that purpoſe. His method of refreſhing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when fatigued, was equally ſingular, though he ſaid he felt the good effects of it: he undreſſed himſelf, and lay down in the ſhallow water on the beach for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>How theſe two men had contrived to loſe their way, was a matter of aſtoniſhment. The land over which their journey lay, from the ſea-coaſt to the lagoon, where the boats were ſtationed, did not exceed three miles acroſs; nor was there any thing that could impede their view; for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was level, with a few ſhrubs diſperſed about it; and, from many parts, the maſts of our veſſels could be eaſily diſcerned. This, however, was a rule of direction which they did not think of; nor did they recollect in what part of the iſland the ſhips lay at anchor; and they were totally at a
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030274_0568_0FE570711F5C1768"/>
loſs how to get back to them, or to the party they had ſo careleſſly ſtraggled from. Conſidering what ſtrange people the generality of ſailors are, while on ſhore, we might, inſtead of being much ſurprized that theſe two ſhould thus loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rather wonder that no more of the party were miſſing.</p>
                     <p>Captain Clerke was no ſooner informed that one of the ſtragglers was ſtill in this diſagreeable ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, than he detached a party in ſearch of him; but neither the man nor the party having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the next morning the Commodore ordered two boats into the lagoon, to proſecute the ſearch by different tracks. In a ſhort time after, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke's detachment returned, with there loſt companion; in conſequence of which the boats diſpatched into the lagoon were called back by ſignal. This man's diſtreſs muſt have been far greater than that of the other ſtraggler; not only as he had been loſt a longer time, but as he was too delicate to drink turtle's blood.</p>
                     <p>Having ſome yams and cocoa-nuts on board, in a ſtate of vegetation, we planted them, by Captain Cook's order, on the ſmall iſland where he had obſerved the late eclipſe; and ſome ſeeds of melons were ſown in another place. The Captain alſo left on that little iſle a bottle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the followng inſcription:

It being late before this buſineſs was completed, he thought proper to defer ſailing till the next morning. We procured at this iſland, for both ſhips, about three hundred turtles, which weighed, one with another, about ninety pounds; they were all of the green ſort, and, perhaps, not inferior in goodneſs to any in the world. We alſo caught, with hook and line, a great quantity of fiſh, principally conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of cavallies, ſnappers, and a few rock-fiſh of two ſpecies, one with whitiſh ſtreaks ſcattered about, and the other with numerous blue ſpots.</p>
                     <p>The ſoil of this iſland (to which Captain Cook gave the name of Chriſtmas Iſland, as we kept that feſtival here) is, in ſome places, light and blackiſh, conpoſed of ſand, the dung of birds, and rotten vegetables. In other parts, it is formed of broken coral-ſtones, decayed ſhells, and other marine productions. Theſe are depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in long, narrow ridges, lying parallel with the ſea-coaſt; and muſt have been thrown up by the waves, though they do not reach, at preſent, within a mile of ſome of theſe places. This ſeems to prove inconteſtably, that the iſland has been produced by different acceſſions from the ſea, and is in a ſtate of augmentation; the broken pieces of coral, and likewiſe many of the ſhells
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030274_0570_0FE57074C83AD3A8"/>
being too large and heavy to have been brought from the beach by any birds to the places where they are now lying. We could not find any where a drop of freſh water, though we frequently dug for it. We met with ſeveral ponds of ſalt water, which, as they had no viſible communication with the ſea, were probably filled by water filtrating through the ſand during the time of high tides. One of the men who loſt their way found ſome ſalt on the ſouth-eaſtern part of the iſland. We could not diſcover the ſmalleſt traces of any human creature having ever been here before us; and, indeed, ſhould any one be accidentally driven on the iſland, or left there, he would hardly be able to prolong his exiſtence. For, though there are birds and fiſh in abundance, there are no viſible means of allaying thirſt, nor any vegetable that would ſerve as a ſubſtitute for bread, or correct the bad effects of an animal diet. On the few cocoa-nut trees upon the iſland, we found very little fruit, and that little not good.</p>
                     <p>A few low trees were obſerved in ſome parts, beſides ſeveral ſmall ſhrubs and plants, which grew in a very languid manner. We found a ſort of purſlain, a ſpecies of <hi>ſida</hi> or Indian mallow, and another plant that ſeemed, from its leaves, to be a <hi>

                           </gap>eſembryanthemum;</hi> with two ſorts of graſs. Under the low trees ſat vaſt numbers of a new ſpecies of tern, or egg-bird, black above, and white below, having a white arch on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030274_0571_0FE57076919CBE48"/>
Theſe birds are ſomewhat larger than the common noddy: their eggs are bluiſh, and ſpeckled with black. There were likewiſe many common boobies; a ſort greatly reſembling a gannet; and a chocolate-coloured ſpecies, with a white belly. Men-of-war-birds, curlews, plovers, tropic-birds, petrels, &amp;c. are alſo to be ſeen here. We ſaw ſeveral rats, ſmaller than our's. There were numbers of land-crabs, and ſmall lizards.</p>
                     <p>Chriſtmas Iſland is ſuppoſed by Captain Cook to be between fifteen and twenty leagues in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit. Its form is ſemi-circular; or like the moon in her laſt quarter, the two horns being the north and ſouth points. The weſt ſide, or the ſmall iſland ſituate at the entrance into the lagoon, lies in the longitude of 202° 30′ eaſt, and in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 1° 59′ north.</p>
                     <p>Like moſt of the other iſles in this ocean, Chriſtmas Iſland is ſurrounded by a reef of coral rock extending but a little way from the weſtern ſide, is a bank of ſand, which extends a mile into the ſea. There is good anchorage on this bank, in any depth between eighteen and thirty fathoms. During our continuance here, the wind generally blew a freſh gale at eaſt by ſouth, or eaſt; and we had conſtantly a great ſwell from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which broke on the reef in a very violent ſurf.</p>

&amp;c. and between the latitude 10° and 11° north, we ſaw ſeveral turtles. Though all theſe are conſidered as ſigns of the proximity of land, we diſcovered none till early in the morning of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 18th, when an iſland appeared, bearing north-eaſt-by-eaſt. Not long after, more land was ſeen, which bore north, and was totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the former. At noon, the firſt was ſuppoſed to be eight or nine leagues diſtant. Our longitude, at this time, was 200° 41′ eaſt, and our latitude, 21° 12′ north. The next day, at ſun-riſe, the iſland firſt ſeen bore eaſt, at the diſtance of ſeveral leagues. Not being able to reach this, we ſhaped our courſe for the other; and ſoon after, obſerved a third iſland, bearing weſt-north-weſt.</p>
                     <p>We had now a fine breze at eaſt-by-north; and, at noon, the ſecond iſland, named Atooi, for the eaſt end of which we were ſteering, was about two leagues diſtant. As we made a nearer approach, many of the inhabitants put off from the ſhore in their canoes, and very readily came along-ſide the ſhips. We were agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find, that they ſpoke a dialect of the Otaheitean language. They could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon by any entreaties to come on board. Captain Cook tied ſome braſs medals to a rope, which he gave to thoſe who were on board the canoes; and they, in return, faſtened ſome mackarel to the rope, by way of equivalent. This
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030274_0574_0FE57080C928DD28"/>
was repeated; and ſome ſmall nails, or pieces of iron, were given them; for which they gave in exchange ſome more fiſh, and a ſweet potatoe; a ſure indication of their having ſome notion of bartering, or, at leaſt, of returning one preſent for another. One of them even offered for ſale the piece of ſtuff which he wore about his waiſt. Theſe people did not exceed the ordinary ſize, and were ſtoutly made. Their complexion was brown; and though there appeared to be little difference in the caſts of their colour, there was a conſiderable variation in their features. Moſt of them had their hair cropped rather ſhort; a few had it tied in a bunch at the top of the head; and others ſuffered it to flow looſe. It ſeemed to be naturally black; but the generality of them had ſtained it with ſome ſtuff which communicated to it a browniſh colour. Moſt of them had pretty long beards. They had no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments about their perſons, nor did we obſerve that they had their cars perforated. Some of them were <hi>tatooed</hi> on the hands, or near the groin; and the pieces of cloth, which were worn by them round their middle, were curiouſly coloured with white, black, and red. They ſeemed to be mild and good-natured; and were furniſhed with no arms of any kind, except ſome ſmall ſtones, which they had manifeſtly brought for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and theſe they threw into the ſea when they found that there was no occaſion for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:030274_0575_0FE570824F5ED080"/>As we perceived no ſigns of an anchoring-place at this eaſtern extremity of the iſland, we bore away to leeward, and ranged along the ſouth-eaſt ſide, at the diſtance of about a mile and a half from the ſhore. The canoes left us when we made ſail; but others came off, as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded along the coaſt, and brought with them pigs and ſome excellent potatoes, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for whatever we offered to them; and ſeveral ſmall pigs were purchaſed by us for a ſix-penny nail. We paſſed divers villages; ſome of which were ſituated near the ſea, and others fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the country. The inhabitants of all of them came in crowds to the ſhore, and aſſembled on the elevated places to take a view of the ſhips. On this ſide of the iſland the land riſes in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acclivity from the ſea to the bottom of the mountains, which occupy the central part of the country, except at one place near the eaſtern end, there they riſe immediately from the ſea: they ſeemed to be compoſed of ſtone, or rocks lying in horizontal <hi>ſtrata.</hi> We obſerved a few trees about the villages; near which we could alſo diſcern ſeveral plantations of ſugar-canes and plantains. We continued to ſound, but did not ſtrike ground with a line of fifty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, till we came abreaſt of a low point, near the north-weſt extremity of the iſland, where we found from twelve to fourteen fathoms, over a rocky bottom. Having paſſed this point, we

met with twenty fathoms, then ſixteen, twelve, and at laſt five, over a bottom of ſand. We ſpent the night in ſtanding off and on; and, the next morning, ſtood in for the land. We were met by ſeveral canoes filled with natives, ſome of whom ventured to come on board.</p>
                     <p>None of the inhabitants we ever met with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any other iſland or country, were ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as theſe people were, upon entering a ſhip. Their eyes were inceſſantly roving from one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another; and the wildneſs of their looks and geſtures, fully indicated their perfect igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with reſpect to every thing they ſaw; and ſtrongly marked to us, that they had never, till the preſent time, been viſited by Europeans, nor been acquainted with any of our commodities, except iron. This metal, however, they had in all probability only heard of, or had perhaps known it in ſome inconſiderable quantity, brought to them at a remote period. They aſked for it by the appellation of <hi>hamaite,</hi> referring probably to ſome inſtrument, in making which iron could be ſerviceably employed; for they applied that name to the blade of a knife, though they had no idea of that particular inſtrument, which they could not even handle properly. They alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called iron by the name of <hi>toe,</hi> which ſignifies a hatchet, or adze. On our ſhewing them ſome beads, they firſt aſked what they were; and then, whether they were to be eaten. But, on
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030274_0577_0FE570898D9E2520"/>
their being informed, that they were to be hung in their ears, they rejected them as uſeleſs. They were equally indifferent with regard to a looking-glaſs that we offered them, and returned it for a ſimilar reaſon. China cups, plates of earthen ware, and other things of that kind, were ſo new to them, that they aſked whether they were made of wood. They were, in many reſpects, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally polite; or, at leaſt, cautious of giving offence. Some of them, juſt before their ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board, repeated a long prayer; and others, afterwards, ſung and made various motions with their hands. On their firſt entering the ſhips, they attempted to ſteal every thing that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> lay hands on, or rather to take it openly, as if they ſuppoſed that we either ſhould not reſent ſuch behaviour, or not hinder it. But we ſoon convinced them of their error; and when they obſerved that we kept a watchful eye over them, they became leſs active in appropriating to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what did not belong to them.</p>
                     <p>About nine o'clock Captain Cook diſpatched Lieutenant Williamſon, with three armed boats, to look out for a proper landing-place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for freſh water; with orders, that, if he ſhould find it neceſſary to land in ſearch of the letter, he ſhould not allow more than one man to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him out of the boats. The very moment they were putting off from the ſhip one of the iſlanders having ſtolen a cleaver, leaped over
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030274_0578_0FE5708B14D8AF68"/>
board, got into his canoe, and haſtened towards the ſhore, while the boats purſued him in vain.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of the Commodore's order that the crews of the boats ſhould not go on ſhore, was that he might prevent, if poſſible, the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dangerous diſeaſe into this iſland, which he knew ſome of our people now laboured under, and which we, unfortunately, had already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to other iſlands in this ocean. From the ſame motive, he commanded that all female viſitants ſhould be excluded from both the ſhips. Many perſons of this ſex had come off in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes. Their features. complexion, and ſtature, were not very different from thoſe of the men; and though their countenances were extremely open and agreeable, few traces of delicacy were viſible either in their faces, or other proportions. The only difference in their dreſs, was their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a piece of cloth about their bodies, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from near the middle almoſt down to the knees, inſtead of the <hi>maro</hi> worn by the male-ſex. They were as much inclined to favour us with their company on board, as ſome of the men were; but the Commodore was extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of preventing all connection, which might in all probability, convey an irreparable injury to themſelves, and afterwards, through their means, to the whole nation. Another pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent precaution was taken, by ſtrictly enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that no perſon capable of communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030274_0579_0FE5708D02F09040"/>
the infection ſhould be ſent upon duty out of the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook had paid equal attention to the ſame object, when he firſt viſited the Friendly Iſles; but he afterwards found, to his great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, that his endeavours had not ſucceeded. And there is reaſon to apprehend, that this will conſtantly be the caſe, in ſuch voyages as ours, whenever it is neceſſary that many people ſhould be employed on ſhore. The opportunities and incitements to an amorous intercourſe are then too numerous to be effectually guarded againſt; and however confident a commander may be of the health of his men, he is often undeceived too late, Among a number of men, there are in general to be found ſome, who, out of baſhfulneſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to conceal their having any venereal ſymptoms: and there are others ſo proſligate and abandoned, as not to care to whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this diſeaſe. We had an inſtance of the laſt remark at Tongataboo, in the gunner of the Diſcovery, who had been ſtationed on ſhore. After knowing that he had contracted this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, he continued to have connections with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent women, who were ſuppoſed to have been, till that time, free from any infection. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions remonſtrated to him on this ſcandalous behaviour without effect, till Captain Clerke, being informed of ſuch a dangerous irregularity of conduct, ordered him to repair on board.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="unknown:030274_0580_0FE57092F993E9F8"/>Waiting for the return of our boats, which had been ſent out to reconnoitre the coaſt, we ſtood off and on with the ſhips. Towards mid-day, Mr Williamſon came back, and reported, that he had obſerved behind a beach, near one of the villages, a large pond, which was ſaid by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to contain freſh water; and that there was tolerable anchoring-ground before it. He alſo mentioned, that he had made an attempt to land in another place, but was prevented by the iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who, coming down in great numbers to the boats, endeavoured to take away the oars, muſquets, and every other article which they could lay hold of; and crowded ſo thick upon him and his people, that he was under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of firing, by which one man was killed. This unfortunate circumſtance, however, was not known to Captain Cook till after we had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the iſland; ſo that all his meaſures were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected as if no affair of that kind had happened, Mr. Williamſon informed him, that, as ſoon as the man fell, he was taken up and carried off by his countrymen, who then retired from the boats, but ſtill they made ſignals for our people to land, which they declined. It did not appear, that the natives had the leaſt intention of killing, or even hurting, any of Mr. Willimſon's party; but they ſeemed to have been excited by curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity alone, to get from them what they had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030274_0581_0FE57094837325F0"/>
prepared to give, in return, any thing that appertained to themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook then diſpatched one of the boats to lie in the beſt anchoring-ground; and when ſhe had gained this nation, he bore down with the ſhips, and caſt anchor in twenty-five fathoms water, over a ſandy bottom. The eaſtern point of the road, which was the low point already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, bore ſouth 51° eaſt; the weſt point, north 65° weſt; and the village near which the freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſaid to be, was one mile diſtant. The ſhips being thus ſtationed, between three and four in the afternoon, the Captain went aſhore with three armed boats, and twelve of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, with a view of examining the water, and trying the diſpoſition of the inhabitants who had aſſembled in conſiderable numbers on a ſandy beach before the village; behind it was a valley, in which was the piece of water. The moment he leaped on ſhore, all the iſlanders fell proſtrate upon their faces, and continued in that poſture of humiliation, till, by ſigns, he prevailed on them to riſe. They then preſented to him many ſmall pigs, with plantain-trees, making uſe of nearly the ſame ceremonies which we had ſeen practiſed, on ſimilar occaſions, at the Society and other iſles: and a long oration or prayer being pronounced by an individual, in which others of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly occaſionally joined. Captain Cook ſignified his acceptance of their proffered friendſhip, by
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030274_0582_0FE57096095E6060"/>
beſtowing on them, in return ſuch preſents a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he had brought aſhore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This introductory buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being ended, he ſtationed a guard upon the beach, and was then conducted by ſome of the natives to the water, which he found extremely good, and ſo conſiderable, that it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated a lake. After this, he returned on board, and iſſued orders that preparations ſhould be made for filling our water-caſks in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; at which time he went aſhore with ſome of his people, having a party of marines for the guard.</p>
                     <p>They had no ſooner landed, than a trade was entered into for potatoes and hogs, which the iſlanders gave in exchange for nails and pieces of iron. But from giving any obſtruction to our men who were occupied in watering, they even aſſiſted them in rolling the caſks to and from the pool, and performed with alacrity whatever was required of them. Captain Cook leaving the command at this ſtation to Mr. Williamſon, who had landed with him, made an excuſiron into the country, up in the valley, being accompanied by Meſſrs. Anderſon and Webber, and followed by a numerous train of natives, one of whom, who had been very active in keeping the others in order, the Captain made choice of as a guide. This, man, from time to time, proclaiming the approach of our gentlemen, every perſon who met them, full proſtrate on the ground, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in that humble poſition till they had
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030274_0583_0FE57097E3593D78"/>
paſſed. This, as we were afterwards informed, is their method of ſhewing reſpect to their own great chiefs.</p>
                     <p>We had obſerved at every village, as we ranged along the coaſt in the ſhips, one or more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated white objects, reſembling pyramids, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obeliſks; one of which, ſuppoſed by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook to be at leaſt fifty feet in height, was very conſpicuous from our anchoring-ſtation, and ſeemed to be at a ſmall diſtance up this valley. To have a nearer view of it, was the principal motive of our gentlemen's walk. Their guide was accquainted with their deſire of being conducted to it: but it happened to be in ſuch a ſituation, that they could not get at it, the pool of water ſeparating it from them. However, as there was another of the ſame kind about half a mile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, upon their ſide of the valley, they ſet out to viſit that. As ſoon as they reached it, they perceived that it was ſituate in a burying-ground, or <hi>morai,</hi> which bore a ſtriking reſemblance, in ſeveral reſpects, to thoſe they had ſeen at Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite and other iſlands in this ocean. It was an oblong ſpace, of conſiderable extent, environed by a ſtone-wall, four or five feet high. The incloſed ſpace was looſely paved; and, at one end of it, was placed the obeliſk or pyramid, called by the natives <hi>henananoo,</hi> which was an exact model of the larger one that we had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from our ſhips. It was about twenty feet
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030274_0584_0FE5709C6E1F4428"/>
in height, and four feet ſquare at the baſe. Its four ſides were formed of ſmall poles interwoven with twigs and branches, thus compoſing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different wicker-work, hollow within from the top to the bottom. It appeared to be in a ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate, and had been originally covered with a thin greyiſh cloth. On each ſide of it were long pieces of wicker-work, termed <hi>herecane,</hi> in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition equally ruinous, with two poles inclining towards each other at one corner, where ſome plantains were placed on a board, fixed at the height of about half a dozen feet. This was called by the iſlanders <hi>herairemy</hi>; and they ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the fruit was an offering to their deity. Before the <hi>henananoo</hi> were ſeveral pieces of wood, carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſome reſemblance of human figures. There was alſo a ſtone near two feet in height covered with cloth. Adjoining to this, on the outſide of the <hi>morai,</hi> was a ſmall ſhed, which they denominated <hi>hareepahoo</hi>; and before it there was a grave, where the remains of a woman had been depoſited.</p>
                     <p>There was a houſe or ſhed, called <hi>hemanaa,</hi> on the further ſide of the area of the <hi>morai:</hi> it was about forty feet in length, ten or eleven feet in height, and ten in breadth in the middle, but narrower at each end; though conſiderably longer, it was lower than their common habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Oppoſite the entrance into this houſe, ſtood two images near three feet high, cut out of
<pb facs="unknown:030274_0585_0FE56FEC39C1CC10"/>
                        <figure>
                           <head>A MORAL in ATOOI.</head>
                        </figure>
                        <pb n="141" facs="unknown:030274_0586_0FE5709DF91119B0"/>
one piece of wood, with pedeſtals: they were ſaid to be <hi>Eatooa no Veheina,</hi> or repreſentations of goddeſſes, and were not very indifferent either in point of execution or deſign. On the head of one of them was a cylindrical cap, not unlike the head-dreſs at Otaheite, called <hi>tomou;</hi> and on that of the other, a carved helmet, ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoſe of the ancient warriors; and both of them had pieces of cloth faſtened about the loins, and hanging down a conſiderable way. There was alſo, at the ſide of, each, a piece of carved wood, with cloth hung on it. Before the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtals lay a quantity of fern, which had been placed there at different times. In the middle of the houſe, and before the images juſt deſcribed, was an oblong ſpace, incloſed by an edging of ſtone, and covered with ſhreds of cloth; this was the grave of ſeven chiefs, and was called <hi>heneene.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our gentlemen had already met with ſo many inſtances of reſemblance, between the <hi>morai</hi> they were now viſiting, and thoſe of the iſlands they had lately quitted, that they entertained little doubt in their minds, that the ſimilarity exiſted alſo, in the rites here ſolemnized, and particularly in the horrid oblation of human victims. Their ſuſpicions were ſoon confirmed; for, on one ſide of the entrance into the <hi>hemannaa,</hi> they obſerved a ſmall ſquare place, and another ſtill ſmaller and on aſking what theſe were, they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their conductor, that in one of them was
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030274_0587_0FE5709FB784F788"/>
interred a man who had been ſacrificed; and in the other, a hog, which had alſo been offered up to the deity. At no great diſtance from theſe, were three other ſquare incloſed places, with two pieces of carved wood at each of them, and a heap of fern upon them. Theſe were the graves of three chiefs; and before them was an incloſed ſpace of an oblong figure, called <hi>Tangata-taboo</hi> by our gentlemen's guide, who declared to them, that three human ſacrifices, one at the funeral of each chief, had been there buried.</p>
                     <p>Every appearance induced the Commodore to believe, that this inhuman practice was very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral here. The iſland ſeemed to abound with ſuch places of ſacrifice as this, at which he was now preſent, and which was probably one of the moſt inconſiderable of them; being much leſs conſpicuous than ſome others which we had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as we ſailed along the coaſt, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly than that on the oppoſite ſide of the piece of water running through this valley; the white py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid of which, in all probability, derived its colour ſolely from the conſecrated cloth put over it. In many ſpots within this burying-ground, were planted trees of the <hi>morinda citrifolia,</hi> and <hi>cordia ſebeſtina,</hi> beſides ſeveral plants of the <hi>etee,</hi> with the leaves of which the <hi>hemanaa</hi> was thatched.</p>
                     <p>The journey of our gentlemen to and from this <hi>morai,</hi> lay through the plantations. Moſt of the ground was perfectly flat, with ditches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſecting
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030274_0588_0FE570A18F56CDB8"/>
different parts, and roads that ſeemed to have been raiſed to ſome height by art. The intervening ſpaces, in general, were planted with <hi>taro,</hi> which grew with great vigour. There were ſeveral ſpots where the cloth-mulberry was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in regular rows; this alſo grew vigorouſly. The cocoa-trees were in a leſs thriving condition, and were all low; but the plantain-trees, though not large, made a pretty good appearance. Upon the whole, the trees that are moſt numerous around this village, are the <hi>cordia ſebaſtina.</hi> The greateſt part of it is ſituate near the beach, and conſiſts of upwards of ſixty houſes there; but there may perhaps be near forty more ſcattered about, towards the <hi>morai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Commodore, and Meſſrs. Anderſon and Webber, had carefully examined whatever was worthy of notice about the <hi>morai,</hi> and the latter had taken drawings of it, and of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding country, they returned by a different route. They found a multitude of people col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected at the beach, and a briſk trade for fowls, pigs, and vegetables, going on there, with the greateſt order and decorum. At noon, Captain Cook went on board to dinner, and then ſent Mr. King to take the command of the party on ſhore. During the afternoon he landed again, accompanied by Captain Clerke, intending to make another excurſion up the country: but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could execute this deſign, the day was
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030274_0589_0FE570A7001721E0"/>
too far advanced; he therefore relinquiſhed his intention for the preſent, and no other opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity afterwards occurred. Towards ſun-ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, he and his people returned on board, after having procured, in the courſe of this day, nine tons of water, and (principally by exchanging nails and pieces of iron) ſeventy or eighty pigs, ſome fowls, plantains, potatoes, and <hi>taro</hi> roots. In this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourſe, the iſlanders deſerved our beſt commendations, making no attempts to cheat us, either along-ſide our ſhips, or on ſhore. Some of them, indeed, as we have already related, betrayed at firſt; a pilfering diſpoſition; or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they imagined that they had a right to all they could lay their hands upon: but they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiſted from a conduct, which, we convinced them, could not be perſevered in with impunity.</p>
                     <p>Among the various articles which they brought to barter this day, we were particularly ſtruck with a ſort of cloak and cap, which, even in more poliſhed countries, might be eſteemed elegant. Theſe cloaks are nearly of the ſhape and ſize of the ſhort ones worn by the men in Spain, and by the women in England, tied looſely before, and reaching to the middle of the back. The ground of them is a net-work, with the moſt beautiful red and yellow feathers ſo cloſely fixed upon it, that the ſurface, both in point of ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gloſſineſs, reſembles the richeſt velvet. The method of varying the mixture is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030274_0590_0FE570A88927EAF8"/>
ſome of them having triangular ſpaces of yellow and red alternately; others, a ſort of creſcent; while ſome, were entirely red, except that they had a broad yellow border. The bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant colours of the feathers, in thoſe cloaks that were new, had a very fine effect. The natives, at firſt, refuſed to part with one of theſe cloaks for any thing that we offered in exchange, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding no leſs a price than one of our muſquets. They afterwards, however, ſuffered us to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſome of them for very large nails. Thoſe of the beſt ſort were ſcarce; and it is probable, that they are uſed only on particular occaſions.</p>
                     <p>The caps are made in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> form of a helmet, with the middle part, or creſt, frequently of a hand's breadth. They ſit very cloſe upon the head, and have notches to admit the ears. They conſiſt of twigs and oſiers, covered with a net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, into which feathers are wrought, as upon the cloaks, but ſomewhat cloſer, and leſs diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified; the major part being red, with ſome yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, green, or black ſtripes, on the ſides. Theſe caps, in all probability, complete the dreſs, with the cloaks; for the iſlanders appeared, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in both together.</p>
                     <p>We could not conjecture from whence they obtained ſuch a quantity of theſe beautiful fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but we ſoon procured intelligence reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſort; for they afterwards brought for ſale great numbers of ſkins of a ſmall read ſpecies of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030274_0591_0FE570AA11481668"/>
birds, frequently tied up in bunches of twenty or upwards, or having a wooden ſkewer run through them. At firſt, thoſe that were purchaſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only of the ſkin from behind the wings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but we afterwards obtained many with the hind part, including the feet and tail. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inſtantly ſuggeſted to us the origin of the fable of the birds of paradiſe being deſtitute of legs; and ſufficiently explained that particular. The reaſon aſſigned by the inhabitants of Atooi for the cuſtom of cutting off the feet of theſe birds, is, that by this practice they can preſerve them the more eaſily, without loſing any part which they conſider as valuable.</p>
                     <p>The red-bird of this iſland was, according to Mr. Anderſon, a ſpecies of <hi>merops,</hi> about as large as a ſparrow, its colour was a beautiful ſcarlet, with the tale and wings black; and it had an arched bill, twice as long as the head, which with the feet, was of a reddiſh hue. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the heads were taken out, as in the birds of paradiſe, but we did not find, that they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed any other mode of preſerving them, than ſimple drying; for the ſkins, though they were moiſt, had neither a ſmell nor taſte that could give any reaſon for ſuſpecting the uſe of anti-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcent ſubſtances.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 22d, we had almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual rain for the whole morning. The wind was at ſouth-eaſt, ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, and ſouth; and
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030274_0592_0FE570AB9DE4F440"/>
the ſurf broke ſo high upon the ſhore, that our boats were prevented from landing. The Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was not in a very ſecure ſituation, there being breakers within the length of little more than two cables from her ſtern. The natives, notwithſtanding the ſurf, ventured out in their canoes, bringing off to our ſhips, hogs and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, which they exchanged, as before, for our commodities. One of their number, who offered ſome fiſh-hooks for ſale, was obſerved to have a very ſmall parcel, faſtened to the ſtring of one of them, which he carefully ſeparated, and reſerved for himſelf, when he diſpoſed of the hook. When aſked what it was, he pointed to his belly, and intimated ſomething of its being dead; ſaying, at the ſame time, that it was bad. He was requeſted to open the parcel, which he did with great reluctance; and we found, that it contained a ſmall thin piece of fleſh, which had, to all appearance, been dried, but was at preſent wet with ſalt water. Imagining that it might be human fleſh, we put the queſtion to the producer of it, who anſwered, that the fleſh was part of a man. Another of the iſlanders, who ſtood near him, was then aſked, whether it was a cuſtom among them to eat their enemies who had been ſlain in battle; and he immediately replied in the affirmative.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, we had ſome intervals of fair weather. The wind then changed to the eaſt
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030274_0593_0FE570B0CC1C8A48"/>
and north-eaſt; but, towards the evening, it veered back again to ſouth-ſouth-eaſt. The rain alſo returning continued the whole night, but was not accompanied with much wind. At ſeven the next morning, a north-eaſterly breeze ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, Captain Cook ordered the anchors of his ſhip to be taken up, with a view of removing her further out. As ſoon as the laſt anchor was up, the wind, veering to the eaſt, rendered it neceſſary to make all the ſail he could, for the purpoſe of clearing the ſhore; ſo that, before he had good ſea-room, he was driven conſiderably to leeward. He endeavoured to regain the road; but having a ſtrong current againſt him, and very little wind, he could not accompliſh that deſign. He therefore diſpatched Meſſrs. King and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſon aſhore, with three boats, to procure water and refreſhments, ſending, at the ſame time, an order to Captain Clerke, to put to ſea after him, if he ſhould find that the Reſolution was unable to recover the road.</p>
                     <p>The Commodore having hopes of finding a road, or perhaps a harbour, at the weſt end of the iſland, was the leſs anxious about regaining his former ſtation. But as he had ſent the boats thither, he kept as much as poſſible to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; notwithſtanding which, at noon, our ſhip was three leagues to leeward. As we approached the weſt end, we found that the coaſt rounded gradually to the north-eaſt, without forming a
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030274_0594_0FE570B27A73E5D0"/>
cove, or creek, wherein a veſſel might be ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the violence of the ſwell, which, roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in from the northward, broke againſt the ſhore in an amazing ſurf: all hopes, therefore, of meeting with a harbour here ſoon vaniſhed. Many of the natives, in their canoes, followed us as we ſtood out to ſea, bartering various arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. As we were extremely unwilling, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſuſpicious circumſtance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day, to believe that theſe people were cannibals, we now made ſome further enquiries on this ſubject. A ſmall inſtrument of wood, beſet with ſharks teeth, had been purchaſed; which as it reſembled the ſaw or knife made uſe of by the ſavages of New-Zealand to diſſect the bodies of their enemies, was ſuſpected by us to be employed here for the ſame purpoſe. One of the iſlanders being queſtioned on this point, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us that the inſtrument above-mentioned ſerved the purpoſe of cutting out the fleſhy part of the belly, when any perſon was ſlain. This explained and confirmed the circumſtance before related, of the man's pointing to his belly. The native, however, from whom we now received this intelligence, being aſked whether his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen eat the part thus cut out, ſtrongly denied it; but, when the queſtion was repeated, he ſhewed ſome degree of apprehenſion, and ſwam off to his canoe. An elderly man, who ſat fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the canoe, was then aſked whether they
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030274_0595_0FE570B4068A29F0"/>
eat the fleſh; and he anſwered in the affirmative. The queſtion being put to him a ſecond time, he again affirmed the fact; adding, that it was ſavoury food.</p>
                     <p>The boats returned about ſeven o'clock in the evening, with a few hogs, ſome plantains and roots, and two tuns of water. Mr. King report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Commodore, that the iſlanders were very numerous at the watering-place, and had brought great numbers of hogs to barter; but our people had not commodities with them ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the purchaſe of them all. He alſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that the ſurf had run ſo very high, that it was with extreme difficulty our men landed, and afterwards got back into the boats.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 24th, at day-break, we found that our ſhip had been carried by the currents to the north-weſt and north; ſo that the weſtern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Atooi bore eaſt, at the diſtance of one league. A northerly breeze ſprung up ſoon after, and Captain Cook expecting that this would bring the Diſcovery to ſea, ſteered for Oneeheow, a neighbouring iſland, which then bore ſouth-weſt, with a view of anchoring there. He continued to ſteer for it till paſt eleven, at which time he was at the diſtance of about ſix miles from it. But not ſeeing the Diſcovery, he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive leſt ſome ill conſequence might ariſe from our ſeparating ſo far; he therefore relinquiſhed the deſign of viſiting Oneeheow for the preſent,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030274_0596_0FE570B5E2D55BC0"/>
and ſtood back to Atooi, intending to caſt anchor again in the road, in order to complete our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of water. At two o'clock, the northerly wind was ſucceeded by calms and variable light airs, which continued till eleven at night. We ſtretched to the ſouth-eaſt, till early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 25th, when we tacked and ſtood in for Atooi road; and, not long after, we were joined by the Diſcovery. We were utterly unable to regain the road; and, by the morning of the 29th, the currents had carried us to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, within nine or ten miles of Oneeheow. Weary with plying ſo unſucceſsfully, Captain Cook laid aſide all thoughts of returning to Atooi and reſumed his intention of paying a viſit to Oneeheow. With this view, he diſpatched the maſter in a boat, to found along the coaſt, and ſearch for a landing-place, and afterwards for freſh water. In the mean time, the ſhips follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under an eaſy ſail. The maſter, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn reported, that there was tolerable anchorage all along the coaſt; and that he had landed in one place, but could not find any freſh water.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook being informed by ſome of the natives, who had come off to the ſhips, that freſh water might be obtained at a village which we ſaw at a little diſtance, run down, and caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor before it, about ſix furlongs from the ſhore, the depth of water being twenty-ſix fathoms. The Diſcovery anchored at a greater diſtance
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030274_0597_0FE570BA852DE998"/>
from the ſhore, in twenty-three fathoms. The ſouth-eaſtern point of Oneeheow bore ſouth, 65° eaſt, about one league diſtant; and another iſland which we had diſcovered the preceding night, named Tahoora, bore ſouth, 61° weſt, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſeven leagues. Before we anchored, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral canoes had come off to us, bringing pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, yams, and ſmall pigs, beſides mats. The people who were in them reſembled in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the inhabitants of Atooi; and like them, were acquainted with the uſe of iron, which they aſked for by the name of <hi>toe</hi> and <hi>hamaite,</hi> readily parting with all their commodities for pieces of this metal. Some more canoes ſoon reached our ſhips, after they had come to anchor; but the iſlanders who were in theſe had apparently no other object, than to make us a formal viſit. Many of them came on board, and crouched down upon the deck; nor did they quit that humble poſture, till they were requeſted to riſe. Several women, whom they had brought with them, remained along-ſide in the canoes, behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much leſs modeſty than the females of Atooi; and, at intervals, they all joined in a ſong, which, though not very melodious, was performed in the exacteſt concert, by beating time upon their breaſts with their hands. The men who had come on board did not continue long with us; and before their departure, ſome of
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030274_0598_0FE548B4E7D35000"/>
them deſired permiſſion to lay down locks of their hair on the deck.</p>
                     <p>The curious enquiry, whether theſe iſlanders were cannibals, was this day renewed, and the ſubject did not ariſe from any queſtions put by us, but from a circumſtance that ſeemed to remove all doubt. One of the natives, who wiſhed to get in at the gun-room port, was refuſed; and he then aſked, whether we ſhould kill and eat him, if he ſhould come in? accompanying this queſtion with ſigns ſo expreſſive, that we did not entertain a doubt with reſpect to his meaning. We had now an opportunity of retorting the queſtion as to this practice; and a man behind the other, in the canoe, inſtantly replied, that, if we were killed on ſhore, they would not ſcruple to eat us not that he meant they would deſtroy us for that purpoſe, but that their devouring us would be the conſequence of our being at enmity with them.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Gore was ſent in the afternoon, with three armed boats, in ſearch of the moſt commodious landing-place; being alſo directed to look for freſh water when he ſhould get on ſhore. He returned in the evening, and reported to Captain Cook, that he had landed at the village above-mentioned, and had been conducted to a well about half a mile up the country; but that the water which it contained was in too ſmall a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity for our purpoſe, and the road that led to it
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030274_0599_0FE570BC0CA7CEA0"/>
was extremely bad. The next day Mr. Gore was ſent aſhore again, with a guard, and a party to trade with the inhabitants for refreſhments. The Commodore's intention was to have followed ſoon afterwards; and he went from the ſhip with that deſign. But the ſurf had ſo greatly increaſed by this time, that he was apprehenſive, if he got aſhore, he ſhould not be able to make his way back again. This circumſtance really happened to our people who had landed with Mr. Gore; for the communication between them and the ſhips, by our own boats, was quickly ſtopped. They made a ſignal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the evening, for the boats, which were accordingly ſent; and, in a ſhort time afterwards, returned with ſome good ſalt and a few yams. A conſiderable quantity of both theſe articles had been obtained in the courſe of the day; but the ſurf was ſo exceedingly high, that the greateſt part of both had bee loſt in bringing them off to the boats. The officer and twenty men, not venturing to run the riſque of coming off, rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ined all night on ſhore; by which unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate circumſtance, the very thing happened which Captain Cook, as we have already related, ſo eagarly wiſhed to prevent, and imagined he had effectually guarded againſt.</p>
                     <p>The violence of the ſurf did not deter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from coming off in canoes to our ſhips. They brought with them ſome refreſhments, for which we gave them, in exchange, ſome nails,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030274_0600_0FE570BD92C8EA08"/>
and pieces of iron hoops; and we diſtributed among the woman in the canoes, many pieces of ribbon, and ſome buttons, as bracelets. Some of the men had repreſentations of human figures punctured upon their breaſts, and one of them had a lizard repreſented. Theſe viſitants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us, that there was no chief of this iſland, but that it was ſubject to one of the chiefs of Atooi, whoſe name was Teneooneoo. Among other articles which they now brought off to us, was a ſmall drum, that had a great reſemblance to thoſe of Otaheite.</p>
                     <p>Between ten and eleven o'clock at night, the wind became ſoutherly, and the ſky ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate an approaching ſtorm. In conſequence of theſe threatening appearances, Captain Cook, thinking that we were rather too near the ſhore, cauſed the anchors to be taken up; and the ſhips being carried into forty-two fathoms water, came to again in that more ſecure ſtation. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, proved an unneceſſary precaution; for the wind, not long after, veering to north-north-eaſt, blew a freſh gale, with ſqualls, and violent ſhowers of rain. This weather continued for the whole ſucceeding day, during which the ſea ran ſo high, that all communication with our party on ſhore was totally intercepted, and the iſlanders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would not venture out to the ſhips in their canoes. Towards the evening, the Commodore ſent the maſter in a boat to the ſouth-eaſt point
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030274_0601_0FE570BF6B800838"/>
of the iſland, to try whether he could land in that quarter. He returned with a favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; but it was now too late to ſend for our party till the following morning; ſo that they were obliged to ſtay another night on ſhore. On the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ppearance of day-light, a boat was diſpatched to the ſouth-eaſt point, with orders to Lieutenant Gore, that, if he could not embark his people from the ſpot where they at preſent were, he ſhould march them up to the point. The boat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevented from getting to the beach, one of the crew ſwam to ſhore, and communicated the inſtructions. After the boat had returned, Captain Cook went himſelf with the launch and pinnace up to the point, in order to bring off our party from the land. He took with him three goats, one of them a male, and the others female; a young boar and ſow of the Engliſh breed; and alſo the ſeeds of onions, pumpkins and melons. He landed, with great eaſe, under the weſt ſide of the point, where he found his party, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſome of the natives. To one of theſe, who aſſumed ſome degree of authority over the reſt, he gave the goats, pigs, and ſeeds. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have left theſe uſeful preſents at Atooi. if we had not been ſo unexpectedly driven from that iſland.</p>
                     <p>While our people were employed in filling ſome water-caſks, from a little ſtream which the late rains had occaſioned, Captain Cook made a
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030274_0602_0FE570C4215101C8"/>
ſhort excurſion into the country, accompanied by the iſlander above-mentioned, and followed by two others who carried the two pigs. When they had arrived upon a riſing ground, the Captain ſtopped to look around him, and immediately obſerved a woman, on the oppoſite ſide of the valley in which he had landed, calling out to her countrymen who attended him. Upon this the man who acted as chief began to mutter ſomething as if he was praying; and the two bearers of the pigs continued walking round the Captain all the time, making about a dozen circuits before the other had made an end of his oriſon. This ſtrange ceremony being performed, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on their walk, and met people coming from all quarters, who, upon being called to by the Captain's attendants, fell proſtrate on their faces, till he was out of ſight. The ground over which he paſſed, though it was uncultivated and very ſtony, was covered with plants and ſhrubs, ſome of which perfumed the air with the moſt delicious fragrance.</p>
                     <p>Our party who had been detained ſo long on ſhore, found, in thoſe parts of the iſland which they had traverſed, ſeveral ſalt ponds, ſome of which had a ſmall quantity of water remaining, but others had none. They ſaw no appearance of a running ſtream; and though, in ſome ſmall wells which they met with, the freſh water was pretty good, it ſeemed to be ſcarce. The houſes
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030274_0603_0FE570C5B7860510"/>
of the natives were thinly ſcattered about; and it was ſuppoſed, that there were not more than five hundred perſons in the whole iſland. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of living among theſe people was decent and cleanly. No inſtance was obſerved of the men and women eating together; and the latter ſeemed in general to be aſſociated in companies by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The oily nuts of the <hi>dooe dooe</hi> are burned by theſe iſlanders for lights during the night; and they dreſs their hogs by baking them in ovens, ſplitting the carcaſes through the whole length. Our people met with a ſufficient proof of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the <hi>taboo</hi> among them; for one woman was employed in feeding another who was under that interdiction. Several other myſterious cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were alſo obſerved; one of which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a woman, who threw a pig into the ſurf, and drowned it, and then tied up a bundle of wood, which ſhe diſpoſed of in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The ſame female, at another time, beat a man's ſhoulders with a ſtick, after he had ſeated himſelf for that purpoſe. An extraordinary ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſeemed to be paid here to owls, which they keep very tame. It appeared to be a pretty general practice among them, to pull out one of their teeth; and when they were aſked the reaſon of this remarkable cuſtom, the only anſwer they gave was, that it was <hi>teeha;</hi> which was alſo the reaſon aſſigned by them for giving a lock of their hair.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="unknown:030274_0604_0FE570C74310DDC8"/>After our water-caſks had been filled, and ſome roots, ſalt, and ſalted fiſh, had been purchaſed from the natives, Captain Cook returned on board with all his people, intending to make another viſit to the Iſland the next day. But, about ſeven in the evening, the anchor of the Reſolution ſtarted, ſo that ſhe drove off the bank. By this accident, we found ourſelves, at day break the next morning, which was the 2d of February, nine miles to the leeward of our laſt ſtation; and the Captain foreſeeing that it would require more time to regain it than he choſe to employ, made the ſignal for the Diſcovery, to weigh anchor and join us. This junction was effected about noon; and both ſhips immediately directed their courſe to the northward, in proſecution of their voyage. Thus, after we had ſpent more time in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of theſe iſlands than was neceſſary to have anſwered all our purpoſes, we were obliged to quit them before we had completed our ſtock of water, or procured from them ſuch a plentiful ſupply of refreſhments as the natives were both able and willing to have furniſhed us with. Our ſhip, however, obtained from them proviſions that laſted at leaſt three weeks; and Captain Clerke, more fortunate than we were, acquired ſuch a quantity of vegetables, as ſufficed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery's people upwards of two months.</p>
                     <p>The obſervations which Captain Cook was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to make on theſe iſlands, combined with

                     <p>THE iſlands in the Pacific Ocean, which have been diſcovered in the courſe of our ate voyages, have been generally found ſituate a groups; the ſingle intermediate iſles, hitherto
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:030274_0606_0FE548B2D59711B0"/>
met with, being few in proportion to the reſt; though, in all probability, there are many more of them yet unknown, which ſerve as gradations or ſteps between the ſeveral cluſters. Of what number this new-diſcovered Archipelago is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, muſt be left to the deciſion of future navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators. We obſerved five of them, whoſe names are Woahoo, Atooi, Oneeheow, Oreehoua, and Tahoora. The laſt of theſe is a ſmall elevated iſland, at the diſtance of four or five leages from the ſouth-eaſt point of Oneeheow. We were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that it abounds with birds, which are its ſole inhabitants. We alſo gained ſome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with regard to the exiſtence of a low unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited iſland in the neighbourhood, named Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata-pappa. Beſides theſe ſix, we were told that there were ſome other iſlands both to the eaſtward and weſtward. Captain Cook diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the whole group by the name of the Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Iſlands, in honour of the Earl of Sandwich. Thoſe which we ſaw are ſituated between the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 21° 30′, and 22° 15′ north, and between the longitude of 199° 20′, and 201° 30′, eaſt.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to Woahoo, the moſt eaſterly of theſe iſlands ſeen by us, we could get no other information, but that it is high land, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.</p>
                     <p>Oneeheow, concerning which ſome particulars have been already mentioned, lies, ſeven leagues to the weſtward of our anchoring-place at Atooi,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030274_0607_0FE570D094620480"/>
and does not exceed fifteen leagues in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Yams are its principal vegetable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. We procured ſome ſalt here, called by the natives <hi>patai,</hi> which is produced in ſalt ponds. With it they cure both fiſh and pork; and ſome ſalt fiſh, which we purchaſed from them, were extremely good, and kept very well. This iſland is chiefly low land, except the part oppoſite Atooi, which riſes immediately from the ſea to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable height; as does alſo its ſouth-eaſt point, which terminates in a round hill.</p>
                     <p>Of Oreehoua we know no other particulars than that it is an elevated iſland, of ſmall extent, lying cloſe to the north ſide of Oneeheow.</p>
                     <p>Atooi, which is the largeſt of thoſe we ſaw, being the principal ſcene of our operations, we ſhall now proceed to lay before our readers ſuch information as we were able to collect concerning it. From what we obſerved of it, it is, at leaſt, ten leagues in length from eaſt to weſt; from whence its circumference may nearly be gueſſed, though it appears to be much broader at the eaſt than at the weſt point. The road, or anchoring-place, which our veſſels occupied, is on the ſouth-weſt ſide of the iſland, about two leagues from the weſt end, before a village named Wymoa. As far as we ſounded, we found the bank free from rocks; except to the eaſtward of the village, where there projects a ſhoal, on which are ſome rocks and breakers. This road is ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

to the trade wind; notwithſtanding which defect, it is far from being a bad ſtation, and greatly ſuperior to thoſe which neceſſity conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually obliges ſhips to uſe, in countries where the winds are not only more variable, but more boiſterous; as at Madeira, Teneriffe, the Azores, &amp;c. The landing too is not ſo difficult as at moſt of thoſe places; and, unleſs in very bad weather is always practicable. The water in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood is excellent, and may be conveyed with eaſe to the boats. But no wood can be cut at any convenient diſtance, unleſs the iſlanders could be prevailed upon to part with the few <hi>etooa</hi> trees (for that is the name they give to the <hi>cordia ſebaſtina</hi>) that grow about their villages, or a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies called <hi>dooe dooe,</hi> which grows farther up the country.</p>
                     <p>The land does not in the leaſt reſemble, in its general appearance, any of the iſlands we have viſited within the tropic of Capricorn; if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept its hills near the centre, which are high, but ſlope gradually towards the ſea, or lower lands.

as being more capable of improvement. The height of the land within, and the number of clouds which we ſaw, during the whole time of our continuance, hanging over it, and not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on the other parts, ſeem to indicate that there is a ſufficient ſupply of water, and that there are ſome running ſtreams which we had not an opportuniry of ſeeing, particularly in the deep valles, at the entrance of which the villages are, in general, ſituated. The ground, from the wooded part to the ſea, is covered with an excellent kind of graſs, about two, feet in height, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grows in tufts, and appeared capable of being converted into abundant crops of fine hay. But on this extenſive ſpace not even a ſhrub grows naturally.</p>
                     <p>In the narrow valley leading to the <hi>morai,</hi> the ſoil is of a dark-brown colour, rather looſe; but, on the high ground, it is of a reddiſh brown more ſtiff and clayey. It is probably the ſame all over the cultivated parts; for what adhered to moſt of the potatoes that we purchaſed, which, doubtleſs, came from very different ſpots, was of this ſort. Its quality, however, may be better eſtimated from its productions, than from its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.

                     <p>Were we to judge of the climate from our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, it might be ſaid to be very variable; for, according to the general opinion; it was, at this time, the ſeaſon of the year when the weather is ſuppoſed to be moſt ſettled, the ſun being at his greateſt annual diſtance. The heat was now very moderate; and few of thoſe inconveniences to which many countries lying within the tropics are ſubject, either from heat, moiſture, ſeem to be experienced here. Nor did we find any dews of conſequence; a circumſtance which may partly be accounted for, by the lower part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being deſtitute of trees.</p>
                     <p>The rock that conſtitutes the ſides of the valley, is a dark-grey ponderous ſtone; but honey-combed, with ſome ſpots of a ruſty colour, and ſome very minute ſhining particles interſperſed. It is of an immenſe depth, and ſeems to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into <hi>ſtrata</hi>; though nothing is interpoſed; for the large pieces always broke off to a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate thickneſs, and did not appear to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to thoſe that were below them. Other ſtones are, in all probability, much more various than in the ſouthern iſlands. For, during the ſhort time we remained here, beſides the <hi>lapis lydius,</hi> we found a ſpecies of cream-coloured whetſtone, ſometimes variegated with whiter or blacker veins, like marble; and common writing ſlate, as well
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:030274_0612_0FE570D3E0317C50"/>
as ſome of a coarſer ſort; and the natives brought us ſome pieces of a coarſer whitiſh pumice ſtone. We all procured a brown ſort of <hi>haematites,</hi> which, from its being ſtrongly attracted by the magnet, diſcovered the quantity of metal it contained. What we ſaw of this was cut artificially, as were alſo the ſlates and whetſtones.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the vegetables purchaſed by us as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, among which were, at leaſt, five or ſix varieties of plantains, the iſland produces bread fruit: this, however, ſeems to be ſcarce, as we only ſaw one tree of that ſpecies. There are alſo a few cocoa-palms; ſome yams; the <hi>kappe</hi> of the Friendly Iſlands, or Virginian <hi>arum;</hi> the <hi>atooa</hi> tree, and odoriferous <hi>gardenia,</hi> or <hi>cape jaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> We met with ſeveral trees of the <hi>dooe dooe,</hi> that bear the oily nuts, which are ſtuck upon a kind of ſkewer, and made uſe of as candles. Our people ſaw them uſed in the ſame manner at Oneeheow. We were not on ſhore at Atooi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the day time, and then we obſerved the iſlanders wearing theſe nuts, hung on ſtrings, round their necks. There is a ſpecies of <hi>ſida,</hi> or Indian mallow; alſo the <hi>morinda citrifolia,</hi> which is here called <hi>none;</hi> a ſpecies of <hi>convolvulus;</hi> the <hi>ava,</hi> or intoxicating pepper, beſides great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of gourds. Theſe laſt grow to a very large ſize, and are of a remarkable variety of ſhapes, which are, perhaps, the effect of art. Upon the dry ſand, about the village, grew a plant, that had
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:030274_0613_0FE570DAA5538EA8"/>
never been ſeen by us in this ocean, of the ſize of a common thiſtle, and prickly; but bearing a fine flower, greatly reſembling a white poppy.</p>
                     <p>The ſcarlet birds, which were brought for ſale, were never met with alive; but we ſaw one ſmall one, about the ſize of a canary bird, of a deep crimſon colour. We alſo ſaw a large owl, two brown hawks, or kites, and a wild duck. We heard from the natives the names of ſome other birds; among which were the <hi>otoo,</hi> or blueiſh heron, and the <hi>torata,</hi> a ſort of whimbrel. It is probable that the ſpecies of birds are numerous, if we may judge by the quantity of fine yellow, green, and ſmall, velvet-like, blackiſh feathers uſed upon the cloaks, and other ornaments, worn by theſe people.</p>
                     <p>Fiſh, and other productions of the ſea, were, to appearance, not various; as beſides the ſmall mackarel, we only ſaw common mullets; a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a chalky colour; a ſmall browniſh rock-fiſh, adorned with blue ſpots; a turtle, which was penned up in a pond; and three or four ſorts of fiſh ſalted. The few ſhell-fiſh ſeen by us were chiefly converted into ornaments, though they were deſtitute of the recommendation either of beauty or novelty.</p>
                     <p>The only tame or domeſtic animals that we found here were hogs, dogs, and fowls, which were all of the ſame kind that we met with at the iſlands of the South Pacific. There were alſo
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030274_0614_0FE570DD4E2A1D28"/>
ſmall lizards; and ſome rats, reſembling thoſe of every iſland which we had hitherto viſited.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of Atooi are of the middle ſize, and in general, ſtoutly made. They are neither remarkable for a beautiful ſhape, nor for ſtriking features. Their viſage, particularly that of the women, is ſometimes round, but others have it long; nor can it juſtly be ſaid, that they are diſtinguiſhed, as a nation, by any general caſt of countenance. Their complexion is nearly of a nut brown; but ſome individuals are of a darker hue. We have already mentioned the women as being little more delicate than the men in their formation; and we may add, that, with few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions they have little claim to thoſe peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that diſtinguiſh the ſex in moſt other parts of the world. There is, indeed, a very remarkable equality in the ſize, colour and figure, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of both ſexes; upon the whole, however, they are far from being ugly, and have to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, few natural deformities of any kind. Their ſkins is not very ſoft, nor ſhining; but their eyes and teeth are, for the moſt part, pretty good. Their hair, in general, is ſtraight; and though its natural colour is uſually black; they ſtain it, as at the Friendly and other iſlands. We perceived but few inſtances of corpulence, and theſe more frequently among the women than the men; but it was principally among the latter, that perſonal defects were obſerved; though, if any of them can
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:030274_0615_0FE56FFF7442FB88"/>
lay claim to a ſhare of beauty, it appeared to be moſt conſpicuous amongſt the young men.</p>
                     <p>They are active, vigorous, and moſt expert ſwimmers; leaving their canoes upon the moſt frivolous occaſion, diving under them, and ſmim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to others, though at a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. We have frequently ſeen women, with infants at the breaſt, when the ſurf was ſo high as to prevent their landing in the canoes, leap overboard, and ſwim to the ſhore, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering their little ones.</p>
                     <p>They appear to be of a frank, chearful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and are equally free from the fickle levity which characterizes the inhabitants of Otaheite, and the ſedate caſt which is obſervable among many of thoſe of Tongataboo. They ſeem to cultivate a ſociable intercourſe with each other; and except the propenſity to thieving, which is, as it were, innate in moſt of the people we have viſited in theſe ſeas, they were extremely friendly to us. And it does no ſmall credit to their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, without flattering ourſelves, that when they ſaw the different articles of our European ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, they could not refrain from expreſſing their aſtoniſhment, by a mixture of joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that ſeemed to apply the caſe as a leſſon of humility to themſelves; and, on every occaſion, they appeared to have a proper conſciouſneſs of their own inferiority; a behaviour that equally exempts their national character from the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:030274_0616_0FE570DF0275CA90"/>
pride of the more poliſhed Japaneſe, and of the ruder native of Greenland. It was pleaſing to obſerve with what affection the women managed their infants, and with what alacrity the men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed their aſſiſtance in ſuch a tender office; thus diſtinguiſhing themſelves from thoſe ſavages, who conſider a wife and child as things rather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, than deſirable, or worthy of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and eſteem.</p>
                     <p>From the numbers that we ſaw aſſembled at every village, as we coaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> along, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that the inhabitants of this iſland are pretty numerous. Including the ſtraggling houſes, there might perhaps be, in the whole iſland ſixty ſuch villages as that near which our ſhips an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored; and if we allow five perſons to each houſe, there would be, in every village, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; or thirty thouſand upon the iſland. This number is by no means exaggerated, for there were ſometimes three thouſand people, at leaſt, collected upon the beach; when it could not be ſuppoſed, that above a tenth part of the natives were preſent.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary dreſs of both ſexes has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed. The women have often much larger pieces of cloth wrapped about them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from juſt below the breaſts to the hams, and ſometimes lower; and ſeveral were obſerved with pieces thrown looſely over their ſhoulders, which covered the greateſt part of the body; but
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:030274_0617_0FE570E0DDE1B050"/>
the children, when very young, are entirely naked. They wear nothing upon the head; but the hair both of men and women, is cut in various forms; and the general faſhion, particularly among the latter, is to have it ſhort behind, and long before. The men frequently had it cut on each ſide in ſuch a manner, that the remaining part ſomewhat reſembled the creſt of their caps or helmets, before mentioned. Both ſexes, however, ſeemed to be very careleſs about the hair, and had no combs, nor any thing of the kind to dreſs it with. The men ſometimes twiſt it into a number of ſeparate parcels, like the tails of a wig, each about as thick as a finger; though moſt of theſe which are ſo long as to reach far down the back, are artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fixed upon the head, over their own hair.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to the general practiſe of moſt of the iſlands of the Pacific Ocean, the people of the Sandwich Iſles have not their ears perforated, nor do they were any ornaments in them. Both men and women however, adorn themſelves with necklaces compoſed of bunches of ſmall black cord, like our hat-ſtring, often above a hundred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; entirely reſembling thoſe we ſaw worn at Woteeoo, except that, inſtead of the two little balls on the middle before, they fix a ſmall piece of wood, ſtone, or ſhell, about two inches in length, with a broad hook, well poliſhed. They have alſo necklaces of many ſtrings of very ſmall ſhells, or of the dried flowers of the Indian mallow; and
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:030274_0618_0FE570E64F5BA400"/>
they ſometimes hang round their necks a ſmall human figure of bone, about the length of three inches. The women likewiſe wear bracelets of a ſingle ſhell, pieces of black wood, with bits of ivory interſperſed, and neatly poliſhed, faſtened together by the ſtring drawn cloſely through them; or others of hogs-teeth, placed parallel to each other, with the concave part outward, and the points cut off; ſome of which, formed only of large boar's tuſks, are very elegant. The men ſometimes fix on their heads plumes of feathers of the tropic bird; or thoſe of cocks, faſtened round neat poliſhed ſticks, two feet in length; and, for the ſame purpoſe, they ſew the ſkin of a white dog's tail over a ſtick, with its tuft <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

They alſo, not unfrequently, wear on the head a kind of ornament, of the thickneſs of a finger, or more, covered with yellow and red feathers, curiouſly varied, and tied behind; and, on that part of the arm which is above elbow, a ſort of broad ſhell-work, grounded upon net-work.</p>
                     <p>The men ſometimes puncture themſelves upon their hands or arms, and near the groin; but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we ſaw no marks at all; though a few individuals had more of this ſpecies of ornament than we had uſually ſeen at other places, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly executed in a great variety of lines and figures, on the arms and fore-part of the body. Contrary to the cuſtom of the Friendly and Society Iſlands, they do not ſlit, or cut off, any part of the

                     <p>There is no appearance of defence, or fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, near any of their villages, and the houſes, are ſcattered about, without the leaſt order. Some of theſe habitations are large and commodious, from forty to fifty feet in length, and twenty or thirty in breadth; while others of them are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible hovels. Their figure reſembles that of hay-ſtacks; or, perhaps, a better idea may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them, by ſuppoſing the roof of a barn placed on the ground, in ſuch a manner, as to form a high, acute ridge, with two low ſides. The gable at each end correſponding to the ſides, makes theſe dwelling-places cloſe all round; and they are well thatched with long graſs, which is laid on ſlender poles. The entrance is made either in the end or ſide, and is an oblong hole, extremely low; it is often ſhut up by a board or planks, faſtened together, which ſerves as a door; but, as it has no hinges, muſt be removed occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally. No light enters the houſe except by this opening; and though ſuch cloſe habitations may be comfortable places of retreat in bad weather, they ſeem but ill-adapted to the warm climate of this country. They are kept remarkably clean, and the floors are ſtrewed with dried graſs, over which mats are ſpread to ſit and ſleep on. At one end ſtands a bench, about three feet high, on which the domeſtic utenſils are placed. Theſe

conſiſt of gourd-ſhells, which the natives convert into veſſels that ſerve a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> bottles to hold water, and as baſkets to contain their food, and other things; and alſo of a few wooden bowls and trenchers of various ſizes.</p>
                     <p>From what we ſaw growing, and from what was brought to market, we have no doubt, that ſweet potatoes, <hi>taro,</hi> and plantains, conſtitute the principal part of their vegetable diet; and that yams and bread-fruit are rather to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as rarities. Of animal food, they appear to be in no want; as they have great numbers of hogs, which run without reſtraint, about the houſes; and, if they eat dogs, which is not altogether improbable, their ſtock of theſe ſeemed very conſiderable. The quantities of fiſhing-hooks found among them, indicated that they procure a tolerable ſupply of animal food from the ſea. They have a cuſtom of ſalting-fiſh, and likewiſe pork, which they preſerve in gourd-ſhells. The ſalt, which they uſe for this purpoſe, is of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh colour, but not very coarſe, and ſeems to be nearly the ſame with what our ſtragglers found at Chriſtmas Iſland. Its colour, is doubtleſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a mixture of mud, at the bottom of the part where it is formed; for ſome of it, which had adhered in lumps, was of a tolerable whiteneſs.</p>
                     <p>They bake their vegetable articles of food with heated ſtones; and, from the great quantity which we ſaw dreſſed at one time, we imagined, that
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:030274_0623_0FE570EBA4716820"/>
all the inhabitants of a village, or at leaſt, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of people, joined in the uſe of a common oven. We did not perceive them dreſs any animal food at this iſland; but Mr. Gore's party, as has been already mentioned, obſerved that it was dreſſed at Oneeheow in the ſame kind of ovens, which makes it highly probable that this is alſo the practice in Atooi; particularly as we met with no utenſil there, that could ſerve the purpoſe of boiling or ſtewing. The only artificial diſh we ſaw was a <hi>taro</hi> pudding; which, though very ſour, was devoured with avidity by the natives. They eat off a ſort of wooden trenchers; and as far as we were enabled to judge from one inſtance, the women, if reſtrained from feeding at the ſame diſh with the men, as is the cuſtom at Otaheite, are, at leaſt, allowed to eat in the ſame place near them.</p>
                     <p>The amuſements of theſe people are various. We did not ſee the dances at which they uſe the feathered cloaks and caps; but, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they made with their hands, on other occaſions, when they ſung, we judged that they were ſomewhat ſimilar to thoſe we had met with at the ſouthern iſlands, though not ſo ſkilfully performed. They had not among them, either flutes or reeds; and the only two muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeen by us, were of an extremely rude kind. One of them does not produce a melody ſuperior to that of a child's rattle. It conſiſts of what may be denominated a conic cap invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030274_0624_0FE570EECF4A1BB8"/>
but very little hollowed at the baſe, made of a ſedge-like plant; the upper part of which, and likewiſe the edges, are embelliſhed with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful red feathers; and to the point, or lower part, is a fixed gourd-ſhell. Into this they put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to rattle, which is done by holding the inſtrument by the ſmall part, and ſhaking it briſkly before the face, at the ſame time ſtriking the breaſt with the other hand. The other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument was a hollow veſſel of wood, not unlike a platter, combined with the uſe of two ſticks, on which one of our gentlemen obſerved a man performing. He held one of the ſticks, about two feet in length, with one hand, in the ſame manner as we hold a violin, and ſtruck it with the other, which was ſmaller, and reſembled a drum-ſtick, in a quicker or flower meaſure; beating with his foot at the ſame time upon the hollow veſſel, that lay upon the ground invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thus producing a tune, that was not diſagreeable. This muſic was accompanied by the vocal performance of ſome women, whoſe ſong had a pleaſing effect.</p>
                     <p>They have great numbers of ſmall poliſhed rods, of the length of between four and five feet, rather thicker than the rammer of a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, with a tuft of long white dog's hair fixed on the ſmall end. Theſe they probably make uſe of their diverſions. We ſaw a native take one of them in his hand, and, holding it up, give

                        <figure/>

a ſmart ſtroke, till it was brought into an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal poſition, ſtriking the ground with his foot, on the ſame ſide, and beating his breaſt with his other hand. They play it bowls with pieces of the whet-ſtone above-mentioned, ſhaped ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a ſmall cheeſe, but rounded at the edges and ſides, which are very neatly poliſhed. They have other bowls made of a reddiſh-brown clay, glazed over with a compoſiton of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or of a courſe dark-grey ſlate. They alſo uſe, as quoits, ſmall flat roundiſh pieces of the writing ſlate, ſcarcely a quarter of an inch thick.</p>
                     <p>In the different manufactures of theſe people, there appears to be an extraordinary degree of ingenuity and neatneſs. Their cloth is made from the <hi>morus papyrifera,</hi> and, doubtleſs, in the ſame manner, as at Tongataboo and Otaheite; for we bought ſome of the grooved ſticks with which, they beat it. Its texture, however, though thicker, is inferior to that of the cloth of either of the places juſt mentioned; but in colouring or ſtaining it, the inhabitants of Atooi diſplay a ſuperiority of taſte, by the infinite variety of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures which they execute. Their colours, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are not very bright, except the red; but the regularity of the figures and ſtripes is amazing; for, as far as we know, they have nothing like ſtamps or prints, to make the impreſſions. We had no opportunity of learning in what manner they produce their colours; but, beſides the

variegated ſorts, they have ſome pieces of plain white cloth, and others of a ſingle colour, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly light blue, and dark-brown. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the pieces brought to us were about the breadth of two feet, and four or five yards in length, being the form and quantity made uſe of by them for their common dreſs, or <hi>maro</hi>; and even ſome of theſe were compoſed of pieces ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. They have alſo a particular ſort that is thin and greatly reſembles oil-cloth; and which is either oiled or ſoaked in ſome kind of varniſh. They fabricate numbers of white mats, which were ſtrong, with many red ſtripes, rhom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, and other figures interwoven on one ſide. Theſe in all probability, occaſionally make a part of their dreſs; for, when they offered them to ſale, they put them on their backs. They ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture others of a coarſer ſort, plain and ſtrong, which they ſpread over their floors, to ſleep upon.</p>
                     <p>They ſtain their gourd-ſhells neatly with undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated lines, triangles, and other figures of a black colour. They alſo ſeem to be acquainted with the art of varniſhing; for ſome of theſe ſtained gourd-ſhells are covered with a ſort of lacker; and, on other occaſions, they make uſe of a ſtrong ſize, or glutinous ſubſtance, to faſten things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Their wooden diſhes and bowls, out of which they drink their <hi>ava,</hi> are of the <hi>etooa</hi> tree, or <hi>cordia,</hi> extremely neat and well poliſhed.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:030274_0628_0FE57111D486DE18"/>
They likewiſe make ſmall ſquare fans of mat or wicker-work, with handles of the ſame, or of wood tapering from them, which are curiouſly wrought with ſmall cords of hair, and cocoa-nut fibres, intermixed. Their fiſhing-hooks are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly made; ſome of bone, many of pearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, and others of wood, pointed with bone. The bones are for the moſt part ſmall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of two pieces; and the various ſorts have a barb, either on the inſide, like ours, or on the outſide; but others have both, the exterior one being fartheſt from the point. Of the latter ſort one was procured, nine inches in length, made of a ſingle piece of bone; the elegant form and poliſh of which, could not be exceeded by any European artiſt. They poliſh their ſtones, by conſtant friction, with pumice-ſtone in water; and ſuch of their tools as we ſaw, reſembled thoſe of the ſouthern iſlanders. Their hatchets. or rather adzes, were exactly of the ſame pattern, and were either formed of a blackiſh ſtone, or of a clay-coloured one. They have alſo ſmall inſtruments compoſed of a ſingle ſhark's tooth, ſome of which are fixed to the fore-part of the jaw-bone of a dog, and others to a thin wooden handle of a ſimilar ſhape; and at the other end there is a bit of ſtring faſtened through a little hole. They ſerve occaſionally as knives, and are, probably, uſed in carving.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="unknown:030274_0629_0FE57113797B7FF8"/>The only iron-tools ſeen among them, and which they poſſeſſed before our arrival, were a piece of iron-hoop, about the length of two inches, fitted into a wooden handle; and another edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tool, which we ſuppoſed to have been made of the point of a broad ſword. Their having the actual poſſeſſion of theſe, and their being well acquainted with the uſe of this metal, inclined ſome of our people to imagine that we were not the firſt European viſitors of theſe iſlands. But the very great ſurprize which they teſtified on ſeeing our ſhips, and their perfect ignorance of the uſe of fire-arms, cannot be reconciled with ſuch an opinion. There are ſeveral means by which ſuch people may obtain pieces of iron, or acquire the knowledge of the exiſtence of that metal, without having had an immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with thoſe nations that uſe it. It can ſcarcely be doubted, that it was unknown to all the inhabitants of the Pacific Ocean, till Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan led the way into it; for no navigator, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his voyage, found any of this metal in their poſſeſſion; though, in the courſe of our late voyages, it has been remarked, that the uſe of it was known at ſeveral iſlands, which no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer European veſſel had ever, to our knowledge, viſited. At all the places where Mendana touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, during his two voyages, ſome of it muſt have been left; and this would, doubtleſs, extend the knowledge of it to all the various iſlands with
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030274_0630_0FE57115049942E8"/>
which the people, whom he viſited, had any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate intercourſe. It might even have been carried farther; and where ſpecimens of this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable article could not be met with, deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might, in ſome degree, ſerve to make it known, when afterwards ſeen. The next voyage to the ſouthward of the equator, in which any intercourſe was had with the people who inhabit the iſlands of this ocean, was that of Quiros, who landed at Sagittaria, the iſland of Handſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and at Tierra del Eſpiritu Santo; at all which places, as well as at thoſe with which they had any communication, it muſt undoubtedly have been made known. To him ſucceeded, in this navigation, Le Maire, and Schouten, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with the natives began much farther to the eaſtward, and terminated at Cocos and Horn iſlands. It is certain, that the inhabitants of Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite, and the Society Iſles, had a knowledge of iron, and purchaſed it with the greateſt avidity, when Captain Wallis diſcovered Otaheite; and they could only have acquired this knowledge through the mediation of thoſe neighbouring iſlands at which it had been originally left. They acknowledge, indeed, that this was really the caſe; and they have ſince informed us, that they held it in ſuch eſtimation, before the arrival of Captain Wallis, that an Otaheitean chief, who had gained poſſeſſion of two nails, received no ſmall emo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ment, by letting out the uſe of them
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030274_0631_0FE57116EDF00A50"/>
to his neighbours, for the purpoſe of boring holes. The natives of the Society Iſlands, whom we found at Wateeoo, had been driven to that place long after the knowledge and uſe of iron had been thus introduced among their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and though, perhaps, they had no ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of it with them, they would naturally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate at that iſland, by diſcription, their knowledge of this uſeful metal. From the people of Wateeoo, again, thoſe of Hervey's Iſland might derive that inclination for it, of which we had ſufficient proofs during our ſhort intercourſe with them.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of the facts will ſhew, how the knowledge of iron has been conveyed throughout the Pacific Ocean, to iſlands which have never had an immediate connection with Europeans; and it may eaſily be imagined, that, wherever the hiſtory of it only has been report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or a very inconſiderable quantity of it has been left, the greater eagerneſs will be ſhewn by the inhabitants to procure plentiful ſupplies of it. The application of theſe particulars, to the object of our preſent conſideration, is manifeſt. The natives of Atooi and Oneeheow, without having ever been viſited by Europeans before us, might have received this metal from interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate iſlands, ſituated between them and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drones which the Spaniards have frequented al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ever ſince the period of Magellan's voyage.
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030274_0632_0FE5711C23D64D18"/>
Or, if the diſtant weſtern poſition of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drones, ſhould detract from the probability of this ſolution, is there not the American continent to windward, where the Spaniards have been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled for upwards of two centuries and a half: dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which long ſpace of time, ſhipwrecks muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have happened on its coaſts? It cannot be deemed ſurprizing that part of ſuch wrecks, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining iron, ſhould, by the eaſterly trade-winds, be occaſionally caſt upon ſome of thoſe iſlands which are diſperſed about this immenſe ocean.— The diſtance of Atooi from America, is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt this ſuppoſition; and even if it were, it would not deſtroy it. This ocean is annually traverſed by Spaniſh veſſels; and it is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that, beſides the accident of loſing a maſt and its appendages, caſks with iron-hoops, and many other things that contain iron, may fall, or be thrown overboard during ſo long a paſſage, and thus find their way to land. Theſe are not mere conjectures; for one of Captain Cook's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple actually ſaw ſome wood in a houſe at Wymoa, which he ſuppoſed to be fir: it was worm-eaten, and the natives informed him, that it had been driven aſhore by the waves; and we had their own expreſs teſtimony, that they had obtained, from ſome place to the eaſtward, the ſpecimens of iron found among them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="unknown:030274_0633_0FE5711E12505EA8"/>From this digreſſion (if it can juſtly be called ſo) let us return to the obſervations made during our continuance at Atooi. The canoes of theſe people are commonly about four and twenty feet in length, and have the bottom, in general, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a ſingle picee of wood, hollwed out to the thickneſs of an inch, or more, and brought to a point at each end. The ſides are compoſed of three boards, each about an inch thick; neatly fitted and laſhed to the bottom. The extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both at head and ſtern, are a little elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and both are made ſharp, ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a wedge, but they flatter more abruptly, ſo that the two ſide-boards join each other, ſide by ſide, for upwards of a foot. As they ſeldom exceed a foot and a half in breadth, thoſe that go ſingle (for they ſometimes join them) have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riggers, which are ſhaped and fitted with more judgment than any we had before ſeen. They are rowed by paddles, ſuch as we had generally obſerved at other iſlands; and ſome of them have a light triangular ſail, extended to a maſt and boom. The ropes which they uſe for their boats, and the ſmaller cords for their fiſhing-tackles, are ſtrong, and neatly made.</p>
                     <p>They are by no means novices in the art of agriculture. The vale-ground is one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plantation of <hi>taro,</hi> and ſome other articles, which have all the appearance of being carefully attended to. The potatoe-fields, and ſpots of

ſugar-cane, or plantains, on the higher grounds, are planted with great regularity; but neither theſe, nor the others, are encloſed with any fence, unleſs we conſider the ditches in the low grounds as ſuch; which, it is more probable, are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to convey water to the <hi>taro.</hi> The great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and excellence of theſe articles, may perhaps be as much owing to ſkilful culture, as natural fertility of ſoil, which ſeems better adapted to them than to bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees; the few we ſaw of theſe latter not being in a thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate. Notwithſtanding this ſkill in agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the iſland, from its general appearance, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be capable of more extenſive improvement, and of mantaining thrice as many inhabitants as are now upon it; for the greater part of it, that now lies waſte, was apparently as good a ſoil as thoſe parts that are cultivated. It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be inferred, that theſe people do not increaſe in that proportion, which, would render it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to take advantage of the extent of their iſlands, towards raiſing a greater quantity of its vegetable productions for their maintenance.</p>
                     <p>Though Captain Cook did not ſee a chief of any note, there were, however, ſeveral, as the iſlanders informed us, who reſide at Atooi, and to whom they proſtrate themſelves as a mark of homage and reſpect. This proſtration ſeems equivalent to the <hi>moe moea,</hi> paid to the chiefs of the Friendly Iſlands, and is here denominated
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030274_0636_0FE571214A2F73D0"/>
                        <hi>hamoea,</hi> or <hi>moe.</hi> Whether they were, at firſt, afraid to ſhew themſelves, or happened to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we cannot determine; but after the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution had left the iſland, one of theſe great men made his appearance, and viſited Captain Clerke on board the diſcovery; he came off in a double canoe; and, like the ſovereign of the Friendly Iſles, paid no regard to the ſmall canoes that chanced to be in his way, but ran againſt, or over them, without making the leaſt attempt to avoid them. And it was impoſſible for theſe poor people to avoid him, for they could not then manage their canoes; it being a neceſſary mark of their ſubmiſſion, that they ſhould lie down till he had paſſed. His attendants aſſiſted him in getting on board the ſhip, and placed him in the gang-way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they ſtood round him, holding each other by the hands; nor would they ſuffer any one to approach him but Captain Clerke himſelf. He was a young man, apparelled from head to foot, and was accompanied by a young woman, who was perhaps his wife. His name was ſaid to be Tamahano. Captain Clerke hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made him ſome preſents, received from him, in return, a large bowl, ſupported by two figures of men, the carving of which diſplayed ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſkill, both with reſpect to the deſign and the execution. This bowl uſed to be filled with the <hi>kava,</hi> or <hi>ava,</hi> (as it is termed at Otaheite), which liquor is prepared and drank here as at
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030274_0637_0FE57125DFB40EF0"/>
the other iſlands of the Pacific Ocean. Captain Clerke could not prevail upon this chief to go below, nor to move from the ſpot where his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants had firſt placed him. After remaining ſome time in the ſhip, he was carried back into his canoe, and returned to the iſland. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, ſeveral meſſages were ſent to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke, inviting him to return the viſit on ſhore, and giving him to underſtand, that the chief had prepared a conſiderable preſent for the occaſion; but the Captain being anxious to get out to ſea, and join the Reſolution, did not think proper to accept of the invitation.</p>
                     <p>The ſhort and imperfect intercourſe we had with the natives, did not enable us to form any accurate judgement of the form of government eſtabliſhed amongſt them; but, from the general ſimilarity of cuſtoms, and particularly from what we obſerved of the honours paid to their chiefs, it ſeems reaſonable to imagine, that it is of the ſame nature with that which prevails in all the iſlands we had hitherto viſited; and, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, their wars among themſelves are equally frequent. This, indeed, might be inferred, from the number of weapons which we found in their poſſeſſion, and from the excellent order in which they kept them. But we had proofs of the fact from their own confeſſion; and, as we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, theſe wars are carried on between the different diſtricts of their own iſland, as well as
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030274_0638_0FE571280537D890"/>
between it and the neighbouring inhabitants of the iſles of Oneeheow and Oreehoua. We ſcarcely need aſſign any other cauſe beſides this, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the appearance, before-mentioned, of their population not being proportioned to the extent of their ground that is capable of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>Beſides their ſpears, formed of a fine browniſh wood, beautifully poliſhed ſome of which are barbed at one end, and flattened to a point at the other, they had a kind of weapon which we had never met with before. It ſomewhat reſembles a dagger, and is, in general, about eighteen inches in length; ſharpened at one or both ends, and ſecured to the hand by a ſtring. Its uſe is to ſtab in cloſe combat, and it ſeems well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that purpoſe. Some of theſe may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated double daggers, having a handle in the middle, with which they are the better enabled to ſtrike different ways. They have likewiſe bows and arrows; but both from their ſlender conſtruction, and their apparent ſcarcity, it is probable that they never make uſe of them in battle. The knife or ſaw, already mentioned, with which they diſſect the dead bodies of their enemies, may alſo be ranked among their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons as they both ſtrike and cut with it when engaged in cloſe fight. It is a ſmall flat wooden inſtrument, about a foot in length, of an oblong ſhape, rounded at the corners; its edges are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030274_0639_0FE571298C149B08"/>
with ſhark's teeth ſtrongly fixed to it, and pointing outwards; and it has generally a hole in the handle, through which paſſes a long ſtring, which they wrap ſeveral times round the wriſt. We alſo conjectured, that they uſe ſlings on ſome occaſions; for we procured ſome pieces of the <hi>haematites</hi> or blood-ſtone, artificially made of an oval form, longitudinally divided with a narrow groove in the middle of the convex part. To this the perſon who had one of them appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thin cord, but would not diſpoſe of it, though he was not unwilling to part with the ſtone, which, as it weighed a pound, muſt prove fatal when thrown with ſome degree of force. We likewiſe ſaw ſome pieces of whetſtone neatly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, of an oval figure, but ſomewhat pointed towards each end; nearly reſembling in ſhape ſome ſtones ſeen by Captain Cook at New Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia in 1774, and made uſe of there in ſlings.</p>
                     <p>As ſome of their religious inſtitutions, and their method of diſpoſing of their dead, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indicate an affinity between the manners of theſe people and of the natives of the Friendly and Society Iſlands, we will mention a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that will ſerve to place this in a ſtriking point of view. The inhabitants of Tongataboo bury their dead with great decency, and they alſo inter their human ſacrifices; but they do not, to our knowledge, offer any other animal, or even vegetable, to their deities. The Otaheiteans do
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030274_0640_0FE5712B6038AC28"/>
not inter their dead, but expoſe them to waſte by time and putrefaction, though they afterwards bury the bones; and, this being the caſe, it is remarkable, that they ſhould inter the intire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their human ſacrifices. They alſo offer up, to their gods, other animals and vegetables; but are far from being attentive to the condition of the places, where they celebrate thoſe ſolemn rites; moſt of their <hi>morais,</hi> being in a ruinous ſtate, and ſhewing manifeſt tokens of neglect. The people of Atooi, again, bury, both their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dead, and their human ſacrifices, as at Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gataboo; but they reſemble thoſe of Otaheite, in offering vegetables and animals to their gods, and in the neglected ſtate of their religious places.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>taboo</hi> alſo prevails in Atooi, in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and apparently with greater ſtrictneſs than even at Tongataboo. For the natives here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aſked, with great eagerneſs, and with indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a fear of offending, whether any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing, which they deſired to ſee, or we were unwilling to ſhew, was <hi>taboo,</hi> or (as they pronounced the word) <hi>tafoo?</hi> The <hi>mai raa,</hi> or prohibited articles at the Society Iſlands, though undoubtedly the ſame thing, did not appear to be ſo rigorouſly obſerved by them, except with regard to the dead: reſpecting whom we thought them more ſuperſtitious than any of the others were. Theſe, however, are circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we cannot pretend to ſpeak deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively;
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030274_0641_0FE5713189A67D50"/>
and we ſhall only obſerve, to ſhew the ſimilitude in other points connected with religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the <hi>tahounas,</hi> or prieſts, ſeem to be as numerous here as at the other iſlands.</p>
                     <p>But whatever reſemblance. we might diſcover between the general manners of the inhabitants of Atooi, and thoſe of Otaheite, theſe were leſs ſtriking than the ſimilarity of language. Indeed, the languages of both places may be ſaid to be almoſt entirely the ſame. The people of Atooi, in general, have neither the ſtrong guttural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the New-Zealanders, nor that ſmaller degree of it, which alſo diſtinguiſhes the Friendly Iſlanders; and they have not only adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſoft mode of the Otaheitans, in avoiding harſh ſounds, but the whole idiom of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; making uſe of the ſame affixes and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes to their words, and the ſame meaſure and cadence in their ſongs; at firſt hearing, indeed, a ſtranger may perceive ſome diſagreement; but it ſhould be conſidered, that the natives of Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite, from their frequent connections with the Engliſh, had learned, in ſome meaſure, to adapt themſelves to our imperfect knowledge of their language, by uſing the moſt common and even corrupted expreſſions in converſation with us; whereas, when they talked with each other, and uſed the ſeveral parts neceſſary to propriety of ſpeech, they were hardly at all underſtood by thoſe among us, who had made the greateſt progreſs
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030274_0642_0FE571330FA82DC0"/>
in the knowledge of their vocabulary. A liſt of words was collected at Atooi, by the indefatigable Mr. Anderſon, who embraced every opportunity of rendering our voyage uſeful to thoſe who amuſe themſelves in tracing the emigrations of the various tribes that have peopled the globe, by the moſt convincing of all arguments, that drawn from the coincidence of language.</p>
                     <p>How widely has this nation diffuſed itſelf, in ſo many detached iſlands, ſo far diſtant from each other, in every quarter of the Pacific Ocean! We find it, from New-Zealand, in the ſouth, as far as the Sandwich Iſlands to the northward; and, in another direction, from Eaſtern Iſland, to the New Hebrides: that is, over an extent of ſixty degrees of latitude, or three thouſand ſix hundred miles, north and ſouth; and eighty three degrees of longitude, or four thouſand nine hundred and eighty miles, eaſt and weſt! How much farther, in either of thoſe directions, its colonies reach, is not known; but, from what we are already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, we are authorized in pronouncing it to be the moſt extenſive nation upon earth, though, perhaps, not the moſt numerous.</p>
                     <p>If the Sandwich Iſlands had been diſcovered at an early period, by the Spaniards, they would doubtleſs have availed themſelves of ſo excellent a ſituation, and have made uſe of Atooi, or ſome other of the iſlands, as a place of refreſhment for the ſhips, that ſail annually between Manilla and
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030274_0643_0FE5713498649930"/>
Acapulco. They lie almoſt midway between the laſt mentioned place and Guam, one of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drones, which is at preſent their only port in traverſing this vaſt ocean; and it would not have been a week's ſail out of their ordinary route, to have touched at them. An acquaintance with the Sandwich Iſles would alſo have been equally favourable to our Buccaneers; who have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times paſſed from the coaſt of America to the Ladrones, with a ſtock of proviſions and water ſcarcely adequate to the ſupport of life. Here they might always have met with a plentiful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and have been within a month's ſail of the very part of California, which the Manilla ſhip is obliged to make. How happy would Lord An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have been, and what difficulties would he have avoided, had he known that there was a cluſter of iſlands, half way between America and Tinian, where all his wants might have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually relieved!</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Diſcovery having joined us, we ſtood away to the northward, with a gentle gale from the eaſt. The tides are ſo inconſiderable at the Sandwich Iſlands, that with the great ſurf breaking againſt the ſhore, it was difficult, at all times to know whether we had high or low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or wether it ebbed or flowed. On the ſouth ſide of Atooi, a current generally ſet to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or north-weſtward. But, when we were at anchor off Oneeheow, we found a current ſetting nearly north-weſt and ſouth-eaſt, ſix hours each way. This was doubtleſs a regular tide, and the flood appeared to come from the north-weſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="unknown:030274_0645_0FE5713DCF3E9680"/>But, to avoid digreſſion, on Saturday the 7th of February, we were in the latitude of 29° north and in the longitude of 200° eaſt, the wind veer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſouth-eaſt. We ſteered north-eaſt and eaſt till the 12th, when the wind had veered round to north-eaſt and eaſt-north-eaſt. We then tacked and ſtood to the northward, being in the latitude of 30° north, and in the longitude of 206° 15′ eaſt. In this advanced latitude, and even in the winter ſeaſon, we had only begun to feel a ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cold in the mornings and evenings; a proof of the equal and durable influence of the heat of the ſun, at all times to 30° on each ſide the line. After that, the diſproportion is known to become very great. This muſt be principally attributed to the direction of the ſun's rays, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the bare diſtance, which is not equal to the effect. On Thurſday the 19th of February, the wind veered to ſouth-eaſt, and we were again enabled to ſteer to the eaſt, inclining a little to the north. On the 25th, we reached the latitude of 42° 30′, and the longitude of 219°; when we began to meet with the rock-weed, mentioned in Lord Anſon's voyage, by the name of ſea-leek, which is generally ſeen by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilla ſhips. Sometimes a piece of wood appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but, if we had not known that we were near the continent of North America, we might have ſuppoſed, from the few ſigns of vicinity of land that we had ſeen, that we were not within ſome
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030274_0646_0FE5713F791B04C0"/>
thouſand leagues of any. Since we left Sandwich Iſlands we had hardly beheld a bird, or any other oceanic animal.</p>
                     <p>On the 1ſt of March, we had a calm day, which was ſucceeded by a wind from the north, with which we ſtood to the eaſt, intending to make land. We ought to have been near it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the charts. Such moderate and mild weather appeared to us very extraordinary, when we were ſo far north, and ſo near an extenſive continent, at this time of the year. The ſeaſon muſt have been remarkably mild, for Sir Francis Drake met with very ſevere cold, about this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, even in the month of June<note n="*" place="bottom">See Sir Francis Drake's Voyage, in Campbell's Edition of Harris, vol. i. p. 18.</note>. Viſcaino, indeed, who was in the ſame part of the world, in the depth of winter, hardly takes notice of the cold, and mentions a ridge of ſnowy mountains, on this coaſt, as ſomething extraordinary <note n="†" place="bottom">Vanega's Hiſt. of California. vol. ii. p. 229.</note>.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſingurlar circumſtance, that we ſhould meet with ſo few birds, compared to thoſe we ſaw in the ſame latitudes, to the ſouth of the line. This muſt either proceed from a ſcarcity of them, or from a deficiency of reſting-places. Hence it may be concluded, that, in the ſouthern he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, beyond 40°, the ſpecies are much more numerous, and the iſlands more plentifully ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030274_0647_0FE57141020A7DD0"/>
than any where near that latitude, between the coaſt of California and Japan.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 2d, during a calm part of the ſea appeared to be covered with a kind of ſlime, and ſome ſmall ſea animals were ſeen ſwimming about. Thoſe which were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, were of the gelatinous kind, almoſt globular; a ſmaller ſort had a white or ſhining appearance, and were in great abundance. Some of the latter were put into a glaſs cup, with ſome ſalt water; and, when in a prone ſituation, they appeared like ſmall ſcales or pieces of ſilver.</p>
                     <p>When they ſwam about, which they did with equal eaſe in various directions, they emitted the brighteſt colours of the moſt valuable gems, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their poſition reſpecting the light. At one time they appeared pellucid, at another diſplaying the various tints of blue, from a ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirine to a voilet, mixed with a kind of ruby, and glowing with ſufficient ſtrengh to illuminate the glaſs and water. When the veſſel was held to the ſtrongeſt light, the tints appeared moſt vivid; but almoſt vaniſhed when the animals ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided to the bottom, and they had then a browniſh appearance. By candle-light, the colour, was principally, a beautiful pale green, with a kind of burniſhed gloſs; and, in the dark, it faintly exhibited a glowing fire.</p>
                     <p>They are a new ſpecies of <hi>oniſcus</hi> and were called, by Mr. Anderſon, <hi>oniſcus fulgens;</hi> being
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030274_0648_0FE57142F1794880"/>
ſuppoſed to be an animal that contributes to that lucid appearance, often obſerved at ſea, in the night. Two large birds ſettled, this day on the water, near the ſhip. One was the <hi>procellaria maxima;</hi> and the other, of little more than half the magnitude of the former, appeared to be of the <hi>albatroſs kind.</hi> It was larger than a ſea-gull, but reſembled it in other reſpects. About noon, on the 6th, we beheld two ſeals, and ſeveral whales; and early the next morning, the long-expected coaſt of New Albion <note n="*" place="bottom">So named by Sir Francis D. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </note> was ſeen, at the diſtance of ten or twelve leagues, extending from north-eaſt to ſouth eaſt. At noon, we were in the latitude of 44° 33′ north, and in the longitude of 235° 20′ eaſt and the land about eight leagues diſtant.</p>
                     <p>We had now ſeventy-three fathoms water, over a muddy bottom, and found ninety fathoms about a league farther off. The land, which was of a moderate height, appeared to be diverſified with hills and vallies, and principally covered with wood. No very ſtriking object, however, preſented itſelf, except an high hill, with a flat ſummit, which bore eaſt from us at noon. The land formed a point at the northern extreme, which Captain Cook named <hi>Cape Foulweather,</hi> from the exceeding bad weather we afterwards met with.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="unknown:030274_0649_0FE57146EEA3FCB8"/>After variable light airs and calms, at eight o'clock in the evening of 7th, a breeze ſprung up at ſouth-weſt. We ſtood to the north-weſt, under an eaſy ſail, entending to range along the coaſt at day light. But, the next morning, at four, the wind having ſhifted to north-weſt, it blew in ſqualls, with rain. Till near ten o'clock our courſe was north-eaſt: but, not being able to make any progreſs on this tack, and ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that had the appearance of an harbour, we tacked, and ſtood off ſouth-weſt. Cape Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weather, at this time, bore north-eaſt by north, diſtant about eight leagues.</p>
                     <p>In the evening of the 8th, the wind veered to the north-weſt, with ſqualls, hail, and ſleet; and, the weather being hazy and thick, we ſtood out to ſea till about noon the next day, when we ſtood in again for the land, which we ſaw at two in the afternoon, bearing eaſt-north-eaſt. In the evening, the wind veered more to the weſt, and the weather grew worſe, which obliged us to tack and ſtand off till about four the next morning, when we ſtood in again. In the afternoon, at four, we diſcovered the land, which, at ſix, was about eight leagues diſtant. Here we tacked, and ſounded, but could not reach the ground with a line of one hundred and ſixty fathoms. We ſtood off till near midnight, and then ſtood in again. At half paſt ſix, the next morning, we were about three leagues from the land. Seeing
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030274_0650_0FE57149ED5A0BE0"/>
nothing like a harbour, and the weather continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſettled, we tacked and ſtretched off ſouth-weſt, having then fifty-five fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>The land which we approached, when we tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is moderately high, but, in many places, it riſes ſtill higher within. It is diverſified with hills and riſing grounds, many of which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with tall ſtraight trees; and others, which were not ſo high, grew in ſpots, like clumps or coppices; but the ſpaces between, and the ſides of the riſing grounds, were clear.</p>
                     <p>Though, perhaps, as a ſummer proſpect, this might be very agreeable, yet at this ſeaſon, it had an uncomfortable appearance, the bare grounds along the coaſt being covered with ſnow, which ſeemed to lie in abundance between hills and riſing grounds; and in many places, towards the ſea, had, at a diſtance, the appearance of white cliffs. On the riſing grounds, the ſnow was thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpread; and farther inland, there ſeemed to be none at all. Hence it might, perhaps, be concluded, that the ſnow which we had ſeen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea, had fallen the proceeding night; which was, indeed the coldeſt we had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced ſince our arrival on that coaſt; and a kind of ſleet ſometimes fell.</p>
                     <p>The coaſt appeared almoſt ſtraight in every part, not having any opening or inlet, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating in a kind of white ſanday beach; though it was imagined by ſome on board, that ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:030274_0651_0FE5714BC0C53078"/>
was owing to the ſnow. Each extreme of the land ſhot out into a point; the northern one was that which we had ſeen on the 7th, and therefore Captain Cook called it <hi>Cape Perpetua.</hi> Its latitude is 44° 6′ north, and its longitude 235° 52′ eaſt. The ſouthern extreme the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore named <hi>Cape Gregory.</hi> It lies in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 43° 30′, and in the longitude 235° 57′ eaſt. This point is rendered remarkable, by the land of it riſing immediately from the ſea, to a tolerable height, and that on each ſide of it is very low. We ſtood off till almoſt one in the afternoon, and then tacked and ſtood in, hoping in the night, to have the wind off from the land. We were, however, miſtaken, for, at five o'clock it veered to the weſt and ſouth-weſt, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us once more to ſtand out to ſea.</p>
                     <p>Cape Perpetua now bore north-eaſt by north; and the fartheſt land to the ſouth of Cape Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, bore ſouth by eaſt, diſtant about ten or twelve leagues. Its latitude will therefore be 43° 10′, and its longitude 235° 55′ eaſt. This is nearly the ſituation of Cape Blanco, diſcovered the 19th of January, 1603, by Martin d'Aguilar. It is remarkable that, in this very latitude, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers have placed a large entrance or ſtrait, aſcribing the diſcovery of it to the ſame naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; whereas nothing more is mentioned in his voyage, than his having diſcovered a large river
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030274_0652_0FE5714D46405F50"/>
in this ſituation, which he would have entered, but was hindered by the currents.</p>
                     <p>The wind was now very unſettled, and blew in ſqualls, with ſnow ſhowers. At midnight, it ſhifted to weſt-north-weſt, and preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a very hard gale with heavy ſqualls, and ſleet, or ſnow. We had not a choice now, but were obliged to ſtretch to the ſouthward, to get clear of the coaſt. This was done under more ſail than the ſhips could bear with ſafety, but it was abſolutely neceſſary to avoid the more imminent danger of being forced on ſhore. This gale abated at eight o'clock in the morning of the 13th, and then we ſtood in again for the land. The wind remained at weſt and north-weſt. Storms, breezes, and calms, alternately ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each other, till the morning of the 21ſt, when a breeze ſprung up at ſouth-weſt. This being accompanied with fair weather, we ſteered north-eaſterly, hoping to fall in with the land, beyond where we had been toſſed about for the preceding fortnight. In the evening the wind ſhifted to the weſtward, and the next morning, about eight o'clock, we beheld the land at the diſtance of about nine leagues. Our latitude was now 47° 5′ north, and our longitude 235° 10′ eaſt. We ſtood to the north, with a fine breeze, till near ſeven in the evening, when we tacked, in order to wait for day-light. We were now in forty-eight fathoms water, and four leagues from the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030274_0653_0FE57153E7BFCBE8"/>
land, extending from north to ſouth-eaſt; and a ſmall round hill, which we ſuppoſed to be an iſland, bore north three quarters eaſt, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of about ſix or ſeven leagues. It ſeemed to be or a tolerable height, and could but juſt be ſeen from the deck.</p>
                     <p>There appeared to be a ſmall opening between this ſuppoſed iſland, and the northern extreme of the land; we therefore entertained ſome hopes of finding an harbour; but theſe hopes gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vaniſhed as we drew nearer; and, at length, we were almoſt convinced that the opening was cloſed by low land. The Commodore for this reaſon, named the point of land to the north of it, <hi>Cape Flattery.</hi> Its latitude is 48° 15′ north, and its longitude 235° 3′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>All the land upon this part of the coaſt, is of a pretty equal height, is principally covered with wood, and has a very fertile appearance. In this very latitude, Geographers have placed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſtrait of Juan de Fuca. But nothing of that kind preſented itſelf to our view, nor is it probable that any ſuch thing ever exiſted. We ſtood to the ſouthward till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idnight, and then taked, and, with a gentle breeze at ſouth-weſt, ſteered to the north-weſt, intending, at day-light, to ſtand in for the land. But, before that time, we had a very hard gale, with rain, right on ſhore; inſtead therefore of running in for the land, we endeavoured to get an offing, or, at
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030274_0654_0FE57155E1C153B0"/>
leaſt, to preſerve that which we had already got. The ſouth-weſt wind, however, did not continue long, for it veered again to the weſt before night.</p>
                     <p>Thus were we perpetually encountering with ſtrong weſt and north-weſt winds. In an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the wind would ſometimes become mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and veer ſouthward; but this was a certain prelude to a ſtorm, which blew the hardeſt at ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, and was generally accompanied with rain and ſleet. In the courſe of ſix hours, it was uſually ſucceeded by a gale from the north-weſt, which introduced fair weather. About nine o'clock in the morning, of Sunday the 29th, we again ſaw the land, the neareſt part about ſix leagues diſtant. We were now in the latitude of 49° 29′ north, and in the longitude of 232° 29′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The face of the country was very different from that of the parts which we had before ſeen; numbers of loſty mountains preſented themſelves to our view, whoſe ſummits were covered with ſnow. The vallies between them, and the land towards the coaſt, were covered with high ſtraight trees, that appeared like a vaſt foreſt. A low point was formed at the ſouth-eaſt extreme of the land, off which are ſeveral breakers, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by ſome ſunken rocks. It was therefore called <hi>Point Breakers.</hi> Its latitude is 49° 15′ north, and its longitude 233° 20′ eaſt. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the other extreme is about 50°, and the
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030274_0655_0FE5715769F9AAA0"/>
longitude 232°. This laſt was named <hi>Woody Point.</hi> It is high land, and projects to the ſouth-weſt.</p>
                     <p>Between theſe two points, a large bay is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which the Commodore called <hi>Hope Bay</hi>; hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he ſaid, to find in it a good harbour; and the event proved that he was not miſtaken. As we approached the coaſt we ſaw the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of two inlets; one of which was in the north-weſt, and the other in the north-eaſt corner of the bay. We bore up for the latter, and paſſed ſome breakers about a league from the ſhore. Half a league without them, we had nineteen and twenty fathoms water; but, after we had paſſed them, the depth increaſed to fifty fathoms; and farther in, the ground was unfathomable with the greateſt length of line.</p>
                     <p>Though appearances were in our favour, we were not yet certain that there were any inlets; but being in a deep bay, Captain Cook reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to anchor, in order to endeavour to get ſome water, which we began to be much in need of. As we advanced, however, the exiſtence of the inlet no longer remained doubtful. About five o'clock, when we reached the weſt point of it, we were becalmed for ſome time. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Commodore ordered all the boats to be hoiſted out, in order to tow the ſhips in. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a freſh breeze ſprung up at north-weſt, with which we ſtretched up into an arm of the inlet,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030274_0656_0FE570F4790E9CF8"/>
which ran in to the north-eaſt. Here we were again becalmed, and found it neceſſary to anchor in eighty-five fathoms water, and ſo near the land as to be able to reach it with a hawſer. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery was becalmed before ſhe got within the arm, where ſhe anchored in ſeventy fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as we approached the inlet, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the coaſt to be inhabited; and three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes came off to the ſhip, at the place where we were firſt becalmed; in one of which were two men, in another ſix, and in the other ten. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing pretty near us, a perſon ſtood in one of the two laſt, and ſpoke for a conſiderable time, inviting us, as we ſuppoſed by his geſtures, to go aſhore; and, at the ſame time, continued ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing handfuls of feathers towards us. Some of his companions alſo threw a red powder in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>The perſon who was the orator upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, was clothed with the ſkin of ſome ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and held ſomething in each hand which rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled as he ſhook it. At length, grown weary with his repeated exortations, of which we could not comprehend a word, he became quiet; and the others in their turn, had ſomething to ſay to us; but their ſpeeches were neither ſo long, nor ſo vehement as that of the other. The hair of two or three of theſe people was ſtrewed over
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030274_0657_0FE571594B27E178"/>
with ſmall white feathers; and that of others, with large ones, ſtuck into different parts.</p>
                     <p>The tumultuous noiſe having ceaſed, they lay at a ſmall diſtance from the ſhip, converſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with much eaſe and compoſure, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt diſtruſt or ſurprize. Some of them roſe, occaſionally, and ſaid ſomething aloud, after the manner of their firſt harangues; and one, in particular, ſung a moſt agreeable air, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great degree of melody and ſoftneſs; the word <hi>haela</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing frequently repeated as the burden of the ſong.</p>
                     <p>A breeze ſpringing up ſoon after, brought us cloſer to the ſhore, when the canoes began to viſit us in great numbers; having had, at one time, no leſs than thirty-two of them about the ſhip, containing from three to ſeven or eight perſons each, and of both ſexes. Several of theſe alſo ſtood up and ſpake aloud, uſing the ſame geſtures as our firſt viſitors. One canoe particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted our obſervation, by a peculiar head, which had a birds eye, and an enormous large beak, painted on it. The perſon who was in it, and who appeared to be a chief, was equally remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his ſingular appearance; having a large quantity of feathers hanging from his head and being painted or ſmeared in a very extraordinary manner. In this hand he had a carved bird of wood, of the ſize of a pigeon, with which he often rattled, like the perſon before-mentioned, and was
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030274_0658_0FE5715F4552D6B8"/>
equally vociferous in his harangue, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many expreſſive geſtures. Though our viſitors were ſo peaceable, that they could not be ſuſpected of any hoſtile intention, not any of them could be prevailed upon to come on board. They were very ready, however, to part with any thing they had, and received whatever we offered them in exchange; but were more ſolicitous after iron, than any of our other articles of commerce; appearing to be no ſtrangers to the uſe of that valuable metal.</p>
                     <p>We were followed, by many of the canoes, to our anchoring-place; and a group, conſiſting of about ten or a dozen of them, continued along-ſide the Reſolution the greateſt part of the night.— Hence we flattered ourſelves, that we were ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably ſituated, as to be able to get all our wants ſupplied, and forget the delays and hardſhips we had experienced, in almoſt a conſtant ſucceſſion of adverſe winds and tempeſtuous weather, ever ſince we arrived upon this coaſt.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAVING happily found ſuch excellent ſhelter for our ſhips, in an inlet whoſe coaſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be inhabited by an inoffenſive race of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030274_0660_0FE571628DEE3538"/>
people, we loſt no time, after coming to anchor, in ſearching for a commodious harbour, where we might be ſtationed during our continuance in the Sound. Upon this ſervice, Captain Cook ſent three armed boats, under the command of Mr. King; and went himſelf, in a ſmall boat, on the ſame buſineſs. He had no difficulty in finding what he wanted; for, on the north-weſt of the arm, and at a ſmall diſtance from the ſhips, he found a convenient ſnug cove, perfectly adapted to our purpoſe. Mr. King was alſo ſucceſsful and found a ſtill better harbour, lying on the north-weſt ſide of the land. It would, however, have required more time to take the ſhips thither, than to the cove where the Captain had been; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his choice was determined in favour of the latter ſituation. But, apprehending that we could not tranſport our ſhips to it, and moor them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, before night had overtaken us, he thought it prudent to continue where we were till the next morning.</p>
                     <p>Plenty of canoes, filled with the inhabitants, were about the ſhips the whole day; and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal trade was commenced between us, which was conducted with the ſtricteſt harmony and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity on both ſides. Their articles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce where the ſkins of various animals; ſuch as bears, ſea-otters, wolves, foxes, deer, racoons, martins, and pole-cats. They alſo produced garments made of ſkins; and another kind of
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030274_0661_0FE57164713FE900"/>
cloathing, fabricated from the bark of a tree, or a plant reſembling hemp. Beſides theſe articles, they had bows, arrows, and ſpears; fiſh-hooks, and various kinds of inſtruments; wooden vizors repreſenting horrid figures; a ſort of woollen-ſtuff; carved work; beads; and red ochre; alſo ſeveral little ornaments of thin braſs and iron, reſembling an horſe-ſhoe, which they were pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant at their noſes. They had likewiſe ſeveral pieces of iron fixed to handles, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling chiſſels. From their being in poſſeſſion of theſe metals, it was natural for us to infer, that they muſt either have been viſited before by perſons of ſome civilized nation, or had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections with thoſe on their own continent, who had ſome communication with them.</p>
                     <p>Among all the articles, however, which they expoſed to ſale, the moſt extraordinary were hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſkulls, and hands, with ſome of the fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on them, which they acknowleged they had been feeding on; and ſome of them, indeed, bore evident marks of their having been upon the fire. From this circumſtance, it was but too apparent, that the horrid practice, of devouring their enemies, is practiſed here, as much as at New-Zealand, and other South-ſea iſlands. For the various articles they brought, they received in exchange, knives, chiſſels, nails, looking-glaſſes, buttons, pieces of iron and tin, or any kind of metal. They had not much inclination
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030274_0662_0FE5716A78F705E8"/>
for glaſs-beads, and rejected every kind of cloth.</p>
                     <p>The next day was employed in hauling our ſhips into the cove, where they were moored. We found, on heaving up the anchor, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great depth of water, that rocks were at the bottom. Theſe had greatly injured the cable, as well as the hauſers that were carried out to warp the ſhip into the cove, conſequently the whole bottom was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ewed with rocks. The ſhip was now become very leaky in her upper works: the carpenters were therefore ordered to caulk her, and to repair any other defects they might diſcover.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of this day (the 31ſt of March) the news of our arrival brought vaſt numbers of the natives about our ſhips. At one time we counted above a hundred canoes, each of which on an average, had five people on board; few containing leſs than three; many having ſeven, eight, or nine; and one was manned with ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. Many of theſe were new viſitors, which we diſcovered by their orations and ceremonies when they approached the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>If they, at firſt, had apprehended that we meant to be hoſtile, their fears were now removed; for they ventured on board the ſhips, and mixed with our people with the utmoſt freedom and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity. We diſcovered, however, by this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that they were as fond of pilfering as any
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030274_0663_0FE5716C146A1EB8"/>
we had met with during our voyage: and they were much more miſchievous than any of the other thieves we had found; for, having ſharp inſtruments in their poſſeſſion, they could, the inſtant that our backs were turned, cut a hook from a tackle, or a piece of iron from a rope.</p>
                     <p>Beſides other articles, we loſt ſeveral hooks in this manner, one of which weighed between twenty and thirty pounds. They ſtripped our boats of every morſel of iron that was worth tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, though ſome of our men were always left in them as a guard. They were, indeed, ſo dextrous in effecting their purpoſes, that one fellow would contrive to amuſe our people at one end of the boat, while another was forcing off the iron-work at the other. If an article that had been ſtolen, was immediately miſſed, the thief was eaſily detected, as they were fond of impeaching each other. But the prize was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reluctantly given up by the guilty perſon; and ſometimes compulſive means were obliged to be exerciſed for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Our ſhips being ſafely moored, we proceeded, the next day, to other neceſſary buſineſs. The obſervatories were taken aſhore, and placed upon a rock on one ſide of the cove, not far from the Reſolution. A party of men was ordered to cut wood, and clear a place for watering. Having plenty of pine-trees here, others were employed in brewing ſpruce-beer. The forge was alſo
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030274_0664_0FE5716D9BB70C08"/>
erected to make the neceſſary iron-work for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the fore-maſt, which had one of the bib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> defective, and was otherwiſe incomplete.</p>
                     <p>We were daily viſited by a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the natives; and, among them, we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſaw new faces. They had a ſingular mode of introducing themſelves on their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. They paddled, with their utmoſt ſtrength and activity, round both the ſhips; a chief, all this time, ſtanding up with a ſpear in his hand, and ſpeaking, or rather bawling, moſt vociferouſly.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the face of this orator was covered with a maſk, repreſenting either a human coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, or that of ſome other animal; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a ſpear, he had a kind of rattle in his hand. Having made this ceremonious circuit round the ſhip, they would come along-ſide, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to traffic with us. Frequently, indeed, they would firſt entertain us with a ſong, in which their whole company joined, and produced a very agreeable harmony. During theſe viſits, our principal care was to guard againſt their thievery.</p>
                     <p>We had, however, in the morning of the 4th of April, a very ſerious alarm. Our party, who were employed on ſhore in cutting wood and filling water, obſerved, that the natives, in all quarters, were arming themſelves in the beſt manner they were able; and that thoſe who had not proper weapons, were collecting ſticks and
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030274_0665_0FE5716F792CCB88"/>
ſtones. Hearing this, we thought it neceſſary to arm alſo: but, being reſolved to act upon the defenſive, the Commodore ordered all our work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to repair to the rock, on which our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatories had been placed, leaving the ſuppoſed enemy in poſſeſſion of the ground where they had aſſembled, which was within about a hundred yards of the Reſolution's ſtern.</p>
                     <p>Our danger, however, was only imaginary; for theſe hoſtile preparations were directed againſt a body of their own countrymen, who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to attack them. Our friends of the Sound, perceiving our apprehenſions, exerted their beſt endeavours to convince us that this was really the caſe. We ſaw they had people look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, on both ſides of the cove, and canoes were frequently diſpatched between them and the main body. The adverſe party, on board of about a dozen large canoes, at length drew up in line of battle, off the ſouth point of the cove, a negociation for the reſtoration of peace having been commenced. In conducting the treaty, ſeveral people in canoes paſſed between the two parties, and ſome debates enſued. At length the matter in diſpute appeared to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted: but the ſtrangers were not permitted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the ſhips, nor to have any intercourſe or dealings with us.</p>
                     <p>We were probably the occaſion of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; the ſtrangers, perhaps, inſiſting on having a
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030274_0666_0FE570FA51876570"/>
right of ſharing in the advantages of a trade with us; and our firſt friends reſolving to engroſs as entirely to themſelves. We were convinced of this on many other occaſions; nay, even among thoſe who lived in the Sound, the weaker were often obliged to ſubmit to the ſtronger party, and were plundered of every thing, without even at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to make any reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon we reſumed out work, and, the next day, rigged the fore-maſt; the head of which not being large enough for the cap, the carpenter was ordered to fill up the vacant ſpace. In examining the ſtate of the maſt-head for this purpoſe, both cheeks were diſcovered to be rotten; inſomuch that there was not a poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing them. We were therefore obliged to get the maſt out, and to ſupply it with new ones.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when almoſt ready for ſea, all our work was to be done over again, and an additional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair was neceſſary to be undertaken, which would require much time to be completed. It was, however, fortunate, that theſe defects ſhould be diſcovered, when we were ſo commodiouſly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as to be able to procure the materials that were requiſite. For, in the cove where our ſhips lay, there were ſome ſmall ſeaſoned trees, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adapted for our purpoſe; and two new cheeks were immediately made from one of theſe. In the morning of the 7th of April, having got the fore-maſt out, we hauled it aſhore, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:030274_0667_0FE57175D4640050"/>
were ſet to work upon it. Some of our lower ſtanding rigging being much decayed, the Commodore embraced the opportunity, while the fore-maſt was repairing, of ordering a new ſet of main-rigging, to be fitted, and the fore-rigging to be improved.</p>
                     <p>From our putting into the Sound, till the 7th of April, the weather had been remarkably fine; but, in the morning of the 8th, the wind blew freſh at ſouth-eaſt, accompanied with hazy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and rain; it increaſed in the afternoon, and in the evening it blew extremely hard. It came in heavy ſqualls, right into the cove, from over the high land on the oppoſite ſhore; and, though the ſhips were well moored, they were in a dangerous ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Though theſe tempeſtuous blaſts ſucceeded each other quickly they were of ſhort duration, and, in the intervals, we had a perfect calm. Another misfortune now befel us. On board the Reſolution, the mizen was the only maſt that now remained rigged, with its top-maſt up. The former was too defective to ſupport the latter dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſqualls, and gave way at the head, under the rigging. The gale abated about eight o'clock; but the rain continued, almoſt without intermſſion, for ſevral days, during which time, a tent was erected over the fore-maſt, that the carpenters might be enabled to proceed in their labours with ſome degree of convenience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="218" facs="unknown:030274_0668_0FE57177EB66CF30"/>The natives were not diſcouraged, by this bad weather, from making us daily viſits; and, in our ſituation, ſuch viſits were very acceptable to us. They frequently brought us a ſupply of fiſh, when we were unable to catch any with a hook and line, and we had not a convenient place to draw a net. The fiſh they brought us were ſmall cod, and a ſmall kind of bream, or ſardine. On the 11th the main-rigging was fixed and got ever head, notwithſtanding the rainy weather; and, the next day, we took down the mizen-maſt the head of which was ſo rotten, that it dropped off in the ſlings.</p>
                     <p>We received a viſit, in the evening from a tribe of natives whom we had not ſeen before; and who, in general, made a better appearance than our old friends. The Commodore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them into the cabin, but there was not an object that demanded their attention; all our novelties were looked on with indifference, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by a very few, who ſhewed a certain degree of curioſity. The next day, a party of our men went into the woods, and cut down a tree, of which a mizen-maſt was to be made. The day after it was conveyed to the place where the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters were at work upon the fore-maſt. The wind, in the evening, veered to the ſouth-eaſt, and blew a very hard gale, attended with rain, till eight o'clock the next morning; at which time it abated, and veered again to the weſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="unknown:030274_0669_0FE570FC41F8B320"/>The fore-maſt being now finiſhed we hauled it along ſide; but, on account of the bad weather, could not get it in till the afternoon. We were expeditious in rigging it, while the carpenters were employed on the mizen-maſt on ſhore. On the 16th, when they had made conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in it, they diſcovered that the tree on which they were at work, was wounded, owing, it was imagined, to ſome accident in cutting it down. It therefore became neceſſary to procure anothor tree out of the woods, on which occaſion, all hands were employed above half a day.</p>
                     <p>During theſe operations, many of the natives were about the ſhips, gazing on with an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſurprize, which, from their general inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we did not expect. A party of ſtrangers, in ſeven or eight canoes, came into the cove on the 18th, and after looking at us for ſome time, retired. We apprehended that our old friends, who, at this time, were more numerous about us than our new viſitors, would not ſuffer them to have any dealings with us. It was evident, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the neighbouring inhabitants engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us entirely to themſelves, and that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on a traffic with more diſtant tribes, in thoſe articles they had received from us; for they frequently diſappeared for four or five days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and returned with freſh cargoes of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and ſkins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="220" facs="unknown:030274_0670_0FE570FDC8E2FA88"/>Such of the natives as viſited us daily, were the moſt benificial to us; for, after diſpoſing of their trifles, they employed themſelvs in fiſhing, and we always partook of what they caught. We alſo procured from them a conſiderable quantity of good animal oil, which they brought to us in bladders. Some, indeed, attempted to cheat us, by mixing water with the oil; and once or twice, they ſo far impoſed upon us, as to fill their blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with water only. But, it was better for us to wink at theſe impoſitions, than ſuffer them to produce a quarel; for our articles of traffic chiefly conſiſted of trifles, and we found it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to produce a conſtant ſupply even of theſe. Beads, and ſuch like toys, of which we had ſome remaining, were not highly eſtimated. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal was principally demanded by our viſitors: and braſs had now ſupplanted iron, being ſought after, with ſuch eagerneſs, that, before we left the Sound, hardly a bit of it was to be found in the ſhips, except what conſtituted a part of our neceſſary inſtruments. Suits of cloaths were ſtripped of their buttons; bureaus of their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; kettles, caniſters, and candleſticks, all went to rack; ſo that our American friends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from us a greater variety of things, than any other nation we had viſited.</p>
                     <p>Having had a fortnight's bad weather, Sunday the 19th being a fair day, we embraced the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of getting up the top-maſts and yards,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:030274_0671_0FE571797386DB60"/>
and of fixing up the rigging. Moſt of our heavy work being now finiſhed, the Commodore ſet out the next morning to ſurvey the Sound; and, going firſt to the weſt point, he diſcovered a large vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and, before it, a very ſnug harbour, with from nine to four fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of this village, who were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, many of whom the Commodore was no ſtranger to, received him with great courteſy, every one preſſing him to enter his apartment; for ſeveral families have habitations under the ſame roof. He politely accepted the invitations, and the hoſpitable friends whom he viſited teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied every mark of civility and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Women were employed, in many of theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, in making dreſſes of the bark or plant already mentioned, and executed their buſineſs much like the inhabitants of New-Zealand. Others were buſy in opening ſardines; large ſhoals of which we have ſeen brought on ſhore, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out to ſeveral people, who carried them home, where they performed the operation of curing them, which is done by ſmoke-drying. They are hung upon ſmall rods; at firſt, about a foot over the fire; they are then removed higher and higher to make room for others. When dried they are cloſely packed in bales, and the bales covered with mats. Thus they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved till they are wanted, and they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant food. They alſo cure cod and other
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:030274_0672_0FE570FFA475A610"/>
large fiſh in the ſame manner; but theſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dried in the open air.</p>
                     <p>Leaving this village, the Commodore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded up the weſt ſide of the Sound. For near three miles he ſaw ſeveral ſmall iſlands, ſo ſituated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s to form ſome convenient harbours, the depths being from thirty to ſeven fathoms. About two leagues within the Sound, on the ſame ſide, an arm runs in the direction of north-north-weſt, and another in the ſame direction about two miles further.</p>
                     <p>About a mile above the ſecond arm, he found the ruins of a village. The framings of the houſes remained ſtanding, but the boards or roofs were taken away. Behind this deſerted village is a ſmall plain, covered with the largeſt pine trees that the Commodore had ever ſeen. This was indeed ſingular, as moſt of the elevated ground on this ſide of the Sound appeared rather naked.</p>
                     <p>Paſſing from this place to the eaſt ſide of the Sound, Captain Cook found, what he had before imagined, that it was an iſland under which the ſhips lay; and that many ſmaller ones lay ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the weſt ſide of it. Upon the main land, oppoſite the north end of our iſland, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore obſerved a village, and landed there; but he was not ſo politely received by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, as by thoſe of the other village he had viſited. This cold reception was occaſioned by one ſurly chief, who would not ſuffer the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030274_0673_0FE5717AFA31B480"/>
to enter their houſes, but followed him wherever he went; making expreſſive ſigns that he was impatient for him to be gone. Captain Cook attempted, but in vain, to ſooth him with preſents; for, though he did not refuſe them, he continued the ſame kind of behaviour. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this treatment from the inhoſpitable chief, ſome of the young women expeditiouſly apparelled themſelves in their beſt, aſſembled in a body, and gave us a hearty welcome to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, by joining in an agreeable ſong. Evening now drawing on, Captain Cook proceeded for the ſhips round the north-end of the iſland.</p>
                     <p>When he returned on board, he was informed that, in his abſence, ſome ſtrangers, in two or three large canoes, had made a viſit to the ſhips; from whom our people underſtood, by ſigns, that they had come from the ſouth-eaſt. They brought with them ſeveral garments, ſkins, and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which they bartered for ſome of ours. But the moſt remarkable circumſtance was, that two ſilver table-ſpoons were purchaſed of them by our people, which appered to be of Spaniſh manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture. They were worn round the neck of one of theſe viſitors, by way of ornament.</p>
                     <p>On the 21ſt, the mizen-maſt was got in and rigged, and the carpenters ordered to make a new fore-top maſt, to replace that which had been carried away. A number of ſtrangers viſited us about eight o'clock the next morning in twelve
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030274_0674_0FE5717FC0DA52A0"/>
or thirteen canoes. They came from the ſouth-ward; and when they had turned the point of the cove, they drew up in a body, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained about half an hour, at the diſtance of two hundred yards from the ſhips. We imagined, at firſt, they were afraid to approach; but in this we were miſtaken, for they were only making prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for an introductory ceremony.</p>
                     <p>At length they advanced towards the ſhips, all ſtanding up in their canoes, and began to ſing. Some of their ſongs were ſlow and ſolemn, in which they were joined by the whole body; others were in quicker time, and their notes were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly accompanied by the motions of their hands, their paddles beating in concert on the ſides of the canoes; and they, at the ſame time, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the moſt expreſſive geſtures. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſilent, for a few ſeconds, after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of each ſong, and then began again, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pronouncing the word <hi>hooee</hi> as a kind of chorus.</p>
                     <p>Having thus favoured us with a ſpecimen of their muſic, with which we were highly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for half an hour, they came nearer the ſhips and bartered with us. We now perceived that ſome of our old friends from the Sound were among them, who managed for the ſtrangers in the traffic between us and them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe viſitors being gone, the Captains Cook and Clerke went with two boats to the village at

the weſt point, where Captain Cook had been two days before, and had obſerved that plenty of graſs was to be had near it; and it was neceſſary to get a ſupply of this, for the few remaining goats and ſheep which were ſtill on board. They expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the ſame welcome reception that Captain Cook had met with before; and, ſoon after they were aſhore, the Commodore ordered ſome of his people to begin cutting; not imagining that the natives would object to our furniſhing ourſelves with what could not be of any uſe to them, though eſſentially neceſſary for us. In this, however, he was miſtaken, for as ſoon as our men began cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the graſs, ſome of the inhabitants would not permit them to proceed, ſaying, "<hi>makook,</hi>" which ſignified that we muſt buy it firſt.</p>
                     <p>The Commodore, at this time, was in one of he houſes; but, hearing of this, he repaired im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the field, where he found about a dozen claimants of different parts of the graſs that grew on the premiſes. The Commodore treated with them for it, and having complied with the terms of his purchaſe, thought we had now full liberty to cut wherever we pleaſed. Here he was again miſtaken; for he had ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally paid the firſt pretended proprietors, that freſh demands were made from others; ſo that it almoſt appeared that every ſingle blade of graſs had a ſeparate owner; and ſo many of them were to be ſatisfied, that his pockets, preſently became
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030274_0676_0FE57183D6F84B78"/>
empty. When they were, however, convinced that he had nothing more to give, they ceaſed to be importunate, and we were permitted to cut where we pleaſed, and as much as we pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>It is worthy of obſervation, that we never met with any uncivillized nation, or tribe, who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ſuch ſtrict notions of their having an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive property in the produce of their country, as the inhabitants of this Sound. They even wanted our people to pay for the wood and water that were carried on board. Had Captain Cook been preſent when theſe demands were made, he would doubtleſs have complied with them; but our workmen thought differently, and paid little or no attention to ſuch claims. The natives think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we were determined to pay nothing, at length ceaſed to apply. But they frequently took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to remind us, that their eſteem for us had induced them to make us a preſent of wood and water.</p>
                     <p>While they remained at this village, Mr. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who attended the two Captains, thither, made a drawing of every thing that was thought cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, both within doors and without. This he was well enabled to do, as he had an excellent opportunity of inſpecting narrowly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their buildings, their furniture; and implements or utenſils as well a the moſt ſtriking peculiarities of the modes of living of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Having, at length, completed all their
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030274_0677_0FE57185AF178EA8"/>
operation at this village, the natives and the two Captains took a friendly leave of each other, and we returned to the ſhips in the afternoon. The 23d, 24th, and 25th, of April were employed in preparing to put to ſea; the ſails were bent; the obſervatories and other articles removed from the ſhore; and both ſhips put into a proper condition for ſailing.</p>
                     <p>Thus prepared, we intended to have put to ſea on the morning of the 26th, but having both wind and tide againſt us, we were under a neceſſity of waiting till noon; when a calm ſucceeded the ſouth-weſt wind, and the tide, at the ſame time, turning in our favour, we towed the ſhips out of the cove. We had variable airs and calms till about four in the afternoon, when a breeze ſprung up, attended with thick hazy weather.</p>
                     <p>The mercury in the barometer ſunk uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly low, and we had every appearance of an approaching ſtorm from the ſouthward. In this ſituation Captain Cook heſitated, for a ſhort time, (as night was then approaching) whether he ſhould ſail immediately, or ſtay till the next morning. But his anxiety to proceed upon the voyage, and the fear of looſing ſo good an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of getting out of the Sound, opperated more ſtrongly upon his mind than the apprehenſions of danger, and he reſolved to put to ſea.</p>
                     <p>We were attended by the natives till we were almoſt out of the Sound; ſome in their canoes,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030274_0678_0FE571899B731D68"/>
and others on board the ſhips. One of the thiefs, who had particularly attached himſelf to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, was among the laſt who parted from us. The Commodore, a little time before he went, made him a ſmall preſent for which he received, in return, a beaver ſkin of a much ſuperier value. This occaſioned him to make ſome addition to his preſent, which pleaſed the chief ſo highly, that he preſented to the Commodore the beaver-ſkin cloak which he then wore, and of which he was particularly fond.</p>
                     <p>Struck with this inſtance of generoſity, and wiſhing him not to be a ſufferer by his gratitude, Captain Cook inſiſted upon his acceptance of a new broad-ſword, with a braſs hilt, with which he appeared greatly delighted. We were earneſtly importuned by the chief, and many of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, to pay them another viſit; who, by way of inducement, promiſed to procure a large ſtock of ſkins. Further particulars relative to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and its inhabitants, will furniſh materials for the two ſubſequent chapters.</p>

                     <p>KING George's Sound was the appellation given by the Commodore to this inlet, on our firſt arrival; but he was afterwards informed that the natives called it Nootka. The entrance is in the eaſt corner of Hope Bay; its latitude is 49° 33′ north, and its longitude 233° 12′ eaſt. The eaſt coaſt of that bay is covered by a chain of ſunken rocks; and, near the Sound, are ſome iſlands and rocks above water. We enter the Sound between two rocky points, lying eaſt ſouth-eaſt, and weſt north-weſt from each other, diſtant about four miles. The Sound widens within theſe
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030274_0680_0FE5718D05B0F090"/>
points, and extends in to the northward at leaſt four leagues.</p>
                     <p>A number of iſlands, of various ſize, appear in the middle of the Sound. The depth of water, not only in the middle of the Sound, but alſo cloſe to ſome parts of its ſhore, is from forty-ſeven to ninety fathoms, or more. Within its circuit, the harbours and anchoring-places are numerous. The cove, where our ſhips anchored, is on the eaſt ſide of the Sound, and alſo on the eaſt of the largeſt iſland. It is, indeed, covered from the ſea, which is its principal recommendation, for it is expoſed to the ſouth-eaſt winds, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blow with great violence, and make great devaſtation, as was but too apparent in many places.</p>
                     <p>Upon the ſea-coaſt the land is tolerably high and level; but, within the Sound, it riſes into ſteep hills, which have an uniform appearance, ending in roundiſh tops with ſharp ridges on their ſides. Many of theſe hills are high, and others are of a more moderate height; but all of them are covered to their tops with the thickeſt woods. Some bare ſpots are to be ſeen on the ſides of ſome of the hills, but they are not nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, though they ſufficiently ſhew the general rocky diſpoſition of theſe hills. They have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, no ſoil upon them, except what has been produced from rotten moſſes and trees, of the depth of about two feet. Their foundation are,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030274_0681_0FE5718EDC0508E0"/>
indeed, nothing more than ſtupendous rocks; which are of a grey or whitiſh caſt when, expoſed to the werther; but, when broken, are of a bluiſh grey colour. The rocky ſhore conſiſts entirely of this; and the beaches of the little coves in the Sound are compoſed of fragments of it.</p>
                     <p>During our ſtay the weather nearly correſponded with that which we had experienced when we were off the coaſt. We had fine clear weather, if the wind was between north and weſt; but if more to the ſouthward, hazy, accompanied with rain. The climate appears to be infinitely milder than that on the eaſt coaſt of America, under the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of latitude. We perceived no froſt in any of the low ground; but, on the contrary, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation proceeded very briſkly, for we ſaw graſs, at this time, upwards of a foot long.</p>
                     <p>The trees, of which the woods are principally compoſed, are the Canadian pine, white cypreſs, and two or three other ſorts of pine. The two firſt are in the greateſt abundance, and, at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, reſemble each other; though they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſtinguiſhed on a nearer view, the cypreſs being of a paler green than the other. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the trees grow here with great vigour, and are of a large ſize. At this early ſeaſon of the year, we ſaw but little variety of other vegetable productions.</p>
                     <p>About the rocks, and borders of the woods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſaw ſome ſtrawberry plants, and raſberry, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030274_0682_0FE5719258C5D3D0"/>
and gooſeberry buſhes, all in a flouriſhing ſtate. There were alſo a few black alder-trees; a ſpecies of ſow-thiſtle; ſome crow's-foot with a fine crimſon flower, and two ſorts of <hi>anthericum.</hi> We alſo met with ſome wild roſe-buſhes, juſt budding; ſome young leeks, a ſmall ſort of graſs, and ſome water-creſſes, beſides a great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>andromeda.</hi> Within the woods are two ſorts of underwood ſhrubs, unknown to us, and ſome moſſes and ſerns.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon of the year did not permit us to acquire much knowledge of the vegetable of this country; and it was impoſſible, from our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to learn much about its animals. The want of water induced us to enter the Sound at firſt; and the accidents that happened there, though they obliged us to ſtay longer than we intended, were unfavourable to our acquiring any knowledge of this kind. It was abſolutely neceſſary that every perſon ſhould be employed in forwarding the neceſſary buſineſs of the ſhips; which was the principal object, as the ſeaſon was advancing, and the ſucceſs of the voyage depended upon their diligence in performing their ſeveral taſks. Excurſions of any kind were, therefore, never attempted.</p>
                     <p>Lying in a cove, on an iſland, all the animals that we ſaw alive were two or three racoons, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, and ſquirrels; ſome of our people, indeed, who landed on the continent, on the ſouth-eaſt
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030274_0683_0FE57195010A9230"/>
ſide of the Sound, raw the prints of a bear's feet, not far from the ſhore. The only account, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we can furniſh of the quadrupeds, is taken from the ſkins which were purchaſed of the inhabitants; and theſe were ſometimes ſo muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the heads, tails, and paws, that we could not even gueſs to what animals they belonged; though others were either ſo perfect, or ſo well known, they did not admit of a doubt about them. The moſt common among them were bears, deer, foxes, and wolves. Bear-ſkins were very plentiful, generally of a ſhining black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but not very large. The deer ſkins were not ſo plentiful, and appeared to belong to what the hiſtorians of Carolina call the fallow-deer; though Mr. Pennant diſtinguiſhes it by the name of Virginian deer, and thinks it quite a different ſpecies from ours. Their foxes are numerous, and of ſeveral varietes; the ſkins of ſome being yellow, with a black tip at the tail; others, of a reddiſh yellow, intermixed with black; and others of an aſh colour, alſo intermixed with black.</p>
                     <p>When the ſkins were ſo mutilated as to admit of a doubt, our people applied the name of fox of wolf indiſcriminately. At length, we met with an entire wolf's ſkin, and it was grey. Here is the common martin, the pine martin, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a lighter brown colour. The ermine is alſo found in this country, but is ſmall, and not very common: its hair is not remarkably fine
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:030274_0684_0FE57196913F11D0"/>
though the animal is entirely white, except about an inch on the tip of the tail. The racoons and ſquirrels are ſuch as are common, but the latter is not ſo large as ours, and has a ruſty colour extending the length of the back.</p>
                     <p>We were ſufficiently clear reſpecting the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals already mentioned, but there were two others that we could not, with any certainty, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. One of them, we concluded to be the elk or mouſe deer; and the other was conjectured to be the wild cat or <hi>lynx.</hi> Hogs, dogs, and goats, have not yet made their appearance in this place. Nor have the natives any knowledge of our brown rats, to which they applied the name they gave to ſquirrels, when they ſaw them on board the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>The ſea animals near the coaſt, are whales, porpoiſes, and ſeals; the latter, from the ſkins we ſaw, ſeeming to be of the common ſort. The porpoiſes is the <hi>Phocena.</hi> Though the ſea otter is amphibious, we ſhall conſider him as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this claſs, as living principally in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We doubted, for ſome time, whether the ſkins, which the natives ſold us for otter ſkins, really belonged to that animal; but, a ſhort time before our departure, a whole one, juſt kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was purchaſed from ſome ſtrangers, of which Mr. Webber made a drawing. It was young, weighing only twenty-five pounds; was of a gloſſy black colour, but many of the hairs being
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:030274_0685_0FE571986E4F29E0"/>
tipt with white, gave it, at firſt ſight, a greyiſh caſt. The face, throat, and breaſt, were of a light brown, or yellowiſh white; and, in many of the ſkins, that colour extended the whole length of the belly. In each jaw it had ſix cutting teeth; two in the lower jaw being exceeding ſmall, and placed without, at the baſe of the two in the middle. In theſe reſpects, it differs from thoſe found by the Ruſſians, and alſo in the outer toes of the hind feet not being ſkirted with a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane. There alſo appeared a greater variety in colour, than is mentioned by thoſe who deſcribe the Ruſſian ſea otters. It is moſt probable, that theſe changes of colour naturally take place at the different gradations of life. The very young ones had brown coarſe hair, with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ittle fur un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath; but thoſe of the ſize of the animal juſt deſcribed, had a greater quantity of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. After they have attained their full growth, they loſe the black colour, which is ſucceeded by a deep brown. At that period, they have a greater quantity of fine fur, and very few long hairs. Some, which we ſuppoſed to be older, were a cheſnut brown; and we ſaw ſome few ſkins that were of a perfect yellow. The fur of theſe creatures is certainly finer than that of any other animal we know of; conſequently the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this part of North America, where ſo valuable an article of commerce is to be procured,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:030274_0686_0FE5719D6A581298"/>
ought certainly to be conſidered as a matter of ſome conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Birds are far from being numerous here, and thoſe that are to be ſeen are remarkably ſhy, ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perhaps, to their being continually harraſſed by the natives, either to eat them, or become poſſeſſed of their feathers to be worn as orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There are crows and ravens, not differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the leaſt, from thoſe in England; alſo a jay or magpie; the common wren, which is the only ſinging bird we heard; the Canadian thruſh; the brown eagle, with a white head and tail; a ſmall ſpecies of hawk; a heron, and the large-creſted American king-fiſher. There are alſo ſome that have not yet been mentioned by thoſe who have treated on natural hiſtory. The two firſt are <hi>ſpecies</hi> of wood peckers. One is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſmaller than a thruſh, of a black colour on the back, having white ſpots on the wings; the head, neck, and breaſt; of a crimſon colour, and the belly of a yellowiſh olive colour; whence it might with propriety, be called the yellow-bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied wood-pecker. The other is larger and more elegant; the back is of a duſky brown colour, richly waved with black; the belly has a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh caſt, with black ſpots; it has alſo a black ſpot on the breaſt, and the lower part of the wings and tail are of a ſcarlet colour; the upper part blackiſh. A crimſon ſtreak runs on each ſide, from the angle of the mouth, a little down
<pb facs="unknown:030274_0687_0FE570F281A7F728"/>
                        <figure>

the neck. The third and fourth are, one of th finch kind, not larger than a linnet, of a duſky colour, black head and neck, and white bill; and a ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piper, of a duſky brown colour, with a broad white band acroſs the wings, of the ſize of a ſmall pigeon. There are alſo humming birds, which differ, in ſome degree, from, the numerous ſorts already known of this delicate little animal.</p>
                     <p>The quebrantahueſſos, ſhags, and gulls, were ſeen off the coaſt; and the two laſt were alſo frequent in the Sound. There are two ſorts of wild ducks; one of which was black, with a white head; the other was white, and had a red bill, but of a larger ſize. Here are alſo the greater <hi>lumme,</hi> or diver, which are found in our northern countries. Some ſwans too, where once or twice ſeen flying to the northward, but we are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their haunts. On the ſhores we found another ſand-piper, about the ſize of a lark, and not unlike the burre: alſo a plover very much reſembling our common ſea-lark.</p>
                     <p>Though the variety of fiſh is not very great here, they are more plentiful in quantity than birds. The principal ſorts are the common herring, which are very numerous, though not exceeding ſeven inches in length; a ſmaller ſort, which, though larger than the anchovy, or ſardine, is of the ſame kind; a ſilver-coloured bream, and another of a gold brown colour, with narrow blue ſtripes. It is moſt probable that the herrings, and ſardines,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:030274_0689_0FE571A0791D1800"/>
had alſo pieces of rock cryſtal. The two firſt articles were probable to be obtained near the ſpot, as they had conſiderable quantities of them; but the latter, it may be ſuppoſed, came from a greater diſtance, or is extremely ſcarce; for our viſitors would not part with it without a very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration.</p>
                     <p>The ſtature of the natives is, in general, below the common ſtandard; but their perſons are not proportionably ſlender, being uſually pretty plump, thou not muſcular. Their ſoft fleſhineſs, however, ſeems never to ſwell into corpulence; and many of the older people are rather lean. Moſt of the natives have round full viſages, which are ſometimes broad, with high prominent cheeks. Above theſe, the face frequently appears fallen in quite acroſs between the temples; the noſe flattens at its baſe, has wide noſtrils, and a rounded point. The forehead is low, the eyes ſmall, black, and languiſhing; the mouth round, the lips thick, and the teeth regular and well ſet, but not remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their whiteneſs.</p>
                     <p>Some have no beards at all, and others only a ſmall thin one upon the point of the chin. This does not ariſe from an original deficiency of hair on that part, but from their plucking it out by the roots; for thoſe who do not deſtroy it, have not only conſiderable beards on every part of the chin, but alſo wiſkers, or muſtachias running from the upper lip to the lower jaw obliquely

downward<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a miſtaken notion though eſpouſed by eminent writers, that American Indians have no beards.

Their eye-brows are alſo ſcanty and narrow; but they have abundance of hair on the head, which is ſtrong, black, ſtraight, and lank. Their necks are ſhort, and their arms are rather clumſy, having nothing of beauty or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in their formation. The limbs, in all of them, are ſmall in proportion to the other parts; beſides, they are crooked and ill-formed, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing projecting ancles, and large feet aukwardly ſhaped. The latter defect ſeems to be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a great meaſure, by their ſitting ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on their hams or knees.</p>
                     <p>Their colour cannot be properly aſcertained, their bodies being incruſted with paint and naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs; though, when theſe have been carefully rubbed off, the ſkin was little inferior in white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to that of the Europeans; though of that paliſh caſt which diſtinguiſhes the inhabitants of our ſouthern nations. Some of them, when young, appear rather agreeable, when compared to the generality of the people; that period of life being attended with a peculiar degree of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but, after a certain age, the diſtinction is hardly obſervable; a remarkable ſameneſs cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizes every countenance, dulneſs and want of expreſſion being viſibly pourtrayed in every

viſage. The women, in general, are of the ſame ſize, colour, and form, with the men; nor is it eaſy to diſtinguiſh them, as they poſſeſs no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural feminine delicacies. Nor was there a ſingle one to be found, even among thoſe who were in their prime, who had the leaſt pretenſions to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Their dreſs, in common, is a flaxen kind of mantle, ornamented with a narrow ſtripe of fur on the upper edge, and fringes at the lower edge. Paſſing under the left arm, it is tied over the right ſhoulder, leaving both arms perfectly free. Sometimes the mantle is faſtened round the waiſt by a girdle of coarſe matting. Over this is worn a ſmall cloak of the ſame ſubſtance, reaching to the waiſt, alſo fringed at the bottom. They wear a cap like a truncated cone, or a flower-pot, made of very fine matting, ornamented with a round knob, or a bunch of leathern taſſels, having a ſtring paſſing under the chin, to prevent its blowing off.</p>
                     <p>The above dreſs is common to both ſexes, and the men often wear, over their other garments, the ſkin of ſome animal, as a bear, wolf, or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otter, with the hair outwards; ſometimes tying it before, and ſometimes behind, like a cloak. They throw a coarſe mat about their ſhoulders in rainy weather, and they have woollen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are but little uſed. They generally wear their hair hanging looſely down; but, thoſe

who have not a cap, tie it into a kind of bunch on the crown of the head.</p>
                     <p>Their dreſs is certainly convenient, and, were it kept clean, would not be inelegant; but, as they are continually rubbing their bodies ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> with a red paint, mixed with oil, their garments become greaſy, and contract a rancid offenſive ſmell. The appearance, indeed, of theſe people, is both wretched and filthy, and their heads and garments ſwarm with lice. So loſt are they to every idea of cleanlineſs, that we frequently ſaw them pick off theſe vermin, and eat them with the greateſt compoſure.</p>
                     <p>Their bodies, it has been obſerved, are always covered with red paint, but their faces are orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a variety of colours; a black, a brighter red, or a white colour; the laſt of theſe gives them a ghaſtly horrible appearance. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtrew the brown martial <hi>mica</hi> over the paint, which cauſes it to glitter. Many of their ears are perforated in the lobe, where they make a large hole, and two ſmaller ones higher up on the outer edge. In theſe holes are hung bits of bone, quills faſtened upon a leather thong, ſhells, bunches of taſſels, or thin pieces of copper. In ſome, the <hi>ſeptum</hi> of the noſe is alſo perforated, and a piece of cord drawn through it. Others wear, at the ſame place, pieces of copper, braſs, or iron, ſhaped ſomewhat like a horſe-ſhoe, the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row opening receiving the <hi>ſeptum,</hi> ſo that it may
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:030274_0694_0FE571AB17F095F8"/>
be pinched gently by the two points, and thus the ornament hangs over the upper lip. The rings of our buttons were eagerly purchaſed, and appropriated to this uſe. Their bracelets, which they wear about their wriſts, are bunches of white bugle beads, or thongs with taſſels, or a broad black horny ſhining ſubſtance. Round their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they frequently wear leathern thongs or the ſinews of animals curiouſly twiſted.</p>
                     <p>Such are the common dreſſes and ornaments, but they have ſome that are uſed only on extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occaſions, ſuch as going to war, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting themſelves to ſtrangers in ceremonial viſits. Amongſt theſe are the ſkins of wolves, or bears, tied on like their other garments, but edged with broad borders of fur, ingeniouſly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented with various figures. Theſe are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally worn ſeparately, or over their common clothing. The moſt uſual head-dreſs, on theſe occaſions, is a quantity of withe, wrapped about the head, with large feathers, particularly thoſe of eagles, ſtuck in it; or it is entirely covered with ſmall white feathers. At the ſame time the face is variously painted, the upper and lower parts being of oppoſite colours, and the ſtrokes having the appearance of freſh gaſhes; or it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with a kind of fat or tallow, mixed with paint, formed into a great variety of figures, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like carved work.</p>
                     <p>

Theſe conſiſt of a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of wooden maſks, applied to the face, fore head, or upper part of the head. Some of theſe viſors reſemble human faces, having hair, beards, and eye-brows; others repreſent the heads of birds, and many the heads of animals; ſuch as deer, wolves, porpoiſes, and others.</p>
                     <p>Theſe repreſentations generally exceed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſize, and they are frequently ſtrewed with pieces, of the foliaceous <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they even exceed this, and fix large pieces of carved work upon the head, projecting to a conſiderable diſtance, and reſembling the prow of a canoe. So much do they delight in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, that, for want of another maſk, we ſaw one of them thruſt his head into a tin-kettle which he had bought from us.</p>
                     <p>Whether theſe extravagant maſquerade orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are uſed on any religious occaſion, or in any kind of diverſion, or whether they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to intimidate by their monſtrous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or as decoys when hunting animals, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.

But, if travellers, in an ignorant and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous age, when more than marvellous things were ſuppoſed to exiſt, had ſeen ſeveral people decorated in this manner, and had not approached ſo near them as to be undeceived, they would have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have endeavoured to make others believe, that a race of beings exiſted, partaking of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man and beaſt.</p>
                     <p>Among the people of Nootka, one of the dreſſes ſeems peculiarly adapted to war. It is a thick tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned leathern mantle doubled, and appears to be the ſkin of an elk, or buffalo. This is faſtened on in the ordinary manner, and is ſo contrived as to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the breaſt quite up to the throat; part of it, at the ſame time, falling down to their heels. This garment is, ſometimes, very curiouſly painted, and is not only ſtrong enough to reſiſt arrows, but, as we underſtood from them, even ſpears cannot pierce it; ſo that it may be conſidered as their compleateſt defenſive armour. Sometimes they wear a ſort of leathern cloak, over which are rows of the hoofs of dear, placed horizontally, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with quills; which, on their moving, make a loud rattling noiſe. Whether this part of their garb is intended to ſtrike terror in war, or to be uſed on ceremonious occaſions, is uncertain; but we ſaw one of their muſical entertainments, which was conducted by a man habited in this manner, having a maſk on, and ſhaking his rattle.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o appearances of ferocity in their counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; but, as has been already obſerved, they ſeem to be of a quiet phlegmatic diſpoſition; deficient in animation and vivacity, to render themſelves agreeable in ſociety. They are rather reſerved than loquacious; but their gravity ſeems conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and not to ariſe from a conviction of its propriety, or to be the reſult of any particular mode of education; for, in their higheſt paroxyſms of rage, they have not heat of language, or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy or geſtures, to expreſs it ſufficiently.</p>
                     <p>The orations which they make on all public occaſions, are little more than ſhort ſentences, and ſometimes only ſingle words, forcibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in one tone of voice, accompanied with a ſingle geſture at every ſentence; at the ſame time jerking their whole body a little forward, with their knees bending, and their arms hanging down by their ſides.</p>
                     <p>From their exhibiting human ſkulls and bones to ſale, there is little reaſon to doubt of their treating their enemies with a degree of brutal cruelty; but, as this circumſtance rather marks a general agreement of character among almoſt every uncivilized tribe, in every age and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:030274_0698_0FE571B773CD1BC0"/>
they are not to be reproached with any charge of peculiar in humanity. Their diſpoſition, in this reſpect, we had not any reaſon to judge unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of. They appear to be docile, courteous, and good-natured; but they are quick in reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuries, notwithſtanding the predominancy of their phlegm; and, like all other paſſionate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as quickly forgetting them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe fits of paſſion never extended farther than the parties immediately concerned; the ſpectators never entering into the merits of the quarrel, whether it was with any of us, or among their own people; ſhewing as much indifference, as if they were wholly unacquainted with the whole tranſaction. It was common to ſee one of them rave and ſcold while all his agitation did not in the leaſt excite the attention of his countrymen, and when we could not diſcover the object of his diſpleaſure. They never betray the leaſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>imidity upon theſe occaſions, but ſeem reſolutely determined to puniſh the inſulter. With reſpect to ourſelves, they were under no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions about our ſuperiority; but if any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference aroſe, were as anxious to avenge the wrong, as if the cauſe of qurrel had been among themſelves,</p>
                     <p>Their other paſſions appear to lie dormant, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their curioſity. Few expreſſed any deſire or inclination to ſee or examine things with which they were unacquainted; and which, to a curious
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:030274_0699_0FE571B954D0DF68"/>
obſerver, would have appeared aſtoniſhing. If they could procure the articles they knew and wanted, they were perfectly ſatisfied; regarding every thing elſe with great indifference. Nor did our perſons, dreſs, and behaviour (though ſo very different from their own) or even the ſize and conſtruction of our ſhips, ſeem to command their admiration or attention.</p>
                     <p>Their indolence may, indeed, be a principal cauſe of this. But it muſt be admitted, that they are not wholly unſuſceptible of the tender paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which is evident from their being fond of muſic, and that too of the truly pathetic kind. Their ſongs are generally ſlow and ſolemn; but their muſic is leſs confined than that which is uſually found in other rude nations; the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being very numerous and expreſſive, and the melody powerfully ſoothing. Beſides their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certs, ſonnets were frequently ſung by ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers keeping time by ſtriking the hand againſt the thigh. Though ſolemnity was predominant in their muſic, they ſometimes entertained us in a gay and lively ſtrain, and even with a degree of pleaſantry and humour.</p>
                     <p>A rattle and a ſmall whiſtle, are the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of muſic which we have ſeen among them. The rattle is uſed when they ſing; but upon what occaſions the whiſtle is uſed, we never knew, unleſs it be when they aſſume the figures of particular animals, and endeavour to imitate
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:030274_0700_0FE571C01F1A0170"/>
their howl, or cry. We once ſaw one of theſe people dreſſed in the ſkin of a wolf with the head covering his own, ſtriving to imitate that animal, by making a ſqueaking noiſe with a whiſtle he had in his mouth. The rattles are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in the ſhape of a bird, with ſmall pebbles in the belly, and the tail is the handle. They have another ſort, which reſembles a child's rattle.</p>
                     <p>Some of them diſplayed a diſpoſition to kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and, in trafficking with us, took away our goods without making any return. But of this we had few inſtances, and we had abundant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to approve the fairneſs of their conduct. Their eagerneſs, however, to poſſeſs iron, braſs, or any kind of metal, was ſo great, that, when an opportunity preſented itſelf, few of them could reſiſt the temptation to ſteal it. The natives of the South-ſea iſlands, as appears in many inſtances would ſteal any thing they could find, without conſidering whether it was uſeful to them or not. The novelty of the object, was a ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement for them to get poſſeſſion of it by any means. They were rather actuated by a childiſh curioſity, than by a thieviſh diſpoſition. The inhabitants of Nootka, who made free with our property, are entitled to no ſuch apology. The appellation of thief is certainly due to them; for they knew that what they pilfered from us, might be converted to the purpoſes of private utility;
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:030274_0701_0FE571C1E4981678"/>
and according to their eſtimation of things, was really valuable. Luckily for us, they ſet no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon any of our articles, except the metals. Linens, and many other things were ſecure from their depredations, and we could ſafely leave them hanging out all night aſhore, without being watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The principle which prompted theſe people to pilfer from us, would probably operate in their intercourſe with each other. We had, indeed, abundant reaſon to believe, that ſtealing is very common among the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

A pretty exact computation of the number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in both, might be made from the canoes that viſited our ſhips, the ſecond day after our arrival. They conſiſted of about a hundred, which upon an average, contained at leaſt five perſons each. But, as there were very few women, old men, children, or youths, then among them, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the number of the inhabitants of the two villages could not be

leſs than four times the number of our viſitors; beeing two thouſand in the whole.</p>
                     <p>The village which is ſituated at the entrance of the Sound, ſtands on the ſide of a pretty ſteep aſcent, extending from the beach to the wood. The houſes conſiſt of three ranges or rows, placed at almoſt equal diſtances behind each other, the front row being the largeſt; and there are a few ſtraggling houſes at each end. Theſe rows are interſected by narrow paths, or lanes, at irregular diſtances, paſſing upward; but thoſe between the houſes are conſiderably broader. Though this general diſpoſition has ſome appearance of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, there is none in the reſpective houſes; for every diviſion made by the paths, may either be conſidered as one or more houſes; there being no regular ſeparation to diſtinguiſh them by, either within or without. Theſe erections conſiſt of very long broad planks, reſting upon the edges of each other, tied, in different parts, with withes of pine-bark. They have only ſlender poſts on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, at conſiderable diſtances from each other, to which they are alſo faſtened; but there are ſome larger poles within, placed aſlant. The ſides and ends of theſe habitations are about ſeven or eight feet in height, but the back part is ſomewhat higher. The planks, therefore, which compoſe the roof, ſlant forward, and, being looſe, may be moved at pleaſure. They may either be put cloſe
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:030274_0705_0FE571C9C596C940"/>
to exclude the rain, or ſeparated to admit the light in fine weather.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, however, they are moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dwellings, and diſplay very little attention or ingenuity in their conſtruction: for, though the ſide-planks are pretty cloſe to each other in ſome places, they are quite open in others. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, theſe habitations have no regular doors, and can only be entered by a hole, which the unequal length of the planks has accidentally made. In the ſides of the houſe they have alſo holes to look out at, ſerving for windows; but theſe are very irregularly diſpoſed, without attending, in the leaſt, to the ſhape and ſize of them.</p>
                     <p>Within the habitations, we have frequently a view from one end to the other of theſe ranges of building; for, though there are ſome appearances of ſeparations on each ſide, for the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of different perſons or families, they do not intercept the ſight; and generally conſiſt of pieces of plank, extending from the ſide to the middle of the houſe. On the ſides of each of theſe parts is a little bench, about five or ſix inches higher than the reſt of the floor, covered with mats, whereon the family ſit and ſleep. The length of theſe benches is generally ſeven or eight feet, and the breadth four or five. The fire-place, which has neither hearth nor chimney, is in the middle of the floor. One houſe in particular, was nearly ſeparated from the reſt by a cloſe partition; and
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:030274_0706_0FE571CBEF9263F8"/>
this was the moſt regular building of any we had ſeen. In it there were four of theſe benches, each holding a ſingle family at the corner; but it had not any ſeparation by boards, and the middle of the houſe ſeemed to be common to all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
                     <p>The furniture of their houſes conſiſts princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of cheſts and boxes of various ſizes, piled upon each other, at the ſides or ends of the houſe; in which are depoſited their garments, ſkins, maſks, and other articles that are deemed valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Many of them are double, or the upper one ſerves as a lid to the other: ſome have a lid faſtened with thongs; others that are very large, have a ſquare hole cut in the upper part, for the convenience of putting things in, or taking them out. They are frequently painted black, ſtudded with the teeth of animals, or rudely carved with figures of birds, &amp;c. as decorations. They have alſo ſquare and oblong pails; round wooden cups and bowls; wooden troughs, of about two feet in length, out of which they eat their food; bags of matting, baſkets of twigs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Their implements for fiſhing, and other things, are hung up, or ſcattered in different parts of the houſe, without any kind of order, making, in the whole, a perfect ſcene of confuſion; except on the ſleeping benches, which have nothing on them but the mats, which are of a ſuperior quality to
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:030274_0707_0FE571CD7662E5B8"/>
thoſe that they uſually have to ſit on in their boats.</p>
                     <p>The irregularity and confuſion of their houſes is, however, far exceeded by their naſtineſs and ſtench. They not only dry their fiſh within doors, but they alſo gut them there; which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their bones und fragments thrown upon the ground at meals, occaſions ſeveral heaps of filth, which are never removed, till it becomes troubleſome, from their bulk, to paſs over them. Every thing about the houſe ſtinks of train-oil, fiſh, and ſmoke; and every part of it is as filthy as can be imagined,</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this filth and confuſion, many of theſe houſes are decorated with images; which are nothing more than the trunks of large trees, of the height of four or five feet, placed at the upper end of the apartment, with a human face carved on the front, and the hands and arms upon the ſides. Theſe figures too are variouſly painted, and make, upon the whole, a moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous appearance. Theſe images are generally called <hi>Klumma;</hi> but the names of two particular ones, ſtanding abreaſt of each other, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about three or four feet, were <hi>Natchkoa</hi> and <hi>Matſeeta.</hi> A ſort of curtain, made of mat, uſually hung before them, which the natives were ſometimes unwilling to remove: and when they did conſent to unveil them, they ſeemed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves in a very myſterious manner. It
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:030274_0708_0FE571CF53835898"/>
ſeems probable that they ſometimes make offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to them; for, if we rightly interpreted their ſigns, they requeſted us to give ſomething to theſe images, when they drew the mats from before them.</p>
                     <p>From theſe circumſtances, it was natural for us to ſuppoſe that they were repreſentatives of their gods, or ſome ſuperſtitious ſymbols; and yet they were held in no very extraordinary degree of eſtimation, for, with a ſmall quantity of braſs, or iron, any perſon might have purchaſed all the gods in the place.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Webber, in drawing a view of the inſide of a Nootka houſe, wherein theſe figures are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, was interrupted, and hindered from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, by one of the inhabitants. Thinking a bribe would have a proper effect upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Mr. Webber made him an offer of a button from his coat, which, being metal, immediately operated as it was intended, and he was at liberty to proceed as before. But ſoon after he had made a beginning, he was again interrupted by the ſame man, who held a mat before the figures. He therefore gave him another button, and was ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to proceed. He then renewed his former practice, till Mr. Webber had parted with every ſingle button; and then permitted him to proceed without any farther obſtruction.</p>

The women alſo go in the ſmall canoes, to gather muſcles and other ſhell-fiſh. They are as dexterous as the men in the management of theſe canoes; and when there are men in the canoes with them, they are paid very little attention to on account of their ſex, none of the men offering to relieve them from the labour of the paddle. Nor do they ſhew them any particular reſpect or tenderneſs on other occaſions.</p>
                     <p>The young men are remarkably indolent; being generally ſitting about, in ſcattered companies, baſking themſelves in the ſun, or wallowing in the ſand upon the beach, like ſo many hogs, without any kind of covering. This diſregard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency was, however, confined ſolely to the men. The women were always decently cloathed, and behaved with great propriety; juſtly meriting all commendation for a modeſt baſhfulneſs, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their ſex. In them it is the more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, as the men have not even a ſenſe of ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Beſides ſeeing ſomething of their domeſtic life and employments, we were enabled to form ſome judgment of their diſpoſition, and method of living, from the frequent viſits received from
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:030274_0710_0FE571D692A24380"/>
them at our ſhips, in the canoes; in which we underſtood they paſs much of their time, eſpecially in the ſummer: for they not only eat and ſleep frequently in them, but lie and baſk themſelves in the ſun, as we had ſeen them at their villiage. Their large canoes are, indeed, ſufficiently ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for that purpoſe; and are, except in rainy weather, more comfortable habitations than their filthy houſes.</p>
                     <p>Their greateſt reliance for food ſeems to be upon the ſea, as affording fiſh, and ſea-animals. The principal of the firſt are herrings and ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, two ſpecies of bream, and ſome ſmall cod. The herrings and ſardines not only ſerve to be eaten freſh in their ſeaſon, but to be dried and ſmoked as ſtores. The herrings alſo afford them another grand reſource for food; which is a vaſt quantity of roe, prepared in a very extraordinary manner. It is ſtrewed upon ſmall branches of the Canadian pine. It is alſo prepared upon a long ſea-graſs, which is found, in great plenty, upon the rocks under water. This <hi>caviare</hi> is preſerved in baſkets of mat, and uſed occaſionally, after being dipped in water. It has no diſagreeable taſte, and ſerves theſe people as a kind of winter bread. They alſo eat the roe of ſome other large fiſh, that has a very rancid ſmell and taſte.</p>
                     <p>The large muſcle is an eſſential article of their food, which is found in great abundance in the Sound. After roaſting them in their ſhells, they
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:030274_0711_0FE571D8188D6298"/>
are ſtuck upon long wooden ſkewers, and taken off as they are wanted to be eaten, as they require no further preparation, though they are ſometimes dipped in oil, as a ſauce. The ſmaller ſhell-fiſh contribute to increaſe the general ſtock, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as a material article of their food.</p>
                     <p>The porpoiſe is more common among them as food than any of the ſea-animals; the fleſh and rind of which they cut in large pieces, dry them as they do herrings, and eat them without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparation. They have alſo a very ſingular manner of preparing a ſort of broth from this animal, when in its freſh ſtate. They put ſome pieces of it in a wooden veſſel or pail, in which there is al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>me water, and throw heated ſtones into it. This operation is repeatedly performed till the contents are ſuppoſed to be ſufficiently ſtewed. The freſh ſtones are put in, and the others taken out, with a cleft ſtick, ſerving as a pair of tongs; the veſſel being, for that purpoſe, always placed near the fire. This is a common diſh among them, and ſeems to be a very ſtrong nouriſhing food. From theſe, and other ſea-animals they procure oil in great abundance, which they uſed upon many occaſions, mixed with other food, as ſauce, and frequently ſip it alone with a kind of ſcoop made of horn.</p>
                     <p>They probably feed upon other ſea-animals, ſuch as whales, ſeals, and ſea-otters; the ſkins of
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:030274_0712_0FE548BBC4FF4FE8"/>
the two latter being common amongſt them: and they are furniſhed with implements of all ſorts for the deſtruction of theſe different animals, though perhaps they may not be able, at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to catch them in great plenty. No great number of freſh ſkins were to be ſeen while we lay in the Sound.</p>
                     <p>The land-animals, at this time, appeared alſo to be ſcarce, as we ſaw no fleſh belonging to any of them; and, though their ſkins were to be had in plenty, they might, perhaps, have been procured by traffic from other tribes. It plainly appears, therefore, from a variety of circumſtances, that theſe people are furniſhed with the principal part of their animal food by the ſea; if we except a few gulls, and ſome other birds, which they ſhoot with their arrows.</p>
                     <p>Their only winter vegetables ſeem to be the Canadian pine-branches, and ſea-graſs; but, as the ſpring advances, they uſe others as they come in ſeaſon. The moſt common of theſe were two ſorts of liliaceous roots, of a mild ſweetiſh taſte, which are mucilaginous and eaten raw. The next is a root called <hi>aheitu,</hi> and has a taſte reſembling liquorice. Another ſmall, ſweetiſh root, about the thickneſs of <hi>ſarſaparilla,</hi> is alſo eaten raw. As the ſeaſon advances, they have doubtleſs many others which we did not ſee. For though there is not the leaſt appearance of cultivation among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are plenty of alder, gooſeberry, and
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:030274_0713_0FE571E1929F5198"/>
currant buſhes. One of the conditions, however, which they ſeem to require in all food, is, that it ſhould be of the leſs acrid kind; for they would not touch the leek or garlic, though they ſold us vaſt quantities of it, when they underſtood we liked it. They ſeemed, indeed, not to reliſh any of our food and rejected our ſpirituous liquors as ſomething diguſting and unnatural.</p>
                     <p>Small marine animals, in their freſh ſtate, are ſometimes eaten raw; though it is their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practice to roaſt or broil their food; for they are abſolute ſtrangers to our method of boiling, as appears from their manner of preparing por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe broth; beſides, as they have only wooden veſſels, it is impoſſible for them to perform ſuch an operation. Their manner of eating correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds with the naſtineſs of their houſes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for the platters and troughs, out of which they eat their food, ſeem never to have been waſhed ſince their original formation; the dirty remains of a formal meal, being only ſwept away by a ſucceeding one. Every thing ſolid and tough, they tear to pieces with their hands and teeth; for though their knives are employed in cutting off the larger portion, they have not yet endeavoured to reduce theſe to mouthfuls by the ſame means, though ſo much more cleanly and convenient. But they do not poſſeſs even an idea of cleanlineſs, and conſtantly eat the roots which are dug from the ground, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:030274_0714_0FE571E446704CD8"/>
to ſhake off the ſoil that adheres to them.</p>
                     <p>Whether they have any ſet time for meals, we never certainly knew; having ſeen them eat at all hours in their canoes. But having ſeen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral meſſes of porpoiſe broth preparing about noon, when we went to the village, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably make a principal meal about that time.</p>
                     <p>They have bows and arrows, ſpears, ſlings, ſhort truncheons made of bone, and a ſmall pick-axe, ſomewhat reſembling the common American tomahawk. Some of the arrows are pointed with iron, and others with indented bone; the ſpear has uſually a long point made of bone. The tomahawk is a ſtone of the length of ſeven or eight inches; one end terminating in a point, and the other fixed into a wooden handle. This handle is intended to reſemble the head and neck of a human figure; the ſtone being fixed in the mouth ſo as to repreſent a tongue of great magnitude. To heighten the reſemblance, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hair is alſo fixed to it. This weapon is called <hi>taaweeſh;</hi> and they have another wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon made of ſtone, which they call <hi>ſeeaik,</hi> about ten or twelve inches long, having a ſquare point.</p>
                     <p>It may be reaſonably concluded that they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently engage in cloſe combat, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their ſtone and other weapons; and we had very diſagreeable proofs of their wars being both
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:030274_0715_0FE571E5CE838F98"/>
frequent and bloody, from the quantity of human ſkulls that were offered us to ſale.</p>
                     <p>The deſign and execution of their manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and mechanic arts, are more extenſive and ingenious than could poſſibly have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the natural diſpoſition of the people, and what little progreſs they had made in civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization. The flaxen and woollen garments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their firſt care, as being the moſt material of thoſe that may be claſſed under the head of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures. The former are fabricated from the bark of the pine-tree, beat into a maſs reſembling hemp. After being prepared in a proper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is ſpread upon a ſtick, which is faſtened to two others in an erect poſition. The manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturer, who ſits on her hams at this ſimple machine, knots it acroſs, at the diſtance of about half an inch from each other, with ſmall plaited threads. Though it cannot, by this method, be rendered ſo cloſe and firm as cloth that is woven, it is ſufficiently impervious to the air, and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſofter and more pliable.</p>
                     <p>Though their woollen garments are probably manufactured in the ſame manner, they have much the appearance of a woven cloth; but, the ſuppoſition of their being wrought in a loom is deſtroyed, by the various figures that are inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly inſerted in them; it being very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that theſe people ſhould be able to produce ſuch a complex work, except immediately by
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:030274_0716_0FE571E7A5BCD7C8"/>
their hands. They are of different qualities; ſome reſembling our courſeſt ſort of blankets; and others not much inferior to our fineſt ſort, and certainly both warmer and ſofter.</p>
                     <p>The wool, of which they are manufactured, ſeems to be produced by different animals, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the fox and brown lynx; that from the lynx is the fineſt, and nearly reſembles our coarſer wools in colour; but the hair, which alſo grows upon the animal, being intermixed with it, the appearance of it is ſomewhat different when wrought. The ornamental figures in theſe gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are diſpoſed with great taſte, and are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a different colour, being uſually dyed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a deep brown or a yellow; the latter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hich, when new, equals in brightneſs the beſt in our carpets.</p>
                     <p>Their fondneſs for carving on all their wooden articles, correſponds with their taſte in working fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>res upon their garments. Nothing is to be ſeen without a kind of freeze-work, or a repreſentation of ſome animal upon it; but the moſt general figure is that of the human face, which is frequently cut out upon birds, and the other monſtrous things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, and even upon their weapons of bone and ſtone.</p>
                     <p>The general deſign of theſe figures conveys a ſufficient knowledge of the objects they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repreſent; though, in the carving, very little dexterity is diſplayed. But, in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ion of many of the maſks and heads, they have
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:030274_0717_0FE571ED05657070"/>
ſhewn themſelves ingenious ſculptors. They preſerve, with the greateſt exactneſs, the general character of their own faces, and finiſh the more minute parts with great accuracy and neatneſs. That theſe people have a ſtrong propenſity to works of this ſort, is obſervable in a variety of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Repreſentations of human figures; birds; beaſts; fiſh; models of their canoes, and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold utenſils, we found among them in very great abundance.</p>
                     <p>Having mentioned their ſkill in ſome of the imitative arts, ſuch as working figures in their garments, and engraving, or carving them in wood; we may alſo add their drawing them in colours. The whole proceſs of their whale fiſhery has been repreſented, in this manner, on the caps they wear. This indeed, was rudely executed, but ſerved, at leaſt, to convince us, that, though they have not the knowledge of letters amongſt them, they have a notion of repreſenting actions, in a laſting way, excluſive of recording them in their ſongs and traditions. They have alſo other painted figures, which, perhaps, have no eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſignifications, and are only the creation of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or caprice.</p>
                     <p>Though the ſtructure of their canoes is ſimple, they appear well calculated for every uſeful purpoſe. The largeſt, which contains upwards of twenty people, are formed of a ſingle tree. The length of many of them is forty feet, the breadth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the depth three. They become gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:030274_0718_0FE571EEE99BF270"/>
narrower from the middle towards each end, the ſtern ending perpendicularly, with a knob at the top. The fore-part ſtretches for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and upwards, and ends in a point or prow, much higher than the ſides of the canoe, which are nearly ſtraight. The greateſt part of them are without any ornament; ſome have a little carving, and are ſtudded with ſeals' teeth on the ſurface. Some have alſo a kind of additional prow, uſually painted with the figure of ſome animal. They have neither ſeats nor any other ſupporters, on the inſide, except ſome ſmall round ſticks, about the ſize of a walking cane, placed acroſs, about half the depth of the canoe. They are very light and, on account of their breadth and flatneſs, ſwim firmly, without an out-rigger, of which they are all deſtitute. Their paddles, which are ſmall and light, reſembles a large leaf in ſhape, being pointed at the bottom, broad in the middle, and gradually becoming narrower in the ſhaft; the whole length being about five feet. By conſtant uſe, they have acquired great dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the management of theſe paddles; but they never make uſe of any ſails.</p>
                     <p>For fiſhing and hunting, their inſtruments are ingeniouſly contrived, and completely made. They conſiſt of nets, hooks, and lines, harpoons, gigs, and an inſtrument reſembling an oar. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is about twenty feet in length, four or five inches in breadth, and of the thickneſs of half an
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:030274_0719_0FE571F0B8B6E7D8"/>
inch. The edges, for about two-thirds of its length, are ſet with ſharp bone-teeth, about two inches in length; the other third ſerving for a handle. With this inſtrument they attack her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and ſardines, and ſuch other fiſh as come in ſhoals. it is ſtruck into the ſhoal, and the fiſh are taken either upon, or between the teeth. Their hooks, which are made of bone and wood, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play no great ingenuity; but the harpoon, which is uſed in ſtriking whales, and other ſea-animals, manifeſts a great extent of contrivance. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a piece of bone, formed into two barbs, in which the oval blade of a large muſcle-ſhell, and the point of the inſtrument, is fixed. Two or three fathoms of rope is faſtened to this harpoon, and in throwing it, they uſe a ſhaft of about fifteen feet long, to which the rope is faſtened; to one end of which the harpoon is fixed ſo as to leave the ſhaft floating, as a buoy upon the water, when the animal is ſtruck with the harpoon.</p>
                     <p>We are ſtrangers to the manner of their catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or killing land animals, but, it is probable, that they ſhoot the ſmaller ſorts with their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; and encounter bears, wolves, and foxes, with their ſpears. They have ſeveral ſorts of nets, which are perhaps applied to that purpoſe; it being cuſtomary for them to throw them over their heads, to ſignify their uſe, when they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them for ſail. Sometimes they decoy ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals by diſguiſing themſelves with a ſkin, and
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:030274_0720_0FE571F24479F348"/>
running upon all fours, in which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably nimble; making, at the ſame time, a kind of noiſe, or neighing. The maſks, or carved heads as well as the dried heads of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent animals, are uſed upon theſe occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Every thing of the rope kind which they uſe in making their various articles, is formed either from thongs of ſkins, and ſinews of animals, or from the flaxen ſubſtance, of which they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture their mantles. The ſinews were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo remarkably long, that it was hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they could have belonged to any other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal than the whale. The ſame conjecture may be hazarded with regard to the bones, of which they make their inſtruments and weapons.</p>
                     <p>The aſſiſtance they receive from iron-tools, contributes to their dexterity in wooden per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. Their implements are almoſt wholly made of iron; at leaſt, we ſaw but one cheſſel that was not made of that metal, and that was only of bone. The knife and the cheſſel are the principal forms that iron aſſumes amongſt them. The chiſſel conſiſts of a flat long piece, faſtened into a wooden handle. A ſtone is their mallet, and a bit of fiſh-ſkin their poliſher. Some of theſe chiſſels were nine or ten inches in length, and three or four in breadth; but they were, in general, conſiderably ſmaller.</p>
                     <p>Some of their knives are very large, and their blades are crooked; the edge being on the back
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:030274_0721_0FE5720706C43168"/>
or convex part. What we have ſeen among them, were about the breadth and thickneſs of an iron-hop; and their ſingular form ſufficiently proves that they are not of European make. Theſe iron-tools are ſharpened upon a coarſe ſlate whetſtone, and the whole inſtrument is kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bright.</p>
                     <p>Iron is called by the natives <hi>ſeekemaile,</hi> a name which they alſo give to tin, and other white metals. It being ſo common among theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we were anxious to diſcover how it could be conveyed to them. As ſoon as we arrived in the Sound we perceived that they had a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of traffic and an inclination to purſue it; and we were afterwards convinced that they had not acquired this knowledge from a curſory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with any ſtrangers, but it ſeemed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual to them and was a practice in which they were well ſkilled.</p>
                     <p>With whom they carry on this traffic, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcertain; for, though we ſaw ſeveral articles of European manufacture, or ſuch, at leaſt, as had been derived from ſome civilized nation, ſuch as braſs and iron, it does not certainly follow that they were received immediately from theſe nations. For we never could obtain the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of their having ſeen ſhips, like ours, before, nor of their having been engaged in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with ſuch people. Many circumſtances corroborate to prove this beyond a doubt. On
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:030274_0722_0FE5720971019010"/>
our arrival, they were earneſt in their enquiries, whether we meant to ſettle amongſt them, and whether we were friendly viſitors; informing us, at the ſame time, that they freely gave us wood and water from motives of friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>This ſufficiently proves, that they conſidered themſelves as proprietors of the place, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſuperiority: for it would have been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural enquiry, if any ſhips had been here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had ſupplied themſelves with wood and water, and then departed; for they might then reaſonably expect that we ſhould do the ſame. It muſt be admitted, indeed, that they exhibited no marks of ſurprize at beholding our ſhips; but this may, with great propriety, be attributed to their natural indolence of temper, and their want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thirſt of curioſity. They were never ſtartled at the report of a muſquet, till they, one day, ſhewed us that their hide-dreſſes were impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable to their ſpears and arrows; when one of our people ſhot a muſquet ball through one of them that had been ſix times folded. Their aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at this, plainly indicated their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the effect of fire-arms. This was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very frequently confirmed, when we uſed them to ſhoot birds, at which they appeared greatly confounded. And our explanation of the piece, together with the nature of its operation, with the aid of ſhot and ball, ſtruck them ſo
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:030274_0723_0FE5720B505E75D0"/>
forcibly, as to convince us of their having no previous ideas on this matter.</p>
                     <p>Though ſome account of a voyage to this coaſt, by the Spaniards, in 1774, or 1775, had arrived in England before we ſailed, the circumſtances juſt mentioned ſufficiently prove, that theſe ſhips had never been at Nootka<note n="*" place="bottom">It has ſince appeared, that they were not within two degrees of Nootka, and probably the inhabitants of that place never heard of theſe Spaniſh ſhips.</note>. It was alſo evident, that iron would not have been in ſo many hands, nor would the uſe of it have been ſo well known, if they had ſo lately obtained the firſt knowledge of it.</p>
                     <p>From their general uſe of this metal, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably comes from ſome conſtant ſource, in the way of traffic, and they have perhaps been long ſupplied with it; for they uſe their tools with as much dexterity as the longeſt practice can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. The moſt natural conjecture, therefore, is, that they trade for their iron with other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian tribes, who may have ſome communication with European ſettlements upon that continent, or receive it through ſeveral intermediate nations. By the ſame means they probably obtain their braſs and copper.</p>
                     <p>Not only the rude materials, but ſome manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured articles ſeem to find their way hither. The braſs ornaments for noſes are made in ſo maſterly a manner, that the Indians cannot be
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:030274_0724_0FE5720CD8548400"/>
ſuppoſed capable of fabricating them. We are certain, that the materials are European, as all the American tribes are ignorant of the method of making braſs; though copper has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently met with, and, from its ductility, might eaſily be faſhioned into any ſhape, and poliſhed. If ſuch articles are not uſed by our traders to Hudſon's Bay and Canada, in their traffic with the natives, they muſt have been introduced at Nootka from Mexico; whence, it is probable, the two ſilver table ſpoons were originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
                     <p>Little knowledge can we be ſuppoſed to have acquired of the political and religious inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions eſtabliſhed among theſe people. We diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, however, that there were ſuch men as chiefs, diſtinguiſhed by the title of <hi>Acweek,</hi> to whom the others are, in ſome degree, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

This, however is all conjecture, for we could receive no information concerning them; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little more of their language than to enable us to aſk the names of things, and being inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of holding any converſation with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, relative to their traditions, or their inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have already mentioned, that we put to ſea, in the evening of the 26th of April, with manifeſt indications of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtorm; and theſe ſigns did not deceive us. We had ſcarce ſailed out of the ſound, when the
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:030274_0727_0FE57216C81C85D8"/>
wind ſhifted from north-eaſt to ſouth-eaſt by eaſt, and blew a ſtrong gale, with ſqualls and rain, the ſky being at the ſame time uncommonly dark. Being apprehenſive of the winds veering more to the ſouth, which would expoſe us to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a lee-ſhore, we got the tacks on board, and made all the ſale we could to the ſouth-weſt. It fortunately happened, that the wind veered no further towards the ſouth, than ſouth-eaſt; ſo that, early the next morning, we were entirely clear of the coaſt. Captain Clerke's ſhip being at ſome diſtance eſtern, the Commodore brought to, till ſhe came up, and then both veſſels ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a north-weſterly courſe. The wind blew with great violence, and the weather was thick and hazy. Between one and two o'clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, there was a perfect hurricane; ſo that the Commodore deemed it exceedingly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to run any longer before it: he therefore brought the ſhips to, with their heads to the ſouth. In this ſituation, the Reſolution ſprung a leak, in her ſtarboard quarter, which, at firſt alarmed us extremely; but, after the water was baled out, which kept us employed till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, it was kept under by means of one pump. The wind having, in the evening, veered to the ſouthward, its fury in ſome meaſure abated; upon which we ſtretched to the weſt; but about eleven, the gale again increaſed, and continued
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:030274_0728_0FE5721860150728"/>
till five the next morning, when the ſtorm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to moderate.</p>
                     <p>The weather now clearing up, we were able to ſee ſeveral leagues around us, and ſteered more to the north. At noon, our longitude was 229° 26′ eaſt: and our latitude, 50° 1′ north. We now ſteered north-weſt by north, with a freſh gale, and fair weather. But, towards the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the wind again blew hard, with ſqualls and rain. With this weather, we continued the ſame courſe till the 30th, when we ſteered north by weſt, intending to make the land. Captain Cook regretted that he could not do it ſooner, as we were now paſſing the ſpot where the pretended ſtrait of Admiral de Fonte has been placed by geographers. Though the Captain gave no credit to ſuch vague and improbable ſtories, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of keeping the coaſt of America aboard, that this point might be cleared up beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But he conſidered, that it would have been very imprudent to have engaged with the land while the weather was ſo tempeſtuous, or to have loſt the advantage of a fair wind, by wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for leſs ſtormy weather. This day, at twelve o'clock, our latitude was 53° 22′ north, and our longitude 225° 14′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>On Friday, the 1ſt of May, not ſeeing land, we ſteered to the north-eaſt, having a freſh breeze at ſouth-ſouth-eaſt and ſouth, with ſqualls and ſhowers of hail and rain. About ſeven o'clock
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:030274_0729_0FE548C9F650EC28"/>
in the evening, we deſcried the land, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of twelve or fourteen leagues. At four the next morning, the coaſt was ſeen from ſouth-eaſt to north by weſt, the neareſt part of it being five or ſix leagues diſtant. At this time, the northern point of an inlet, or, at leaſt, what appeared to be one, bore eaſt by ſouth; and from it to the northward, there ſeemed to be many bays and harbours along the coaſt. At ſix o'clock, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a nearer approach to the land, we ſteered north-weſt by north, this being the direction of the coaſt; and between eleven and twelve, we paſſed a cluſter of little iſlands ſituate near the continent, to the northward of the ſouthern point of an extenſive bay. An arm of this bay ſeemed to extend in towards the north, behind a round lofty mountain that ſtands between it and the ſea. To this mountain Captain Cook gave the name of Mount Edgecumbe; and the point of land projecting from it, he called Cape Edgecumbe. The latitude of this cape is 57° 3′ north, and its longitude 224° 7′ eaſt. The land, except in ſome parts cloſe to the ſea, is of a conſiderable height, abounding with hills. Mount Edeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbe, which far out-tops all the reſt, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely covered with ſnow, as were alſo the other elevated hills; but the lower ones, and the flatter ſpots near the ſea, were deſtitute of it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with wood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="279" facs="unknown:030274_0730_0FE5721F493884F8"/>In our progreſs to the northward, we found that the coaſt from Cape Edgecumbe trended to the north and north-eaſt for ſix or ſeven leagues, and there formed a ſpacious bay. There being ſome iſlands in the entrance of this bay, the Commodore named it the Bay of Iſlands. It ſeemed to branch out into ſeveral arms, one of which turned towards the ſouth, and may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps communicate with the bay on the eaſtern ſide of Cape Edgecumbe, and thus render the land of that cape an iſland. On the 3d, at half an hour after four in the morning, Mount-Edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbe bore ſouth 54° eaſt, a large inlet, north 50° eaſt; and the moſt advanced point of land towards the north-weſt, lying under a very lofty peaked mountain, which obtained the appellation of Mount Fair-Weather, bore north 32° weſt. The inlent we named Croſs Sound, having firſt obſerved it on the day ſo marked in our calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar. The ſouth eaſtern point of this Sound is an elevated promontory, which we diſtinguiſhed by the name of Croſs Cape. To the point under the above-mentioned peaked mountain, we gave the name of Cape Fair-Weather. At noon, this cape was diſtant twelve or thirteeen leagues.</p>
                     <p>We had now light breezes from the north-weſt, which continued ſeveral days. We ſteered to the ſouth weſt, and weſt-ſouth-weſt, till the morning of the 4th, when we tacked and ſtood towards the ſhore. At twelve o'clock, Mount
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:030274_0731_0FE57220D01E7AE8"/>
Fair-Weather bore north 63° eaſt, and the ſhore under it was about a dozen leagues diſtant. This mount is the higheſt of a chain or ridge of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that riſe at the north-weſtern entrance of Croſs Sound, and extend towards the north-weſt, parrellel with the coaſt. Theſe mountains were covered with ſnow, from the higheſt ſummit down to the ſea-coaſt; except a few places, where we could diſcern trees that ſeemed to riſe, as it were, from the ſea. About five o'clock in the afternoon, the top of a high mountain appeared above the horizon, bearing north 26° weſt; and, as we afterwards found, near forty leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. We ſuppoſed that it was the mount St. Elias, of Commodore Beering. We ſaw, in the courſe of this day, ſeveral porpoiſes, ſeals, and whales; alſo great numbers of gulls, and many flocks of birds which had a black circle about the head, and a black band on the tip of the tail and upper part of the wings, the reſt being white below and blueiſh above. We likewiſe obſerved a browniſh duck, with a blackiſh or dark blue head and neck.</p>
                     <p>As we had light winds, with occaſional calms, we proceeded but ſlowly. On the 6th, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the neareſt land was at the diſtance of about eight leagues. In a north-eaſterly direction, there appered to be a bay, and an iſland near its ſouthern point, covered with wood. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the place where Beering anchored. South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:030274_0732_0FE5722279FFEA68"/>
of the bay (which Captain Cook named Beering's Bay, in honour of its diſcoverer) the ridge of mountains, already mentioned, is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by a plain of ſeveral leagues in extent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which the ſight was unbounded. In the afternoon, we ſounded, and found a muddy bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom at the depth of about ſeventy fathoms. Soon afterwards, having a light northerly breeze, we ſteered to the weſtward; and at noon, the next day, we were at the diſtance of four or five leagues from the ſhore. From this ſtation we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a bay under a high land, with low wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on each ſide of it. We now found that the coaſt trended conſiderably to the weſt; and as we had but little wind, and that chiefly from the weſtward, we made a ſlow progreſs. On the 9th, about noon, Mount St Elias bore north 30° eaſt at the diſtance of nineteen leagues. This moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtands twelve leagues inland, in the longitude of 219° eaſt, and in the latitude of 69° 27′ north. It belongs to a ridge of very lofty mountains, which may be reckoned a kind of continuation of the former, being ſeparated from them only by the plain before-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the 10th, at twelve o'clock, we were about three leagues diſtant from the coaſt of the continent, which extended from eaſt half north, to north-weſt half weſt. To the weſtward of the latter direction was an iſland, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſix leagues. A point which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:030274_0733_0FE5722459993130"/>
named Cape Suckling, projects towards the north-eaſtern end of this iſland. The extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the cape is low; but, within it, ſtands a hill of a conſiderable height, which is divided from the mountains by low land; ſo that the cape, at a diſtance, has an inſular appearance. On the north ſide of Cape Suckling is a bay, which ſeemed to be extenſive, and to be ſhelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from moſt winds. Captain Cook had ſome thoughts of reparing to this bay, in order to ſtop the leak of his ſhip, all our endeavours to effect that purpoſe at ſea having proved fruitleſs. We therefore ſteered for the cape; but, having only variable light breezes, we advanced towards it ſlowly. Before night, however we had approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near enough to ſee ſome low land projecting from the cape to the north-weſt; we alſo obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome little iſlands in the bay, and ſeveral ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated rocks between the cape and the north-eaſtern extremity of the iſland. As there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be a paſſage on each ſide of theſe rocks, we continued ſteering thither the whole night. Early the next morning, the wind ſhifted from north-eaſt to north. This being againſt us, the Commodore relinquiſhed his deſign of going into the bay, and bore up for the weſt end of the iſland. There being a calm about ten o'clock, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in a boat, and landing on the iſland, with a view of ſeeing what lay on the other ſide; but finding that the hills were at a greater diſtance
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:030274_0734_0FE5722919D65D58"/>
than he expected, and that the way was woody and ſteep, he laid aſide that intention. On a ſmall eminence near the ſhore, he left, at the foot of a tree, a bottle containing a paper, on which the names of our ſhips, and the date of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, were inſcribed; he alſo incloſed two ſilver two-penny pieces of Engliſh coin, which, with many others, had been furniſhed him by Dr. Kay, now Dean of Lincoln; and, in teſtimony of his eſteem for that gentleman, he diſtinguiſhed the iſland by the name of Kay's Iſland.</p>
                     <p>This iſle does not exceed twelve leagues in length, and its breadth is not above a league and a half in any part of it. The ſouth-weſt point whoſe latitude is 59° 49′ north, and longitude 216° 58′ eaſt, is a naked rock, conſiderably ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above the land within it. There is alſo a high rock lying off it, which, when ſeen in ſome particular directions, has the appearance of a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous caſtle. The iſland terminates towards the ſea, in bare ſloping cliffs, with a beach conſiſting of large pebbles, intermixed in ſome places with a clayey ſand. The cliffs are compoſed of a blueiſh ſtone or rock, and are, except in a few parts in a ſoft or mouldering ſtate. Some parts of the ſhore are interrupted by ſmall vallies and gullies, in each of which a rivulet or torrent ruſhes down with a conſiderable degree of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity; though, perhaps, only furniſhed from the ſnow, and laſting no longer than till the whole
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:030274_0735_0FE5722B0BD042F0"/>
is diſſolved. Theſe vallies are filled with pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees; and they alſo abound in other parts of the iſland, which, indeed, is covered, as it were, with a broad girdle of wood. The trees, however, are far from being of an extraordinary growth; few of them ſeeming to be larger than what a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might graſp round with his arms, and their general height being forty or fifty feet; ſo that they would be of no great ſervice for ſhipping, except as material for making top gallant maſts, and other ſmall things. The pine-trees appeared to be all of one ſpecies; and neither the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian pine, nor cypreſs, was to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Upon the edges of the cliffs, the ſurface was covered with a kind of tuft, about ſix inches thick, apparently compoſed of the common morſe and the upper part of the iſland had nearly the ſame appearance in point of colour; but that which covered it, whatever it was, ſeemed to be thicker. Among the trees were ſome currant and the leaves of other plants not yet in flower, particular one which was ſuppoſed by Mr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon to be the <hi>heracleum</hi> of Linnaeus.</p>
                     <p>A crow was ſeen flying about the wood; two or three white headed eagles, like thoſe of Noot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka, were alſo obſerved; beſides another ſpecies equally large, which had a white breaſt. The Commodore likewiſe ſaw, in his paſſage from the ſhip to the ſhore, a number of fowls ſitting on
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:030274_0736_0FE5722C93496890"/>
the water; or flying about; the principal of which were gulls, burres, ſhags, ducks, or large petrels, divers, and quebrantahueſſes. The divers were of two ſorts; one very large, whoſe colour was black, with a white belly and breaſt; the other of a ſmaller ſize, with a longer and more pointed bill. The ducks were alſo of two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; one browniſh, with a dark-blue or blackiſh head and neck: the other ſmaller, and of a dirty black colour. The ſhags were large and black, having a white ſpot behind the wings. The gulls were of the common ſort, flying in flocks. There was alſo a ſingle bird flying about, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently of the gull kind, whoſe colour was a ſnowy white, with ſome black along part of the upper ſide of its wings. At the place where our party landed, a fox came from the verge of the wood, and eyeing them with little emotion, walked leiſurely on without manifeſting any ſigns of fear. He was not of a large ſize, and his colour was a reddiſh yellow. Two or three ſmall ſeals were likewiſe ſeen near the ſhore; but no traces were diſcovered of inhabitants having ever been in the iſland.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook, with thoſe who accompanied him, returned on board in the afternoon, and with a light breeze from the eaſt, we ſteered for the ſouth weſt ſide of the iſland, which we got round by eight o'clock in the evening: we then ſtood for the weſternmoſt land that was now in ſight.
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:030274_0737_0FE5722E6780EE28"/>
At the north-eaſt end of Kay's Iſland ſtands ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iſland, extending north-weſt and ſouth-eaſt about nine miles, to within the ſame diſtance of the north-weſtern boundary of the bay mentioned before, to which the appellation of Comptroller's bay was given. Early the next morning Kay's Iſland was ſtill in ſight, bearing eaſt by ſouth; and, at this time, we were at the diſtance of four or five leagues from the main. At noon, the eaſtern point of a ſpacious inlet bore weſt-north-weſt, about three leagues diſtant. From Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller's Bay to this point, which the Commodore named Cape Hinchingbroke, the direction of the coaſt is nearly eaſt and weſt. Beyond this, it appeared to incline towards the ſouth; a direction very different from that which is marked out in the modern charts, founded on the late diſcoveries of the Ruſſians; inſomuch that we had ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect, that we ſhould find, through the inlet before us, a paſſage to the north, and that the land to the weſt and ſouth-weſt was a group of iſlands. The wind was now ſouth-eaſterly, and we were menaced with a fog and a ſtorm; and Captain Cook was deſirous of getting into ſome place to ſtop the leak, before we had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gale to encounter. We therefore ſteered for the inlet, which we had no ſooner reached, than the weather became exceedingly foggy, and it was deemed neceſſary that the ſhips ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in ſome place or other, till the ſky ſhould
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:030274_0738_0FE57234C4D044F0"/>
clear up. With this view we hauled cloſe under Cape Hinchingbroke, and caſt anchor before a ſmall cove, over a clayey bottom, in eight fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms water, at the diſtance of about two fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs from the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>Soon after we had anchored, the boats were hoiſted out, ſome to fiſh, and others to ſound. The ſeine, at the ſame time, was drawn in the cove; but without ſucceſs, as it was torn. At intervals the fog cleared away, and gave us a view of the neighbouring land. The cape was one league diſtant; the weſtern point of the inlet, five leagues; and the land on that ſide extended to weſt by north. Between this point and north-weſt by weſt, we could diſcern no land. The moſt weſterly point we had in view on the north ſhore, was at the diſtance of two leagues. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this point, and the ſhore under which our ſhips now lay at anchor, is a bay about three leagues deep, on the ſouth-eaſtern ſide of which are ſeveral coves; and, in the middle, ſtand ſome rocky iſlands.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Gore was diſpatched in a boat to theſe iſlands, in order to ſhoot ſome birds that might ſerve for food. He had ſcarcely reached them, when about twenty natives appeared, in two large canoes; upon which he retured to the ſhips, and they followed him. They were unwilling, however, to venture along-ſide, but kept at a little diſtance, ſhouting aloud, and claſping and
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:030274_0739_0FE572364B4139C0"/>
extending their arms alternately. They then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a kind of ſong, much after the manner of the inhabitants of King George's or Nootka Sound. Their heads were ſtrewed with feathers, and one of them held out a white garment, which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed was intended as a token of friendſhip; while another, for near a quarter of an hour, ſtood up in the canoe, entirely naked, with his arms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended like a croſs, and motionleſs. Their canoes were conſtructed upon a different plan from thoſe of Nootka. The frame conſiſted of ſlender laths, and the outſide was formed of the ſkins of ſeals, or other animals of a ſimilar kind. Though we returned their ſigns of amity, and endeavoured by the moſt expreſſive geſtures, to encourage them to come along-ſide, we were unable to prevail upon them. Though ſome of our people repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral of the moſt common words of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Nootka, ſuch as <hi>mahook</hi> and <hi>ſeekemaile,</hi> they did not appear to underſtand them. After they had received ſome preſents that were thrown to them, they retired towards the ſhore, intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſigns, that they would pay us another viſit the next morning. Two of them, however, came off to us in the night, each in a ſmall canoe; hoping, perhaps, that they might find us all aſleep, and might have an opportunity of pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for they went away as ſoon as they perceived themſelves diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="289" facs="unknown:030274_0740_0FE57237F6186768"/>The wind, during the night, blew hard and in ſqualls, with rain, and thick hazy weather. The next morning, about ten, the wind becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more moderate, and the weather in ſome meaſure clearing up, we got up our anchors and made ſail, in order to ſearch for ſome convenient place where we might ſtop the leak, as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtation was two much expoſed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Captain Cook at firſt propoſed to have gone up the bay before which our ſhips had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored; but he was afterwards induced by the clearneſs of the weather, to ſteer towards the north, further up the great inlet. After we had paſſed the north-weſt point of the above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned bay, we found that the coaſt, on that ſide, inclined to the eaſtward. We did not follow it, but proceeded on our courſe to the northward, for a point of land which we obſerved in that direction.</p>
                     <p>The Americans who had viſited us the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day, came off again in the morning, in five or ſix canoes; but as they did not come till after we were under ſail, they were unable to reach the ſhips, though they followed us for a conſiderable time. In the afternoon, before two o'clock, the unfavourable weather returned, with ſo thick a haze, that we could diſcern no other land but the point juſt mentioned, off which we arrived between four and five o'clock, and found it to be a little iſland, ſituated at the diſtance of
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:030274_0741_0FE57239DD9BD968"/>
about two miles from the neighbouring coaſt, being a point of land on the eaſtern ſide of which we diſcovered an excellent bay, or rather harbour. To this we plied up, while the wind blew in very hard ſqualls, accompanied with rain. Though, at ſome intervals, we could ſee land in every direction, yet, in general, there was ſo great a fog, that we could only perceive the ſhores of the bay for which we were now ſteering. In paſſing the iſland, we found a muddy bottom, at the depth of twenty-ſix fathoms. Not long after, we found ſixty and ſeventy fathoms, over a rocky bottom; and, in the entrance of the bay, the depth of water was from thirty to ſix fathoms. At length, about eight o'clock, we were obliged, by the violence of the ſqualls, to caſt anchor in thirteen fathoms water, before we had proceeded ſo far into the bay as the Commodore intended; but we thought ourſelves fortunate in having the ſhips already ſecured; for the night was extremely tempeſtuous.</p>
                     <p>Though the weather was ſo turbulent, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were not deterred from paying us a viſit. Three of them came off in two canoes; two men in one, and one in the other, being the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that each canoe could carry. For they were conſtructed nearly in the ſame manner with thoſe of the Eſquimaux, except that in one of them were two holes for two perſons to ſit in, and in the other but one. Theſe men had each a ſtick,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:030274_0742_0FE5723E1A930638"/>
of the length of about three feet, with the large feathers, or wings of birds, faſtened to it. Theſe they frequently held up to us, probably as tokens of peace. The treatment theſe three received, induced many others to viſit us, between one and two o'clock the following morning, in both great and ſmall canoes. Some of them ventured on board the Reſolution, though not before ſome of our people had ſtepped into their boats. Among thoſe who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame on board, was a middle aged man, who, as we afterwards found, was the chief. His dreſs was made of the ſkin of the ſea-otter, and he had on his head ſuch a cap as is worn by the inhabitants of Nootka, embelliſhed with ſky-blue glaſs beads. He appeared to value theſe much more than our white glaſs beads. Any kind of beads, however, ſeemed to be in high eſtimation among theſe people, who readily gave in exchange for them whatever they had, even their fine ſea-otter ſkin.</p>
                     <p>They were very deſirous of iron, but abſolutely rejected ſmall bits, and wanted pieces nine or ten inches long at leaſt, and of the breadth of three or four fingers. They obtained but little of this commodity from us, as, by this time, it was become rather ſcarce. The points of ſome of their ſpears were of this metal; others were of copper; and a few were of bone; of which laſt the points of their arrows, darts, &amp;c. were formed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="292" facs="unknown:030274_0743_0FE57240477EF9D0"/>The chief could not be prevailed upon to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture below the uper deck, nor did he and his companions continue long on board. While they were with us, it was neceſſary to watch them narrowly, as they ſoon manifeſted an inclination for thieving. At length, when they had been three or four hours along-ſide the Reſolution, they all quitted her, and reparied to the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which ſhip none of them had before been on board of, except one man, who came from her at this very time, and immediately returned to her, in company with the others. As ſoon as they had departed from our ſhip, Captain Cook diſpatched a boat to found the head of the bay, foras, the wind was moderate at preſent, he had an intention of laying the ſhip aſhore, if a proper place could be found for the proceſs of ſtopping the leak. Soon afterwards all the Americans quitted the Diſcovery, and made their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our boat that was employed in ſounding. The officer who was in her, obſerving their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, returned to the ſhip, and all the canoes followed him. The crew of the boat had no ſooner repaired on board, leaving in her, by way of guard, two of their number, then ſeveral of the natives ſtepped into her; ſome of whom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their ſpears before the two men, while others looſed the rope by which ſhe was faſtened to the ſhip, and the reſt were ſo daring as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to tow her away. But the moment they
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:030274_0744_0FE57241CC3142F8"/>
ſaw that we were preparing to oppoſe them, they let her go, ſtepped out of her into their own boats, and made ſigns to us to perſuade us to lay down our arms, being, to all appearance, perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned.</p>
                     <p>This attempt, though a very bold one, was ſcarce equal to what they had meditated on board Captain Clerke's ſhip. The man whom we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before as having conducted his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from the Reſolution to the Diſcovery, had firſt been on board of the latter; where looking down all the hatchways, and obſerving no one except the officer of the watch, and one or two others, he doubtleſs imagined that ſhe might be plundered with eaſe, particularly as ſhe was ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at ſome diſtance from the Reſolution. It was unqueſtionably with this intent, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives went off to her. Several of them went on board without the leaſt ceremony, and drawing their knives, made ſigns to the officer, and the other people upon deck, to keep off, and began to ſearch for plunder. The firſt thing they laid hold of was the rudder of one of our boats, which they immediately threw overboard to thoſe of their party who had continued in the canoes. But before they had time to find another object that ſtruck their fancy, the ſhips crew were alarmed, and many of them, armed with cutlaſſes came upon deck. On obſerving this, the plunderers all ſneaked off into their canoes, with evident
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:030274_0745_0FE57243A33C1C70"/>
marks of indifference. It was at this time, that our boat was occupied in ſounding, as we have already mentioned; and the natives, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, proceeded towards her, after the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had met with at the Diſcovery. Their viſiting us ſo early in the morning was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly with a view of plundering, on a ſuppoſition that they ſhould find all our people aſleep.</p>
                     <p>From the circumſtances above related, it may reaſonably be inferred, that theſe people are not acquainted with fire-arms. For, had they known any thing of their effect, they would by no means have ventured to attempt carrying off a boat from under, a ſhip's guns, in the face of upwards of a hundred men; for moſt of the Reſolution's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were looking at them, at the very inſtant of their making the attempt. However, we left them as ignorant, in this particular, as we found them; for they neither ſaw nor heard a muſquet fired, except at birds.</p>
                     <p>As we were on the point of weighing anchor, in order to proceed further up the bay, the wind began to blow as violently as before, and was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with rain; inſomuch that we were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear away the cable again, and lie faſt. In the evening, perceiving that the gale did not abate, and thinking that it might be ſome time before an opportunity of getting higher up preſented itſelf, the Commodore was determined to heel the ſhip in our preſent ſtation: and, with
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:030274_0746_0FE5724A45A3CD48"/>
that view, cauſed her to be moored with, a kedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchor and hawſer. One of the ſailors, in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the anchor out of the boat, was carried over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board by the buoy-rope, and accompanied the anchor to the bottom. In this very hazardous ſituation, he had ſufficient preſence of mind to diſengage himſelf, and come up to the ſurface of the water, where he was immediately taken up, with a dangerous fracture in one of his legs, Early the following morning, we heeled the ſhip, in order to ſtop the leak, which, on ripping off the ſheathing, was found to be in the ſeams. While the carpenters were employed in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, others of our people filled the water-caſks at a ſtream not far from our ſtation. The wind had, by this time, conſiderably abated; but the weather was hazy, with rain. The Americans paid us another viſit this morning: thoſe who came off firſt, were in ſmall canoes; others ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived afterwards in large ones. In one of theſe great canoes were twenty women and one man, beſides ſeveral children.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 16th, towards the evening, the weather cleared up, and we then found ourſelves encompaſſed with land. Our ſtation was on the eaſtern ſide of the Sound, in a place diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the appellation of Snug Corner Bay. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook, accompanied by ſome of his officers, went to take a ſurvey of the head of it; and they found that it was ſheltered from all winds,
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:030274_0747_0FE5724BCFDDDBF0"/>
and had a muddy botto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> at the depth of from ſeven to three fathoms. The land near the ſhore is low; partly wooded, and partly clear. The clear ground was covered with ſnow, but very little remained in the woods. The ſummits of the hills in the neighbourhood were covered with wood; but thoſe that were at a greater diſtance inland, had the appearance of naked, rocks, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in ſnow.</p>
                     <p>The leak of the Reſolution being at length ſtopped, we weighed anchor on the 17th, at four in the morning, and ſteered a north-weſt courſe, with a gentle breeze at eaſt-north-eaſt. Soon after we had made ſail, the Americans viſited us again, ſeemingly with no other view than to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their curioſity, for they did not enter into any traffic with us. When we had reached the north-weſtern point of the arm wherein we had achor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we obſerved that the flood-tide came into the inlet, by the ſame channel through which we had entered. This circumſtance did not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the probability of a paſſage to the north through the inlet, though it did not make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely againſt it. After we had paſſed the point juſt mentioned, we met with much foul ground, and many ſunken rocks. The wind now failed us, and was ſucceeded by calms and variable light airs, ſo that we had ſome difficulty in extricat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves from the danger that threatened us. At laſt, however, about one o'clock, we caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:030274_0748_0FE5724D96892A40"/>
in about thirtheen fathoms water, under the eaſtern ſhore, about four leagues to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our laſt ſtation. Though the weather, in the morning, had been very hazy, it cleared up afterwards, ſo as to afford us a diſtinct view of all the ſurrounding land, particularly towards the north, where it appeared to cloſe. This gave us but little hope of meeting with a paſſage that way. That he might be enabled to form a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgment, Captain Cook ſent Mr. Gore, with two armed boats, to examine the northern arm; and at the ſame time diſpatched the Maſter, with two other boats, to ſurvey another arm that ſeemed to incline towards the eaſt. Both of them returned at night. The Maſter informed the Commodore, that the arm, to which he had been ſent, communicated with that we had laſt quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that one ſide of it was formed by a cluſter of iſlands. Mr. Gore reported, that he had ſeen the entrance of an arm, which, he thought, extended a very conſiderable way to the north-eaſtward, and by which a paſſage might probably be found. On the other hand, Mr. Roberts, one of the Mates, who had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Mr. Gore on this occaſion, gave it as his opinion, that they ſaw the head of this arm. The variation of theſe two opinions, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance before-mentioned of the flood-tide en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the inlet from the ſouthward, rendered the exiſtence of a paſſage this way extremely uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:030274_0749_0FE5724F1D8C50D8"/>
Captain Cook therefore determined to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy no more time in ſeeking a paſſage in a place that afforded ſo ſmall a proſpect of ſucceſs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as the wind was now become favourable for getting out to ſea.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, about three o'clock, we weighed, and made ſail to the ſouthward down the inlet, with a light northerly breeze. We met with the ſame broken ground as on the preceding day, but ſoon extricated ourſelves from it. We were enabled to ſhorten our way out to ſea, by diſcovering another paſſage into this inlet, to the ſouth-weſt of that by which we entered. It is ſeparated from the other, by an iſland that extends eighteen leagues in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſouth-weſt and north-eaſt, to which Captain Cook gave the appellation of Montagu Iſland.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral iſlands in the ſouth-weſtern channel. Thoſe which are ſituate in the entrance, next the open ſea, are elevated and rockey. Thoſe that are within, are low; and as they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally free from ſnow, and covered with wood and verdure, they were, for this reaſon, denominated Green-Iſlands.</p>
                     <p>The wind, at two o'clock in the afternoon, veered to the ſouth-weſt and ſouth-weſt by ſouth, which ſubjected us to the neceſſity of plying. We firſt ſtretched over to within the diſtance of two miles of the eaſtern ſhore, and tacked in about
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:030274_0750_0FE57252B35AED48"/>
fifty-three fathoms. As we ſtood back to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu Iſland, we diſcovered a ledge of rocks, ſome under water, and others above the ſurface. We afterwards met with ſome others towards the middle of the channel. Theſe rocks rendering it unſafe to ply during the night, we ſpent it in ſtanding off and on, under Montagu Iſland; for the depth of water was ſo great, that we could not caſt anchor. The next morning, at break of day, we ſteered for the channel between the Green Iſlands and Montagu Iſland, which is about two leagues and an half in breadth. The wind was inconſiderable the whole day; and, abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After the calm had continued till ten o'clock the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding morning, a ſlight breeze ſprung up from the north with which we again weighed and made ſail. Having got out into the open ſea by ſix in the evening, we diſcovered that the coaſt trended weſt by ſouth, as far as the eye could poſſibly reach.</p>

                     <p>THE inlet which we had now quitted, was diſtinguiſhed by Captain Cook with the name of Prince William's Sound. From what we ſaw of it, it ſeems to occupy, at leaſt, one degree and an half of latitude, and two degrees of longitude, excluſive of the branches or arms, with whoſe exent we are unacquainted. The natives whom we ſaw, were in general of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling ſtature, though many of them were under it. They were ſquare, or ſtrong-cheſted, with ſhort thick necks, and large broad viſages, which were, for the moſt part, rather flat. The moſt diſproportioned part of their body appeared to be their heads, which were of great magnitude. Their teeth were of a tolerable whiteneſs, broad, well ſet, and equal in ſize. Their noſes had full round points, turned up at the tip, and

their eyes, though not ſmall, were ſcarcely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the largeneſs of their faces. They had black hair, which was ſtrong, ſtraight, and thick. Their beards were, in general, thin, or deficient; but the hairs growing about the lips of thoſe who have them, were briftly or ſtiff, and often of a browniſh colour; and ſome of the elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men had large, thick, ſtraight beards.</p>
                     <p>Though, for the moſt part, they agree in the formation of their perſons, and the largeneſs of their heads, the variety in their features is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. Very few, however, can be ſaid to be handſome, though their countenance uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates frankneſs, vivacity, and good-nature; and yet ſome of them ſhewed a reſerve and fullenneſs in their aſpect. The faces of ſome of the women are agreeable; and many of them, but principally the younger ones, may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from the other ſex, by the ſuperior delicacy of their features. The complexion of ſome of the females, and of the children, is white, without any mixture of red. Many of the men, whom we ſaw naked, had father a ſwarthy caſt, which was ſcarcely the effect of any ſtain, as it is not their cuſtom to paint their bodies.</p>
                     <p>The men, women, and children of this Sound, are all clothed in the ſame manner. Their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dreſs is a ſort of cloſe frock, or rather robe, which ſometimes reaches only to the knees, but generally down to the ancles. It has, at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:030274_0755_0FE57259308BE310"/>
part, a hole juſt ſufficient to admit the head, with ſleeves reaching to the wriſt. Theſe frocks are compoſed of the ſkins of various animals, ſuch as the grey fox, racoon, pine-martin, ſea-otter, ſeal, &amp;c. And they are commonly worn with the hairy ſide outwards. Some of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have their frocks made of the ſkins of fowls, with only the down left on them, which they glue upon other ſubſtances: we alſo ſaw one or two woollen garments, reſembling thoſe of the inhabitants of King George's Sound. At the ſeams, where the different ſkins are ſewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they are uſually adorned with fringes or taſſels of narrow thongs, cut out of the ſame ſkins. There is a ſort of cape or collar to a few of them, and ſome have a hood; but the other is the moſt cuſtomary form, and appears to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute their whole dreſs in fair weather. They put over this, when it is rainy, another frock, made with ſome degree of ingenuity from the inteſtines of whales, or of ſome other large ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, prepared with ſuch ſkill, as to reſemble, in a great meaſure, our gold-beater's leaf. It is formed ſo as to be drawn tight round the neck; and its ſleeves extend down to the wriſt, round which they are faſtened with a ſtring. When they are in their canoes, they draw the ſkirts of this frock over the rim of the hole in which they ſit, ſo that the water is prevented from entering. At the ſame time it keeps the men dry upwards,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:030274_0756_0FE5725D08CA6978"/>
for no water can penetrate through it. It is apt to crack or break, if it is not conſtantly kept moiſt. This frock, as well as the common one made of ſkins, is nearly ſimilar to the dreſs of the natives of Greenland, as deſcribed by Crantz<note n="*" place="bottom">Crantz's Hiſtory of Greenland, Vol. I. p. 136—138.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Though the inhabitants of this inlet in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, do not cover their legs or feet, yet ſome of them wear a kind of ſkin ſtockings, reaching half-way up their thighs. Few of them are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mittens for their hands, formed from the ſkins of a bear's paws. Thoſe who wear any thing on their heads, reſembled, in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the people of Nootka, having high trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated conical caps, compoſed of ſtraw, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of wood.</p>
                     <p>The hair of the men is commonly cropped round the forehead and neck, but the females ſuffer it to grow long; and the greateſt part of them tie a lock of it on the crown, while a few club it behind, after our method. Both the men and women perforate their ears with ſeveral holes about the outer and lower part of the edge, wherein they ſuſpend ſmall bunches of beads. They alſo perforate the <hi>ſeptum</hi> of the noſe, through which they often thruſt the quill-feathers of birds, or little bending ornaments, made of a tubulous ſhelly ſubſtance, ſtrung on a ſtiff cord,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:030274_0757_0FE5725F69471F98"/>
of the length of three or four inches, which give them a ridiculous and groteſque appearence. But the moſt extraordinary ornamental faſhion, adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome of the natives of both ſexes, is their having the under-lip cut quite through length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, rather below the ſwelling part. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion frequently exceeds two inches in length, and either by its natural retraction while the wound is ſtill freſh, or by the repetition of ſome artificial management, aſſumes the appearance and ſhape of lips, and becomes ſufficiently large to admit the tongue through. This happened to be the caſe, when a perſon with his under-lip thus ſlit was firſt ſeen by one of our ſailors, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately exclaimed, that the man had two mouths; which, indeed it greatly reſembles. They fix in this artificial mouth a flat, narrow kind of ornament, made principally out of a ſolid ſhell or bone, cut into ſmall narrow pieces, like teeth, almoſt down to the baſe, or thick part, which has, at each end, a projecting bit, that ſerves to ſupport it when put into the divided lip; the cut part then appearing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Some of them only perforate the lower lip into ſeparate holes; on which occaſion the ornament conſiſts of the ſame number of diſtinct ſhelly ſtuds, the points of which are thruſt through theſe holes, and their heads appear within the lip, not unlike another row of teeth under their natural ones.</p>

                        <pb n="305" facs="unknown:030274_0758_0FE572610941FAD8"/>Such are the native ornaments of theſe people. But we obſerved among them many beads of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean manufacture, chiefly of a pale blue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which are hung in their ears, or about their caps, or are joined to their lip-ornaments, which have a little hole drilled in each of the points to which they are faſtened, and others to them, till they ſometimes even hang as low as the point of the chin. In this laſt caſe, however, they cannot remove them with ſuch facility; for, with reſpect to their own lip-ornaments, they can take them out with their tongue at pleaſure. They likewiſe wear bracelets of beads, made of a ſhelly ſubſtance, or others of a cylindrical form, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a ſubſtance reſembling amber. And they are, in general, ſo fond of ornaments of ſome kind or other, that they fix any thing in their perforated lip; for one of them appeared with two of our iron nails projecting like prongs from it; and another man attempted to put a large braſs button into it.</p>
                     <p>The men often paint their faces of a black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and of a bright red, and ſometimes of a blueiſh or leaden hue; but not in any regular figure. The woman puncture or ſtain the chin with black, that comes to a point in each of their cheeks; a cuſtom ſimilar to which is in vogue among the Greenland females, as we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Crantz. The bodies of theſe people are not painted, which may probably be owing to the
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:030274_0759_0FE572630BC67B08"/>
ſcarcity of materials for that purpoſe; all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which they brought for ſale, being in very ſmall quantities. Upon the whole, we have in no country ſeen ſavages who take more pains than theſe do, to ornament, or rather (as we ſhould think) to disfigure their perſons.</p>
                     <p>Their canoes are of two ſorts; the one large and open, the other ſmall and covered. We have mentioned before, that there were twenty women, and one man, beſides children, in one of their large boats. Captain Cook having attentively examined this, and compared its conſtruction with Crantz's deſcription of the great, or woman's boat in Greenland, found that they were built in the ſame mode, with no other difference than in the form of the head and ſtern, particularly of the former, which ſomewhat reſembles a whale's head. The framing conſiſts of ſlender pieces of wood: and the outſide is compoſed of the ſkins of ſeals, or other ſea animals, ſtretched over the wood. The ſmall canoes of theſe people, are conſtructed nearly of the ſame form and mateirals with thoſe of the Eſquimaux and Greenlanders. Some of theſe, as we have already mentioned, carry two perſons. Their fore-part is curved like the head of a violin; and they are broader in proportion to their length than thoſe of Eſquimaux.</p>
                     <p>Their weapons, and implements for hunting and fiſhing, are the ſame with thoſe uſed by the Greenlanders and Eſquimaux. Many of their
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:030274_0760_0FE5726876B13C68"/>
ſpears are headed with iron, and their arrows are generally pointed with bone. Their larger darts are thrown by means of a piece of wood about a foot long, with a ſmall groove in the middle, which receives the dart: at the bottom is a hole for the reception of one finger, which enables them to graſp the piece of wood much firmer, and to throw with greater force. For defenſive armour they have a ſort of jacked, or coat of mail, formed of laths, faſtened together with ſinews, which render it very flexible, though it is ſo cloſe as not to admit a dart or arrow. It ſerves only to cover the trunk of the body, and may, not improperly, be compared to the ſtays worn by women.</p>
                     <p>We had not an oportunity of ſeeing any of the habitations of the natives, as none of them dwelt in the bay where our ſhips anchored, or where any of us landed. With reſpect to their domeſtic utenſils, they brought, in their canoes ſome round and oval wooden diſhes, rather ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and others of a ſylindrical form, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably deeper. The ſides conſiſted of one piece, bent round, after the manner of our chip boxes, but thick, and neatly faſtened with thongs; the bottoms being fixed in with ſmall pegs of wood. Others were ſomewhat ſmaller, and of a more elegant figure, not unlike a large oval butter-boat, without any handle, but ſhallower: theſe were compoſed of a piece of wood, or ſome horny
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:030274_0761_0FE5726A8159FE38"/>
ſubſtance, and were ſometimes neatly carved. They had a number of little ſquare bags, made of the ſame gut with their exterior frocks, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly adorned with very ſmall red feathers, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with it, in which were contained ſeveral very fine ſinews, and bundles of ſmall cord, made out of them, plaited with extraordinary ingenuity. They likewiſe brought ſome wooden models of their canoes chequered baſkets, wrought ſo cloſely as to hold water, and a conſiderable number of ſmall images, of the length of four or five inches, either of wood, or ſtuffed, which were covered with a piece of fur, and embelliſhed with quill-feathers, with hair fixed on their heads. We could not determine whether theſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended merely as children's toys, or were held in veneration, as repreſenting their deceaſed friends and relations, and applied to ſome ſuperſtitious purpoſe. They have many inſtruments formed of two or three hoops, or concentrical pieces of wood, having a croſs-bar fixed in he middle, by which they are held. To theſe they fix a number of dried barnacle-ſhells, with threads, which when ſhaken, produce a loud noiſe, and thus ſerve the purpoſe of a rattle. This contrivance is probably a ſubſtitute for the rattling-bird at King George's Sound.</p>
                     <p>It is uncertain with what tools their wooden utenſils, frames, of canoes, &amp;c, are made; the only one that we obſerved among them being a ſort of
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:030274_0762_0FE5726C78AF65F8"/>
ſtone adze, ſomewhat reſembling thoſe of Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite, and other iſlands of the Pacific Ocean. They have a great quantity of iron knives, ſome of which are rather curved, others ſtrait, and ſome very ſmall ones, fixed in longiſh handles, with the blades bent upwards. They have alſo knives of another ſort, ſometimes almoſt two feet in length, ſhaped, in a great meaſure, like a dagger, with a ridge towards the middle. They wear theſe in ſheaths of ſkins, hung by a thong round their necks, under their robe or frock. It is probable, that they uſe them only as weapons, and that their other knives are applied to different purpoſes. Whatever they have, is as well made as if they were provided with a complete cheſt of tools; and their plating of ſinews, ſewing, and ſmall work on their little bags above mentioned, may be ſaid to vie with the neateſt manufactures found in any part of the globe. Upon the whole, conſidering the uncivilized ſtate of the natives of this Sound, their northerly ſituation, amidſt a country almoſt continually covered with ſnow, and the comparatively wretched materials they have to work with, it appears, that, with reſpect to their ſkill and invention, in all manual operations, they are at leaſt equal to any other people.</p>
                     <p>The food that we ſaw them eat, was the fleſh of ſome animal, either roaſted or broiled, and dried fiſh. Some of the former that was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:030274_0763_0FE5726E54B11A98"/>
had the appearance of bear's fleſh. They likewiſe eat a larger ſort of fern-root, either baked or dreſſed in ſome other method. Some of us obſerved them eat freely of a ſubſtance, which we imagined was the interior part of the pine bark. Their drink, in all probability, is water; for, in their canoes, they brought ſnow in wooden veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which they ſwallowed by mouthfulls. Their manner of eating is decent and cleanly, for they conſtantly took care to remove any dirt that might adhere to their food; and though they would ſometimes eat the raw fat of ſome ſea animal, they did not fail to cut it carefully into mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls. Their perſons were, to appearance, always clean; and their utenſils, in general, were kept in excellent order, as were alſo their boats.</p>
                     <p>The language of theſe people ſeems difficult to be underſtood; which is, perhaps, not owing to any confuſion or indiſtinctneſs in their ſounds, but to the various ſignifications which their words bear. For they appeared frequently to make uſe of the ſame word on very different oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; though, probably, if we had had a longer intercourſe with them, this might have proved to be a miſtake on our part. Among the very few words of their language that Mr. Anderſon was enabled to procure, are the following, viz. <hi>aa,</hi> yes; <hi>keeta,</hi> give me ſomething; <hi>tawuk,</hi> keep it; <hi>akaſhou,</hi> what's the name of that? <hi>namuk,</hi> an ear-ornament; <hi>natooneſhuk,</hi> a ſea-otter's ſkin;
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:030274_0764_0FE5727325102CA8"/>
                        <hi>ableu,</hi> a ſpear; <hi>yaut,</hi> I'll go, or, ſhall I go? <hi>keelaſhnk,</hi> guts of which they make jackets; <hi>naema,</hi> give me ſomething by way of exchange, or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>whaehai,</hi> ſhall I keep it? <hi>ooonaka,</hi> of or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to me.</p>
                     <p>Our knowledge of the animals of this part of the American continent, is entirely derived from the ſkins that were brought by the natives for ſale. Theſe were principally of bears, common and pine martins, ſea-otters, ſeals, racoons, ſmall ermines, foxes, and the whitiſh cat or lynx. Among theſe various ſkins, the moſt common were thoſe of racoons, martins, and ſea-otters, which conſtituted the ordinary dreſs of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but the ſkins of the martins, which were in general of a far lighter brown than thoſe of Nootka, were greatly ſuperior to them in point of fineneſs; whereas thoſe of the ſea-otters, which, as well as the martins, were much more plentiful here than at Nootka, ſeemed to be conſiderably inferior in the thickneſs and fineneſs of their fur, though they far exceeded them with reſpect to ſize; and were, for the moſt part, of the gloſſy black ſort. The ſkins of ſeals and bears were alſo pretty common; and the former were in general white, beautifully ſpotted with black, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſimply white; and many of the bears here were of a dark brown hue.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe animals, there is here the white bear, of whoſe ſkins the natives brought ſeveral
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:030274_0765_0FE57275471CDCA0"/>
pieces, and ſome compleat ſkins of cubs. There is alſo the wolverine, or quickhatch, whoſe ſkin has very bright colours; and a larger ſpecies of ermine than the common one, varied with brown, and having ſcarcely any black on its tail. The ſkin of the head of ſome very large animal was likewiſe brought to us, but we could not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively decide what it was: though, from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and ſhaggineſs of the hair, and its not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling any land animal, we conjectured that it might be that of the male urſine ſeal, or ſea-bear. But one of the moſt beautiful ſkins that fell under our obſervation, is that of a ſmall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal near a foot in length, of a brown colour on the back with a number of obſcure whitiſh ſpecks, the ſides being of a blueiſh aſh colour, with a few of theſe ſpecks. The tail is about a third part of the length of the body, and is covered with whitiſh hair. This animal is doubtleſs the ſame with that which is called by Mr. Staehlin, in his account of the New Northern Archipelago, the ſpotted field mouſe. But whether it is really of the mouſe kind, or a ſquirrel, we could not determine, for want of intire ſkins; though Mr. Anderſon was inclined to imagine, that it is the ſame animal which Mr. Pennant has deſcribed under the appellation of the Caſan marmot. The great number of ſkins that we obſerved here, demonſtrates the abundance of the various ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals we have mentioned; but it is ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:030274_0766_0FE57276CF295518"/>
that we neither met with the ſkins of the mouſe, nor of the common ſpecies of deer.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to birds, we found here the <hi>hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon,</hi> or great king-fiſher, which had fine bright colours; the ſhag; the white-headed eagle; and the humming-bird, which often flew about our ſhips, while we lay at anchor; though it can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed to live here during the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which muſt be extremely ſevere. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fowl ſeen by us were Black ſea-pyes, with red bills, ſuch as we met with in New-Zealand and Van Diemen's Land; geeſe; a ſmall ſort of duck, nearly reſembling that ſpecies we ſaw at Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guelen's Land; and another ſort with which none of us were acquainted. Some of our people who went aſhore, killed a ſnipe, a grouſe, and ſome plovers. But though the water-fowl were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, particularly the geeſe and ducks, they were ſo ſhy that it was ſcarce poſſible to get within ſhot; in conſequence of which, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a very inconſiderable ſupply of them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. The duck before-mentioned is about the ſize of the common wild duck, of a deep black, with red feet, and a ſhort pointed tail. Its bill is white, tinged towards the point with red, and has a large black ſpot, almoſt ſquare, near its baſe, on each ſide, where it is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſtended. On the forehead is a large tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular white ſpot; and on the hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="314" facs="unknown:030274_0767_0FE57278546C35E0"/>
are conſiderably duller than thoſe of the male; and it has none of the ornaments of the bill, excepting the two black ſpots, which are rather obſcure.</p>
                     <p>A ſpecies of diver, which ſeems peculiar to this place, was obſerved here. It is equal to a partridge in ſize, and has a ſhort, black, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed bill. Its head, and the upper part of its neck, are of a browniſh black; and the remainder of its body is of a deep brown, obſcurely waved with black, except the under part, which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally of a blackiſh caſt, minutely varied with white. We alſo found a ſmall land bird, of the finch kind, about the ſize of a yellow-hammer; but we imagined it to be one of thoſe which change their colour with the ſeaſon, and with their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent migrations. It was, at this time, of a duſky brown, with a reddiſh tail; and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed male had, on the crown of the head, a large yellow ſpot, with ſome varied black on the upper part of its neck, but the latter was on the breaſt of the female.</p>
                     <p>The fiſh that were principally brought to us by the natives for ſale, were torſk and halibut; and we caught ſome ſculpins about the ſhip, with ſtar-fiſh of a purpliſh hue, that had ſixteen or eighteen rays. The rocks were almoſt deſtitute of ſhell-fiſh; and the only other animal of this tribe that was obſerved by us, was a reddiſh crab, covered with very large ſpines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="unknown:030274_0768_0FE5727C6D430558"/>The metals ſeen by us were iron and copper; both which, but more particularly the former, were in ſuch abundance, as to form the points of numbers of their lances and arrows. The ores which they made uſe of to paint themſelves with, were a brittle, unctuous, red ochre, or iron ore; a pigment of a bright blue; and black lead. Each of theſe ſeemed to be very ſcarce among them.</p>
                     <p>We obſerved few vegetables of any kind; and the trees that chiefly grew about this ſound, were the Canadian and ſpruce pine, ſome of which were of a conſiderable ſize.</p>
                     <p>Theſe people muſt, doubtleſs, have received from ſome more civilized nation, the beads and iron found among them. We were almoſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that we were the firſt Europeans with whom they had ever had a direct communication; and it remains only to be determined, from what quarter they had procured our manufactures, by intermediate conveyance. And it is more than probable, that they had obtained theſe articles, through the intervention of the more i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If, however, the natives of this inlet are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with European commodities by means of the intermediate traffic to the eaſtern coaſt, it is rather remarkable, that they ſhould never, in return, have ſupplied the more inland Indians with ſome of their ſea-otter ſkins, which would undoubtedly have appeared, at ſome time or other, in the invirons of Hudſon's Bay. But that does not appear to be the caſe; and the only method by which we can account for this, muſt be by conſidering the very great diſtance; which, though it might not prevent European articles of commerce from coming ſo far, as being ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, might hinder the ſkins, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, from paſſing through more than two or three tribes, who might make uſe of them for their own clothing, and ſend others, which they reckoned of inferior value, as being of their own animals, towards the eaſt, till they reach the traders at the European ſettlements.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>LEAVING Prince William's Sound, on Wedneſdy the 20th of May, we ſteered to the ſouth-weſt, with a gentle breeze; which was ſucceeded by a calm at four o'clock the next morning, and that calm was ſoon after followed by a breeze from ſouth-weſt. We continued to ſtretch to the ſouth-weſt, and paſſed a lofty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, in the latitude of 59° 10′, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of 207° 45′. It having been diſcovered on Princeſs Elizabeth's birth-day, Captain Cook gave it the name of <hi>Cape Elizbeth.</hi> As we could ſee no land beyond it, we flattered ourſelves that it was the weſtern extremity of the continent;
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:030274_0771_0FE5728242CDDD70"/>
but we were ſoon convinced that we were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, freſh land appearing in ſight, bearing weſt-ſouth-weſt. The wind had now increaſed to a ſtrong gale, and forced us to a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the coaſt. On the 22d, in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, the gale abated, and we ſtood for Cape Elizabeth; which, about noon the next day, bore weſt, diſtant ten leagues. New land was then ſeen, bearing ſouth-weſt, which, it was imagined connected Cape Elizabeth with the land we had ſeen towards the weſt.</p>
                     <p>We ſtood to the ſouthward till the next day at noon, at which time we were about three leagues from the coaſt, which we had ſeen on the 22d. In this ſituation, it formed a point, that bore weſt-north-weſt. More land was diſcovered, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the ſouthward; on which was ſeen a ridge of mountains, with ſummits covered with ſnow, behind the firſt land, which we ſuppoſed to be an iſland, there appearing on it but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable quantity of ſnow. The latitude of this point of land is 58° 15′, and its longitude 207° 42′. And, by what the Commodore could gather from Beering's Voyage and Chart, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be what he called Cape St. Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes. But the account of that Voyage, as well as the chart, is ſo extremely inaccurate, that it is almoſt impoſſible to diſcover any one place, which that navigator either ſaw or touched at. The Commodore, indeed, was by no means certain,
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:030274_0772_0FE57287755F25A0"/>
that the bay which he had named after Beering, was the place where he had anchored.</p>
                     <p>In the chart above mentioned, a ſpace is here pointed out, where Beering is ſuppoſed to have ſeen no land. This favoured Mr. Staehelin's as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who makes Cape St. Hermogenes, and the land diſcovered by Beering to the ſouth weſt of it, to be a cluſter of iſlands; and that St Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes is one of thoſe which are deſtitute of wood. This appeared to be confirmed by what we now ſaw; and we entertained the pleaſing hopes of finding here a paſſage northward, with out being under the neceſſity of proceeding any farther to the ſouth-weſt.</p>
                     <p>By variable light airs and calms, we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained off the Cape till two o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 25th, when a breeze ſpringing up, we ſteered along the coaſt, and perceived that the land of Cape St. Hermogenes was an iſland, about ſix leagues in circumference ſeparated from the coaſt by a channel of about one league in breadth. Some rocks lie above water, a league and a half to the north of this iſland; and on the north-eaſt ſide of the rocks, we had from thirty to twenty fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>About noon, St. Hermogenes bore ſouth-eaſt, diſtant eight leagues; the land to the north-weſt extending from ſouth half weſt to near weſt. In the laſt direction it ended in a low point, named <hi>Point Banks.</hi> The ſhip was, at this time, in
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:030274_0773_0FE5728ACE9E14A8"/>
the latitude of 58° 41′, and in the longitude of 207° 44′. In this ſituation, the land was in ſight bearing north-weſt, which, it was imagined, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected Cape Elizabeth with this ſouth-weſt land. When we approached it, we ſaw it was a groupe of high iſlands and rocks, and conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with any other land. From the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their appearance, they were denominated the <hi>Barren Iſles:</hi> they are ſituated in the latitude of 59°, three leagues diſtant from Cape Elizabeth, and five from Point Banks.</p>
                     <p>We intended to have paſſed through one of the channels by which theſe iſlands are divided; but, a ſtrong current ſetting againſt us, we went to the leeward of them all. The weather, which had been thick and hazy, cleared up towards the evening, and we perceived a very lofty promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, whoſe elevated ſummit appeared above the clouds, forming two exceedingly high mountains. The Commodore named this promontory <hi>Cape Douglas,</hi> in honour of his friend Dr. Douglas canon of Windſor. Its latitude is 58° 56′, and its longitude 206° 10′; twelve leagues from Point Banks, and ten to the weſtward of the Barren Iſles.</p>
                     <p>The coaſt ſeemed to form a large deep bay, between this point and Cape Douglas; which, from our obſerving ſome ſmoke upon Point Banks received the name of <hi>Smokey Bay.</hi> On the 26th, at day-break, being to the northward of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:030274_0774_0FE5728C867B60C8"/>
Iſles, we perceived more land, extending from Cape Douglaſs to the north. It conſiſted of a chain of very high mountains; one of which being much more conſpicious than the reſt, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the name of <hi>Mount St Auguſtin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We were not diſcouraged at perceiving this land, ſuppoſing it to be wholly unconnected with the land of Cape Elizabath. We alſo expected to find a paſſage to the north-weſt, betwen Cape Douglaſs and Mount St. Auguſtin. It was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, imagined, that the land to the north of Cape Douglaſs, conſiſted of a groupe of iſlands, ſeperated by ſo many channels, any of which we might have choſen, according to the direction of the wind.</p>
                     <p>Flattered with theſe ideas, and having a freſh gale at north-north-eaſt, we ſtood to the north-weſt, till eight o'clock, when we were fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that what we had ſuppoſed to be the iſlands, were ſummits of mountains, connected by the lower land, which we could not perceive at a greater diſtance, on account of the hazineſs of the horizon. This land was covered wholly with ſnow, from the tops of the mountains down to the ſea beach; and had, in every other reſpect, the appearance of a great continent. Captain Cook was now fully convinced that he ſhould diſcover no paſſage by this inlet: and his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in the ſearch of it, was more to ſatisfy others, than to confirm his own opinion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="322" facs="unknown:030274_0775_0FE5728E0BE011D0"/>Mount St. Auguſtin, at this time, bore north weſt, about three leagues diſtant. It is of vaſt height, and of a conical figure; but whether it be an iſland, or part of the continent, is not yet aſcertained. Perceiving that nothing was to be done to the weſt, we ſtood over to Cape Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, under which we fetched at about five in the afternoon.</p>
                     <p>Between Cape Elizabeth and a lofty promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, named <hi>Cape Bede</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">This name, and that of Mount St. Auguſtin, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by our calendar.</note>, is a bay, in which there appeared to be two ſnug harbours. We ſtood into this bay, and might have anchored there in twenty-three fathoms water: but, the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore having no ſuch intention, we tacked, and ſtood to the weſtward, with a very ſtrong gale, accompanied with rain and hazy weather. The gale abated the next morning, and about three o'clock in the afternoon, the weather cleared up; Cape Douglaſs bearing ſouth-weſt by weſt, and the depth of water being forty fathoms, over a rocky bottom.</p>
                     <p>The coaſt from Cape Bede, trended north-eaſt by eaſt, with a chain of mountains inla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, in the ſame direction. On the coaſt, the land was woody, and there appeared to be ſome commodious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. We had the mortification, however, to diſcover low land in the middle of the inlet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:030274_0776_0FE5729659EE8CC0"/>
from north-north-eaſt, to north-eaſt by eaſt; but, as it was ſuppoſed to be an iſland, we were not much diſcouraged. About this time we ſteered, with a light breeze, to the weſtward of this low land; as, in that direction, there was no appearance of obſtruction. Our ſoundings were from thirty to twenty-five fathoms.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 28th, having but little wind, the ſhip drove to the ſouthward; and, in order to ſtop her, we dropped a kedge-anchor, with an eight inch hauſer. But, in bringing the ſhip up, we loſt both that and the anchor. We brought the ſhip up, however, with one of the bowers, and ſpent a conſiderable part of the day in ſweeping for them, but without effect. We were now in the latitude of 59° 51′; the low-land extended from north eaſt to ſouth-eaſt, the neareſt part diſtant about two leagues. The land on the weſtern ſhore was diſtant about ſeven leagues. A ſtrong tide ſet to the ſouth-ward, out of the inlet; it was the ebb, and ran almoſt four knots in an hour. At ten o'clock it was low water. Great quantities of ſea-weed, and ſome drift wood, were taken out with the tide. Though the water had become thick, and reſembled that in rivers, we were encouraged to proceed, by finding it as ſalt as the ocean, even at low water. Three knots was the ſtrength of the flood tide; and the ſtream continued to run up till four in the afternoon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="324" facs="unknown:030274_0777_0FE572996174F100"/>Having a calm the whole day, we moved with a light breeze at eaſt, at eight o'clock in the evening, and ſtood to the north, up the inlet. The wind, ſoon after, veered to the north, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a freſh gale, and blew in ſqualls, with ſome rain. But this did not hinder us from ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up while the flood continued, which was till the next morning, at near five o'clock. We had from thirty-five to twenty-four fathoms water. We anchored about two leagues from the eaſtern ſhore, where our latitude was 6o° 8′; ſome low land, which we ſuppoſed to be an iſland, lying under the weſtern ſhore, diſtant between three and four leagues.</p>
                     <p>The weather having now become fair and clear, we could ſee any land within our horizon; when nothing was viſible to obſtruct our progreſs in a north-eaſt direction. But a ridge of mountains appeared on each ſide, riſing behind each other, without any ſeparation. Captain Cook ſuppoſed it to be low water about ten o'clock, but the ebb ran down till almoſt twelve. Two columns of ſmoke were now viſible on the eaſtern ſhore; a certain ſign that inhabitants were near. We weighed at one in the afternoon, and plied up under double reefed topſails, having a ſtrong gale at north eaſt.</p>
                     <p>We ſtretched over to the weſtern ſhore, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have taken ſhelter till th gale ſhould ceaſe; but falling ſuddenly from forty fathoms water
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:030274_0778_0FE5729C10189330"/>
into twelve, and ſeeing the apperance of a ſhoal, we ſtretched back to the eaſtward, and anchored in nineteen fathoms water, under the eaſtern ſhore; the north-weſt part of which, ended in a bluff point.</p>
                     <p>On the 30th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, we weighed anchor again, the gale hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much abated, but ſtill continuing contrary. We plied up till near ſeven, and then anchored in nineteen fathoms water, under the ſhore to the eaſtward.</p>
                     <p>Two canoes, with a man in each, came off to the ſhip about noon, nearly from that part where we had ſeen the ſmoke the day before. It coſt them ſome labour to paddle acroſs the ſtrong tide; and they heſitated a little, before they dared ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to approach us. One of them was very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious, but to no purpoſe, for we could not underſtand a ſyllable he ſaid: while he was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he kept pointing continually to the ſhore, which we ſuppoſed to be an invitation for us to go thither. Captain Cook made them a preſent of a few trifles, which he conveyed to them from the quarter gallery.</p>
                     <p>Theſe people ſtrongly reſembled thoſe we had ſeen in Prince William's Sound, both in dreſs and perſon: their canoes were alſo conſtructed in the ſame manner. One of our viſitors ſeemed to have no beard, and his face was painted of a jet black; the other, who was older, was not paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:030274_0779_0FE5729DE5139B90"/>
but he had a large beard, and a countenance like the common ſort of the people in the Sound. Smoke was this day ſeen upon the flat weſtern ſhore; whence we inferred, that theſe lower ſpots only are inhabited.</p>
                     <p>As we weighed when the flood made, the canoes quitted us. We ſtood over to the weſtern ſhore, with a freſh gale, and fetched under the point above mentioned. This, with the point on the oppoſite ſhore, contracted the breadth of the channel to about four leagues, through which ran a prodigious tide. It had a terrible appearance, as we were ignorant whether the water was thus agitated by the ſtream, or by the daſhing of the waves againſt ſands or rocks. Meeting with no ſhoal, we concluded it to be the former, but we afterwards found ourſelves miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>We kept the weſtern ſhore aboard, that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be the faireſt. We had a depth of thirteen fathoms near the ſhore, and, two or three miles off, upwards of forty. In the evening, about eight o'clock, we anchored under a point of land bearing north-eaſt, diſtant about three leagues, and lay there during the ebb.</p>
                     <p>Till we arrived here, the water retained an equal degree of ſaltneſs, both at high and low water, and was as ſalt as that which is in the ocean; but now the marks of a river evidently diſplayed themſelves. The water, which was taken up at this ebb, was much freſher than any
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:030274_0780_0FE572A629ABE860"/>
we had taſted; whence we concluded that we were in a large river, and not in a ſtrait which had a communication with the northern ſeas. But having proceeded thus far, we were anxious to have ſtronger proofs; and, therefore, in the morning of the 31ſt we weighed with the flood, and drove up with the tide, having but little wind.</p>
                     <p>We were attended, about eight o'clock, by many of the the natives, in one large canoe, and ſeveral ſmall ones. The latter had only one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on board each; and ſome of the paddles had a blade at each end, like thoſe of the Eſquimaux. Men, women, and children, were contained in the large canoes. At ſome diſtance from the ſhip, they exhibited on a long pole, a kind of leathern frock, which we interpreted to be a ſign of their peaceable intentions. They conveyed this frock into the ſhip, as an acknowledgement for ſome trifles which the Commodore had given them.</p>
                     <p>No difference appeared either in the perſons, dreſs, or canoes of theſe people, and the natives of Prince William's Sound, except that the ſmall canoes were not ſo large as thoſe of the Sound, and carried only one man.</p>
                     <p>We bartered with them for ſome of their fur dreſſes, made of the ſkins of animals; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of ſea-otters, martins, and hares: we alſo had a few of their dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="328" facs="unknown:030274_0781_0FE572A7FA95D168"/>
and halibut. We gave them in exchange for theſe, ſome old cloths, beads, and pieces of iron.</p>
                     <p>They were already poſſeſſed of large iron knives, and glaſs beads of a ſky blue colour, ſuch as we ſaw among the inhabitants of Prince Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's Sound. The latter, as well as thoſe which they received of us, they ſeemed to value highly. But they were particularly earneſt in aſking for large pieces of iron, to which they gave the name of <hi>goone;</hi> though with them, as well as with their neighbours in the Sound, one word ſeemed to have many ſignifications. Their language is certainly the ſame, the words <hi>

After paſſing about two hours between the two ſhips, they retired to the weſtern ſhore.</p>
                     <p>We anchored at nine o'clock, in ſixteen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms water, and almoſt two leagues from the weſtern ſhore, the ebb being already begun. It ran but three knots an hour at its greateſt ſtrength; and fell, after we had anchored, twenty-one feet upon a perpendicular. The weather was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately clear and miſty, with drizling rain. When it was clear, we perceived low land between the mountains on the eaſtern ſhore, bearing eaſt from the ſtation of the ſhips, which we concluded to be iſlands between us and the main land. We
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:030274_0782_0FE548C2D0736D00"/>
alſo beheld low land to the northward, which appeared to extend from the mountains on one ſide, to thoſe on the other; and, at low water, large ſhoals were ſeen, ſtretching out from this low land, from ſome of which we were not far diſtant. We doubted, from theſe appearances, whether the inlet did not take an eaſterly direction through the above opening; or whether that opening was only a branch of it, the main chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel continuing its northern direction. The chain of mountains, on each ſide of it, ſtrongly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced the latter ſuppoſition.</p>
                     <p>To be ſatisfied of theſe particulars, Captain Cook diſpatched two boats; and, when the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide made, followed with the two ſhips: but it being a dead calm, and having a ſtrong tide, we anchored, after driving about ten miles. At the loweſt of the ebb, the water at and near the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face was perfectly freſh; though retaining a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of ſaltneſs, if taken above a foot below it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We had this and many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proofs of its being a river: ſuch as thick muddy water, low ſhores, trees and rubbiſh of various kinds, floating backwards and forwards with the tide. In the afternoon we received ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſit from the natives, in ſeveral canoes, who trafficked conſiderably with our people, without ſo much as attempting any diſhoneſt action.</p>
                     <p>At two o'clock in the morning of the firſt of June, the maſter, who commanded the two boats
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:030274_0783_0FE572A98472E2B0"/>
returned, informing us that he found the inlet, or river, contracted to one league in breadth, and that it took a northerly courſe through low land on each ſide. He advanced about three leagues through this narrow part, which he found from twenty to ſeventeen fathoms deep. While the ſtream ran down, the water was perfectly freſh; but it became brackiſh when it ran up, and very much ſo towards high water.</p>
                     <p>He went aſhore upon an iſland, between this branch and that to the eaſt, and ſaw ſome cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant buſhes; and ſome other fruit trees and buſhes that were unknown to him. About three leagues to the northward of this ſearch, he ſaw another ſeparation in the eaſtern chain of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, through which he ſuppoſed it probable the river took a north-eaſt direction; but this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, was only another branch, and the main channel continued in a northern direction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two chains of mountains.</p>
                     <p>The hopes of finding a paſſage were no longer entertained; but as the ebb was ſpent, and we were unable to return againſt the tide, we took the advantage of the latter, to get a cloſer view of the eaſtern branch; in order to determine whether the low land on the eaſt, was an iſland or not. For this purpoſe we weighed with the firſt of the flood, and ſtood over for the eaſtern ſhore. At eight o'clock a breeze ſprung up in an oppoſite direction to our courſe, ſo that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:030274_0784_0FE572AB0BB80000"/>
of reaching the entrance of the river. The Commodore, therefore, diſpached two boats. under the command of Lieutenant King, to make ſuch obſervations as might enable us to form ſome tolerable idea of the nature of the river.</p>
                     <p>We anchored, about ten o'clock, in nine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms water. The Commodore obſerving the ſtrength of the tide to be ſo great, that the boats could not make head againſt it, made a ſignal for them to return before they had proceeded half way to the entrance of the river. The chief knowledge obtained by this tide's work, was, that all the low land, which we imagined to be an iſland, was one continued tract from the great river to the foot of the mountains, terminating at the ſouth entrance of this eaſtern branch, which the Commodore denominated the <hi>river Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again.</hi> The low land begins again on the north ſide of this river and extends from the foot of the mountains, to the banks of the great river; forming, before the river Turnagain, a large bay, having from twelve to five fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>After entering the bay, the flood ſet very ſtrong into the river Turnagain, and the ebb came out ſtill ſtronger, the water falling twenty feet upon a perpendicular. From theſe circumſtances, it plainly appeared, that a paſſage was not to be expected by this ſide river, any more than by the main branch. But, as the water at ebb, though much freſher, retained a conſiderable degree of
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:030274_0785_0FE572B2350CA0A0"/>
ſaltneſs, it is probable that both theſe branches are navigable by ſhips much farther; and that a very extenſive inland communication lies open, by means of this river and its ſeveral branches. We had traced it to the latitude of 61° 30′, and the longitude of 219°, which is upwards of ſeveral leagues from its entrance end ſaw no appearance of its ſource.</p>
                     <p>The time we ſpent in the diſcovery of this great river <note n="*" place="bottom">Captain Cook having here left a blank, Lord Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich very judiciouſly directed it to be called <hi>Cook's River.</hi>
                        </note> ought not to be regretted, if it ſhould hereafter prove uſeful to the preſent, or any future age. But the delay, thus occaſioned, was an eſſential loſs to us, who had an object of greater magnitude in view. The ſeaſon was far advanced; and it was now evident that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of North America extended much farther to the weſt, than we had reaſon to expect from the moſt approved charts. The Commodore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had the ſatisfaction to reflect, that, if he had not examined this very large river, ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fabricators of geography would have ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſert that it had a communication with the ſea to the north, or with Hudſon's or Baffin's bay to the eaſt; and it would probably have been marked, on future maps of the world with as much appearance of preciſion, as the imaginary ſtraits of de Fuca, and de Fonte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="333" facs="unknown:030274_0786_0FE572B3BA866FE8"/>Mr. King was again ſent, in the afternoon, with two armed boats, with orders from Captain Cook to land on the ſouth eaſt ſide of the river, where he was to diſplay the flag; and, in his Majeſty's name, to take poſſeſſion of the country and the river. He was alſo ordered to bury a bottle in the earth, containing ſome Engliſh coin of 1772, and a paper, whereon were written the names of our ſhips, and the date of our diſcovery. The ſhips, in the mean time, were got under ſail. The wind blew freſh eaſterly; but we had not been long under way before a calm enſued; and the flood tide meeting us, we found it neceſſary to anchor in ſix fathoms water; the point where Mr. King landed bearing ſouth, at the diſtance of two miles. This point of land was named <hi>Point Poſſeſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On Mr. King's return, he informed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, that when he approached the ſhore, he ſaw eighteen or twenty of the natives with their arms extended; an attitude, he ſuppoſed, meant to ſignify their peaceable diſpoſition, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him that they were without weapons. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. King and his attendants land, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving muſquets in their hands, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed, and requeſted (by expreſſive ſigns) that they would lay them down. This was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately complied with, and then Mr. King and his party were permitted to walk up to them,
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:030274_0787_0FE572B54402F270"/>
when they appeared to be very ſociable and chearful.</p>
                     <p>They had with them ſeveral dogs, and a few pieces of freſh ſalmon. Mr. Law, Surgeon of the Diſcovery, happened to be of the party, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed one of the dogs, and, taking it towards the boat, immediately ſhot it dead. At this they ſeemed exceedingly ſurprized; and, not thinking themſelves ſafe in ſuch company, they walked away; but it preſently appeared, that they had concealed their ſpears and other weapons in the buſhes cloſe behind them. Mr. King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that the ground was ſwampy, and the ſoil poor and light. It, however, produced ſome pines, alders, birch, and willows; ſome roſe and current buſhes, and a little graſs; but there was not a plant in flower to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>When it was high water we weighed anchor, and, with a faint breeze, ſtood over to the weſt ſhore, where we anchored early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on account of the return of the flood. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after we were viſited by ſeveral of the natives, in canoes, who bartered their ſkins, and afterwards parted with their garments, many of them returning perfectly naked. Among others they brought a great quantity of the ſkins of white rabbits and red foxes, but only two or three of thoſe of otters. We alſo purchaſed ſome pieces of halibut and ſalmon. They gave iron the preference to every thing we offered them in
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:030274_0788_0FE572B71B64BDB8"/>
exchange. The lip-ornaments were leſs in faſhion among them than at Prince William's Sound; but thoſe which paſs through the noſe were more frequent, and in general, conſiderably longer. They had, likewiſe, more embroidered work on their garments, quivers, knife-caſes, and many other articles.</p>
                     <p>We weighed at half paſt ten, and plied down the river with a gentle breeze at ſouth; when, by the inattention of the man at the lead, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſtruck, and ſtuck upon a bank, nearly in the middle of the river. It is pretty certain that this bank occaſioned that ſtrong agitation of the ſtream, with which we were ſo much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized when turning up the river. We had twelve feet depth of water about the ſhip, at the loweſt of the ebb, but the bank was dry in other parts.</p>
                     <p>When the Reſolution came aground, Captain Cook made a ſignal for the Diſcovery to anchor. We were afterwards informed, that ſhe had been almoſt a ſhore on the weſt ſide of the bank. About five o'clock in the afternoon, as the flood tide came in, the ſhip floated off without ſuſtaining any damage, or occaſioning the leaſt trouble. We then ſtood over to the weſt ſhore, where we anchored, in deep water, to wait for the ebb, the wind being ſtill unfavourable to us.</p>
                     <p>At ten o'clock at night we weighed with the ebb; and about five the next morning, (the 3d
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:030274_0789_0FE572BCED729CF0"/>
of June) the tide being finiſhed, we caſt anchor on the weſt ſhore, about two miles below the bluff point. When we were in this ſtation we were viſited by many of the natives, who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us all the morning; and, indeed, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was highly acceptable to us, as they brought with them a quantity of fine ſalmon, which they exchanged for ſome of our trifles. Several hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight of it was procured for the two ſhips, and the greateſt part of it ſplit, and ready for drying.</p>
                     <p>The mountains now, for the firſt time after our entering the river, were free from clouds, and we perceived a volcano in one of thoſe on the weſtern ſide. Its latitude is 60° 23′; and it is the firſt high mountain north of Mount St. Auguſtin. The volcano is near the ſummit, and on that part of the mountain next the river. It emits a white ſmoke, but no fire. The wind continuing ſoutherly, we ſtill tided it down the river; and, on the morning of the 5th, arriving at the place where we had loſt our kedge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, we attempted, though unſucceſsfully, to recover it.</p>
                     <p>Before our departure from this place, we were again viſited by ſome of the natives, in ſix canoes, from the eaſtern ſhore. For half an hour they remained at a ſmall diſtance from the ſhips, gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them with a kind of ſilent ſurprize, without uttering a ſyllable to us, or to each other. At

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor did they leave us till they had parted with their ſkins and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which were the only articles they had brought to traffic with.</p>
                     <p>It may not be unneceſſary to remark, that all the people we had ſeen in this river, had a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſemblance, in every particular, to thoſe who inhabit Prince William's Sound, but differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt eſſentially from thoſe of Nootka, as well in their perſons as their language.</p>
                     <p>The points of their ſpears and knives are made of iron; ſome of the former, indeed, are made of copper. Their ſpears reſemble our ſpontoons; and their knives, for which they have ſheaths, are of a conſiderable length. Except thoſe, and a few glaſs beads, every thing we ſaw amongſt them was of their own manufacture. We have already hazarded conjectures from whence they derive their foreign articles. It cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, however, that the Ruſſians have been amongſt them, for we ſhould not then have ſeen them cloathed in ſuch valuable ſkins as thoſe of the ſea-otter.</p>
                     <p>A very beneficial fur trade might certainly be carried on with the natives of this vaſt coaſt; but, without a northern paſſage, it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote for Great-Britain to be benefited by ſuch commerce. It ſhould, however, be obſerved, that almoſt the only valuable ſkins, on, this weſt
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:030274_0791_0FE572C08C877560"/>
ſide of North America, are thoſe of the ſea-otter. Their other ſkins were of a ſuperior quality; and it ſhould be farther obſerved, that the greater part of the ſkins, which we purchaſed of them, were made up into garments. Some of them indeed, were in pretty good condition, others, old and ragged, and all of them extremely louſy. But, as ſkins are uſed by theſe people only for cloathing themſelves, they, perhaps, are not at the trouble of dreſſing more of them than they require for this purpoſe. This is probably the chief cauſe of their killing the animals, for they principally receive their ſupply of food from the ſea and rivers. But if they were once habituated to a conſtant trade with foreigners, ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe would increaſe their wants, by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with new luxuries; to be enabled to purchaſe which, they would become more aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in procuring ſkins; a plentiful ſupply of which might doubtleſs be obtained in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                     <p>The tide is very conſiderable in this river, and greatly aſſiſts to facilitate the navigation of it. In the ſtream, it is high water between two and three o'clock, on the days of the new and full moon; and the tide riſes between three and four fathoms. The mouth of the river being in a corner of the coaſt, the ocean forces the flood into it by both ſhores, which ſwells the tide to a greater height than at other parts of this coaſt.</p>

                     <p>THE ebb tide making in our favour, we weighed, and, with a gentle breeze at ſouth-weſt, plied down the river. The flood, however, obliged us to anchor again; but, about one o'clock the next morning, we got under ſail with a freſh breeze, paſſed the barren iſlands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight, and at noon Cape St. Hermogenes bore ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, about eight leagues diſtant. We intended to go through the paſſage between the iſland of that name and the main land; but the wind ſoon after failed us, and we had baffling airs from the eaſtward; we, therefore, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:030274_0793_0FE572C9B6B7DBB8"/>
the deſign of carrying our ſhip through that paſſage.</p>
                     <p>We now beheld ſeveral columns of ſmoke on the continent, northward of the paſſage; which were probably meant as ſignals to attract us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The land forms a bay here, a low rocky iſland lying off the north-weſt point of it. Some other iſlands, of a ſimilar appearance, are ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the coaſt between here and Point Banks.</p>
                     <p>About eight in the evening, St. Hermogenes extended from ſouth half eaſt to ſouth-ſouth-eaſt; and the rocks bore ſouth-eaſt, diſtant three miles. Here we had forty fathoms water, and catched ſeveral halibut with hooks and lines. We paſſed the rocks, and bore up to the ſouthward about midnight; and, on the 7th at noon, St. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes bore north, at the diſtance of four leagues. The ſouthernmoſt point of the main land lay north half weſt, five leagues diſtant. The latitude of this promontory is 58° 15′, and its longitude 207° 24′. It was named, after the day, <hi>Cape-Whitſunday;</hi> and a large bay to the weſt; of it, was called <hi>Whitſuntide Bay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The wind, which had been at north-eaſt, ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſouthward about two in the afternoon. The weather was gloomy, and the air cold. At midnight we ſtood in for the land, and at ſeven o'clock in the morning of the 8th, we were within four miles of it, and leſs than two miles from ſome ſunken rocks, bearing weſt-ſouth-weſt.
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:030274_0794_0FE572CBB37078E8"/>
Here we anchored in thirty-five fathoms water. In ſtanding in for the coaſt, we paſſed the mouth of Whitſuntide Bay, and perceived land all round the bottom of it; therefore the land muſt either be connected, or the points lock in behind each other; the former conjecture appears to be the moſt probable. There are ſome ſmall iſlands to the weſt of the bay. To the ſouthward the ſea coaſt is low, with projecting rocky points, having ſmall inlets between them. Upon the coaſt there was no wood, and but little ſnow; but the mountains, at ſome diſtance inland, were entirely covered with ſnow. We were now in the latitude of 57° 52 ½; the land here forming a point, it was named <hi>Cape Greville.</hi> Its latitude is 57° 33′, and its longitude 207° 15′. It is fifteen leagues diſtant from St. Hermogenes.</p>
                     <p>The 9th, 10th, and 11th, we had conſtant miſty weather, with ſome rain, and ſeldom had a ſight of the coaſt; we had a gentle breeze of wind, and the air was raw and cold. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued plying up the coaſt.</p>
                     <p>In the evening of the 12th, the fog clearing up, we ſaw the land about twelve leagues diſtant, bearing weſt; and we ſtood in for it early the next morning. At noon we were within three miles of it; an elevated point, which was named <hi>Cape Barnabas,</hi> in the latitude of 57° 13′, bore north-north-eaſt, at the diſtance of about ten miles. We could not ſee the north-eaſt extreme
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:030274_0795_0FE572CD3A6AA6A0"/>
for the haze, but the point to the ſouth-weſt had an elevated ſummit, which terminated in two round hills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was therefore called <hi>Two-headed Point.</hi> This part of the coaſt is principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of high hills, and deep vallies. We could ſometimes perceive the tops of other hills beyond thoſe which form the coaſt, which had a very barren appearance, though not much incumbered with ſnow. Not a tree or buſh was to be found, and the land, in general, had a browniſh hue.</p>
                     <p>We continued to ply, and, at about ſix in the evening, being about midway between Cape Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas and Two-headed Point, two leagues from the ſhore we had ſixty-two fathoms water. Here a low point of land was obſerved, bearing ſouth 69° weſt. On the 14th, at noon, we were in the latitude of 56° 49′. The land ſeen in the preceding evening now appeared like two iſlands. We were up with the ſouthernmoſt part of this land the next morning, and perceived it to be an iſland, which obtained the name of <hi>Trinity Iſland.</hi> Its greateſt extent, in the direction of eaſt and weſt, if about ſix leagues. It has naked elevated land at each end, and is low towards the middle. Its latitude is 56° 36′, and its longitude 205′. It is diſtant about three leagues from the continent, between which rocks and iſlands are interſperſed. There ſeems, nevertheleſs, to be good paſſage, and ſafe anchorage. We at firſt, imagined that
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:030274_0796_0FE572CEC3918F18"/>
this was Beering's <hi>Foggy Iſland;</hi> but its ſituation is not agreeable to his chart.</p>
                     <p>In the evening at eight, we were within a league of the ſmall iſlands above mentioned. The weſternmoſt point of the continent, now in view, we called <hi>Cape Trinity,</hi> it being a low point facing Trinity Iſland. in this ſituation, we ſtood over for the iſland, meaning to work up between that and the main. In ſtanding over towards the iſland, we met two men in a canoe, paddling from thence to the main: inſtead of approaching us, they ſeemed carefully to avoid it.</p>
                     <p>The wind now inclining to the ſouth, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it would preſently be at ſouth-eaſt; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from experience, that a ſouth-eaſterly wind was here generally accompanied with a thick fog, we were afraid to venture between the iſland and the continent, leſt we ſhould not be able, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh our paſſage before night, or before the foggy weather came on; when we ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of anchoring, and loſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a fair wind. Induced by theſe reaſons, we ſtretched out to ſea, and paſſed two or three rocky iſlets, near the eaſt end of Trinity Iſland. Having weathered the iſland, we tacked about four in the afternoon, and ſteered weſt ſoutherly, with a gale at ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, which veered to the ſouth-eaſt about midnight, and was attended with miſty rainy weather.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="344" facs="unknown:030274_0797_0FE572D37122C028"/>We expected, from the courſe we ſteered during the night, to fall in with the continent in the morning; and we ſhould, doubtleſs, have ſeen it if the weather had been clear. No land appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at noon, and the gale and fog increaſing, we ſteered weſt-north-weſt, under ſuch ſail as we could haul the wind with; ſenſible of the danger of running before a ſtrong gale, in the vicinity of an unknown coaſt, and in a thick fog. It was, however, become neceſſary to run ſome riſk, when the wind was favourable to us; as we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that clear weather was generally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with weſterly winds.</p>
                     <p>About three in the afternoon, land was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived through the fog, bearing north-weſt, about three miles diſtant. We inſtantly hauled up ſouth, cloſe to the wind. The two courſes were ſoon after ſplit, and we had others to bring to the yards: ſeveral of our ſails received conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble damage. The gale abated, and the weather cleared up about nine; when we again ſaw the coaſt, about the diſtance of five leagues. Our depth was a hundred fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>The fog returned ſoon after, and was diſperſed about four o'clock the next morning; when we found ourſelves, in ſome degree, ſurrounded by land; the continent, or that which we ſuppoſed to be the continent, ſome elevated land, bearing ſouth-eaſt, about nine leagues diſtant. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of the main, at the north-eaſt, was the
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:030274_0798_0FE572D5B002DCF0"/>
point of land ſeen during the fog; it was named <hi>Foggy Cape,</hi> and lies in the latitude of 56° 31′.</p>
                     <p>Having had but little wind all night, a breeze now ſprung up at north-weſt; we ſtood to the ſouthward with this, in order to make the land plainer, that was ſeen in that direction. About nine o'clock, we diſcovered it to be an iſland, nine miles in circumference, in the latitude of 56° 10′, and the longitude of 202° 45′. In our chart, it is named <hi>Foggy Iſland,</hi> it being reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuppoſe, from its ſituation, that it is the iſland on which Beering had beſtowed the ſame appellation. Three or four iſlands bore north by weſt; a point, with pinnacle rocks upon it, bore north-weſt by weſt, called <hi>Pinnacle Point;</hi> and a cluſter of iſlets ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, about nine leagues from the coaſt. In the afternoon we had very little wind, and our progreſs was inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday the 17th, we had gentle breeze<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> between weſt and north-weſt; the weather was perfectly clear, and the air dry and ſharp. The continent, about noon, extended from ſouth-weſt to north by eaſt; the neareſt part about ſeven or eight leagues diſtant; a group of iſlands ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſouth-weſt, about the ſame diſtance from the continent.</p>
                     <p>The weather was clear and pleaſant on the 18th, and it was calm the greateſt part of the day. There is, probably, a continuation of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:030274_0799_0FE572D736073128"/>
between Foggy Cape and Trinity Iſland, which the thick weather hindered us from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
                     <p>The Commodore having occaſion to ſend a boat to the Diſcovery, one of the people a-board her, ſhot a moſt beautiful bird. It is ſmaller than a duck, and the colour is black, except that the fore-part of the head is white; behind each eye, an elegant yellowiſh-white creſt ariſes; the bill and feet are of reddiſh colour. The firſt we ſaw of theſe birds was to the ſouthward of Cape St. Hermogenes; after which we ſaw them daily, and frequently in large flocks. We often ſaw moſt of the other ſea-birds, that are uſually met with in the northern ocean; ſuch as ſhags, gulls, puffins, ſheer-waters, ducks, geeſe, and ſwans; and we ſeldom paſſed a day, without ſeeing whales, ſeals, and other fiſh of great magnitude.</p>
                     <p>We got a light breeze, ſoutherly, in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and ſteered weſt, for the channel between the iſlands and the continent. At day-break next morning, we were not far from it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral other iſlands, within thoſe that we had already ſeen, of various dimenſions. But, between theſe iſlands, and thoſe we had ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there appeared to be a clear channel, for which we ſteered; and, at noon, our latitude was 55° 18′, in the narroweſt part of the channel. Of this groupe of iſlands, the largeſt was now upon our left, and is called <hi>Kodiak,</hi> as we were
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:030274_0800_0FE572D8BB6ED800"/>
afterwards informed. The Commodore did not beſtow a name upon any of the others, though he ſuppoſed them to be the ſame that Beering has named Schumagin's Iſlands<note n="*" place="bottom">Decouve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tes des Ruſſes, par Muller, p. 262.277.</note>. Iſlands appeared to the ſouthward, as far as an iſland could be ſeen. They begin in the longitude of 200° 15′ eaſt, and extend about two degrees to the weſtward.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of theſe iſlands are tolerably high, but very barren and rugged; exhibiting very roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic appearances, and abounding with rocks and cliffs. They have ſeveral bays and coves about them, and ſome freſh-water ſtreams deſcend from their elevated parts, but the land was not embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with a ſingle tree or buſh. Plenty of ſnow ſtill remained on many of them, as well as on thoſe parts of the continent which appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the innermoſt iſlands.</p>
                     <p>By four o'clock in the afternoon, we had paſſed all the iſlands to the ſouth of us. We found thirty fathoms water in the channel, and ſoon after we had got through it, the Diſcovery, which was two miles aſtern, fired three guns, and brought too, making a ſignal to ſpeak with us. Captain Cook was much alarmed at this; for, as no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger had been obſerved in the channel, he was apprehenſive that the Diſcovery had ſprung a leak, or met with ſome ſimilar accident. A boat was ſent to her, which immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:030274_0801_0FE548C0337AB600"/>
with Captain Clerke. He informed the Commodore, that ſome natives in three or four canoes, having followed the ſhip for ſome time, at laſt got under his ſtern; one of whom made many ſigns, having his cap off and bowing in the European manner. A rope was then handed down from the ſhip, to which he faſtened a thin wooden box, and, after he had made ſome more geſticulations, the canoes left the Diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>It was not imagined, that the box contained any thing, till the canoes had departed, when it was accidently opened, and found to contain a piece of paper carefully folded up, on which ſome wrighting appeared, which they ſuppoſed to be in the Ruſſian language. To this paper was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed the date 1778, and a reference was made therein to the year 1779. Though unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher the alphabet of the writer, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, by his numerals, that others had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded us in viſiting theſe dreary regions. Indeed the hopes of ſpeedily meeting ſome of the Ruſſian traders, muſt be highly ſatisfactory to thoſe, who had been ſo long converſant with the ſavages of the Pacific Ocean, and thoſe of the continent of North America.</p>
                     <p>At firſt, Captain Clerke imagined, that ſome Ruſſians had been ſhipwrecked here; and that, ſeeing our ſhips, theſe unfortunate perſons were induced thus to inform us of their ſituation. Deeply impreſſed with ſentiments of humanity on
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:030274_0802_0FE572E0A5995208"/>
this occaſion, he was in hopes the Reſolution would have ſtopped till they had time to join us; hut no ſuch idea ever occured to Captain Cook. If this had really been the caſe, he ſuppoſed, that the firſt ſtep which ſuch ſhipwrecked perſons would have taken, in order to ſecure relief, would have been, to ſend ſome of their people off to the ſhips in the canoes. He, therefore, rather thought the paper was intended to communicate ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, from ſome Ruſſian trader, who had lately viſited theſe iſlands, to be delivered to any of his countrymen who ſhould arrive; and that the natives ſuppoſing us to be Ruſſians, had brought off the note. Convinced of this, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no farther into the matter, but made ſail, and ſteered to the weſtward.</p>
                     <p>We ran all night with a gentle breeze at north-eaſt; and the next morning at two ſome breakers were ſeen within us, diſtant about two miles; others were ſoon after ſeen a-head, and they were innumerable on our larboard bow, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the land. By holding a ſouth courſe we, with difficulty, cleared them. Theſe breakers were produced by rocks, many of which were above water; they are very dangerous, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſeven leagues from land. We got on their out ſide about noon, when our latitude was 54° 44′, and our longitude 198′. The neareſt land was an elevated bluff point and was named <hi>Rock-Point</hi>; it bore north, about eight leagues diſtance;
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:030274_0803_0FE572E30E412798"/>
the weſternmoſt part of the main bore north-weſt, and a high round hill, called <hi>Halibut Head,</hi> bore ſouth-weſt, diſtant about thirteen leagues.</p>
                     <p>At noon on the 21ſt, we made but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, having only faint winds and calms. Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but Head then bore north 24° weſt; and the iſland where it is ſituated, called <hi>Halibut Iſland,</hi> extended from north by eaſt to north-weſt. This iſland is ſeven leagues in circumference, and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the head, is very low and barren; ſeveral ſmall iſlands are near it, between which and the main, there appears to be a paſſage, of the breadth of two or three leagues.</p>
                     <p>We were kept at ſuch a diſtance from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, by the rocks and breakers, that we had a very diſtant view of the coaſt between Halibut Iſland and Rock Point. We could, however, perceive the main land covered with ſnow; and particularly ſome hills, whoſe elevated tops towered above the clouds to a moſt ſtupendous height. A <hi>volcano</hi> was ſeen on the moſt ſouth-weſterly of theſe hills, which perpetually threw up immenſe columns of black ſmoke; it is at no great diſtance from the coaſt, and is in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 54° 48′, and the longitude of 195° 45′. Its figure is a compleat cone, and the volcano is at the ſummit of it: remarkable as it may appear, the wind, at the height to which the ſmoke of the volcano roſe, often moved in an oppoſite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to what it did at ſea, even in a freſh gale.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="351" facs="unknown:030274_0804_0FE572E496B2C2B0"/>Having three hours calm in the afternoon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of an hundred halibuts were caught by our people, ſome of which weighed upwards of an hundred pounds, and none of them leſs than twenty. They were highly acceptable to us. We fiſhed in thirty-five fathoms water, about four miles diſtant from the ſhore; during which time we were viſited by a man in a ſmall canoe, who came from the large iſland. When he approached the ſhip, he uncovered his head and bowed as the other had done the preceding day, when he came off to the Diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>That the Ruſſians had ſome communication with theſe people, was evident, not only from their politeneſs, but from the written paper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned. We had now an additional proof of it; for our new viſitor had on a pair of green cloth breeches, and a jacket of black cloth, under the frock of his own country. He had with him a grey fox ſkin, and ſome fiſhing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements; alſo a bladder, in which was ſome liquid, which we ſuppoſed to be oil; for he opened it, drank a mouthful, and then cloſed it up again.</p>
                     <p>His canoe was ſmaller than thoſe we had ſeen before, though of the ſame conſtruction; like thoſe who had viſited the Diſcovery, he uſed the double bladed paddle. His features reſembled thoſe of the natives of Prince William's Sound, but he was perfectly free from any kind of paint;
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:030274_0805_0FE572EA1C549428"/>
and his lip had been perforated in an oblique di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, though at that time, he had not any ornament in it. Many of the words, ſo frequently uſed by our viſitors in the Sound, were repeated to him, but he did not appear to underſtand any of them; owing either to his ignorance of the dialect, or other erroneous pronunciation.</p>
                     <p>The weather was principally cloudy and hazy, till the afternoon of the 22d, when the wind ſhifted to the ſouth-eaſt, attended, as uſual, with thick rainy weather. Before the fog, we ſaw no part of the main land, except the volcano, and a neighbouring mountain. We ſteered weſt till ſeven, when, fearing we might fall in with the land in thick weather, we hauled to the ſouthward till two the next morning, and then bore away weſt. Our progreſs was but trifling, having but little wind, and that variable; at five o'clock in the afternoon, we had an interval of ſun-ſhine, when we ſaw land, bearing north 59° weſt.</p>
                     <p>On the 24th, at ſix in the morning, we ſaw the continent, and at nine it extended from north eaſt-by-eaſt, to ſouth-weſt-by-weſt the neareſt part four leagues diſtant. The land to the ſouth-weſt conſiſted of iſlands, being what we had ſeen the preceding night. In the evening being about the diſtance of four leagues from the ſhore, and having little wind, we threw out our hooks and lines, but caught only two or three little cod.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="353" facs="unknown:030274_0806_0FE572EBE9C2A0C8"/>We got an eaſterly breeze the next morning, and, with it, what was very uncommon, clear weather; inſomuch, that we clearly ſaw the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano, the other mountains, and all the main land under them. It extended from north-eaſt by north, to north-weſt half weſt. Between this point and the iſlands, a large opening appeared, for which we ſteered, till land was ſeen beyond it; and, though we did not perceive that this land joined the continent, a paſſage through the opening was very doubtful; as well as whether the land to the ſouth-weſt was inſular or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental. Unwilling to truſt too much to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, we therefore ſteered to the ſouthward; when, having got without all the land in ſight, we ſteered weſt, the iſlands lying in that direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Three of them, all of a good height, we had paſſed by eight o'clock; more were now ſeen to the weſtward. In the afternoon, the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came gloomy, and afterwards turned to a miſt, the wind blowing freſh at eaſt. We therefore hauled the wind to the ſouthward till day-break, and then proceeded on our courſe to the weſt.</p>
                     <p>We derived but little advantage from day-light, the weather being ſo thick that we could not diſcover objects at the diſtance of a hundred yards; but, as the wind was moderate, we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to run. About half an hour after four, the ſound of breakers alarmed us, on our larboard
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:030274_0807_0FE572ED70600498"/>
bow; we found twenty-eight fathoms water, and then twenty-five. We brought the ſhip too, and anchored in the laſt depth; the Commodore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Diſcovery, who was not far diſtant, to anchor alſo.</p>
                     <p>Some hours after, the fog being a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, we diſcovered the imminent danger we had eſcaped. We were three quarters of a mile from the north-eaſt ſide of an iſland; two ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated rocks were about half a league from us, and from each other. Several breakers alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared about them; and yet Providence had ſafely conducted the ſhips through in the dark, between thoſe rocks, which we ſhould not have attempted to have done in a clear day, and to ſo commodious an anchoring place.</p>
                     <p>Being ſo near land, Captain Cook ordered a boat aſhore, to examine what it produced. When ſhe returned in the afternoon, the officer who commanded her ſaid, he ſaw ſome graſs, and other ſmall plants, one of which had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of purſlain; but the iſland produced neither trees nor ſhrubs.</p>
                     <p>The wind blew freſh at ſouth, in the night, but in the morning was more moderate, and the fog, in a great degree, diſperſed. We weighed at ſeven o'clock, and ſteered between the iſland near which we had anchored, and a ſmall one not far from it. The breadth of the channel does not exceed a mile, and the wind failed before we
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:030274_0808_0FE572EF604DDA08"/>
could paſs through it; we were therefore obliged to anchor, which we did in thirty-four fathoms water. Land now preſented itſelf in every direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That to the ſouth extended, in a ridge of mountains, to the ſouth-weſt; which we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found to be an iſland called <hi>Oonaloſhka.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Between this iſland, and the land to the north, which we ſuppoſed to be a group of iſlands, there appeared to be a channel in a north weſt direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On a point, weſt from the ſhip, and at the diſtance of three quarters of a mile, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral natives and their habitations. To this place we ſaw two whales towed in, which we ſuppoſed had juſt been killed. A few of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, occaſionally, came off to the ſhips, and engaged in a little traffic with our people, but never continued with us above a quarter of an hour at a time. They ſeemed, indeed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſhy; though we could readily diſcover they were not unacquainted with veſſels, ſimilar, in ſome degree, to ours. Their manner diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a degree of politeneſs which we had never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced among any of the ſavage tribes.</p>
                     <p>About one in the afternoon, being favoured with a light breeze, and the tide of flood, we weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proceeded to the channel laſt mentioned; expecting, when we had paſſed through, either to find the land trend away to the northward; or that we ſhould diſcover a paſſage out to ſea, to the weſt. For we did not ſuppoſe ourſelves to
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:030274_0809_0FE572F5037CF1C0"/>
be in an inlet of the continent, but among iſlands; and we were right in our conjectures. Soon after we got under ſail, the wind veered to the north, and we were obliged to ply. The depth of water was from forty to twenty-ſeven fathoms. In the evening, the ebb made it neceſſary for us to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor within three leagues of our laſt ſtation.</p>
                     <p>We weighed the next morning at day break, and were waſted up the paſſage by a light breeze at ſouth; after which we had variable light airs from all directions. There was, however, a rapid tide in our favour, and the Reſolution got through before the ebb made. The Diſcovery was not equally fortunate, for ſhe was carried back, got into the race, and found a difficulty in getting clear of it.</p>
                     <p>Being now through the channel, we found the land, on one ſide, trending weſt and ſouth-weſt, and that on the other ſide to north. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged us to hope, that the continent had taken a new direction in our favour. Being ſhort of water, and expecting to be driven about in a rapid tide, without wind ſufficient to govern the ſhip, we ſtood for a harbour the ſouth ſide of the paſſage, but were driven beyond it; and, that we might not be forced back through the paſſage, anchored near the ſouthern ſhore, in twenty-eight fathoms water, and out of the reach of the ſtrong tide; though, even here it ran five knots and an half in an hour.</p>

They bartered ſome fiſhing implements for tobacco. A young man, among them, overſet his canoe, while he was along-ſide of one of our boats. He was caught hold of by one of our people, but the canoe was taken up by another and carried aſhore. In conſequence of this accident, the youth was obliged to come into the ſhip, where he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited into the cabin, and readily accepted the invitation, without any ſurprize or embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He had on an upper garment, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a ſhirt, made of the gut of a whale, or ſome other large ſea-animal. Under this, he had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame form, made of the ſkins of birds with the feathers on, curiouſly ſewed together; the feathered ſide placed next his ſkin. It was patched with ſeveral pieces of ſilk ſtuff, and his cap was embelliſhed with glaſs beads.</p>
                     <p>His cloaths being wet, we furniſhed him with ſome of our own, which he put on with as much readineſs as we could have done. From the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of this youth, and that of ſeveral others it evidently appeared, that theſe people were no ſtrangers to Europeans, and to many of their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Some thing in our ſhips, however, greatly excited their curioſity; for, ſuch as had not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes to bring them off, aſſembled on the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring hills <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A boat was ſent to draw the ſeine, but we caught only a few trout, and ſome other ſmall fiſh.</p>
                     <p>We had not long anchored, before a native of the iſland brought another note on board, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to that which had been given to Captain Clerke. He preſented it to Captain Cook; but, as it was written in the Ruſſian language, neither he, nor any of us, could read it. As it could not be of any uſe to us, and might probably be of conſequence to others, the Commodore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it to the bearer, accompanied with a few preſents; for which he expreſſed his thanks, as he retired, by ſeveral low bows.</p>
                     <p>On the 29th, we ſaw along the ſhore, a group of the natives of both ſexes ſeated on the graſs, partaking of a repaſt of raw fiſh, which they ſeemed to reliſh exceedingly.</p>
                     <p>We were detained by thick fogs, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wind, till the 2d of July; during which time we acquired ſome knowledge of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as well as of its inhabitants; the particulars of which ſhall be hereafter related.</p>
                     <p>This harbour is called <hi>Samganoodha,</hi> by the natives, and is ſituated on the north ſide of Oonaloſhka, the latitude being 53° 55′, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 193° 30′; and in the ſtrait which ſeparates this iſland from thoſe to the north. It is about

                     </argument>
                     <p>ON the 2d of July, we ſteered from Samga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noodha, with a gentle breeze at ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, to the northward, and met with nothing to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030274_0825_0FE573671D9516F0"/>
obſtruct us in that courſe. For on the one ſide, the Iſle of Oonalaſhka trended ſouth-weſt; and, on the other, no land was viſible in a direction more northerly than north-eaſt; all which land was a continuation of the ſame groupe of iſlands that we had fallen in with on the 25th of the preceding month. That which is ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Samganoodha, and conſtitutes the north-eaſtern ſide of the paſſage through which we came, is denominated Oonella, and its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference is about ſeven leagues. Another iſland, lying to the north-eaſtward of it, bears the name of Acootan, it is conſiderably ſuperior in ſize to Oonella, and has in it ſome very lofty mountains, which were, at this time, covered with ſnow. It appeared, that we might have paſſed with great ſafety between theſe two iſlands and the continent, whoſe ſouth-weſtern point opened off the north-eaſtern point of Acootan and proved to be the ſame point of land that we had diſcerned when we left the coaſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, the 25th of June, to go without the iſlands. It is termed Oonemak by the natives, and is ſituate in the longitude of 192° 3′ eaſt, and in the latitude of 54° 30′ north. Over the cape, which, of itſelf is high land, there is a round elevated mountain, at preſent covered with ſnow. This mountain bore eaſt 2° north, at ſix o'clock in the afternoon; and two hours afterwards, no
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:030274_0826_0FE57311B73CB388"/>
land was to be ſeen. Concluding, therefore, that the coaſt of the continent had now inclined to the north-eaſtward, we ſteered the ſame courſe, till one o'clock the following morning, when the watch ſtationed upon deck imagined they ſaw land a-head. Upon this we wore, and, for the ſpace of about two hours, ſtood towards the ſouth-weſt; after which we reſumed our courſe to the eaſt north-eaſt. At ſix we diſcoveted land a-head, at the diſtance of about five leagues, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouth-eaſt. As we advanced we deſcried more and more land, the whole of which was connected. At twelve o'clock, we obſerved that it extended from ſouth-ſouth-weſt to eaſt, the part neareſt to us being five or ſix leagues diſtant. Our longitude, at this time, was 195° 18′ eaſt, and our latitude 55° 21′ north. At ſix, in the afternoon, we ſounded, and found a bottom of black ſand at the depth of forty-eight fathoms. We were now four leagues from the land; and the eaſtern part in ſight was in the direction of eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, appearing as an elevated round hummock.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 4th at eight o'clock in the morning we ſaw the coaſt from ſouth-ſouth-weſt, and eaſt by ſouth; and, at intervals we could diſcern high land, covered with ſnow, behind it. Not long after we had a calm; and being in thirty fathoms water, we caught, with hook and line, a good number of excellent cod. At twelve
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030274_0827_0FE57368A482E898"/>
we had an eaſterly breeze and clear weather; at which time we found ourſelves about ſix leagues from the land which extended from ſouth by weſt to eaſt by ſouth; and the hummock, ſeen the preceding evening, bore ſouth weſt by ſouth, at the diſtance of nine or ten leagues. A great hollow ſwell from the weſt-ſouth-weſtward, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us, that there was no main land, in that direction, near us. We ſteered a northerly courſe till ſix o'clock in the afternoon, when the wind, veering to the ſouth-eaſt, enabled us to ſteer eaſt-north-eaſt. The coaſt lay in this direction, and, at twelve o'clock on the following day, was at the diſtance of about four leagues.</p>
                     <p>We made but little progreſs on the 6th and 7th, as the wind was northerly. In the evening of the latter day, about eight o'clock, the depth of water was nineteen fathoms, and we were three or four leagues from the coaſt, which, on Wedneſday the 8th, extended from ſouth-ſouth-weſt to eaſt by north, and was all low land, with a ridge of mountains, covered with ſnow, behind it. It is not improbable that this low coaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to a conſiderable diſtance towards the ſouth-weſt; and that thoſe places which we ſometimes ſuppoſed to be the inlets or bays, are nothing more than vallies between the mountains. This day we put our hooks and lines over, and caught plenty of fine cod.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:030274_0828_0FE5736A2B135FD0"/>On the 9th, in the morning, having a breeze at north-weſt, we ſteered eaſt by north, in order to make a nearer approach to the coaſt. At noon, we were at the diſtance of about two leagues from the land, which was obſerved to extend from ſouth by eaſt to eaſt-north-eaſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all a low coaſt, with points projecting in ſeveral places, which, from the deck, had the appearance of iſlands; but, from the maſt head, we ſaw that low land connected them. We were now in the longitude of 201° 33′ eaſt, and in the latitude of 57° 49′ north. In this ſituation, our ſoundings were fifteen fathoms, over a bottom of fine black ſand.</p>
                     <p>In advancing towards the north-eaſt, we had found that the depth of water gradually decreaſed, and the coaſt trended more and more northerly. But we obſerved, that the ridge of mountains behind it, continued to lie in the ſame direction as thoſe that were more weſterly; ſo that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the low land, between the coaſt and the foot of the mountains, inſenſibly increaſed. Both the low and high grounds were totally deſtitute of wood; but were apparently covered with a green turf, the mountains excepted, which were involved in ſnow.</p>
                     <p>As we proceeded along the coaſt with a light weſterly breeze, the water ſhoaled gradually from fifteen to ten fathoms, though we were eight or ten miles diſtant from the ſhore. About eight
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030274_0829_0FE5732E754B4B98"/>
o'clock in the evening, a lofty mountain which had been ſome time within ſight, bore ſouth-eaſt by eaſt, at the diſtance of twenty-one leagues. Several other mountains, forming a part of the ſame chain, and much further diſtant, bore eaſt 3° north. The coaſt was ſeen to extend as far as north-eaſt half north, where it ſeemed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in a point, beyond which it was both our hope and expectation, that it would aſſume a more eaſterly direction. But, not long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, we perceived low land, that extended from behind this point, as far as north-weſt by weſt, where it was loſt in the horizon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it we diſcerned high land, appearing in hills detached from each other. Thus the fine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we had of getting to the northward vaniſhed in an inſtant. We ſtood on till nine o'clock, and then the point before-mentioned was about one league diſtant, bearing north-eaſt half eaſt. Behind the point is a river, which at its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, ſeemed to be a mile in breadth. The water appeared ſomewhat diſcoloured, as upon ſhoals; but a calm would have given it a ſimilar aſpect. It ſeemed to take a winding direction through the extenſive flat which lies between the chain of mountains towards the ſouth-eaſt, and the hills to the north-weſtward. It doubtleſs abounds with ſalmon, as many of thoſe fiſh were ſeen leaping in the ſea before the entrance, and ſome were found in the maws of cod that we had
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030274_0830_0FE57315A1A58A68"/>
caught. The mouth of this river, which we diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of Briſtol River, is ſituated in the longitude of 201° 55′ eaſt, and in the latitude of 58° 27′ north.</p>
                     <p>At day-break, on the 10th, we made ſail to the weſt-ſouth-weſt, with a light breeze at north-eaſt. About eleven o'clock, thinking that the coaſt towards the north-weſt terminated in a point, bearing north-weſt by weſt, the Commodore ſteered for that point, having ordered the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to keep a-head. But, before that veſſel had run a mile ſhe made a ſignal for ſhoal water. At that very time we had the depth of ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms; and before we could get the head of our ſhip the other way, we had leſs than five: but the Diſcovery's ſoundings were leſs than four fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms. We now ſtood back to the north-eaſt, three or four miles; but obſerving that there was a ſtrong tide ſetting to the weſt-ſouth-weſt, that is, towards the ſhoal, we brought the ſhips to anchor in about ten fathoms, over a ſandy bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Two hours after we had caſt anchor, the water had fallen upwards of two feet; which proved, that it was the tide of ebb that came from Briſtol River.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, at four o'clock, the wind hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhifted to the ſouth-weſt, we weighed and made ſail towards the ſouth, ſeveral boats being occupied a-head in ſounding. Having paſſed over the ſouth-end of the ſhoal, in ſix fathoms

water, we afterwards got into thirteen and fifteen; in which laſt depth we let go our anchors again, between eight and nine in the evening; ſome part of the chain of mountains on the ſouth-eaſtern ſhore, being in ſight, and bearing ſouth-eaſt half ſouth; and the moſt weſterly land on the other ſhore bearing north-weſt. In the courſe of this day, we had deſcried high land, which bore north 60° weſt, and which we ſuppoſed to be about twelve leagues diſtant.</p>
                     <p>We weighed anchor the next morning, at two o'clock, with a gentle breeze at ſouth weſt, by weſt, and plied to windward till nine; when judging the flood-tide to be now againſt us, we anchor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At one in the afternoon, the fog, which had this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevailed, diſperſing, and the tide becoming favourable, we weighed again, and plied to the ſouth-weſtward. Towards the evening, the wind was extremely variable, and we had ſome thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: we had heard none before, from the time of our arrival on the coaſt; and that which we now heard was at a great diſtance. The wind ſettling again in the ſouth-weſt quarter, in the morning of Sunday the 12th we ſteered a a north-weſt courſe, and, at ten oclock, ſaw the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. At mid-day, it extended from north-eaſt by north to north-north-weſt a quarter weſt; and an elevated hill appeared in the direction of north-north-weſt, nine or ten leagues diſtant. This
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030274_0832_0FE5734153799C68"/>
was found to be an iſland, to which, on account of its figure, Captain Cook gave the name of Round Iſland. It ſtands in the latitude of 58° 37′ north, and the longitude of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>00° 6′ eaſt, and is ſeven miles diſtant from the continent. At nine in the evening, having ſteered a northerly courſe to within three leagues of the ſhore, we tacked in fourteen fathoms water, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the coaſt bearing eaſt-ſouth-eaſt half eaſt, and weſt.</p>
                     <p>The wind now veered to the north-weſt, and enabled us to ſtretch along the ſhore, till two the next morning, when we ſuddenly got into ſix fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms water, being then ſix miles from the land. After we had edged off a little, our depth of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gradually increaſed; and, at twelve o'clock, our ſoundings were twenty fathoms. Round Iſland, at this time, bore north 5° eaſt; and the weſtern extreme of the coaſt was ſeven leagues diſtant, bearing north 16° weſt. It is an elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed point, to which the appellation of Calm Point was given, from our having calm weather while we were off it. To the north-weſtward of Round Iſland, we diſcerned two or three hillocks which had an inſular appearance; and perhaps they may be Iſlands, for we had but a diſtant proſpect of this particular part of the coaſt.</p>
                     <p>We advanced but ſlowly on the 14th and 15th, having little wind, and, at times, a very thick fog. Our ſoundings were from twenty-ſix to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030274_0833_0FE5733605757600"/>
fourteen fathoms; and we had pretty good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in fiſhing, for we caught plenty of cod, and ſome flac fiſh. On Thurſday the 16th at five o'clock in the morning, the fog clearing up, we found ourſelves nearer the ſhore than we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Calm Point bore north 72° eaſt, and a point about eight leagues from it, in a weſterly direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bore north 3° eaſt, only three miles diſtant. Betwixt theſe two points, the coaſt forms a bay in ſeveral parts of which the land could ſcarcely be ſeen from the maſt-head. There is another bay on the north-weſtern ſide of the laſt-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned point, between it and a high promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which now bore north 36° weſt, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſixteen miles. About nine o'clock, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook diſpatched Lieutenant Williamſon to this promontory, with orders to go aſhore, and obſerve what direction the coaſt aſſumed beyond it, and what was the produce of the country; which, when viewed from the ſhips, had but a ſteril aſpect. We here found the flood tide ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtrongly towards the north-weſt, along the coaſt. At twelve o'clock it was high water, and we caſt anchor at the diſtance of twelve miles from the ſhore, in twenty-four fathoms water. In the afternoon, about five, the tide beginning to make in our favour, we weighed, and drove with it, there being no wind.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Williamſon, at his return, reported, that he had landed on the point, and, having aſcended
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030274_0834_0FE5731366407330"/>
the moſt elevated hill, found, that the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tant part of the coaſt in ſight was nearly in a northerly direction. He took poſſeſſion of the country in the name of his Britannic Majeſty, and left on the hill a bottle contai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The promontory, which he named Cape Newenham, is a rocky point, of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able height; and ſtands in the longitude of 197° 36° eaſt, and in the latitude of 58° 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>′ north. Over it, or within it, two lofty hills riſe one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the other; of which the innermoſt, or eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernmoſt, is the higheſt. The country, as far as Mr. Williamſon could diſcern, produces not a ſingle tree or ſhrub. The hills were naked; but on the lower grounds, there grew graſs and plants of various kinds, very few of which were at this time in flower. He met with no other animals than a doe and her fawn, and a dead ſea-horſe or cow that lay upon the beach. Of the latter ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals we had lately ſeen a conſiderable number.</p>
                     <p>The coaſt, as we have already mentioned, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a northerly direction from Cape Newen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, that cape is the northern boundary of the extenſive bay and gulph, ſituate before the river Briſtol, which in honour of the Admiral Earl of Briſtol, received from the Commodore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Briſtol Bay. Cape Ooneemak forms the ſouthern limit of this bay; and is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030274_0835_0FE573466727AA98"/>
eighty-two leagues diſtant, in the direction of ſouth ſouth-weſt, from Cape Newenham.</p>
                     <p>A light breeze ariſing about eight o'clock in the evening, and ſettling at ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, we ſteered to the north-weſt, and north-north-weſt round Cape Newenham; which at twelve the following day, was four leagues diſtant, bearing ſouth by eaſt. Our ſoundings, at this time, were ſeventeen fathoms; the moſt advanced land to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north bore north 30° eaſt; and the neareſt part of the coaſt was three leagues and a half diſtant. During the whole afternoon, there was but little wind; ſo that, by ten o'clock in the evening, we had only proceeded three leagues on a northerly courſe.</p>
                     <p>We ſteered north by weſt till eight o'clock the next morning, (Saturday the 18th) when, the depth of water ſuddenly decreaſing to ſeven and five fathoms, we brought too, till a boat from each of our ſhips was ſent a-head to ſound, and then ſteered to the north-eaſt. At noon, the water was deepened to ſeventeen fathoms. Cape Newen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was now eleven or twelve leagues diſtant, bearing ſouth 9° eaſt; the north-eaſtern extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the land in ſight bore north 66° eaſt; and the diſtance of the neareſt ſhore was four or five leagues. Our preſent latitude was 59° 16′ north. Between Cape Newenham and this lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the coaſt conſiſts of low land and hills, and ſeemed to form ſeveral bays.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030274_0836_0FE5734AC1C487A8"/>Before one o'clock, the boats a-head diſplayed the ſignal of ſhoal water. They had, indeed, only two fathoms; and at the ſame time, the ſhips were in ſix fathoms water. By hauling more to the north, we continued nearly in the ſame depth till between five and ſix o'clock, when our boats finding leſs and leſs water, Captain Cook made the ſignal to the Diſcovery, which was then a-head to caſt anchor, and both ſhips ſoon came to. In bringing up the Reſolution, her cable parted at the clinch, ſo that we were obliged to make uſe of the other anchor. We rode in ſix fathoms water, over a bottom of ſand, at the diſtance of four or five leagues from the continent. Cape Newenham now bore ſouth, ſixteen or ſeventeen leagues diſtant; the fartheſt hills we could perceive towards the north, bore north-eaſt by eaſt; and there was low land ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the more elevated land, as far as north by eaſt. Without this there was a ſhoal of ſtones and ſand, dry at half ebb. The two maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters having been ſent, each in a boat, to ſound between this ſhoal and the coaſt, reported, on their return, that there was a channel, in which the ſoundings were ſix and ſeven fathoms, but that it was rather narrow and intricate.</p>
                     <p>We attempted, at low water to get a hawſer round the loſt anchor, but we did not then meet with ſucceſs. However, being reſolved not to leave it behind us, while there was any proſpect
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030274_0837_0FE573378B3B8CA0"/>
of recovering it, we perſevered in our endeavours; and, at length, in the evening of the 20th, we ſucceeded. While we were thus occupied, the Commodore ordered Captain Clerke to diſpatch his maſter in a boat to ſearch for a baſſage in a ſouth-weſt direction. He accordingly did ſo, but no channel was obſerved in that puarter; nor did it appear that there was any other way to get clear of the ſhoals, than by returning by the ſame track in which we had entered. For though by following the channel we were now in, we might perhaps have got further down the coaſt; and though this channel might probably have carried us at laſt to the northward, clear of the ſhoals, yet the attempt would have been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extreme hazard; and, in caſe of ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, there would have been a great loſs of time that we could not conveniently ſpare. Theſe reaſons induced the Commodore to return by the way which had brought us in, and thus avoid the ſhoals.</p>
                     <p>The longitude of our preſent ſtation, by lunar obſervations, was 197° 45′ 48″ eaſt, and the latitude 59° 37′ 30″ north. The moſt northern part of the coaſt, that we could diſcern from this ſtation was ſuppoſed to be ſituate in the latitude of 60°. It formed, to appearance, a low point, which received the name of Shoal Neſs. The tide of flood ſets to the northward, and the ebb to the ſouthward: it riſes and falls five or ſix
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030274_0838_0FE5733AEE72CEE0"/>
feet upon a perpendicular; and we reckon that it is high water at eight o'clock, on the full and change days.</p>
                     <p>At three in the morning of the 21ſt, we weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anchor with a gentle breeze at north-north-weſt, and ſteered back to the ſouth, having three boats a-head employed in ſounding. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this precaution, we met with greater difficulty in returning than we had found in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing; and were at length under the neceſſity of anchoring, to avoid the danger of running upon a ſhoal that had only a depth of five feet. While we lay at anchor, twenty-ſeven Americans each in a ſeparate canoe, came off to the ſhips, which they approached with ſome degree of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As they advanced, they hollowed and opened their arms; thereby intimating, as we underſtood, their peaceable intentions. Some of them, at laſt, came near enough to receive a few trifling articles which we threw to them. This gave encouragement to the others to venture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long-ſide; and a traffic quickly commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and our people, who obtained wooden veſſels, bows, darts, arrows, dreſſes of ſkins, &amp;c. in exchange for which the natives excepted what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we offered them. They appeared to be the ſame ſort of people, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> we had met with all along this coaſt; and they wore in their lips and noſes the ſame ſpecies of ornaments, but were not ſo well cloathed, and were far more dirty.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030274_0839_0FE5736C0C39C2C0"/>
They ſeemed to be perfectly unacquainted with any civilized nation; they were ignorant of the uſe of tobacco; nor did we obſerve in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion any foreign article, unleſs a knife may be conſidered as ſuch. This, indeed, was nothing more than a piece of common iron fitted in a handle made of wood, ſo as to ſerve the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of a knife. They, however, ſo well knew the uſe and value of this inſtrument, that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be almoſt the only article they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of.</p>
                     <p>The hair of moſt of them were ſhaved, or cut ſhort off, a few locks only being left on one ſide, or behind. They wore as a covering for their heads, a hood of ſkins, and a bonnet, which was ſeemingly of wood. One part of their dreſs, which we procured from them, was a kind of girdle, made of ſkin in a very neat manner, with trappings depending from it and paſſing betwixt the thighs, ſo as to conceal the adjacent parts. From the uſe of this girdle, it is probable that they ſome times go in other reſpects naked, even in this high northern latitude; for it can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed that they wear it under their other clothing. Their canoes were covered with ſkins, like thoſe we had lately ſeen; but they were broader, and the hole wherein the perſon ſits we wider than in any of thoſe we had before met with. Our boats returning from ſounding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to give them ſome alarm, ſo that they all
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030274_0840_0FE57342EC9BAD80"/>
departed ſooner than perhaps they otherwiſe would have done.</p>
                     <p>We did not get clear of the ſhoals before the evening of Wedneſday the 22d; and then we durſt not venture to ſteer towards the weſt during the night, but ſpent it off Cape Newenham. At day-break, on the 23d, we ſtood to the north-weſtward, the Diſcovery being ordered to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Before we had proceeded two leagues, our ſoundings decreaſed to ſix fathoms. Being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that, if we continued this courſe, we ſhould meet with leſs and leſs water, we hauled to the ſouth, with a freſh eaſterly breeze. This courſe gradually brought us into eighteen fathoms water, upon which we ventured to ſteer a little weſterly, and afterwards due weſt, when we at length found twenty-ſix fathoms. At noon, on the 24th, our longitude, by obſervation, was 194° 22′ eaſt, and our latitude. 58° 7′ north. About three leagues to the weſt of this ſituation, our ſoundings were twenty-eight fathoms; and we then ſteered weſt-north-weſt, the depth of water gradually increaſing to thirty-four fathoms. We ſhould have ſteered more northerly had not the wind prevented us.</p>
                     <p>In the evening of Saturday the 25th, having but little wind, and an exceedingly thick fog, we let go our anchors in thirty fathoms; our longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude being, at that time, 191° 37′ eaſt, and our latitude 58° 29′ north. About ſix o'clock the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030274_0841_0FE57322930DAF80"/>
next morning, the weather in ſome degree clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, we weighed, and with a gentle breeze at eaſt, ſteered to the northward, our depth of water being from twenty-five to twenty-eight fathoms. After we had proceeded on this courſe for the ſpace of nine leagues, the wind veered to the north, ſo that we were obliged to ſteer more weſterly. The weather, for the moſt part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be foggy, till about twelve o'clock on the 28th, when we had clear ſun-ſhine for a few hours, during which ſeveral lunar obſervations were made. The mean reſult of theſe, reduced to noon, at which time our latitude was 59° 55′ north, gave 190° 6′ eaſt longitude, and the time-keeper gave 189° 59′.</p>
                     <p>Continuing our weſterly courſe, we diſcovered land at four in the morning of the 29th, bearing north-weſt by weſt, at the diſtance of ſix leagues. We ſtood towards it till between ten and eleven, when we tacked in twenty-four fathoms, being then a league from the land, which bore north-north-weſt. It was the ſouth-eaſtern extreme, and formed a perpendicular cliff of great height; upon which account, Captain Cook gave it the name of Point Upright. It ſtands in the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 187° 30′ eaſt and in the latitude of 60° 17′ north. More land was perceived to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this point; and, at a clear interval, we diſcerned another portion of high land, bearing weſt by ſouth; and this ſeemed to be perfectly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030274_0842_0FE57344742FC590"/>
ſeparated from the other. We here obſerved an amazing number of birds, ſuch as guillemots, awks, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>During the whole afternoon we had baffling light winds, which occaſioned our progreſs to be but ſlow; and the weather was not ſufficiently clear, to enable us to determine the extent of the land that was before us. We conjectured that it was one of the many iſlands laid down in Mr. Staehlin's map of the New Northern Archipelogo; and we every moment expected to deſcry more of them.</p>
                     <p>On the 30th, at four o'clock in the afternoon, Point Upright was ſix leagues diſtant, bearing north-weſt by north. A light breeze now ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up at north-north-weſt, we ſteered to the north-eaſtward till four the next morning, when the wind veered to the caſt; we then tacked, and ſtood to the north-weſt. The wind, not long after, ſhifting to ſouth-eaſt, we ſteered north-eaſt by north; and continued this courſe, with found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from thirty-five to twenty fathoms, till noon the following day (Auguſt 1.) Our latitude, at this time, was 60° 58′ north, and our longitude was 191° eaſt. The wind now becoming north-eaſterly, we firſt made a ſtretch of about ten leagues towards the north-weſt; and then, as we obſerved no land in that direction, we ſtood back to the eaſt for the ſpace of fourteen or fifteen leagues, and met with a conſiderable quantity of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030274_0843_0FE57308043E97F8"/>
drift-wood. Our depth of water was from twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two to nineteen fathoms.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday, the 2d of Auguſt, variable light winds, with ſhowers of rain, prevailed the whole day. In the morning of the 3d, the wind ſettling in the ſouth-eaſt quarter, we reſumed our north-ward courſe. At twelve o'clock our ſoundings were ſixteen fathoms, our latitude was 62° 34′ north, longitude 192° eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Between three and four o'clock this afternoon Mr. Anderſon, Surgeon of the Reſolution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, after he had lingered under a conſumption for upwards of a twelve month. He was a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, intelligent young man, and an agreeable companion. He had great ſkill in his profeſſion and had acquired a conſiderable portion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in other departments of ſcience. Our readers will doubtleſs have obſerved, how uſeful an aſſiſtant he had proved in the courſe of the voyage; and if his life had been prolonged to a later period, the public might have received from him many valuable communications reſpecting the natural hiſtory of the different places viſited by us. Soon after he had reſigned his breath, we diſcovered land to the weſtward, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of twelve leagues. We ſuppoſed it to be an iſland; and the Commodore, to perpetuate the memory of the deceaſed, for whom he had a particular eſteem, diſtinguiſhed it by the name of Anderſon's Iſland. The following day Mr.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030274_0844_0FE5732C31172B50"/>
Law, Surgeon of the Diſcovery, was removed into the Reſolution; and Mr. Samual, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's firſt mate of the Reſolution, was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſucceed Mr. Law as Surgeon of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                     <p>At three in the afternoon, on the 4th we ſaw land extending from north-north-eaſt to north-weſt. We ſteered towards it till four, when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four or five miles diſtant from it, we tacked; and, not long afterwards, the wind failing, we let go our anchors in thirteen fathoms, over a ſandy bottom, at the diſtance of about two leagues from land. Our latitude was now 64° 27′ north, and longitude 194° 18′ eaſt. We could, at intervals, diſcern the coaſt extending from eaſt to north-weſt, and an iſland of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable elevation, bearing weſt by north, nine miles diſtant.</p>
                     <p>The land before us, which we imagined to be the continent of America, appeared rather low next the ſea; but, inland, it roſe in hills, which ſeemed to be of a tolerable height. It had a greeniſh hue, and was apparently deſtitute of wood, and free from ſnow. While our ſhips remained at anchor, we obſerved that the tide of flood came from the eaſtward, and ſet to the weſtward, till between the hours of ten and eleven, from which time, till two o'clock the next morning, the ſtream ſet to the eaſt, and the water fell three feet. The flood running both
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030274_0845_0FE57310206DAA90"/>
longer and ſtronger than the ebb, we concluded, that there was a weſterly current beſides the tide.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday the 5th, at ten o'clock in the morning, we ran down, and, ſoon after, anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the iſland and the continent in ſeven fathoms. Not long after we had caſt anchor, Captain Cook, accompanied by Mr. King, and ſome other officers, landed upon the iſland. He hoped to have had from it a proſpect of the coaſt and ſea towards the weſt; but, in that direction, the fog was ſo thick, that the view was not more extenſive than it was from our ſhips. The coaſt of the continent ſeemed to incline to the north, at a low point, named by us Point Rodney, which bore from the iſland north-weſt half weſt, at the diſtance of three or four leagues; but the high land, which aſſumed a more northerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, was perceived at a much greater diſtance.</p>
                     <p>The latitude of this iſland is 64° 30′ north, and its longitude is 193° 57′ eaſt. It is about twelve miles in circumference. The ſurface of the ground principally conſiſts of large looſe ſtones, covered in many places with moſs and other vegetables' of which twenty or thirty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies were obſerved, and moſt of them were in flower. But the Captain ſaw not a tree or ſhrub, either on the iſland, or upon the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring continent. Near the beach where he landed, was a conſiderable quantity of wild pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlain, long-wort, peaſe, &amp;c. ſome of which he

took on board for boiling. He ſaw ſeveral plovers, and other ſmall birds; a fox was alſo ſeen. He met with ſome decayed huts, built partly under ground. People had lately been upon the iſland, and it is more than probable, that they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to it, there being a beaten path from one end to the other. At a ſmall diſtance from that part of the ſhore where our gentlemen landed, they found a ſledge, which induced Captain Cook to give the iſland the appellation of Sledge Iſland. It appeared to be ſuch a one as is uſed by the Ruſſian in Kamtſchatka, for the purpoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying goods from one place to another over the ſnow or ice. It was about twenty inches in bredath, and ten feet in length; had a ſort of rail-work on each ſide, and was ſhod with bone. Its conſtruction was admirable, and its various parts were put together with great neatneſs; ſome with wooden pins, but for the moſt part with thongs or laſhings of whale-bone; in conſequence of which, the Captain imagined that it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the workmaſhip of the natives.</p>
                     <p>We weighed anchor at three o'clock in the morning of the 6th, and made ſail to the north-weſt, with alight breeze from the ſouth-ward. Having afterwards but little wind, and that vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we made but a ſlow progreſs; and, at eight o'clock in the evening, finding the ſhips, getting into ſhoal water, we anchored in ſeven fathoms, our diſtance from the coaſt being about two
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030274_0847_0FE5730A2EE0D2F0"/>
leagues. Sledge Iſland then bore ſouth 51° eaſt, nine or ten leagues diſtant. Soon after we had let go our anchors the weather, which had been miſty, cleared up, and we perceived high land extending from north 40° eaſt to north 30° weſt, ſeemingly disjoined from the coaſt near which we lay at anchor, which appeared to extend to the north-eaſtward. We at the ſame time ſaw an iſland bearing north 81° weſt, at the diſtance of eight or nine leagues. It ſeemed to be of a ſmall extent, and was named King's Iſland. We rode at anchor till eight the next morning, when we weighed, and ſteered a north-weſt courſe. The weather being clear towards the evening, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſight of the north-weſtern land, diſtant about three leagues. We paſſed the night in making ſhort boards, the weather being rainy and miſty, and the wind inconſiderable. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four and five in the morning of the 8th, we again had a ſight of the north-weſt land; and, not long afterwards, having a calm, and being driven by a current towards the ſhore, we thought proper to anchor in twelve fathoms water, at the diſtance of about two miles from the coaſt. Over the weſtern extremity is a lofty peaked hill, ſituate in the longitude of 192° 18′ eaſt, and in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 65° 36′ north. A north-eaſterly breeze ſpringing up at eight o'clock, we weighed, and made ſail to the ſouth-eaſtward, hoping to find a paſſage between this north-weſt land and the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030274_0848_0FE57371271883B0"/>
coaſt, near which we had caſt anchor in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 6th. But we quickly got into ſeven fathoms water, and perceived low land con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting the two coaſts, and the elevated land behind it.</p>
                     <p>Convinced that the whole was a continued coaſt, we now tacked, and ſteered for its north-weſtern-part, near which we anchored in ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen fathoms. The weather, at preſent, was very thick and rainy: but, at four the next morning, it cleared up, and enabled us to diſcern the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring land. A lofty ſteep rock or iſland bore weſt by ſouth; another iſland to the northward of it, and conſiderably larger, bore weſt by north; the peaked hill before-mentioned, ſouth-eaſt by eaſt; and the point that was under it, ſouth 32° eaſt. Under this hill is ſome low land, extending towards the north-weſt, the extreme point of which was now about one league diſtant, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing north-eaſt by eaſt. Over it, and alſo beyond it, we obſerved ſome high land, which we imagined was a continuation of the continent.</p>
                     <p>This point of land, which the Commodore diſtinguiſhed by the name of Cape Prince of Wales, is the weſtern extreme of all America hitherto known. It ſtands in the longitude of 191° 4′ eaſt, and in the latitude 65° 46′ north. We fancied that we ſaw ſome people on the coaſt: and, perhaps, we were not miſtaken in our ſuppoſition, as ſome elevations like ſtages,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030274_0849_0FE57372B6282E78"/>
and others reſembling huts, were obſerved at the ſame place.</p>
                     <p>At eight o'clock this morning, a faint norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breeze ariſing, we weighed anchor: but our ſails were ſcarcely ſet, when it began to blow and rain with great violence, there being at the ſame time, miſty weather. The wind and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent were in contrary directions, raiſing ſuch a ſea, that it often broke into the ſhip. Having plied to windward, with little effect, till two o'clock in the afternoon, we ſtood for the iſland which we had perceived to the weſtward, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to caſt anchor under it till the gale ſhould abate. But, upon our nearer approach to this land, we found that it was compoſed of two ſmall iſlands, neither of which exceeded three or four leagues in circumference. As theſe could afford us little ſhelter, we did not come to an anchor, but continued to ſtretch towards the weſt; and, about eight o'clock in the evening, we ſaw land extending from north-north-weſt to weſt by ſouth, the diſtance of the neareſt part being ſix leagues. We ſtood on till ten o'clock, and then made a board towards the eaſt, in order to paſs the night.</p>
                     <p>On Monday the 10th, at break of day, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed our weſtward courſe for the land ſeen by us the preceding evening. At eleven minutes after ſeven o'clock, it extended from ſouth 72° weſt, to north 51′ eaſt. Betwixt the ſouth-weſtern extremity, and a point bearing weſt, ſix
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030274_0850_0FE573744906FD48"/>
miles diſtant, the coaſt forms a ſpacious bay, in which we dropped our anchors at ten in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, about two miles from the northern ſhore over a gravelly bottom, at the depth of ten fathoms. The nothern point of this bay bore north 43° eaſt; its ſouthern point ſouth 58° weſt; the bottom of the bay, north 60° weſt, between two and three leagues diſtant; and the two iſlands that we had paſſed the preceding day, were at the diſtance of fourteen leagues, bearing north 72° eaſt.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHILE we were ſteering for this bay, we obſerved on the north ſhore, a village, and ſome people, who ſeemed to have been thrown into confuſion, or fear, at the ſight of our veſſels. We could plainly perceive perſons running up the country with burdens upon their ſhoulders. At this village Captain Cook propoſed to land; and accordingly, went with three armed boats, accompanied by ſome of the officers. Thirty or forty men, each of whom was armed with a ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon, bow, and arrows, ſtood drawn up on an eminence near the houſes; three of them came
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030274_0852_0FE5737D9F8277A0"/>
down towards the ſhore, on the approach of our gentlemen, and were ſo polite as to pull off their caps, and make them low bows. Though this civility was returned, it did not inſpire them with ſufficient confidence to wait for the landing of our party; for, the inſtant they put the boats aſhore the natives retired. Captain Cook fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them alone, without any thing in his hand; and, by ſigns and geſtures prevailed on them to ſtop, and accept ſome trifling preſents; in return for theſe, they gave him two fox-ſkins, and a couple of ſea horſe teeth. The Captain was of opinion that they had brought theſe articles down with them for the purpoſe of preſenting them to him, even if they had expected no return.</p>
                     <p>They ſeemed very timid and cautious; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating their deſire, by ſigns, that no more of our people ſhould be ſuffered to come up. On the Captain's laying his hand on the ſhoulder of one of them, he ſtarted back ſeveral paces; in proportion as he advanced, they retreated, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the attitude of being ready to make uſe of their ſpears; while thoſe on the eminence, were prepared to ſupport them with their arrows. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, the Captain, and two or three of his companions, introduced themſelves among them. The diſtribution of a few beads among ſome of them, ſoon created a degree of confidence, ſo that they were not alarmed, when the Captain
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030274_0853_0FE5737F24DE08B8"/>
was joined by a few more of his people; and, in a ſhort time, a kind of traffic was entered into. In exchange for tobacco, knives, beads, and other articles, they gave a few arrows, and ſome of their cloathing; but nothing that our people had to offer, could induce them to part with a ſpear or a bow. Theſe they held in continual readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, never quitting them, except at one time, when four or five perſons laid theirs down, while they favoured our party with a ſong and a dance; and even then, they placed them in ſuch a manner, that they could lay hold of them in a moment.</p>
                     <p>Their arrows were pointed either with ſtone or bone, but very few of them had barbs; and ſome of them had a round blunt point. What uſe theſe are applied to, we cannot ſay, unleſs it be to kill ſmall animals without damaging the ſkin.</p>
                     <p>Theſe bows were ſuch as we had obſerved on the American coaſt: their ſpontoons, or ſpears, were of iron or ſteel, and of European or Aſiatic work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip: and conſiderable pains had been taken to embelliſh them with carving, and inlayings of braſs and of a white metal. Thoſe who ſtood with bows and arrows in their hands, had the ſpear ſlung by a leathern ſtrap over their right ſhoulder. A leathern quiver, ſlung over their left ſhoulder, ſerved to contain arrows; and ſome of theſe quivers were exceedingly beautiful, being made of red leather, on which was a very neat em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030274_0854_0FE573810CB017B8"/>
and other ornaments. Several other things, and particularly their clothing, indicated a degree of ingenuity, far ſurpaſſing what any one would expect to find among ſo northern a people.</p>
                     <p>All the Americans we had ſeen ſince our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival on that coaſt, had round chubby faces, and high cheek-bones, and were rather low of ſtature. The people among whom we now were, far from reſembling them, had long viſages, and were ſtout and well made: upon the whole, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be a very different nation. No women, nor children of either ſex, were obſerved, nor any aged perſons, except one man whoſe head was bald, and he was the only one who bore no arms: the other ſeemed to be ſelect men, and rather under than above the middle age. The elderly man had a black mark acroſs his face, which was not perceived in any others; all of them had their ears perforated, and ſome had glaſs beads hanging to them. Theſe were the only fixed ornaments ſeen about them, for they wear none to their lips: this is another particular, in which they differ from the Americans we had lately ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Their apparel conſiſted of a pair of breeches, a cap, a frock, a pair of boots, and a pair of gloves, all made of the ſkins of deer, dogs, ſeals, and other animals, and extremely well dreſſed; ſome with the hair or fur on, and others without it. The caps were made in ſuch a manner, as to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030274_0855_0FE5738293424858"/>
fit the head very cloſe; and beſides theſe caps, which were worn by moſt of them, we procured from them ſome hoods, made of dog-ſkins, that were ſufficiently large to cover both head and ſhoulders. Their hair was apparently black, but their heads were either ſhaved, or the hair cut cloſe off and none of them wore beards. Of the few articles which they obtained from our people, knives and tobacco were what they ſet the moſt value upon.</p>
                     <p>The village was compoſed both of their winter and their ſummer habitation; the former are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like a vault, the floor of which is ſunk below the ſurface of the earth. One of them, which Captain Cook examined, was of an oval figure, about twenty feet in length, and twelve or more in height; the framing conſiſted of wood, and the ribs of whales, judiciouſly diſpoſed, and bound together with ſmaller materials of the ſame kind. Over this framing, a covering of ſtrong coarſe graſs was laid, and that again was covered with earth; ſo that on the outſide, the houſe had the apperance of a little hillock, ſupported by a wall of ſtone, of the height of three or four feet, which was built round the two ſides, and one end. At the other end of the habitation, the earth was raiſed ſloping, to walk up to the entrance, which was by a hole in the top of the roof, over that end. The floor was boarded, and under it was a ſort of cellar, in which the Captain ſaw nothing but water; at the end of each houſe was a vaulted

room; which he ſuppoſed was a ſtore-room. Theſe ſtore-rooms communicated, by a dark paſſage, with the houſe; and with the open air by a hole in the roof, which was even with the ground one walked upon; they cannot be ſaid to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely below ground; for one end extended to the edge of the hill, along which they were made, and which was built up with ſtone. Over it ſtood a kind of centry-box; or tower, formed of the large bones of great fiſh.</p>
                     <p>Their ſummer huts were of a tolerable ſize, and circular, being brought to a point at the top. Slight poles and bones, covered with the ſkins of ſea-animals, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ompoſed the framing. Captain Cook examined the inſide of one: their was a fire place juſt within the door, where a few wooden veſſels were depoſited, all very dirty. Their bed-places were cloſe to the ſide, and occupied about one-half of the circuit: ſome degree of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy ſeemed to be obſerved; for there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral partitions, made with ſkins. The bed and bedding conſiſted of deer-ſkins, and moſt of them were clean and dry.</p>
                     <p>About the houſes were erected ſeveral ſtages, ten or twelve feet in height, ſuch as we had ſeen on ſome parts of the American coaſt. They were compoſed entirely of bones, and were appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently intended for drying their fiſh and ſkins, which were thus placed out of reach of their dogs, of which they had great numbers. Theſe
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030274_0858_0FE573864726DB38"/>
dogs are of the fox kind, rather large, and of different colours, with long ſoft hair, that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles wool. They are, in all probability, uſed for the purpoſe of drawing their ſledges, in water; for it appears that they have ſledges, as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſaw many of them laid up in one of their waner huts. It is, likewiſe, not improbable, that dogs conſtitute a part of their food, for ſeveral lay dead, which had been killed that morning.</p>
                     <p>The canoes of theſe people are of the ſame kind with thoſe of the northern Americans, ſome both of the large and ſmall ſort, being ſeen lying in a creek near the village.</p>
                     <p>From the large bones of fiſh, and other ſea-animals, it appeared, that the ſea furniſhed them with the greater part of their ſubſiſtance. The country ſeemed extremely barren, as our gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſaw not a tree or ſhrub. At ſome diſtance towards the weſt, they obſerved a ridge of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains covered with ſnow, that had fallen not long before.</p>
                     <p>At firſt, ſome of us ſuppoſed this land to be a part of iſland of Alaſchka, laid down in Mr. Staehlin's map before mentioned; but from the appearance of the coaſt, the ſituation of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſhore of America, and from the longitude, we ſoon conjectured that it was, more probably, the country of the Tſchutſki, or the eaſtern extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Aſia, explored by Beering in the year
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030274_0859_0FE57388254D7FE0"/>
1728. In admitting this, however, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination, we muſt have pronounced Mr. Staehlin's map, and his account of the new north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Archipelago, to be either remarkably erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, even in latitude, or elſe to be a mere fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a judgement which we would not preſume to paſs, upon a publication ſo reſpectably vouched, without producing the moſt deciſive proofs.</p>
                     <p>After our party had remained with theſe people between two and three hours, they returned on board; and, ſoon after, the wind becoming ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, we weighed anchor, ſtood out of the bay and ſteered to the north-eaſt, between the coaſt and the two iſlands. At twelve o'clock the next day (Auguſt 11) the former extended from ſouth 80° weſt, to north 84° weſt; the latter bore ſouth 40° weſt; and the peaked hill, over Cape Prince of Wales, bore ſouth 36° eaſt. The latitude of the ſhip was 66° 5′ north, the longitude 191° 19′ eaſt; our ſoundings were twenty eight fathoms; and our poſition nearly in the middle of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, between the two coaſts, each being at the diſtance of about ſeven leagues.</p>
                     <p>We ſteered to the eaſtward from this ſtation, in order to make a nearer approach to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican coaſt. In this courſe the water gradually ſhoaled; and there being very little wind, and all our endeavours to increaſe our depth failing, we were obliged at laſt to caſt anchor in ſix fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms; which was the only remedy remaining,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030274_0860_0FE57389A9F2CCD0"/>
to prevent the ſhips driving into more ſhallow water. The neareſt part of the weſtern land bore weſt, twelve leagues diſtant; the peaked mountain over Cape Prince of Wales, bore ſouth l6° weſt; and the moſt northern part of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican continent in ſight, eaſt-ſouth-eaſt; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the neareſt part being about four leagues. After we had anchored, a boat was diſpatched to ſound, and the water was found to ſhoal gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards the land. While our ſhips lay at anchor, which was from ſix to nine in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we perceived little or no current, nor did we obſerve that the water roſe or fell.</p>
                     <p>A northerly breeze ſpringing up, we weighed and made ſail to the weſtward, which courſe ſoon brought us into deep water; and, during the 12th, we plied to the northward in ſight of both coaſts, but we kept neareſt to that of America. On the 13th, at four in the afternoon, a breeze ariſing at ſouth, we ſteered north-eaſt by north, till four o'clock the next morning, when, ſeeing no land, we directed our courſe eaſt by north; and between the hours of nine and ten, land ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, which we ſuppoſed was a continuation of the continent. It extended from eaſt by ſouth, to eaſt by north; and, not long afterwards, we deſcried more land, bearing north by eaſt. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather ſuddenly into thirteen fathoms water, at two in the afternoon, we made a trip off till four, when we again ſtood in for the land; which
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030274_0861_0FE5738B8A5E9A20"/>
ſoon after, we ſaw, extending from north to ſouth-eaſt, the neareſt part being at the diſtance of three or four leagues. The coaſt here forms a point, named by us Point Mulgrave, which is ſituated in the latitude of 67° 45′ north, and in the longitude of 194° 51′ eaſt. The land ſeemed to be very low near the ſea, but a little farther it riſes into hills of a moderate height: the whole was free from ſnow, and apparently deſtitute of wood. We now tacked, and bore away north-weſt by weſt; but, in a ſhort time afterwards, thick weather, with rain, coming on, and the wind increaſing, we hauled more to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. At two o'clock the next morning, the wind veered to ſouth-weſt by ſouth, and blew a ſtrong gale, which abated towards noon. We now ſtood to the north-eaſt, till ſix the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we ſteered rather more eaſterly: in this run we met with ſeveral ſea-horſes, and great numbers of birds; ſome of which reſembled ſand-larks and others were not larger than hedge-ſparrows. We alſo ſaw ſome ſhags, ſo that we judged we were not far from land; but, having a thick fog, we could not expect to ſee any; and as the wind blew ſtrong, it was not deemed pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to continue a courſe which was moſt likely to bring us to it. From the noon of this day, (the 16th of Auguſt) to ſix o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the following, we ſteered eaſt by north; a courſe which brought us into fifteen fathoms
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030274_0862_0FE57391035CA820"/>
water. We now ſteered north-eaſt by eaſt, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſuch a courſe, to increaſe our depth of water. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, in the ſpace of ſix leagues, it ſhoaled to eleven fathoms, which induced us to haul cloſe to the wind, that now blew at weſt. About twelve o'clock, both ſun and moon were clearly ſeen at intervals, and we made ſome haſty obſervations for the longitude; which, reduced to noon, when the latitude was 70° 33′ north, gave 197° 41′ eaſt. The time-keeper, for the ſame time, gave 198°</p>
                     <p>Some time in the forenoon, we perceived a brightneſs in the northern horizon, like that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from ice, uſually called the blink. Little notice was taken of it, from a ſuppoſition that it was improbable we ſhould ſo ſoon meet with ice. The ſharpneſs of the air, however, and gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the weather, for the two or three preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days, ſeemed to indicate ſome ſudden change. About an hour afterwards, the ſight of an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous maſs of ice, left us no longer in any doubt reſpecting the cauſe of the brightneſs of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. Between two and three o'clock we tacked cloſe to the edge of the ice, in twenty-two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms water, being then in the latitude of 70° 41′ north, and unable to ſtand on any farther: for the ice was perfectly impenetrable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from weſt by ſouth, to eaſt by north, as far as the eye could reach. Here we met wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the water, but far more upon the ice. The Commodore had thoughts of hoiſting out the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We made no progreſs; for, at twelve on the 18th, our latitude was 70° 44′ north, and we were almoſt five leagues farther to the eaſt.</p>
                     <p>We were, at preſent, cloſe to the edge of the ice, which was as compact as wall, and appeared to be at leaſt ten or twelve feet in height: but, farther northward, it ſeemed to be much higher. Its ſurface was exceedingly rugged, and, in ſeveral places, we ſaw pools of water upon it. We now ſtood to the ſouth, and, after running ſix leagues, ſhoaled the water to ſeven fathoms; but it ſoon increaſed to the depth of nine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms. At this time, the weather, which had been hazy, becoming clearer, we ſaw land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from ſouth to ſouth-eaſt by eaſt, at the diſtance of three or four miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The eaſtern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity forms a point, which was greatly encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with ice, on which account it was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of Icy Cape. Its latitude is 70° 29′ north, and its longitude 198° 20′ eaſt. The other extreme of the land was loſt in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon; and we had no doubt of its being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the continent of America. The Diſcovery being about a mile a-ſtern, and to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030274_0864_0FE573942FEC2870"/>
met with leſs depth of water than we did; and tacking on that account, the Commodore was obliged to tack alſo, to prevent ſeperation.</p>
                     <p>Our preſent ſituation was very critical. We were upon a lee ſhore in ſhoal water; and the main body of the ice to windward, was driving down upon us. It was evident, that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued much longer between it and the land, it would force us aſhore, unleſs it ſhould chance to take the ground before us. It appeared almoſt to join the land to leeward, and the only direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was free from it, was to the ſouth-weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. After making a ſhort board to the north, Captain Cook made a ſignal for the Diſcovery to tack, and his ſhip tacked at the ſame time. The wind proved in ſome meaſure favourable ſo that we lay up ſouth-weſt, and ſouth-weſt by weſt.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday the 19th at eight in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wind veering to weſt, we tacked to the northward and, at twelve, the latitude was 70° 6′ north, and the longitude 196° 42′ eaſt. In this ſituation, we had a conſiderable quantity of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ift ice about our ſhips, and the main ice was about two leagues to the north. Between one and two, we got in with the edge of it. It was leſs compact than that which we had obſerved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north; but it was too cloſe, and in too large pieces to attempt forcing the ſhips through it. We ſaw an amazing number of ſea-horſes on the ice, and as we were in want of freſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,

                        <figure/>

the boats from each ſhip were diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to procure ſome of them. By ſeven in the evening, we had received, on board the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, nine of theſe animals; which, till this time, we had ſuppoſed to be ſea cows; ſo that we were greatly diſappointed, particularly ſome of the ſailors, who, on account of the novelty of the thing, had been feaſting their eyes for ſome days paſt. Nor would they now have been diſappointed, nor have known the difference, if there had not been two or three men on board, who had been in Greenland, and declared what animals theſe were, and that no perſon ever eat of them. Notwithſtanding this, we made them ſerve us for proviſions, and there were few of our people who did not prefer them to our ſalt meat.</p>
                     <p>The fat of theſe animals, at firſt, as ſweet as marrow; but, in a few days, it becomes ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, unleſs it is ſalted, in which ſtate it will keep much longer. The lean fleſh is coarſe and blackiſh and has a ſtrong taſte: and the heart is almoſt as well taſted as that of a bullock. The fat, when melted, affords a good quantity of oil which burns very well in lamps; and their hides, which are of great thickneſs, were extremely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about our rigging. The teeth, or tuſks, of moſt of them were, at this time, of a very ſmall ſize; even ſome of the largeſt and oldeſt of theſe animals, had them not exceeding half a foot in
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030274_0867_0FE5739A2E169968"/>
length. Hence we concluded, that they had lately ſhed their old teeth.</p>
                     <p>They lie upon the ice in herds of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, huddling like ſwine, one over the other; and they roar very loud; ſo that in the night, or when the weather was foggy, they gave us notice of the vicinity of the ice, before we could diſcern it. We never found the whole herd ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome of them being conſtantly upon the watch. Theſe, on the reproach of the boat, would awake thoſe that were next to them; and the alarm being thus gradually communicated, the whole herd would preſently be awake. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were ſeldom in a hurry to get away, before they had been once fired at. Then they would fall into the ſea, one over the other in the utmoſt confuſion; and, if we did not happen, at the firſt diſcharge, to kill thoſe we fired at, we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally loſt them, though mortally wounded.</p>
                     <p>They did not appear to us to be ſo dangerous as ſome authors have repreſented them, not even when they were attacked. They are, indeed, more ſo, in apperrance, than in reality. Vaſt multitudes of them would follow, and come cloſe up to the boats; but the flaſh of a muſket in the pan, or even the mere pointing of one at them, would ſend them down in a moment. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male will defend her young one to the very laſt, and at the expence of her own life, whether upon the ice or in the water. Nor will the young,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030274_0868_0FE5739CAF514FD0"/>
one quit the dam, though ſhe ſhould have been killed; ſo that, if you deſtroy one, you are ſure of the other. The dam, when in the water, holds her young one between her fore ſins. Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is certainly more like a cow than a horſe; but this reſemblance conſiſts in nothing but the ſnout. In ſhort, it is an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal not unlike a ſeal, but incomparably larger. The length of one of them, which was none of the largeſt, was nine feet four inches from the ſnout to the tail; the circumference of its body at the ſhoulder, was ſeven feet ten inches: its circumference near the hinder fins was five feet ſix inches, and the weight of the carcaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the head, ſkin, or intrails, was eight hundred and fifty-four pounds. The head weighed forty-one pounds and a half, and the ſkin two hundred and five pounds.</p>
                     <p>It may not be improper to remark, that, for ſome days before this time, we had often ſeen flocks of ducks flying to the ſouth. They were of two ſpecies, the one much larger than the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030274_0869_0FE5739E98FC02E8"/>
other. The larger ſort was of a brown colour; and of the ſmall ſort, either the duck or drake was black and white, and the other brown. Some of our people ſaid that they alſo ſaw geeſe. This ſeems to indicate, that there muſt be land to the northward, where theſe birds, in the proper ſeaſon, find ſhelter for breeding, and whence they were now on their return to a warmer climate.</p>
                     <p>Soon after we had got our ſea-horſes on board, we were, in a manner, ſurrounded with the ice, and had no means of clearing it, but by ſteering to the ſouthward, which we did till three o'clock the next morning, with a light weſterly breeze, and, in general, thick, foggy weather. Our ſoundings were from twelve to fifteen fathoms. We then tacked and ſtood to the northward till ton o'clock, when the wind ſhifting to the north, we ſtood to the weſt-ſouth-weſt and weſt. At two in the afternoon, we fell in with the main ice, and kept along the edge of it, being partly directed by the roaring of the ſea-horſes, for we had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thick fog. Thus we continued ſailing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ill near midnight, when we got in among the looſe pieces of ice.</p>
                     <p>The wind being eaſterly, and the fog very thick, we now hauled to the ſouthward, and at ten the next morning, the weather clearing up, we ſaw the American continent, extending from ſouth by eaſt, to eaſt by ſouth; and, at noon, from ſouth-weſt half ſouth to eaſt, the diſtance
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030274_0870_0FE573A01DB79EC8"/>
of the neareſt part being five leagues. We were at preſent in the latitude of 69° 32′ north, and in the longitude of 195° 48′ eaſt; and, as the main ice was not far from us, it is evident, that it now covered a part of the ſea; which, a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had been free from it; and that it extended farther towards the ſouth, than where we firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ell in with it.</p>
                     <p>During the afternoon we had but little wind; and the Maſter was ſent in a boat to obſerve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any current, but he found none. We continued to ſteer for the American land till eight o'clock, in order to obtain a nearer view of it, and to ſearch for a harbour; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing that had the appearance of one, we again ſtood to the north, with a gentle weſterly breeze. At this time, the coaſt extended from ſouth-weſt to eaſt, the neareſt part being at the diſtance of four or five leagues. The ſouthern extreme ſeemed to form a point, to which the name of Cape <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iſburne was given. It is ſituate in the latitude of 69° 5′ north, and in the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 194° 42′ eaſt, and appeared to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably high land, even down to the ſea; but there may be low land under it, which we might not then ſee, being not leſs than ten leagues diſtant from it. In almoſt every other part, as we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the north, we had found a low coaſt, from which the land riſes to a moderate height. The coaſt now before us was free from ſnow, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030274_0871_0FE573A6920868C8"/>
in one or two places, and had a greeniſh hue. But we could not diſcern any wood upon it.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 22d, the wind was ſoutherly, and the weather for the moſt part foggy, with ſome intervals of ſunſhine. At eight in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we had a calm, which continued till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when we heard the ſurge of the ſea daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the ice, and had many looſe pieces about us. A light breeze now roſe at north-eaſt, and the fog being very thick, we ſteered to the ſouth to get clear of the ice. At eight the next morning, the fog diſperſed, and we hauled towards the weſt; for the Commodore finding that he could not get to the north near the coaſt, by reaſon of the ice, reſolved to try what could be done at a diſtance from it; and as the wind ſeemed to be fixed at north, he conſidered it as a favourable opportunity.</p>
                     <p>In our progreſs to the weſtward, the water gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually deepened to twenty-eight fathoms. With the northerly wind the air was ſharp and cold; and we had fogs, ſunſhine, ſhowers of ſnow and fleet alternately. On the 26th, at ten in the morning, we fell in with the ice. At twelve, it extended from north-weſt to eaſt by north, and ſeemed to be thick and compact. We were now, by obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the latitude of 69° 36′ north, and in the longitude of 184° eaſt; and it now appeared that we had no better proſpect of getting to the north here, than nearer the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:030274_0872_0FE573A84E869508"/>We continued ſteering to the weſt, till five in the afternoon, when we were, in ſome degree, embayed by the ice, which was very cloſe in the north-weſt and north-eaſt quarters, with a great quantity of looſe ice about the edge of the main body. At this time, we had baffling light airs, but the wind ſoon ſettled at ſouth, and increaſed to a freſh gale, accompanied with ſhowers of rain. We got the tack aboard, and ſtretched to the eaſt, as this was the only direction in which the ſea was free from ice.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 27th, at four in the morning, we tacked and ſtood to the weſtward, and at ſeven o'clock in the evening, we were cloſe in with the edge of the ice, which lay eaſt-north-eaſt, and weſt-ſouth-weſt, as far in each of thoſe directions as the eye could reach. There being but little wind, Captain Cook went with the boats, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the ſtate of the ice. He found it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of looſe pieces, of various extent, and ſo cloſe together, that he could ſcarcely enter the outer edge with a boat; and it was as impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable for the ſhips to enter it, as if it had been ſo many rocks. He particularly remarked, that it was all pure tranſparent ice, except the upper ſurface, which was rather porous. It ſeemed to be wholly compoſed of frozen ſnow, and to have been all formed at ſea. For, not to inſiſt on the improbability of ſuch prodigious maſſes floating out of rivers, none of the productions of the land
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030274_0873_0FE573AA158D1700"/>
were found incorporated, or mixed in it; which would certainly have been the caſe, if it had been formed in rivers, either great or ſmall.</p>
                     <p>The pieces of ice that formed the outer edge of the main body, were from forty or fifty yards in extent, to four or five; and the Captain judged, that the larger pieces reached thirty feet or more, under the ſurface of the water. He alſo thought it highly improbable, that this ice could have been the production of the preceding winter alone. He was rather inclined to ſuppoſe it to have been the production of many winters, It was equally improbable, in his opinion, that the little that now remained of the ſummer, could deſtroy even the tenth part of what now ſubſiſted of this great maſs; for the ſun had already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted upon it the full force and influence of its rays. The ſun, indeed, according to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contributes very little towards reducing theſe enormous maſſes. For though that lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is above the horizon a conſiderable while, it ſeldom ſhines out for more than a few hours at a time, and frequently is not ſeen for ſeveral ſucceſſive days. It is the wind, or rather the waves raiſed by the wind, that brings down the bulk of theſe prodigious maſſes, by grinding one piece againſt another, and by undermining and waſhing away thoſe parts which are expoſed to the ſurge of the ſea. This was manifeſt, from the Captain's obſerving, that the upper ſurface
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030274_0874_0FE57328E096F0F8"/>
of many pieces had been partly waſhed away, while the baſe, or under part, continued firm for ſeveral fathoms round that which appeared above water, like a ſhoal round a high rock. He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the depth of water upon one, and found that it was fifteen feet, ſo that the ſhips might have ſailed over it. If he had not meaſured this depth, he would have been unwilling to believe, that there was a ſufficient weight of ice above the ſurface, to have ſunk the other ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. It may thus happen, that more ice is deſtroyed in one tempeſtous ſeaſon than is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſeveral winters, and an endleſs accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is prevented. But that there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly a remaining ſtore, will be acknowledged by every one who has been upon the ſpot.</p>
                     <p>A thick fog, which come on while the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore was thus employed with the boats, haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened him aboard ſooner than he could have wiſhed, with one ſea-horſe to each ſhip. Our party had killed many, but could not wait to bring them off. The number of theſe animals, on all the ice that we had ſeen, is really aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We ſpent the night ſtanding off and on, amongſt the drift ice, and at nine o'clock the next morning, the fog having in ſome degree diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, boats from each of the ſhips were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched for ſea-horſes; for our people by this time began to reliſh them, and thoſe we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore furniſhed ourſelves with, were all conſumed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="unknown:030274_0875_0FE573ABB24ECCA8"/>At noon, our latitude was 69° 17′ north, our longitude 183° eaſt, and our depth of water was twenty-five fathoms. At two in the afternoon, having got on board as many ſea horſes as were deemed ſufficient, and the wind freſhening at ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, we hoiſted in the boats, and ſteered to the ſouth-weſt. But being unable to weather the ice upon this tack, or to go through it, we made aboard to the eaſtward, till about eight o'clock, then reſumed our courſe to the ſouth-weſt, and were obliged before midnight, to tack again, on account of the ice. Not long after, the wind veering to the north weſt, and blowing a ſtiff gale, we ſtretched to the ſouth-weſt, cloſe hauled.</p>
                     <p>On the 29th, in the morning, we ſaw the main ice towards the north, and ſoon after, perceived land bearing ſouth-weſt by weſt. In a ſhort time after this, more land was ſeen, bearing weſt. It ſhewed itſelf in two hills, reſembling iſlands, but ſoon the whole appeared connected. As we made a nearer approach to the land, the depth of water decreaſed very faſt, ſo that, at twelve o'clock, when we tacked, we found only eight fathoms; being three miles from the coaſt, which extended from ſouth 30° eaſt, to north 60° weſt. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extremity terminating in bluff point, being one of the hills mentioned before.</p>
                     <p>The weather was now very hazy, with driz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling rain; but, ſoon afterwards, it cleared up
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030274_0876_0FE573B1E66010F0"/>
particuarly to the ſouthward, weſtward, and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This enabled us to have a tolerable view of the coaſt; which reſembles, in every reſpect, the oppoſite coaſt of America; that is, low land next the ſea, with higher land farther back. It was totally diſtitute of wood, and even of ſnow; but was probably, covered with a moſſy ſubſtance, that gave it a browniſh hue. In the low ground that lay between the ſea and the high land, was a lake, extending to the ſouth eaſtward farther than we could ſee. As we ſtood off, the moſt weſterly of the two hills above-mentioned, came open off the bluff point, in a north-weſt direction. It had the appearance of an iſland, but it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be connected with the other by low land, though we did not ſee it. And if that be the caſe, there is a two-fold point, with a bay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. This point, which is rocky and ſteep, received the name of Cape North. It is ſituated nearly in the latitude of 68° 56′ north, and in the longitude of 180° 51′ eaſt. The coaſt beyond it doubtleſs aſſumes a very weſterly direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for we could diſcern no land to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, though the horizon was there pretty clear. Wiſhing to ſee more of the coaſt to the weſtward, we tacked again, at two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, thinking we ſhould be able to weather Cape North; but finding we could not, the wind freſhening, a thick fog ariſing, with much ſnow, and being apprehenſive of the ice coming down
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030274_0877_0FE573B3C08306F8"/>
upon us, the Commodore relinquiſhed the deſign he had formed of plying to the weſtward, and again ſtood off ſhore.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon was now ſo far advanced, and the time when the froſt generally ſets in was ſo near, that Captain Cook did not think it conſiſtent with prudence, to make any farther attempts to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a paſſage into the Atlantic Ocean this year, in any direction, ſo ſmall was the probability of ſucceſs. His attention was now directed to the ſearch of ſome place, where we might recruit our wood and water; and the object that principally occupied his thoughts was, how he ſhould paſs the winter, ſo as to make ſome improvements in navigation and geography, and at the ſame time, be in a condition to return to the north-ward the enſuing ſummer, to proſecute his ſearch of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the Atlantic.</p>

                     <p>HAVING ſtood off till our foundings were eighteen fathoms, we made ſail to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, along the coaſt, which, we were now pretty well convinced, could only be the continent of Aſia. The wind blowing freſh, and there being, at the ſame time, a thick miſt, and a very heavy fall of ſnow, it was requiſite that we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with particular caution: we therefore brought too, for a few hours, in the night. Early the next morning, which was the 30th of Auguſt, we ſteered ſuch a courſe as we judged moſt likely to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030274_0879_0FE573B739F94348"/>
bring us in with the land, being guided, in a great meaſure, by the land; for the weather was extremely thick and gloomy, with inceſſant ſhowers of ſnow. At ten o'clock we obtained a ſight of the coaſt, which was at the diſtance of four miles, bearing ſouth-weſt. Soon afterwards, our depth of water having decreaſed to ſeven fathoms, we hauled off. A very low point now bore ſouth-ſouth-weſt, diſtant two or three miles; to the eaſtward of which there ſeemed to be a narrow channel, that led into ſome water which we ſaw over the point. It is not improbable, that the lake above-mentioned communicates here with the ſea.</p>
                     <p>About twelve o'clock, the miſt diſperſing, we had a view of the coaſt, which extended from ſouth-eaſt to north-weſt by weſt. Some parts of it were apparently higher than others; but the greateſt part of it was rather low, with high land farther up the country. It was almoſt entirely covered with ſnow, which had fallen very lately. We ranged along the coaſt, at the diſtance of about two leagues, till ten o'clock in the evening, when we hauled off; but reſumed our courſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the following morning, when we had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther view of the coaſt, extending from weſt to ſouth-eaſt by ſouth. At eight o'clock, the eaſtern part bore ſouth, and was found to be an iſland, which, at twelve, was four or five miles diſtant, bearing ſouth-weſt half ſouth. It is of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030274_0880_0FE573BE766A9A60"/>
height, between four and five miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, with a ſteep rocky coaſt. It is ſituated in the latitude of 67° 45′ north, about three leagues from the continent; and is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the chart by the appellation of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's Iſland. The inland country, about this part, abounds with hills, ſome of which are of conſiderable elevation. The land in general was covered with ſnow, except a few ſpots on the coaſt, which ſtill continued to be low, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs ſo than farther towards the weſt.</p>
                     <p>During the two preceding days, the mean height of the mercury in the thermometer had been frequently below the freezing point, and, in general, very little above it; inſomuch that the water, in the veſſels upon deck, was often covered with a ſheet of ice. We continued to ſteer ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, almoſt in the direction of the coaſt, till five o'clock in the afternoon, when we ſaw land bearing ſouth 50° eaſt, which proved to be a continuation of the coaſt. We hauled up for it without delay; and, at ten in the evening, being a-breaſt of the eaſtern land, and doubtful of weathering it, we tacked, and made a board towards the weſt, till after one o'clock the next morning, (Tueſday, the 1ſt of September), when we again made ſail to the eaſt. The wind was now very unſettled, continually varying from north to north-eaſt. Between eight and nine, the eaſtern extremity of the land was at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030274_0881_0FE573C002E852E0"/>
of ſix or ſeven miles, bearing ſouth by eaſt. A head-land appeared, at the ſame time, bearing eaſt by ſouth, half ſouth; and, not long after, we could diſcern the whole coaſt that lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and a little iſland at ſome diſtance from it.</p>
                     <p>The coaſt now in ſight ſeemed to form ſeveral rocky points, that were connected by a low ſhore, without any appearance of an harbour. At a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the ſea many hills preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our view, the higheſt of which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in ſnow; in other reſpects, the whole country had a naked aſpect. At ſeven o'clock in the evening, two points of land, beyond the eaſtern head, opened off it in the direction of ſouth 37° eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook was now convinced of what he had before imagined, that this was the country of the Tſchutſki, or the north-eaſtern coaſt of Aſia; and that Beering had proceeded thus far in the year 1728; that is, to this head, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Muller, is denominated <hi>Serdze Kamen,</hi> on account of a rock upon it, that is of the figure of a heart. There are, indeed, many high rocks on this cape, ſome one or other of which may perhaps be ſhaped like a heart. It is a promontory of tolerable height, with a ſteep rocky cliff front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſea. Its latitude is 67° 3′ north, and its longitude 188° 11′ eaſt. To the eaſt of it the coaſt is elevated and cold; but, to the weſt, it
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030274_0882_0FE5731D82420C78"/>
is low, and extends north weſt by weſt, and north-north-weſt; and it is nearly of the ſame direction all the way to Cape North. The depth of water is every where the ſame at an equal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the ſhore; and this is likewiſe the caſe on the oppoſite coaſt of America. The greateſt depth we met with, as we ranged along it, was twenty-three fathoms. During the night, or in thick foggy weather, the ſoundings are no bad guide to thoſe who ſail along either of theſe coaſts.</p>
                     <p>On the 2d of September, at eight in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the moſt advanced land to the ſouth-eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, bore ſouth 25° eaſt; and, from this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular point of view, had an inſular appearance. But the thick ſhowers of ſnow, that fell in quick ſucceſſion, and ſettled on the land, concealed, from our ſight, at this time, a great part of the coaſt. In a ſhort time after, the ſun, which we had not ſeen for near five days, broke out dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intervals between the ſhowers, by which means the coaſt was, in ſome degree, freed from the fog; ſo that we obtained a ſight of it, and found that the whole was connected. The wind was ſtill northerly, the air was cold, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in the thermometer did not riſe above 35°, and was ſometimes not higher than 30°. At twelve o'clock our latitude was 66° 37′ north; Cape Serdze Kamen was twelve or thirteen leagues diſtant, bearing north 52° weſt; the moſt ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030274_0883_0FE573C1891D6B78"/>
point of land that we had in our ſight, bore ſouth 41° eaſt; our ſoundings were twenty-two fathoms; and the diſtance of the neareſt part of the ſhore was about two leagues.</p>
                     <p>The weather was now fair and bright; and, as we were ranging along the coaſt, we ſaw ſeveral of the natives, and ſome of their dwelling-places, which had the appearance of hillocks of earth. In the courſe of the evening we paſſed the Eaſtern Cape, or the point before-mentioned; from which the coaſt trends to the ſouth-weſtward. This is the ſame point of land that we had paſſed on the 11th of the preceding month. Thoſe who gave credit to Mr. Staehlin's map, then ſuppoſed it to be the eaſtern point of his iſland Alaſchka; but we were, by this time, convinced, that it is no other than the eaſtern promontory of Aſia; and, perhaps, it is the proper Tſchukotſkoi Noſs, though the promontory, which received that name from Beering, is ſituated further towards the ſouth-weſt.</p>
                     <p>Muller, in his map of the diſcoveries of the Ruſſians, places the Tſchukotſkoi Noſs nearly in the latitude of 75° north, and extends it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the eaſtward of this cape. But Captain Cook was of opinion, that he had no good authority for ſo doing. Indeed his own, or rather Deſhneff's account of the diſtance between the river Anadir and the Noſs, cannot well be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with ſo northerly a poſition. For he ſays,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030274_0884_0FE573C36A562668"/>
that, with the moſt favourable wind a perſon may go by ſea from the Noſs to the river Anadir in three whole days, and that the journey by land is very little longer. But Captain Cook, having hopes of viſiting theſe parts again, deferred the diſcuſſion of this point to another opportunity. In the mean time, however, he concluded, as Beering had done before him, that this was the eaſternmoſt point of all Aſia. It is a peninſula of conſiderable elevation, joined to the continent by a very low and apparently narrow iſthmus. It has, next the ſea, a ſteep rocky cliff; and off the very point are ſeveral rocks reſembling ſpires. It ſtands in the longitude of 190° 22′ eaſt, and in the latitude of 66° 6′ north; and is thirteen leagues diſtant, in the direction of north 53° weſt, from Cape Prince of Wales, on the coaſt of America. The land about this promontory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of vallies and hills. The former terminate at the ſea in low ſhores, and the latter in ſteep rocky points. The hills appeared like naked rocks; but the vallies, though deſtitute of tree or ſhrub, were of a greeniſh hue.</p>
                     <p>After we had paſſed the Cape, we ſteered ſouth-weſt half weſt towards the northern point of St. Lawrence's Bay, in which our ſhips had anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 10th of Auguſt. We reached it by eight o'clock the following morning, and ſaw ſome of the natives at the place where we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen them, as well as others on the oppoſite
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030274_0885_0FE573C858913AF8"/>
ſide of the bay, Not one of them, however, came off to us; which was rather remarkable, as the weather was ſufficiently favourable, and as thoſe whom we had lately viſited had no reaſon to be diſpleaſed with us. Theſe people are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Tſchutſki, whom the Ruſſians had not hitherto ſubdued; though it is manifeſt that they muſt carry on a traffic with the latter, either directly, or by the interpoſition of ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring nation; as their being in poſſeſſion of the ſpontoons we ſaw among them, cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be accounted for.</p>
                     <p>The Bay of St. Lawrence <note n="*" place="bottom">Captain Cook called it by this name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from his having anchored in it on the 10th of Auguſt, which is St. Lawrence's Day. It is worthy of remark, that Beering ſailed by this very place on Auguſt 10, 1728; for which reaſon, he denominated the neighbouring iſlands after the ſame ſaint.</note> is, at the entrance, at leaſt five leagues in breadth, and about four leagues deep, growing narrower towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, where it ſeemed to be pretty well ſheltered from the ſea winds, provided there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent depth of water for ſhips. The Commodore did not wait to examine it, though he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely deſirous of finding a convenient harbour in thoſe parts, to which he might reſort in the ſucceeding ſpring. But he wiſhed to meet with one where wood might be obtained; and he knew that none could be found here. From the ſouthern point of this bay, which is ſituated in
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030274_0886_0FE573CB5282A9A8"/>
the latitude of 65° 30′ north, the coaſt trends weſt by ſouth for the ſpace of about nine leagues, and there ſeems to form a deep bay or river; or elſe the land in that part is ſo low that we could not diſcern it.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, about one o'clock, we ſaw what was firſt ſuppoſed to be a rock; but it was found to be a dead whale, which ſome Aſiatics had killed, and were then towing aſhore. They ſeemed to endeavour to conceal themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the fiſh, in order to avoid being ſeen by us. This, however, was unneceſſary, for we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on our courſe without taking notice of them. On the 4th, at break of day, we hauled to the north-weſtward, for the purpoſe of gaining a nearer view of the inlet ſeen the day before; but the wind, not long after, veering to that direction, the deſign was abandoned; and, ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the ſouth along the coaſt, we paſſed two bays, each about ſix miles deep. The moſt northerly one is ſituate before a hill, which is rounder than any other we had obſerved upon the coaſt. There is an iſland lying before the other bay. It is a matter of doubt whether there is a ſufficient depth of water for ſhips in either of theſe bays, as, when we edged in for the ſhore, we conſtantly met with ſhoal water. This part of the country is extremely naked and hilly. In ſeveral places on the lower grounds, next the ſea, were the habitations of the natives, near all of
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030274_0887_0FE573CCDA86FC30"/>
which were erected ſtages of bones, like thoſe before-mentioned. This day, at noon, our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was 64° 38′ north, and our longitude 188° 15′ eaſt; the neareſt part of the ſhore was at the diſtance of three or four leagues; and the moſt ſouthern point of the continent in ſight bore ſouth 48° weſt.</p>
                     <p>The wind, by this time, had veered to the north, and blew a light breeze: the weather was clear, and the air ſharp. The Commodore did not think proper to follow the direction of the coaſt, as he perceived that it inclined weſtward towards the gulph of Anadir, into which he had no motive for going. He therefore ſteered a ſoutherly courſe, that he might have a ſight of the iſle of St. Lawrence, which had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by Beering. This iſland was quickly ſeen by us; and, at eight in the evening, it bore ſouth 20° eaſt, ſuppoſed to be at the diſtance of eleven leagues. The moſt ſoutherly point of the main land was, at that time, twelve leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, bearing ſouth 83° weſt. Captain Cook con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that this was the point which is called by Beering the eaſtern point of Suchotſki, or Cape Tſchukotſki; an appellation which he gave it with ſome propriety, becauſe the natives, who ſaid they were of the nation of the Tſchut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſki, came off to him from this part of the coaſt. Its latitude is 64° 13′ north, and its longitude 185° 36′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:030274_0888_0FE573CEC6A98160"/>The more the Captain was convinced of his being at preſent upon the Aſiatic coaſt, the more he was at a loſs to reconcile his obſervations with Mr. Staehlin's map of the New Northern Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago; and he could find no other method of accounting for ſo important a difference, than by ſuppoſing that he had miſtaken ſome part of what Mr. Staehlin denominates the iſland of Alaſchka for the continent of America, and had miſſed the channel by which they are ſeparated. But even on that ſuppoſition there would ſtill have been a conſiderable variation. The Captain conſidered it as an affair of ſome conſequence to clear up this point during the preſent ſeaſon, that he might have only one object in view in the following one. And as theſe northerly iſlands were ſaid to abound with wood, he had ſome hopes, if he ſhould find them, of procuring a competent ſupply of that article, of which we began to ſtand in great need. With this view he ſteered over for the coaſt of America; and the next day, about five o'clock in the afternoon, land was ſeen bearing ſouth three quarters eaſt, which we imagined was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon's Iſland, or ſome other land near it. On Sunday the 6th, at four in the morning, we had a ſight of the American coaſt, near Sledge Iſland; and, at ſix in the evening of the ſame day, that iſland was at the diſtance of about ten leagues, bearing north 6° eaſt, and the moſt eaſterly land in view bore north 49° eaſt. If any part of what
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030274_0889_0FE573D4D5A62CE0"/>
Captain Cook had conjectured to be the coaſt of the American continent, could poſſibly be the iſland of Alaſchka, it was that now in ſight; in which caſe he muſt have miſſed the channel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the main land, by ſteering towards the weſt, inſtead of the eaſt, after he had firſt fallen in with it. He was, therefore, at no loſs where to go, for the purpoſe of clearing up theſe doubts.</p>
                     <p>On the 7th, at eight o'clock in the evening, we had made a near approach to the land. Sledge Iſland bore north 85° weſt, about eight leagues diſtant; and the eaſtern part of the coaſt bore north 70° eaſt, with elevated land in the direction of eaſt by north. At this time we perceived a light on ſhore; and two canoes, with people in them, came off towards us. We brought to, in order to give them time to approach; but they reſiſted all our tokens of amity, and kept at the diſtance of a quarter of a mile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We therefore left them, and proceeded along the coaſt. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at one o'clock, obſerving that the water ſhoaled pretty faſt, we anchored in ten fathoms, and remained in that ſituation till day-light came on. We then weighed, and purſued our courſe along the coaſt, which trended eaſt, and eaſt half ſouth. At ſeven o'clock in the evening we were abreaſt of a point, ſituated in the longitude of 197° eaſt, and in the latitude of 64° 21′ north; beyond which the coaſt aſſumes a more northerly
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030274_0890_0FE573D67273D908"/>
direction. At eight this point, which received the appellation of Cape Darby, bore ſouth 62° weſt; the moſt northern land we had in view, bore north 32° eaſt; and the diſtance of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the ſhore was one league. In this ſituation we let go our anchors in thirteen fathoms, over a muddy bottom.</p>
                     <p>On the 9th, at break of day, we weighed and made ſail along the coaſt. We now ſaw land, which we ſuppoſed to be two iſlands; the one bearing eaſt, the other ſouth 70° eaſt. Not long afterwards, we found ourſevles near a coaſt cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wood; a pleaſing ſight to which we had not been lately accuſtomed. As we advanced northward, land was ſeen in the direction of north-eaſt, half north, which proved a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the coaſt upon which we now were: we likewiſe perceived high land over the iſlands, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, at a conſiderable diſtance beyond them. This was imagined to be the continent, and the other land the iſle of Alaſchka; but it was already a matter of doubt, whether we ſhould diſcover a paſſage between them, for the water gradually ſhoaled, as we proceeded further towards the north. In conſequence of this, two boats were diſpatched a-head to ſound: and the Commodore ordered the Diſcovery, as ſhe drew the leaſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to lead, keeping nearly in the middle chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, between the coaſt and the moſt northerly iſland. In this manner we continued our courſe
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030274_0891_0FE573D7F82B5560"/>
till three o'clock in the afternoon, when having paſſed the iſland, our ſoundings did not exceed three fathoms and a half, and the Reſolution once brought up the mud from the bottom. In no part of the channel could a greater depth of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be found, though we had ſounded it from one ſide to the other; we therefore deemed it high time to return.</p>
                     <p>At this time, a head-land on the weſtern ſhore, to which the name of Bald-head was given, was about one league diſtant, bearing north by weſt. The coaſt extended beyond it as far as north-eaſt by north, where it appeared to terminate in a point; behind which, the coaſt of the high land, that was ſeen over the iſlands, ſtretched itſelf. The ſhore on the weſtern ſide of Bald-head, forms a bay, in the bottom of which is a beach, where we perceived many huts of the natives.</p>
                     <p>We continued to ply back during the whole night; and, by day-break on the 10th, had deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened our water ſix fathoms. At nine o'clock, when we were about three miles from the weſt ſhore, Captain Cook, accompanied by Mr. King, went with two boats in ſearch of wood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They landed in that part where the coaſt projects into a bluff head compoſed of perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular <hi>ſtrata</hi> of a dark blue rock, intermixed with glimmer and quartz. Adjoining to the beach is a narrow border of land, which was at this time covered with long graſs, and where they
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030274_0892_0FE573D9D6E6A7D8"/>
obſerved ſome angelica. The ground, beyond this, riſes with ſome abruptneſs: towards the top of this elevation, they found a heath, that abounded with berries of various kinds: further onwards the country was rather level, and thinly covered with ſmall ſpruce-trees, birch, and willows. They ſaw the tracts of foxes and deer upon the beach; in many parts of which, there was a great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of drift-wood: there was alſo no want of freſh-water.</p>
                     <p>Our gentlemen and their attendants having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned on board, the Commodore had thoughts of bringing the ſhips to an anchor here; but the wind then ſhifting to north-eaſt, and blowing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on this ſhore, he ſtretched over to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite one, expecting to find wood there likewiſe. At eight in the evening, we anchored near the ſouthern end of the moſt northerly iſland, for ſuch we then imagined it to be. The next morning, however, we found that it was a peninſula, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the continent by a low iſthmus, on each ſide of which, a bay is formed by the coaſt. We plied into the ſouthernmoſt of theſe bays, and caſt anchor again, about twelve o'clock, in five fathoms water, over a muddy bottom; the point of the peninſula, to which the appellation of Cape Denbigh was given, being one league diſtance, in the direction of north 68° weſt.</p>
                     <p>We obſerved on the peninſula, ſeveral of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and one of them came off in a ſmall canoe.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030274_0893_0FE573DE30122318"/>
Captain Cook gave this man a knife and ſome beads, with which he appeared to be well pleaſed; we made ſigns to him to bring us ſome proviſion, upon which he inſtantly quited us, and paddled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>owards the ſhore. Happening to meet another man coming off, who had two dried ſalmons, he got them from him; and when he returned to our ſhip, he refuſed to give them to any body except Captain Cook. Some of our people fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that he aſked for him under the name of <hi>Capitaine</hi>; but, in this, they were perhaps miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Others of the inhabitants came off ſoon afterwards, and gave us a few dried fiſh, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for ſuch trifles as we had to barter with them. They ſhewed no diſlike for tobacco, but they were moſt deſirous of knives.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, Mr. Gore was diſpatched to the peninſula, to procure wood and water; of the former of which articles, we obſerved great plenty upon the beach. At the ſame time, a boat from each of the ſhips was ſent to ſound round the bay, and at three o'clock, the wind freſhening at north-eaſt, we weighed anchor and endeavoured to work further in. But that was quickly found to be impracticable, by reaſon of the ſhoals, which extended entirely round the bay, to the diſtance of upwards of two miles from the ſhore; as the officers, who had been ſent out for the purpoſe of ſounding, reported. We therefore ſtood off and on with the ſhips, waiting

He informed the Commodore, that he had found but little freſh water, and that the wood could not be procured without difficulty on account of the boats grounding at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the beach. As this was the caſe we ſtood back to the other ſhore; and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at eight, all the boats, and a detachment of men, with an officer, were ſent to get wood from the place where Captain Cook had landed on the 10th.</p>
                     <p>After having continued, for ſome time, to ſtand off and on with the ſhips, we at length caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in leſs than five fathoms, at the diſtance of half a league from the coaſt, whoſe ſouthern point bore ſouth 26° weſt. Cape Denbigh was about twenty-ſix miles diſtant, bearing ſouth 72° eaſt; Bald-head was nine leagues off, in the direction of north 60° eaſt; and the iſland near the eaſtern ſhore, ſouth of Cape Denbigh, named by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook, Beſborough Iſland, was fifteen leagues diſtant, bearing ſouth 52° eaſt</p>
                     <p>This being a very open road, and therefore not a ſecure ſtation for the ſhips, the Commodore reſolved not to wait till our ſtock of water was completed, as that would take up ſome time; but only to furniſh both ſhips with wood, and afterwards to ſeek a more commodious place for the former article. Our people carried off the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030274_0895_0FE548C86B751B58"/>
drift-wood that lay on the beach, and performed that buſineſs with great expedition; for, as the wind blew along the ſhore, the boats were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſail both ways. In the afternoon Captain Cook went on ſhore, and took a walk into the country; which, in thoſe parts where there was no wood, abounded with heath, and other plants, ſeveral of which had plenty of berries, all ripe. Scarce a ſingle plant was in flower. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, ſuch as birch, alders, and willows, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned walking to be very troubleſome among the trees, which were all ſpruce, and none of which exceeded ſeven or eight inches in diameter; but ſome were obſerved lying on the beach, that were above twice that ſize. All the drift-wood that we ſaw in theſe northern parts was fir.</p>
                     <p>The following day, which was Sunday the 13th, a family of the natives came near the ſpot where our people were occupied in taking of wood. The Captain ſaw only the huſband and wife, and their child, beſides a fourth perſon, who was the moſt deformed cripple he had ever ſeen. The huſband was nearly blind, and neither he, nor his wife, were ſuch well looking people as many of thoſe whom we had met with on this coaſt. Both of them had their lower lips perforated; and they were in poſſeſſion of ſome glaſs-beads, reſembling thoſe we had ſeen before among their neighbours. Iron was the article that pleaſed them moſt. For four knives which had been
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030274_0896_0FE573E391B9AC88"/>
formed out of an old iron hoop, the Captain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from them near four hundred pounds weight of fiſh, that had been lately caught by them. Some of theſe were trout, and others were, with reſpect to ſize and taſte, ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a herring and a mullet. The Captain gave a few beads to the child, who was a female; upon which the mother immediately burſt into tears, then the father, next after him the cripple, and at laſt, to add the finiſhing ſtroke to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, the child herſelf. This muſic, however, was not of long duration.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King had, on the preceding day, been in company with the ſame family. His account of this interview is to the following purport: While he attended the wooding party, a canoe, filled with natives, approached, out of which an elderly man and woman (the huſband and wife above mentioned) came aſhore. Mr. King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a ſmall knife to the woman, and promiſed to give her a much larger one in exchange for ſome fiſh. She made ſigns to him to follow her. After he had proceeded with them about a mile, the man fell down as he was croſſing a ſtony beach, and happened to cut his foot very much. This occaſioned Mr. King to ſtop; upon which the woman pointed to her huſband's eyes, which were covered with a thick, whitiſh film. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards kept cloſe to his wife, who took care to apprize him of the obſtacles in his way. The
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030274_0897_0FE573E806EFF870"/>
woman had a child on her back, wrapped up in the hood of her jacket. After walking about two miles, they arrived at an open ſkin-boat, which was turned on one ſide, the convex part towards the wind, and was made to ſerve for the habitation of this family. Mr. King now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a remarkable operation on the man's eyes. He was firſt deſired to hold his breath, then to breathe on the diſtempered eyes, and afterwards to ſpit on them. The woman then took both the hands of Mr. King, and preſſing them to the man's ſtomach, held them there for ſome time, while ſhe recounted ſome melancholy hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting her family; ſometimes pointing to her huſband, ſometimes to her child, and at other times to the cripple, who was related to her. Mr. King purchaſed all the fiſh they had, which conſiſted of excellent ſalmon, ſalmon-trout, and mullet. Theſe fiſh were faithfully delivered to the perſon he ſent for them.</p>
                     <p>The woman was ſhort and ſquat, and her viſage was plump and round. She wore a jacket made of deer ſkin, with a large hood, and had on a pair of wide boots. She was punctured from the lip to the chin. Her huſband was well made, and about five feet two inches in height. His hair was black and ſhort and he had but little beard. His complexion was of a light copper caſt. He had two holes in his lower lip, in which, however, he had no ornaments. The
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030274_0898_0FE573E98D7E73D8"/>
teeth of both of them were black, and appeared as if they had been filed down level with the gums.</p>
                     <p>Before night, on the 13th, we had amply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſhips with wood, and had conveyed on board about a dozen ton of water to each. On the 14th a party was detached on ſhore to cut brooms, and likewiſe the branches of ſpruce-trees for brewing beer. About twelve o'clock all our people were taken on board, for the wind freſhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had raiſed ſo heavy a ſurf on the beach, that our boats could not continue to land without extreme difficulty and danger.</p>
                     <p>As doubts were ſtill entertained whether the coaſt, upon which we now were, belonged to an iſland, or to the continent of America, lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant King was diſpatched by the Commodore, with two boats, well manned and armed, to make ſuch ſearch as might tend to remove all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of opinion on the ſubject. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to proceed towards the north as far as the extreme point ſeen on Wedneſday the 9th, or a little further, if he ſhould find it neceſſary; to land there, and, from the heights, endeavour to diſcover whether the land he was then upon, imagined to be the iſland of Alaſchka, was really an iſland, or was connected with the land to the eaſtward, ſuppoſed to be the American conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. If it proved to be an iſland, he was to examine the depth of water in the channel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030274_0899_0FE573EB725548D0"/>
it and the continent, and which way the flood-tide came: but if he ſhould find the two lands united, he was to return immediately to the ſhip. He was directed not to be abſent longer than four or five days; and it was alſo mentioned in his inſtructions, that, if any unforeſeen or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable accident ſhould force our ſhips off the coaſt, the rendezvous was to be at the harbour of Samganoodha.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 15th, the ſhips removed over to the bay on the ſouth-eaſtern ſide of Cape Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigh, where we caſt anchor in the afternoon. Not long after, ſeveral of the inhabitants came off in canoes, and gave us ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſalmon in exchange for trifling articles. Early the next morning, nine men, each in a ſeparate canoe, paid us a viſit, with the ſole view of gratifying their curioſity. They approached the ſhip with caution, and drawing up abreaſt of each other, under our ſtern, favoured us with a ſong; while one of their number made many ludicrous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with his hands and body, and another beat upon a ſort of drum. There was nothing ſavage, either in the ſong, or the geſtures with which it was accompanied. There ſeemed to be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, either with reſpect to ſize or features, between theſe people, and thoſe whom we had ſeen on every other part of the coaſt, except King George's Sound. Their dreſs, which chiefly conſiſted of the ſkins of deer, was made after
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030274_0900_0FE573ED56031220"/>
the ſame mode; and they had adopted the practice of perforating their lower lips, and affixing orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them.</p>
                     <p>The habitations of theſe Americans were ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated cloſe to the beach. They conſiſt merely of a ſloping roof, without any ſide walls, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of logs, and covered with earth and graſs. The floor is likewiſe laid with logs. The entrance is at one end, and the fire-place is juſt within it. A ſmall hole is made near the door of the hut, for the purpoſe of letting out the ſmoke.</p>
                     <p>A party of men was diſpatched, this morning, to the peninſula for brooms and ſpruce. Half the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the people of both ſhips were, at the ſame time, permitted to go aſhore and gather ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Theſe returned on board about twelve o'clock and the other half then landed for the ſame purpoſe. The berries found here were hurtle-ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, heath-berries, partridge-berries, and wild cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant-berries. Captain Cook alſo went aſhore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and took a walk over part of the peninſula. He met with very good graſs in ſeveral places, and ſcarcely obſerved a ſingle ſpot on which ſome vegetable was not growing. The low land by which this peninſula is united to the continent, abounds with narrow creeks, and likewiſe with ponds of water, ſeveral of which were at this time frozen over. There were numbers of buſtards and geeſe, but they were ſo ſhy, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to get within muſquet-ſhot of them. Some
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030274_0901_0FE573F3979932E0"/>
ſnipes were alſo ſeen; and on the higher grounds, were partridges of two ſpecies; where there was wood, muſquitoes were numerous. Some of the officers, who went further into the country than Captain Cook did, met with ſome of the natives of both ſexes, who treated them with civility and kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Commodore was of opinion, that this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninſula had been an iſland in ſome diſtant period; for there were marks of the ſea having formerly flowed over the iſthmus; and even at preſent, it appeared to be kept out by a bank of ſand ſtones, and wood which the waves had thrown up: It was manifeſt from this bank, that the land here encroached upon the ſea, and it was not difficult to trace its gradual formation.</p>
                     <p>Lieutenant King returned from his expedition about ſeven o'clock this evening. He had ſet out at eight o'clock at night, on the 14th. The crews of the boats rowed without intermiſſion towards the land, till one in the morning of the 15th. They then ſet their ſails, and ſtood acroſs the bay, which the coaſt forms to the weſtward of Bald-Head. They afterwards, about three o'clock, again made uſe of their oars, and by two in the afternoon, had got within two miles of Bald-Head, under the lee of the high land. At that time all the men in the boat belonging to the Reſolution, except two, were ſo oppreſſed with fatigue and ſleep, that Mr. King's utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030274_0902_0FE573F5659CD478"/>
to make them put on were perfectly inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. They, at length, were ſo far exhauſted, as to drop their oars, and fall aſleep at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the boat. In conſequence of this, Mr King, and two gentlemen who were with him, were obliged to lay hold of the oars; and they landed, a little after three o'clock, between Bald-Head and a point that projects to the eaſtward.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King, upon his landing, aſcended the heights, from which he could ſee the two coaſts join, and that the inlet terminated in a ſmall creek or river, before which there were banks of ſand or mud, and in every part ſhoal water. The land, for ſome diſtance towards the north, was low and ſwampy; then it roſe in hills; and the perfect junction of thoſe, on each ſide of the inlet, was traced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt difficulty.</p>
                     <p>From the elevated ſituation in which Mr. King took his ſurvey of the Sound, he could diſcern many ſpacious vallies, with rivers flowing through them, well wooded, and bounded by hills of a moderate height. One of the rivers towards the north-weſt ſeemed to be conſiderable; and he was inclined to ſuppoſe, from its direction, that it diſcharged itſelf into the ſea at the head of the bay. Some of his people, penetrating beyond this into the country, found the trees to be of a larger ſize the further they proceeded.</p>
                     <p>To this inlet Captain Cook gave the name of Norton's Sound, in honour of Sir Fletcher Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030274_0903_0FE573F6E9F754F8"/>
now Lard Grantley, a near relation of Mr. King. It extends northward as far as the latitude of 64° 55′ north. The bay, wherein our ſhips were now at anchor, is ſituated on the ſouth-eaſtern ſide of it, and is denominated <hi>Chacktoole</hi> by the natives. It is not a very excellent ſtation, being expoſed to the ſouth and ſouth-weſt winds. Nor is a harbour to be met with in all this Sound. We were ſo fortunate, however, as to have the wind from the north-eaſt and the north, during the whole time of our continuance here, with very fine weather. This afforded an opportunity of making a great number of lunar obſervations, the mean reſult of which gave 197° 13′ eaſt, as the longitude of the anchoring-place on the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſide of the Sound, while its latitude was 64° 31′ north. With reſpect to the tides, the night-flood roſe two or three feet, and the day flood was ſcarcely perceivable.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook being now perfectly convinced, that Mr. Staehlin's map was extremely erroneous, and having reſtored the continent of America to the ſpace which that gentleman had occupied with his imaginary iſland of Alaſchka, thought it now high time to quit theſe northerly regions, and retire to ſome place for the winter, where he might obtain proviſions and refreſhments. He did not conſider Petropaulowſka, or the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamtſchatka, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to furniſh a ſufficient ſupply. He had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030274_0904_0FE573F8CB5B68E0"/>
other reaſons for not going thither at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; the principal of which was, his great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to remain inactive for ſix or ſeven months, which would have been the conſequence of paſſing the winter in any of theſe northern countries. He at length concluded, that no ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo convenient for our purpoſe as the Sandwich Iſlands. To them, therefore, he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a reſolution of repairing. But a ſupply of water being neceſſary before he could execute that deſign, he determined, with a view of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing this eſſential article, to ſearch the coaſt of America for a harbour, by proceeding along it to the ſouthward. If he ſhould not meet with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in that ſearch, his intention was to reach Samganoodha, which was appointed for our place of rendezvous, in caſe the ſhips ſhould happen to ſeparate.</p>

                     <p>IN the morning of the 17th of September, we weighed anchor with a light eaſterly breeze, and ſteered to the ſouthward, attempted to paſs within Beſbourough Iſland; but, though it is ſix or ſeven miles diſtant from the continent, we were prevented, by meeting with ſhoal water. Having but little wind all the day, we did not
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030274_0906_0FE5740003B5C4A0"/>
paſs that iſland before it was dark; and the night was ſpent under an eaſy ſail.</p>
                     <p>At day-break, on the 18th, we reſumed our progreſs along the coaſt. At noon, our ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were no more than five fathoms. Beſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Iſland, at this time, bore north 42° eaſt; the moſt ſoutherly land in ſight, which alſo prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be an iſland, bore ſouth 66° weſt; the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage between it and the continent, was in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſouth 40° weſt, and the neareſt land was at the diſtance of about two miles.</p>
                     <p>We continued to ſteer for this paſſage, till the boats which were a-head made the ſignal for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than three fathoms water. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, we hauled without the iſland, and diſplayed the ſignal for the Reſolution's boat to keep between the ſhore and the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>This iſland, to which the name of Stuart's Iſland was given, lies in the latitude of 63° 35′ north, and is ſeventeen leagues diſtant from Cape Denbigh, in the direction of ſouth 27° weſt. It is ſix or ſeven leagues in circumference. Though ſome parts of it are of a moderate height, yet, in general, it is low, with ſome rocks off the weſtern part. The greateſt part of the coaſt of the continent is low land, but we perceived high land up the country. It forms a point, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite the iſland, which was diſtinguiſhed by the name of Cape Stephens, and is ſituated in the latitude of 63° 33′ north, and in the longitude of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030274_0907_0FE5740189DAE360"/>
197° 41′ eaſt. Some drift wood was obſerved on the ſhores, both on the iſland and of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; but not a ſingle tree was ſeen growing upon either. Veſſels might anchor, upon occaſion, between the continent and the north-eaſt ſide of this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and in a depth of five fathoms, ſheltered from the eaſterly, weſterly, and ſoutherly winds. But this ſtation would be entirely expoſed to the northerly winds, the land, in that direction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too remote to afford any ſecurity. Before we reached Stuart's Iſland, we paſſed two little iſlands, ſituate between us and the main land; and as we ranged along the coaſt, ſeveral of the natives made their appearance upon the ſhore, and by ſigns, ſeemed to invite us to approach.</p>
                     <p>We were no ſooner without the iſland, than we ſteered ſouth by weſt, for the moſt ſouthern part of the continent in ſight, till eight in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when, the depth of water having decreaſed from ſix fathoms to leſs than four, we tacked and ſtood to the northward into five fathoms, and then paſſed the night in ſtanding off and on. At the time we tacked, the ſouthernmoſt point of land above-mentioned, which we named Point Shallow-Water, bore ſouth half eaſt, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſeven leagues. On the 19th, at day-break, we reſumed our ſoutherly courſe; but ſhoal water ſoon obliged us to haul more to the weſtward. We were at length ſo far advanced upon the bank, that we could not hold a north-north-weſt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030274_0908_0FE574030E1E22C0"/>
courſe, as we ſometimes met with only four fathoms. The wind blowing freſh at eaſt-north-eaſt, it was now high time to endeavour to find a greater depth of water, and quit a coaſt upon which we would no longer navigate with ſafety. We therefore hauled the wind to the northward, and the water gradually increaſed in depth to eight fathoms.</p>
                     <p>At the time of our hauling the wind, we were about twelve leagues diſtant from the continent, and nine to the weſt of Stuart's Iſland. We ſaw no land to the ſouthward of Point Shallow-Water, which Captain Cook judged to lie in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 63° north; ſo that between this latitude and Shoal Neſs, in latitude 60°, the coaſt has not been explored. It is probably acceſſible only to boats, or very ſmall veſſels; or, if there are channels for veſſels of greater magnitude, it would require ſome time to find them. From the maſt-head, the ſea within us appeared to be checquered with ſhoals; the water was very muddy and diſcoloured, and much freſher than at any of the places where our ſhips had lately anchored. From this we inferred, that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable river runs into the ſea, in this unexplored part.</p>
                     <p>After we had got into eight fathoms water, we ſteered to the weſtward, and afterwards more ſoutherly, for the land diſcovered by us on the 5th of September, which at noon on the 20th,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030274_0909_0FE5740A4E15ED30"/>
bore ſouth-weſt by weſt, at the diſtance of ten or eleven leagues. We had now a freſh gale at north, and, at intervals, ſhowers of hail and ſnow, with a pretty high ſea. To the land before us, the commodore gave the appellation of Clerke's Iſland. It ſtands in the latitude of 63° 15′, and in the longitude of 190° 30′. It ſeemed to be an iſland of conſiderable extent, in which are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hills, all connected by low ground, ſo that it looks, at a diſtance, like a group of Iſlands. Near its eaſtern part is a little iſland, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for having on it three elevated rocks. Both the greater iſland, and this ſmaller one, were inhabited</p>
                     <p>About ſix o'clock in the afternoon, we reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the northern point of Clerke's Iſland; and having ranged along its coaſt till dark, we brought too, during the night. Early the next morning, we again ſtood in for the coaſt, and proceeded along it in queſt of an harbour, till twelve o'clock, when finding no probability of ſucceſs, we left it and ſteered ſouth-ſouth-weſt, for the land diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by us on the 29th of July; having a freſh gale at north, accompanied with ſhowers of ſnow and ſleet.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday the 23d, at day-break, the land above-mentioned made its appearance, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouth-weſt, at the diſtance of ſix or ſeven leagues. From this point of view it reſembled a cluſter of iſlands; but it was found to be only
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030274_0910_0FE5740BF29182C8"/>
one, of about thirty miles in extent, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of north-weſt and ſouth-eaſt; the ſouth-eaſtern extremity being Cape Upright, which we have mentioned before. The iſland is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, particularly at the low necks of land by which the hills are connected. Captain Cook afterwards found, that it was entirely unknown to the Ruſſians, and, therefore, conſidering it as a diſcovery of our own, he named it Gore's Iſland. It appeared to be barren and deſtitute of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, at leaſt we ſaw none. Nor did we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch a number of birds about it, as we had ſeen when we firſt diſcovered it. But we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome ſea-otters, an animal which we had not found to the north of this latitude. About twe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, after we had paſſed Cape Upright, we ſteered ſouth-eaſt by ſouth, for Samganoodha, with a gentle breeze at north-north-weſt, being reſolved to loſe no more time in ſearching for an harbour among iſlands, which we now began to ſuſpect had no exiſtence; at leaſt, not in the latitude and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude in which they have been placed by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern delineators of charts. On the 24th, in the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030274_0911_0FE5747E6C7B3500"/>
evening, the wind veered to ſouth-weſt and ſouth, and increaſed to a freſh gale.</p>
                     <p>We continued our eaſterly courſe till eight in the morning of the 25th, when in the longitude of 191° 10′, and in the latitude of 58° 32′ we tacked and ſtood to the weſtward; ſoon after which, the gale increaſing, we were reduced to two courſes, and cloſe-reefed main-top-ſails. In a ſhort time after, the Reſolution ſprung a leak, under the ſtarboard buttock, which was ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as to keep one pump conſtantly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We would not venture to put the ſhip upon the other tack, from the apprehenſion of getting upon the ſhoals that lie to the north-weſt of Cape Newenham; but continued to ſteer towards the weſt, till ſix in the evening of Saturday the 26th, when we wore and ſtood to the eaſtward; and then the leak gave us no further trouble. This proved, that it was above the water-line, which gave us great ſatisfaction. The gale had now ceaſed, but the wind continued at ſouth, and ſouth-weſt, for ſome days longer.</p>
                     <p>At length, on Friday the 2d of october, at day-break, we ſaw the iſle of Oonalaſhka, in a ſouth-eaſt direction. But as the land was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by a thick haze, we were not certain with reſpect to our ſituation till noon, when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved latitude determined it. We hauled into a bay, ten miles to the weſtward of Samganood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha, known by the appellation of Egoochſhac;
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030274_0912_0FE57460453C3D90"/>
but finding very deep water, we ſpeedily left it. The natives viſited us at different times, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them dried ſalmon, and other fiſh, which our ſailors received in exchange for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. Only a few days before, every ounce of tobacco that remained in the ſhip, had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed among them, and the quantity was not half ſufficient to anſwer their demands. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, ſo thoughtleſs and improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a being is an Engliſh ſailor, that they were as profuſe in making their bargains, as if we had arrived at a port in Virginia; by which means, in leſs than two days, the value of this commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity was lowered above a thouſand <hi>per c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The next day at one o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored in the harbour of Samganoodha, and, on the morning of the 4th, the carpenters were employed in ripping off the ſheathing of and under the wale of the Reſolution on the ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſide. Many of the ſeams were found en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirly open; it was therefore not to be wondered at, that ſo much water had got into the ſhip. We cleared the fiſh and ſpirit rooms, and the after-hold; and diſpoſed things in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that, in caſe of any future leaks of the ſame nature the water might find its way to the pumps. Beſides this work, and completing our ſtock of water, we cleared the fore-hold, and took in a quantity of ballaſt.</p>

                        <pb n="88" facs="unknown:030274_0913_0FE5747FF282A230"/>The vegetables we had met with when we were here before, were now, for the moſt part, in a ſtate of decay. There being great plenty of ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, one third of the people, by turns, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to go a-ſhore and gather them. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantities of them were alſo brought to us by the inhabitants. If there were any ſeeds of the ſcurvy, among the people of either ſhip, theſe berries, and the uſe of ſpruce beer, which the were allowed to drink every other day, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually eradicated them.</p>
                     <p>We likewiſe procured abundance of fiſh, at firſt, chiefly ſalmon, both freſh and dried, which the natives brought us. Some of the freſh ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was in the higheſt perfection; but there was one ſort, which, from the figure of its head, we called hook-noſed, that was but indifferent. Drawing the ſeine ſeveral times, at the head of they bay, we caught many ſalmon trout, and a halibut that weighed two hundred and fifty-four pounds. We afterwards had recourſe to hooks and lines. A boat was ſent out every morning, which ſeldom returned without eight or ten ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libut, a quantity more than ſufficient to ſerve all our people. Theſe fiſh were excellent, and there were few who did not perfer them to ſalmon. Thus we not only obtained a ſupply of fiſh for preſent conſumption, but had ſome to carry with us to ſea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:030274_0914_0FE57481D3E74E70"/>Captain Cook received, on the 8th, by the hands of a native of Oonalaſhka, named Derra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſhk, a very ſingular preſent, conſidering the place we were in. It was a rye loaf, or rather a pye in the form of a loaf, as it encloſed ſome ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, well ſeaſoned with pepper. This man had brought a ſimilar preſent for Captain Clerke, and a note for each of the Captains, written in a character which none of us underſtood. It was natural to imagine, that theſe two preſents were from ſome Ruſſians now in our neighbourhood, and therefore the Captains ſent, by the ſame meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, to theſe unknown friends, a few bottles of rum, wine and porter, which they ſuppoſed would be highly acceptable. Captain Cook alſo ſent, in company with Derramouſhk, Corporal Lediard, of the marines, an intelligent man, for the purpoſe of gaining farther information; with orders that if he met with any Ruſſians, he ſhould endeavour to make them underſtand, that we were Engliſhmen, the friends and allies of their nation.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 10th, Corporal Lediard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with three Ruſſian ſeamen, or furriers, who, with ſeveral others, reſided at Egoochſhac, where they had ſome ſtore-houſes, a dwelling houſe, and a ſloop of about thirty ton burthen. One of theſe Ruſſians was either Maſter or Mate of this veſſel. They were all three intelligent, well behaved men, and extremely ready to give
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030274_0915_0FE57486AAE648D8"/>
us all the information we could deſire. But, for want of an interpreter, we found it very difficult to underſtand each other. They appeared to have a perfect knowledge of the attempts which their countrymen had made to navigate the Frozen Ocean, and of the diſcoveries that had been made from Kamtſchatka, by Beering, Tſcherik off, and Spangenberg. But they had not the leaſt idea to what part of the world Mr. Staehlin's map re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, when it was laid before them. When Captain Cook pointed out Kamtſchatka, and ſome other places, upon this map, they aſked him whether he had ſeen the iſlands there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and, on his anſwering in the negative, one of them put his finger upon a part of the map, where a number of iſlands are laid down, and ſaid, that he had cruiſed there in ſearch of land, but could not meet with any. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then ſhewed them his own chart, and found that they were ſtrangers to every part of the coaſt of America, except that which lies oppoſite this iſland.</p>
                     <p>One of theſe men ſaid, that he had been with Beering in his American voyage; but he muſt then have been very young; for even now, at the diſtance of thirty-ſeven years, he had not the appearance of being aged. Never was greater reſpect paid to the memory of any eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than by theſe men to that of Beering. The trade in which they are engaged, is very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030274_0916_0FE5748832E046D8"/>
and its being undertaken and extended to the eaſtward of Kamtſchatka, was the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate reſult of the ſecond voyage of that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed navigator, whoſe misfortunes proved the ſource of much private benefit to individuals, and of public utility to the Ruſſian empire. And yet, if his diſtreſſes had not accidentally carried him to the iſland which bears his name, where he ended his life, and from whence the remainder of his ſhip's crew brought back ſpecimens of its valuable furs, the Ruſſians would probably have undertaken no future voyages, which could lead them to make diſcoveries in this ſea, towards the American coaſt. Indeed, after his time, their miniſtry ſeem to have paid leſs attention to this object; and, for what diſcoveries have been ſince made, we are principally indebted to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing ſpirit of private merchants, encouraged, however, by the ſuperintending care of the court of Peterſburgh.</p>
                     <p>The three Ruſſians having remained all night with the Commodore, viſited Captain Clerke the following morning, and then departed, perfectly ſatisfied with the reception they had met with. They promiſed to return in a few days, and bring with them a chart of the iſlands ſituate between Kamtſchatka and Oonalaſhka.</p>
                     <p>In the evening of the 14th, while Captain Cook and Mr. Webber were at a village, not far from Samganoodha, a Ruſſian landed there, who
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030274_0917_0FE57489B9A71FF0"/>
proved to be the principal perſon among his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in this and the adjacent iſles. His name was Eraſim Gregorioff Sin Iſmyloff. He arrived in a canoe that carried three perſons, attended by twenty or thirty ſmaller canoes, each conducted by one man. Immediately after landing, they conſtructed a ſmall tent for Iſmyloff, of materials which they had brought with them, and they afterwards made others for themſelves, of their canoes and paddles, which they covered with graſs. Iſmyloff having invited the Captain and Mr. Webber into his tent, ſet before them ſome dried ſalmon and berries. He appeared to be a man of ſenſe; and the Captain felt no ſmall mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification in not being able to converſe with him except by ſigns, with the aſſiſtance of figures, and other characters. The Captain requeſted him to favour him with his company on board the next day, and accordingly he came with all his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. He had indeed, moved into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of our ſtation, for the expreſs purpoſe of waiting upon us.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook was in hopes of receiving from him the chart which his three countrymen had promiſed, but he was diſappointed. However, Iſmyloff aſſured him he ſhould have it, and he kept his word. The Captain found him very well acquainted with the geography of thoſe parts, and with all the diſcoveries which had been made in this quarter by the Ruſſians. On ſeeing the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030274_0918_0FE5748B9F29FF30"/>
modern maps, he inſtantly pointed out their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: he ſaid, he had accompanied Lieutenant Syndo, or (as he called him) Synd, in his nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern expedition; and according to his account, they did not proceed farther than Tſchukotſkoi Noſs, or rather than St Lawrence's Bay; for he pointed on our chart to the very place where Captain Cook landed. From thence, he ſaid, they went to an iſland, in the latitude of 63° north, upon which they did not land. He did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the name of that iſland; but the Captain conjectured, that it was the ſame with that to which the appellation of Clerke's Iſland had been given. To what place Synd repaired afterwards, or in what particular manner he employed the two years, during which, according to Iſmyloff, his reſearches laſted, he was either unable or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to inform us. Perhaps he did not comprehend our inquiries on this point; and yet, in almoſt every other thing, we found means to make him underſtand us. This inclined us to ſuſpect, that he had not really been in this expedition, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what he had aſſerted.</p>
                     <p>Not only Iſmyloff, but alſo the others affirmed that they were totally unacquainted with the American continent to the northward; and that neither Lieutennant Synd, nor any other Ruſſian, had ſeen it of late years. They called it by the ſame name which Mr. Staehlin has aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ted to his large iſland, that is Alaſchka.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:030274_0919_0FE574900237C790"/>According to the information we obtained from Iſmyloff and his countrymen, the Ruſſians have made ſeveral attempts to gain a footing upon that part of the North American continent, that lies contiguous to Oonalaſhka and the adjacent iſlands, but have conſtantly been repulſed by the inhabitants, whom they repreſent as a very trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous people. They made mention of two or three captains, or chief men, who had been murdered by them; and ſome of the Ruſſians ſhewed us wounds which they declared they had received there.</p>
                     <p>Iſmyloff alſo informed us, that in the year 1773, an expedition had been undertaken into the Frozen Ocean in ſledges over the ice, to three large iſlands, that are ſituate oppoſite the mouth of the river Kovymy. But a voyage which he ſaid he himſelf had performed, engaged our attention more than any other. He told us that on the 12th of May, 1771, he ſailed from Bolcheretzk, in Kamtſchataka, in a Ruſſian veſſel, to Mareekan, one of the Kurile Iſlands, where there is an harbour, and a Ruſſian ſettlement. From this iſland he proceeded to Japan, where his continuance appears to have been but ſhort; for, as ſoon as the Japaneſe knew that he and his companions profeſſed the Chriſtian faith, they made ſigns for them to depart; but did not ſo far as we could underſtand him, offer any inſult or violence. From Japan he repaired to Canton
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030274_0920_0FE57491E6FCFCD0"/>
in China; and from thence in a French ſhip, to France. He then travelled to Peterſburg, and was afterwards ſent out again to Kamtſchatka. We could not learn what became of the veſſel in which he firſt embarked, nor what was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal intention of the voyage. His being unable to ſpeak one word of the French language, rendered this ſtory rather ſuſpicious; he ſeemed clear, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as to the times of his arrival at the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent places, and of his departure from them, which he put down in writing.</p>
                     <p>The next morning (Friday the 16), he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captain Cook a ſea-otter ſkin, which he ſaid, was worth eighty roubles at Kamtſchatka. The Captain, however, thought proper to decline the offer; but except of ſome dried fiſh, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral baſkets of the lily, or <hi>ſaranne</hi> root. In the afternoon, Iſmyloff, after having dined with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke, left us with all his retinue, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to return in a few days. Accordingly, on the 19th, he paid us another viſit, bringing with him the charts above mentioned, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Captain Cook to copy; and the contents of which are the foundation of the following remarks.</p>
                     <p>The charts were two in number, they were both manuſcripts, and bore every mark of authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity. One of them comprehended the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhinſkian ſea; the coaſt of Tartary, as low as the latitude of 41° north; the Kurile Iſlands, and the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030274_0921_0FE574936EC8BEE0"/>
peninſula of Kamtſchatka. Since this chart had been made Wawſeelee Irkeechoff, a naval cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain explored, in the year 1758, the coaſt of Tartary, from Okotſk, and the river Amur, to Japan, or 41° of northern latitude. We were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Mr. Iſmyloff, that a great part of the ſea-coaſt of Kamtſchatka had been corrected by himſelf; and he deſcribed the inſtrument uſed by him for that purpoſe, which muſt have been a theodolite. He alſo told us, that there were only two harbours proper for ſhipping, on all the eaſtern coaſt of Kamtſchatka, viz. the bay of Awatſka, and the river Olutora, in the bottom of the gulph of the ſame name; that there was not one harbour on its weſtern coaſt; and that Yamſk was the only one except Okotſk, on all the weſtern ſide of the Penſhinſkian ſea, till we come to the river Amur. The Kurile Iſlands contain but one harbour, and that is on the north-eaſt ſide of Mareekan; where as we have already mentioned, the Ruſſians have a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The other chart comprehended all the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that the Ruſſians had made to the eaſtward of Kamtſchatka, towards America. That part of the American coaſt, with which Tſcherikoff fell in, is laid down in this chart between the latitude of 58° and 50 ½° north and 75° of eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern longitude, from Okotſk, or 218 ½° from Greenwich; and the place where Beering an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030274_0922_0FE5749556854240"/>
in 59 ½° of latitude, and 63 ½° of longitude from Okotſk, or 207° from Greenwich. To ſay nothing of the longitude, which may, from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes, be erroneous, the latitude of the coaſt, diſcovered by Beering and Tſcherikoff, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that part of it which was diſcovered by the latter, differs conſiderably from Mr. Muller's chart. Whether the chart now produced by Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myloff, or that of Muller, be moſt erroneous in this reſpect, it may be difficult to determine.</p>
                     <p>According to Iſmyloff's account, neither the number nor the ſituation of the iſlands which are diſperſed between 52° and 55° of latitude, in the ſpace between Kamtſchatka and America, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly aſcertained. He ſtruck out about a third of them, aſſuring us that they did not exiſt; and he conſiderably altered the ſituation of others; which, he ſaid, was neceſſary, from the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he himſelf had made; and there was no reaſon to entertain a doubt about this. As theſe iſlands are nearly under the ſame parrallel, different navigators, miſled by their different rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings, might eaſily miſtake one iſland, or cluſter of iſlands, for anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and imagine they had made a new diſcovery, when they had only found old ones, in a poſition ſomewhat different from that which their former viſitors had aſſigned to them.</p>
                     <p>The iſles of St. Theodore, St. Stephen, St. Abraham, St. Macarius, Seduction Iſlands, and
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030274_0923_0FE5749A9CCF7148"/>
ſeveral others, which are repreſented in Mr. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's chart, were not to be found in this now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to us; nay, Iſmyloff, and the other Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, aſſured Captain Cook, that they had been frequently ſought for without effect. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it is difficult to believe, that Mr. Muller could place them in his chart without ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Captain Cook, however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confiding in the teſtimony of theſe people, whom he thought competent witneſſes, omitted them in his chart; and made ſuch corrections reſpecting the other iſlands, as he had reaſon to think were neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall now proceed to give ſome account of the iſlands, beginning with thoſe which are neareſt to Kamtſchatka, and computing the longitude from the harbour of Petropaulowſka, in the bay of Awatſka. The firſt is Beering's iſland, in 55° of no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>hern latitude, and 6° of eaſtern longitude. At the diſtance of ten leagues from the ſouthern extremity of this, in the direction of eaſt by ſouth, or eaſt ſouth-eaſt, ſtands <hi>Maidenci Oſtroff</hi> or the Copper Iſlands. The next iſland is Atakon, in the latitude of 52° 45′ and in the longitude of 15° or 16.° The extent of this iſland is about eighteen leagues in the direction of eaſt and weſt; and it is perhaps the ſame land which Beering fell in with, and to which he gave the name of Mount St. John.</p>
                     <p>We next came to a cluſter of ſix or more iſlands; two of which, Amluk and Atghka, are
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030274_0924_0FE5749C69393CE8"/>
of conſiderable extent, and each of them has a good harbour. The middle of this group lies in the latitude of 52° 30′, and 28° of longitude, from the bay of Awatſka; and its extent is about four degrees, in the direction of eaſt and weſt. Theſe are the iſles that Iſmyloff ſaid were to be removed four degrees to the eaſtward. In the ſituation they have in Captain Cook's chart, was a group, comprehending ten little iſlands, which, we were informed, were entirely to be ſtruck out; and alſo two iſlands, ſituate between them and the group to which Oonalaſhka appertains. In the place of theſe two, an iſland, named Amoghta, was introduced.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of many of theſe iſlands may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oneouſly laid down. But the poſition of the largeſt group, of which Oonalaſhka is one of the moſt conſiderable iſlands, is free from ſuch errors. Moſt of the iſlands that compoſe this cluſter, were ſeen by us; their longitude and latitude were therefore determined with tolerable accuracy, particularly the harbour of Samga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noodha, of Oonalaſhka, which muſt be conſidered as a fixed point. This group may be ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as far as Halibut Iſles, which are forty leagues diſtant from Oonalaſhka, towards the eaſt-north-eaſt. Within theſe iſles a paſſage, communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Briſtol Bay, was marked in Iſmyloff's chart; which converts about fifteen leagues of the coaſt, that Captain Cook had ſuppoſed to be part

of the continent, into an iſland, named Oonce, mak. This paſſage might eaſily eſcape us, being as we were informed, extremely narrow, ſhallow, and only to be navigated through with boats, or veſſels of very ſmall burthen.</p>
                     <p>From the chart, as well as from the teſtimony of Iſmyloff and his countrymen, it appears, that this is as far as the Ruſſians have made any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, or have extended themſelves, ſince the time of Beering. They all affirmed, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that nation had ſettled themſelves ſo far to the eaſtward, as the place where the natives gave the note to Captain Clerke; which being delivered to Iſmyloff for his peruſal, he ſaid, that it had been written at Oomanak. From him we procured the name of Kodiak<note n="*" place="bottom">A Ruſſian ſhip had touched at Kodiak in the year 1776.</note>, the largeſt of Schumagin's Iſlands; for it had no name aſſigned to it upon the chart which he produced. It may not be improper to mention, that no names were put to the Iſlands which Iſmyloff ſaid were to be ſtruck out of the charts; and Captain Cook, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered this as ſome confirmation, that they have no exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>The American continent is here called, by the Ruſſians, as well as by the iſlanders, Alaſchka; which appellation, though it properly belongs only to that part which is contiguous to Oonce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mak,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030274_0926_0FE5749FD204D6B8"/>
is made uſe of by them when ſpeaking of the American continent in general.</p>
                     <p>This is all the intelligence we obtained from theſe people, reſpecting the geography of this part of the globe; and perhaps this was all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they were able to give. For they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly aſſured Captain Cook, that they knew of no other iſlands, beſides thoſe which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented upon this chart, and that no Ruſſian had ever viſited any part of the American conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the northward, except that which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite the country of the Tſchutſkis.</p>
                     <p>If Mr. Staehlin was not greatly impoſed upon, what could induce him to publiſh a map ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly erroneous, as his map of the New Northern Archipelago, in which many of theſe iſlands are jumbled together without the leaſt regard to truth? Nevertheleſs, he himſelf ſtyles it
<q>a very accurate little map.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Iſmyloff continued with us till the evening of the 21ſt, when he took his final leave. Captain Cook entruſted to his care a letter to the Lords of the Admiralty, encloſing a chart of all the northern coaſts we had viſited. Iſmyloff ſaid there would be an opportunity of tranſmitting it to Kamtſchatka, Okotſk, in the courſe of the ſucceeding ſpring; and that it would be at Peterſburgh the following winter. He gave the Captain a letter to Major Behm, Governor of Kamtſchatka, who reſides at Bolcheretſk in that
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030274_0927_0FE574A56C73BED8"/>
peninſula; and another to the commanding of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers at Petropaulowſka.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Iſmyloff ſeemed to poſſeſs abilities that might entitle him to a higher ſtation than that in which we found him. He had conſiderable knowledge in aſtronomy, and in the moſt uſeful branches of the mathematics. Captain Cook made him a preſent of an Hadley's octant; and though, perhaps, it was the firſt he had ever ſeen, he very quickly made himſelf acquainted with moſt of the uſes to which that inſtrument can be applied.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 22d, in the morning, we made an attempt to get out to ſea, with the wind at ſouth-eaſt, but did not ſucceed. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon of the 23d we were viſited by one Jacob Ivanovitch Sopoſnicoff, a Ruſſian, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a ſmall veſſel a Oomanak. This man ſeemed very modeſt, and would drink no ſtrong liquor, of which the other Ruſſians, whom we had met with here, were extremely fond. He appeared to know what ſupplies could be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul, and the price of the various articles, more accurately than Mr. Iſmyloff. But, by all accounts, every thing, we ſhould have occoaſion to purchaſe at that place, was very ſcarce, and bore a high price. This man informed us, that he was to be at Petropaulowſka in the enſuing May; and, as we underſtood, was to have the charge of Captain
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030274_0928_0FE574A6F35144A0"/>
Cook's letter. He ſeemed very deſirous of having ſome token from the Captain to carry to Major Behm; and, to gratify him, the Captain ſent a ſmall ſpying-glaſs.</p>
                     <p>After we had contracted an acquaintance with theſe Ruſſians, ſeveral of our gentlemen at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, viſited their ſettlements on the iſland, where they always met with friendly treatment. It conſiſted of a dwelling-houſe and two ſtore-houſes. Beſides the Ruſſians, there was a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Kamtſchadales, and of the Oonalaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kans, as ſervants to the former. Some other natives of this iſland, who appeared to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the Ruſſians, lived at the ſame place. Such of them as belonged to the Ruſſians, were all of the male ſex; and they are either taken, or purchaſed from their parents when young. There were, at preſent, about twenty of theſe who could be conſidered in no other light than as children. They all reſide in the ſame houſe, the Ruſſians at the upper end, the Kamtſchadales in the middle, and the Oonalaſhkans at the lower end, where is fixed a capacious boiler for preparing their food, which principally conſiſts of fiſh, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wild roots and berries. There is no great difference between the firſt and laſt table, except what is produced by cookery, by which the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians can make indifferent things palatable. They dreſs whales fleſh in ſuch a manner as to make it very good eating; and they have a kind of pan-pudding
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030274_0929_0FE5747578690A40"/>
of ſalmon-roe, beaten up fine and fried, which is a tolerable ſubſtitute for bread. They may perhaps, occaſionally, taſte real bread, or have a diſh in which flour is one of the ingredients. If we except the juice of berries, which they generally ſip at their meals, they drink no other liquor than pure water; and it ſeems to be very fortunate for them that they have nothing ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>As the iſland furniſhes them with ſubſiſtence, ſo it does, in ſome meaſure, with clothing. This is chiefly compoſed of ſkins. The upper gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is made like a waggoner's frock, reaches down to the knees. Beſides this, they wear a waiſtcoat or two, a pair of breeches, a fur cap, and a pair of boots, the legs of which are formed of ſome kind of ſtrong gut, but the ſoles and upper leathers are of Ruſſian leather. Their two chiefs, Iſmyloff and Ivanovitch, wore a calico frock, and they, as well as ſeveral others, had ſhirts of ſilk.</p>
                     <p>Many Ruſſians are ſettled upon all the moſt conſiderable iſlands between Kamtſchatka and Oonalaſhka, for the purpoſe of collecting furs. Their principal object is the ſea-beaver or otter; but ſkins of inferior value alſo make a part of their cargoes. We neglected to inquire how long they have had a ſettlement upon Oonalaſhka, and the neighbouring iſlands; but if we form our judgment on this point from the great ſubjection
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030274_0930_0FE574A879DC4D38"/>
the natives are under, this cannot be of a very late date<note n="*" place="bottom">According to Mr. Coxe, in his account of the diſcoveries of the Ruſſians, they began to frequent Oonalaſhka in the year 1762.</note>. Theſe furriers are, from time to time, ſucceeded by others. Thoſe we ſaw ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here from O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>As for the native inhabitants of this iſland, they are, to all appearance, a very peaceable, inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive race of people; and, in point of honeſty, they might ſerve as a pattern to the moſt civilized nations. But, from what we ſaw of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, with whom the Ruſſians are unconnected, we have ſome doubt whether this was their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſpoſition; and are rather inclined to be of opinion, that it is the conſequence of their preſent ſtate of ſubjection. Indeed, if we did not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand the Ruſſians, they had been under the neceſſity of making ſome ſevere examples before they could bring the iſlanders into tolerable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. If ſeverities were really inflicted at firſt, the beſt excuſe for them is, that they have produced the moſt beneficial effects; and, at preſent, the greateſt harmony ſubſiſts between the Ruſſians and the natives. The latter have their own chiefs in each iſland, and ſeem to enjoy liberty and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty without moleſtation. Whether they are tributaries to the Ruſſians, or not, we could never
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030274_0931_0FE574AA8F1C9378"/>
learn; but we had ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe that they are.</p>
                     <p>The people of Oonalaſhka, are in general, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther low of ſtature, but plump, and well ſhaped. Their necks are commonly ſhort, and they have ſwarthy chubby faces. They have black eyes, and ſmall beards. Their hair is long, black, and ſtraight; the men wear it looſe behind, and cut before; but the women generally tie it up in a bunch.</p>
                     <p>The dreſs of both ſexes is the ſame with reſpect to faſhion, the only difference is in the materials. The frock worn by the women is made of the ſkins of ſeals; and that of the men, of the ſkins of birds; both reach below the knees. This conſtitutes the whole dreſs of the females. But, over the frock, the men wear another compoſed of gut, which water cannot penetrate; it has a hood to it, which is drawn over the head. Some of them wear boots; and all of them wear a ſort of oval ſnouted cap, made of wood, with a rim that admits the head. They dye theſe caps with green and other colours; and round the upper part of the rim they fix the long briſtles of ſome ſea animal, on which glaſs beads are ſtrung; and on the front is a ſmall image or two formed of bone. They do not make uſe of paint; but the women puncture their faces ſlightly, and both ſexes perforate the lower lip, in which they fix pieces of bone. But it is as uncommon here to
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030274_0932_0FE574AF890D5A30"/>
ſee a man with this ornament, as to obſerve a woman without it. Some fix beads to the upper lip under the noſtrils; and they all ſuſpend orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their ears.</p>
                     <p>Fiſh, and other ſea animals, birds, roots, ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and even ſea-weed, compoſe their food. They dry quantities of fiſh during the ſummer, which they lay up in ſmall huts for their uſe in winter; and, probably, they preſerve berries and roots for the ſame ſeaſon of ſcarcity. They eat moſt of their proviſions raw. Boiling and broil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were the only methods of cookery that we ſaw practiſed among them; and the former they in all probability learnt from the Ruſſians. Some have in their poſſeſſion ſmall braſs kettles: and thoſe who have not, make one of a flat ſtone, with ſides of clay.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook once happened to be preſent, when the chief of this iſland made his dinner of the raw head of a large halibut, juſt caught. Before any part of it was given to the chief, two of his ſervants eat the gills with no other dreſſing than ſqueezing out the ſlime. After this, one of them having cut off the head of the fiſh, took it to the ſea, and waſhed it, then came with it, and ſeated himſelf by the chief; but not before he had pulled up ſome graſs, upon a part of which the head was placed, and the reſt was ſtrewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chief. He then cut large pieces off the cheeks, and put them within the reach of the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030274_0933_0FE574B11D3831B0"/>
chief, who ſwallowed them with great ſatisfaction. When he had finiſhed his meal, the remains of the head been cut in pieces, were given to the ſervants, who tore off the meat with their teeth, and knawed the bones like ſo many dogs.</p>
                     <p>As the Oonalaſhkans uſe no paint, they are leſs dirty in their perſons than thoſe ſavages who thus beſmear themſelves; but they are full as filthy in their houſes. The following is their method of building: they dig, in the ground, an oblong pit, which rarely exceeds fifty feet in length, and twenty in breadth; but the dimenſions are in general ſmaller. Over this excavation they form the roof of wood, which they cover firſt with graſs, and then with earth, ſo that the external appearance reſembles a dung-hill. Near each end of the roof is left a ſquare opening, which admits the light; one of theſe openings being intended only for this purpoſe, and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo uſed to go in and out by, with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ladder, or rather a poſt, in which ſteps are cut. In ſome of the houſes there is another entrance below, but this is rather uncommon. Round the ſides and ends of the habitations, the families, ſeveral of which dwell together, have their ſeparate apartments, where they ſleep, and ſit at work; not on benches, but in a ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave trench, dug entirely round the inſide of the houſe and covered with mats, ſo that this part is kept pretty clean and decent. The ſame cannot
<pb facs="unknown:030274_0934_0FE548CDA0BA5B60"/>
                        <figure/>
                        <pb n="109" facs="unknown:030274_0935_0FE574B2AD471080"/>
be ſaid of the middle of the houſe, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the families. For, though it is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dry graſs, it is a recepticle for every kind of dirt, and the place where the urine trough ſtands; the ſtench of which is by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by raw hides, or leather, being almoſt continually ſteeped in it. Behind, and over the trench, they place the few effects that they have in their profeſſion, ſuch as their mats, ſkins, and apparel.</p>
                     <p>Their furniture conſiſts of buckets, cans, wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en bowls, ſpoons, matted baſkets and ſometimes a Ruſſian kettle or pot. All theſe utenſils are made in a very neat manner; and yet we obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no other tools among them than the knife and the hatchet; that is, a ſmall flat piece of iron, made like an adze, by fixing it into a crooked wooden handle.</p>
                     <p>Though the Ruſſians live among theſe people, we found much leſs iron in poſſeſſion of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than we had met with among other tribes on the neighbouring continent of America, who had never ſeen the Ruſſians, nor perhaps had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with them. Probably a few beads, and a ſmall quantity of tobacco and ſnuff, purchaſe all they have to ſpare. There are few of them that do not both ſmoke and chew tobacco, and take ſnuff.</p>
                     <p>They did not appear to be very deſirous of more iron, or to want any other inſtruments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

ſewing needles, their own being formed of bone. With theſe they ſew their canoes, and make their clothes, and alſo work very curious embroidery. They uſe, inſtead of thread, the fibres of ſinews, which they ſplit to the thickneſs which is required. All ſewing is performed by the females. They are the ſhoe-makers, taylors, and boat-builders, or boat-coverers; for the men, in all probability, conſtruct the wooden frame, over which the ſkins are ſewed. They manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mats, and baſkets of graſs, which are both ſtrong and beautiful. There is indeed, a neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perfection in moſt of their work, that ſhews they are neither deficient in ingenuity nor perſeverance.</p>
                     <p>We did not obſerve a fire-place in any one of their habitations. They are lighted, as well as heated, by lamps; which though ſimple, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually anſwer the purpoſe for which they are intended. They conſiſt of a flat ſtone, hollowed on one ſide like a plate; in the hollow part they put the oil, mixed with ſome dry graſs, which ſerves for a wick. Both ſexes often warm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over one of theſe lamps, by placing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their legs, under their garments, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus over it for ſeveral minutes. Theſe people produce fire both by colliſion and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the firſt by ſtriking two ſtones againſt each other, on one of which a quantity of brimſtone has been previouſly rubbed. The latter method
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030274_0937_0FE574B49D8E1210"/>
is performed by means of two pieces of wood, one of which is flat, and the other is a ſtick of the length of about a foot and a half. They preſs the pointed end of the ſtick upon the other piece, whirling it nimbly round as a drill, and thus fire is procured in a few minutes. This method is common in many countries. It is not only practiſed by theſe people, but alſo by the Kamtſchadales, the Greenlanders, the Otaheite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the New-Hollanders, and the Brazilians, and probably by other nations. Some men of learning and genius have founded an argument on this cuſtom, to prove that this and that nation are of the ſame extraction. But caſual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in a few particular inſtances, will not wholly authorize ſuch a concluſion; nor, on the other hand, will a diſagreement, either in manners or cuſtoms, between two different nations, prove of courſe that they are of different extraction.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw no offenſive, nor even defenſive weapon among the natives of Oonalaſhka. It can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſuppoſed that the Ruſſians found them in ſuch a defenceleſs ſtate; it is rather to be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, for their own ſecurity, they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed them. Political motives, likewiſe, may have induced the Ruſſians not to permit theſe iſlanders to have any large canoes; for we can hardly believe they had none ſuch originally, as we found them among all their neighbours.
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030274_0938_0FE574B8BAEE22C8"/>
However, we obſerved none here except two or three that belonged to the Ruſſians.</p>
                     <p>The canoes in uſe among the natives, are ſmaller than any of thoſe we had ſeen upon the coaſt of America, from which however, they differ but little in their conſtruction. The form of theſe terminates ſomewhat abruptly; the head is forked, and the upper point of the fork pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects without the under one, which is level with the ſurface of the water. It is remarkable that they ſhould thus conſtruct them, for the fork generally catch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> hold of every thing that comes in the way; to prevent which, they fix a piece of ſmall ſtick from one point to the other. In other reſpects they build their canoes after the manner of thoſe of the Eſquimaux and Greenlanders; the frame being of ſlender laths, and the covering of the ſkins of ſeals. They are about twelve feet in length, eighteen inches in breadth in the middle, and twelve or fourteen inches in depth. They ſometimes carry two perſons, one of whom ſits in the ſeat, or round hole, which is nearly in the middle; and the other is ſtretched at full length in the canoe. Round this hole is a rim or hoop of wood, about which, gut ſkin is ſewed, which can be drawn together, or opened like a purſe, with leathern ſtrings fitted to the outer edge. The man ſits in this place, draws the ſkin tight about his body over his gut-frock, and brings the ends of the thongs, or purſe-ſtrings, over his
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030274_0939_0FE574BA5248AA00"/>
ſhoulder. The ſleeves of his frock are faſtened tight round his wriſts; and it being cloſe round his neck, and the hood being drawn over his head, where his cape confines it, water cannot eaſily penetrate, either into the canoes, or to his body. If, however, any water ſhould find means to inſinuate itſelf, the boatman dries it up with a piece of ſpunge. He makes uſe of a double-bladed paddle, which is held with both hands in the middle, ſtriking the water firſt on one ſide, and then on the other, with a quick regular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus the canoe is impelled at a great rate, and in a direction perfectly ſtraight. In ſailing from Egoochſhak to Samganoodha, though our ſhip went at the rate of ſeven miles an hour, two or three canoes kept pace with her.</p>
                     <p>Their implements for hunting and fiſhing lie ready upon their canoes, under ſtraps fixed for the purpoſe. They are all extremely well made of wood and bone, and are not very different from thoſe uſed by the Greenlanders. The only difference is in the point of the miſſile dart; which, in ſome that we ſaw at this iſland, does not exceed an inch in length; whereas thoſe of the Greenlanders, according to Crantz, are about eighteen inches long. Indeed theſe darts, as well as ſome others of the inſtruments, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely curious. Their darts are generally made of fir, and are about four feet in length. One end is formed of bone, into which, by means of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030274_0940_0FE574BBE1C2B728"/>
a ſocket, another ſmall piece of bone, which is barbed, is fixed, but contrived in ſuch a manner, as to be put in and taken out without trouble: this is ſecured to the middle of the ſtick by a ſtrong, though thin piece of twine, compoſed of ſinews. The bird, fiſh, or other animal is no ſooner ſtruck, than the pointed bone ſlips out of the ſocket but remains fixed in its body by means of the barb. The dart then ſerves as a float to trace the animal, and alſo contributes to fatigue it conſiderably, ſo that it is eaſily taken. They throw theſe darts by the aſſiſtance of a thin piece of wood, twelve or fourteen inches long; the middle of this is ſlightly hollowed, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reception of the weapon; and at the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hollow, which does not extend to the end, is fixed a ſhort pointed piece of bone, to prevent the dart from ſlipping. The other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity is furniſhed with a hole for the reception of the fore-finger, and the ſides are made to coincide with the other fingers and thumb, in order to graſp with greater firmneſs. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives throw theſe darts to the diſtance of eighty or ninety yards, with great force and dexterity. They are exceedingly expert in ſtriking fiſh, both in the ſea, and in rivers. They alſo uſe hooks and lines, nets and wears. The lines are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of twiſted ſinews, and the hooks of bone.</p>
                     <p>Whales, porpoiſes, grampuſes, halibut, ſword-fiſh, ſalmon, trout, cod, ſoals, flat-fiſh, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030274_0941_0FE574BDC590F128"/>
other ſorts, are found here; and there may be many more that we had not an opportunity of ſeeing. Salmon and halibut appear to be in the greateſt plenty; and on them the people of theſe iſles principally ſubſiſt; at leaſt, they were the only ſort of fiſh, except cod, that we obſerved to be laid up for their winter ſtore.</p>
                     <p>Seals, and all that tribe of ſea animals, are not ſo numerous as they are in many other ſeas. Nor can this be thought ſurprizing, ſince there is hardly any part of the coaſt, on either conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, nor any of theſe iſlands, ſituate between them, but what is inhabited, and whoſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants hunt theſe animals for their food and cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Sea-horſes are, indeed, to be found in prodigious numbers about the ice; and the ſea-otter is ſcarce any where to be met with but in this ſea. An animal was ſometimes ſeen by us, that blew after the manner of whales. It had a head reſembling that of a ſeal. It was larger than that animal, and its colour was white, with dark ſpots interſperſed. This was perhaps the <hi>manati,</hi> or ſea-cow.</p>
                     <p>Water fowls are neither found here in ſuch numbers, nor in ſuch variety, as in the northern parts of the Atlantic Ocean. However there are ſome in theſe parts, that we do not recollect to have ſeen in other countries; particularly the <hi>alca monochroa</hi> of Steller, and a black and white duck, which we judge to be different from the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030274_0942_0FE574C1C37E9B88"/>
ſtone-duck that Kraſheninikoff has deſcribed in his hiſtory of Kamtſchatka. All the other birds we ſaw are mentioned by this author, except ſome which we obſerved near the ice; and the greateſt part of theſe, if not all, have been deſcribed by Martin, in his voyage to Greenland. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what extraordinary, that penguins, which are ſo frequently met with in many parts of the world, ſhould not be found in this ſea. Albatroſſes too are extremely ſcarce here.</p>
                     <p>The few land-birds ſeen by us are the ſame with thoſe of Europe; but there were probably many others which we had no opportunity of obſerving. A very beautiful bird was ſhot in the woods at Norton Sound; which, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, is ſometimes found in England, and known by the appellation of chatterer. Our people ſaw other ſmall birds there, but in no great abundance or variety; ſuch as the bullfinch, the wood pecker, the yelloſh-finch, and tit-mouſe.</p>
                     <p>Our excurſions and obſervations being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the ſea-coaſt, we cannot be expected to have much knowledge of the animals or vegetables of the country. There are few other inſects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides muſquetoes, and we ſaw few reptiles except lizards. There are no deer at Oonaliſhka, or any of the neighbouring iſlands; nor are there any domeſtic animals, not even dogs. Weaſels and foxes were the only quadrupeds we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; but the natives told us, that they had
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030274_0943_0FE574C416D71F48"/>
likewiſe hares, and the <hi>marmottas</hi> mentioned by Kraſheninikoff. Hence it appears, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants procure the greateſt ſhare of their food from the ſea and rivers. They are alſo indebted to the ſea for all the wood which they uſe for building, and other neceſſary purpoſes; as there is not a tree to be ſeen growing upon any of the iſlands, nor upon the neighbouring coaſt of the continent.</p>
                     <p>The ſeeds of plants are ſaid to be coveyed, by various means, from one part of the world to another; even to iſlands lying in the midſt of extenſive oceans, and far diſtant from any other lands. It is therefore remarkable, that there are no trees growing on this part of the American continent, nor upon any of the adjacent iſles. They are doubtleſs as well ſituated for receiving ſeeds, by the various ways we have heard of, as thoſe coaſts which have plenty of wood. Nature has, perhaps, denied to ſome ſoils the power of raiſing trees, without the aſſiſtance of art. With reſpect to the drift-wood, upon the ſhores of theſe iſlands, we have no doubt of its coming from America. For though there may be none on the neighbouring coaſt, a ſufficient quantity may grow farther up the country, which may be broken looſe by torrents in the ſpring, and brought down to the ſea; and not a little may be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the woody coaſts, though ſituated at a more conſiderable diſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="unknown:030274_0944_0FE574C5F6A4D888"/>Plants are to be found in great variety at Oonalaſhka. Several of them are ſuch as we meet with in Europe, and alſo in Newfoundland, and other parts of America; and others of them, which are likewiſe found in Kamtſchatka, are eaten by the natives both there and here. Of theſe, Kraſheninikoff has favoured us with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. The principal one is the <hi>ſaranne</hi> or lily root; which is about as large as a root of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, round, and compoſed of a number of ſmall cloves and grains. When boiled, it ſomewhat reſembles ſaloop; the taſte of it is not diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It does not appear to be in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                     <p>Among the food of the natives we may reckon ſome other wild roots; the ſtalk of a plant not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like angelica; and berries of different ſpecies, ſuch as cranberries, hurtle-berries, bramble-ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and heath-berries; beſides a ſmall red berry, which, in Newfoundland, is denominated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge berry; and another brown berry, with which we were unacquainted. This has ſomewhat of the taſte of a ſloe, but is different from it in every other reſpect. When eaten in a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity it is very aſtringent. Brandy may be diſtilled from it. Captain Clerke endeavoured to preſerve ſome; but they fermented, and became as ſtrong as if they had been ſteeped in ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>There were ſeveral plants which were ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us, but are not uſed either by the Ruſſians
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030274_0945_0FE574C7810FFCE8"/>
or natives. Theſe were pea-tops, wild pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlain, a ſort of ſcurvy-graſs, creſſes, and a few others. We found all theſe very palatable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreſſed in ſoups or in ſallads. The vallies and low grounds abound with graſs, which grows very thick, and to a great length. We are of opinion, that cattle might ſubſiſt at Oonalaſhka in every ſeaſon of the year, without being houſed. The ſoil, in many places, appeared to be capable of producing grain and vegetables. But, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Ruſſian traders, and the natives, ſeem contented with the ſpontaneous productions of nature.</p>
                     <p>We obſerved native ſulphur among the people of this iſland; but we could not learn where they procured it. We alſo found ochre, and a ſtone that affords a purple colour; beſides another that gives a good green. This laſt, in its natural ſtate is of a greyiſh green hue, coarſe, and heavy. It readily diſſolves in oil; but when it is put into water, it altogether loſes its properties. As for the ſtones about the ſhore and hills, we perceived in them nothing that was extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>The Oonalaſhkans inter their dead on the tops of hills, and raiſe over the grave a little hillock. One of the natives, who attended Captain Cook in a walk into the country, pointed out ſeveral of theſe repoſitories of the dead. There was one of them by the ſide of a road, that had a heap of ſtones over it; and all who paſſed it, added a ſtone
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030274_0946_0FE574CAE55720B8"/>
to the heap. In the country were ſeen ſeveral ſtone hillocks, that ſeemed to have been artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed. Some of them were, to appearance, of great antiquity.</p>
                     <p>We are unacquainted with the notions of theſe people reſpecting the deity, and a future ſtate. We are equally uninformed with regard to their diverſions; having ſeen nothing that could give us an inſight into either.</p>
                     <p>They are extremely chearful and friendly among each other; and they always treated us with great civility. The Ruſſians ſaid they never had any connection with their women, on account of their not being chriſtians. Our people, however, were leſs ſcrupulous; and ſome of them had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repent, that the women of Oonalaſhka en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged their addreſſes; for their health was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by a diſtemper that is not wholly unknown here. The natives are alſo ſubject to the cancer, or a complaint of a ſimilar nature, which thoſe who are attacked by it are ſtudious to conceal. They do not appear to be long-lived. We did not ſee a perſon, man or woman, whom we could ſuppoſe to be ſixty years of age; and we obſerved very few who ſeemed to exceed fifty.</p>
                     <p>We have occaſionally mentioned, from the time of our arrival in Prince William's Sound, how remarkably the inhabitants on this north-weſtern ſide of America reſemble the Eſquimaux and Greenlanders in various particulars of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030274_0947_0FE574CCFA3BDE10"/>
dreſs, weapons, canoes and the like. We were; however, much leſs ſtruck with this, than with the affinity ſubſiſting between the dialects of the Greenlanders and Eſquimaux, and thoſe of Oonalaſhka and Norton's Sound. But we muſt obſerve, with reſpect to the words which were collected by us on this ſide of America, that too much ſtreſs is not to be laid upon their being accurately repreſented; for, after the death of Mr. Anderſon, we had few who took any great degree of pains about ſuch manners; and we have often found that the ſame word, written down by two or more perſons, from the mouth of the ſame native, differed conſiderably, on bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g compared together. Nevertheleſs, enough is certain to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize this judgment, that there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe, that all theſe nations are of the ſame extraction; and if that be the caſe, there is little doubt of there being a northen communication by ſea, between the weſtern ſide of America, and the eaſtern ſide, through Baffin's Bay; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, however, is perhaps effectually ſhut up againſt ſhips, by ice, and other obſtructions; ſuch, at leaſt, was Captain Cook's opinion at this time.</p>
                     <p>The tides in theſe parts are not very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, except in Cook's River. The flood comes from the ſouth or ſouth-eaſt, following the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the coaſt to the north-weſt. Between Cape Prince of Wales and Norton's Sound we
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030274_0948_0FE574CEDB23CCB8"/>
found a current ſetting towards the north-weſt, particularly off that Cape, and within Sledge Iſland. This current, however, extended but a little way from the coaſt, and was neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent nor uniform. To the north of Cape Prince of Wales, we obſerved neither tide nor current, either on the coaſt of America, or that of Aſia. This circumſtance gave riſe to an opinion which ſome of our peo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> entertained, that the two coaſts were connected either by land or ice; and that opinion received ſome degree of ſtrength, from our never having any hollow waves from the northward, and from our ſeeing ice almoſt the whole way acroſs.</p>
                     <p>From the obſervations made during our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in the harbour of Samganoodha, its lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is 53° 5′ north, and its longitude 193° 29′ 45″ eaſt.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>ON Monday the 26th of October, we ſailed from Samganoodha harbour, when, the wind being ſoutherly, we ſtood to the weſtward. We intended to proceed to the Sandwich Iſlands, in order to paſs a few of the winter months there, if we ſhould meet with the neceſſary refreſhments, and then advance in our progreſs to Kamtſchatka, ſo as to arrive there about the middle of May in the enſuing year. This being determined on, the Commodore gave Captain Clerke inſtructions
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030274_0950_0FE574D7A5A9AD88"/>
for proceeding in caſe of ſeparation; Sandwich Iſlands being appointed for the firſt place of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous; and, for the ſecond, Petropaulowſka, in Kamtſchatka.</p>
                     <p>Having got out of the harbour, the wind veer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſouth-eaſt, with which we were carried to the weſtern part of Oonalaſhka, by the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Here the wind was as ſouth, and we ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the weſtward till the next morning at ſeven, at which time we wore, and ſtood to the eaſt. The wind had now ſo greatly increaſed, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to our three courſes. It blew in heavy ſqualls, accompanied with rain, hail, and ſnow.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 28th, at about nine o'clock, Oonalaſhka bore ſouth-eaſt, about four leagues diſtant. The ſtrength of the gale was much abated, and, towards the evening, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly veered round to the eaſt, and ſoon after got to north-eaſt, increaſing to a very hard gale, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with rain.</p>
                     <p>At half after ſix in the morning of the 29th, we diſcovered land, which we ſuppoſed to be the iſland Amoghta. At eight, the wind having veered to the weſtward, we could not weather the iſland, and gave over plying; bearing away for Oonalaſhka, in order to go to the north of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not daring, in ſo hard a gale of wind, to attempt a paſſage to the ſouth-eaſt of it. When we bore away, the land was about four leagues diſtant. The longitude was 191° 17′, and the latitude 53°
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030274_0951_0FE574D976D4A2E8"/>
38′. The Ruſſian map is very inaccurate in the ſituation of this iſland.</p>
                     <p>Steering to the north-eaſt, we diſcovered, at eleven o'clock, a rock, elevated like a tower, bearing north-north-eaſt, at the diſtance of about four leagues. The latitude was 53° 57′, and the longitude 191° 2′. We got ſight of Oonalaſhka about three in the afternoon, when we ſhortened ſail, and hauled the wind, being unable to get through the paſſage before night. On the 20th at day-break having a very hard gale at weſt-north-weſt, with heavy ſqualls and ſnow, we bore away under courſes, and cloſe-reefed top-ſails. About noon we were in the middle of the ſtrait, and got through it at three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, Cape Providence bearing weſt-ſouth-weſt; the wind at weſt-north-weſt, blew a ſtrong gale, with fair weather.</p>
                     <p>On the 2d of November, the wind was at ſouth; and, in the evening, blew a violent ſtorm, which occaſioned us to bring too. Several guns were fired by the Diſcovery, which we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately anſwered. We loſt ſight of her at eight, and ſaw her no more till eight the next morning. She joined us at ten; when, the height of the gale being over, and the wind having veered to weſt-north-weſt, we made ſail, and purſued our courſe to the ſouthward.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of Saturday the 7th, a ſhag, or cormorant, ſlew often round the ſhip. As it
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030274_0952_0FE574DB007854B0"/>
is not common for theſe birds to go far out of the ſight of land, we ſuppoſed there was ſome at no great diſtance; though we could not diſcover any. Having but little wind in the afternoon, Captain Clerke came on board with ſome melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly intelligence. He informed us that, the ſecond night after we departed from Samganood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha, the main tack of the Diſcovery gave way, by which accident one man was killed, and the boatſwain, with two or three others, wounded. He added, that his ſails and rigging received conſiderable damage on the 3d, and that he fired the guns as a ſignal to bring too.</p>
                     <p>On the 8th, we had a gentle breeze at north, with clear weather. On the 9th, we had eight hours calm. To this ſucceeded a wind from the ſouth, accompanied with fair weather. Such of our people as could handle a needle, were now employed to repair the ſails; and the carpenters were directed to put the boats in order.</p>
                     <p>At noon, on the 12th, the wind returned to the northward, and veered to the eaſt on the 15th. We now ſaw a tropic bird, and a dolphin; the firſt we had obſerved in our paſſage. On the 17th, the wind was ſouthward, where it remained till the 19th in the afternoon, when it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly brought round by the weſt to the north, by a ſquall of wind and rain. The wind in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reaſed to a very ſtrong gale, and brought us under double reefed top-ſails. In lowering the main
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030274_0953_0FE574DCECDBC3C0"/>
top-ſail, in order to reef it, the force of the wind tore it out of the foot-rope, and it was ſplit in ſeveral parts. We got, however, another top-ſail to the yard the next morning. We ſteered to the ſouthward till the 25th, at day-light, when we were in the latitude of 20° 55′.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, at day-break, land was diſcovered, extending from ſouth-ſouth-eaſt to weſt. We ſtood for it and at eight o'clock, it extended from ſouth-eaſt to weſt, the neareſt part about two leagues diſtant. We now perceived that our diſcovery of the group of the Sandwich Iſlands had been very imperfect, thoſe which we had viſited in our progreſs north-ward, all lying to the leeward of our preſent ſtation.</p>
                     <p>An elevated hill appeared in the country, whoſe ſummit roſe above the clouds. The land, from this hill, fell in a gradual ſlope, terminating in a ſteep rocky coaſt; the ſea breaking againſt it in a moſt dreadful ſurf. Unable to weather the iſland, we bore up, and ranged to the weſtward. We now perceived people on many parts of the ſhore, and ſeveral houſes and plantations. The country appeared to be well ſupplied with wood and water, and ſtreams were ſeen, in various places, falling into the ſea.</p>
                     <p>It being of the utmoſt importance to procure a proper ſupply of proviſions at theſe iſlands, which could not poſſibly be accompliſhed, if a free trade with the natives were to be permitted; Captain
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030274_0954_0FE574E217F0FF70"/>
Cook publiſhed an order, prohibiting all perſons on board the ſhip from trading, except thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by himſelf and Captain Clerke; and theſe were under limitations of trading only for proviſions and refreſhments. Injunctions were alſo laid againſt the admittance of women into the ſhips, but under certain reſtrictions. But the evil, which was intended to have been prevented by this regulation, had already got amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>About noon, the coaſt extended from ſouth-eaſt to north-weſt, the neareſt ſhore three miles diſtant, in the latitude of 20° 59′, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of 203° 50′. Some canoes came off, and, when they got along-ſide, many of the conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of them came into the ſhip without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We perceived that they were of the ſame nation as thoſe iſlanders more to the leeward, which had already been viſited by us; and, as we underſtood, they were no ſtrangers to our having been there. It was, indeed, too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; theſe people having got the venereal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe among them; which they probably contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an intercourſe with their neighbours, after we had left them.</p>
                     <p>Our viſitors ſupplied us with a quantity of cuttle-fiſh, in exchange for nails and iron. They brought but little fruit or roots, but ſaid they had plenty of them on their iſland, as well as of hogs and fowls. The horizon being clear, in the evening, we ſuppoſed the weſternmoſt land that
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030274_0955_0FE574E39C638848"/>
we could ſee, to be an iſland, diſtinct from that off which we now were. Expecting the natives would return the next day, with the produce of their iſland, we plyed off the whole night, and ſtood cloſe in ſhore the next morning. At firſt we were viſited but by few, but towards noon, many of them appeared, bringing with them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes, tarro, bread-fruit, plantains and ſmall pigs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which were bartered for iron tools and nails, we having few other articles to give them. We traded with them till about four in the afternoon, at which time they had diſpoſed of all their cargoes; and not expreſſing any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to fetch more, we immediately made ſail.</p>
                     <p>On the 30th, in the afternoon, being off the north-eaſt end of the iſland, ſome more canoes came off. Theſe principally belonged to Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeoboo, a chief who came in one of them. He made the commodore a preſent of two or three pigs; and we procured a little fruit by bartering with the other people. In about two hours they all left us, except ſeven or eight who choſe to remain on board. Soon after, a double ſailing canoe arrived to attend upon them, which we towed aſtern the whole night. In the evening, another iſland was ſeen to the windward, called, by the natives, <hi>Owhyhee.</hi> That, which we had been off for ſome days, was called <hi>Mowee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="unknown:030274_0956_0FE574E522E00E08"/>At eight in the morning, on the firſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, Owhyhee extended from ſouth-eaſt to ſouth-weſt. Perceiving that we could fetch Owhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hee, we ſtood for it, when our viſitors from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wee thought proper to embark in their canoes, and went aſhore. We ſpent the night, ſtanding off and on, the north ſide of Owhyhee.</p>
                     <p>On the 2d of December, in the morning, to our great ſurprize, we ſaw the ſummits of the mountains covered with ſnow. Though they were not of an extraordinary height, the ſnow, in ſome places, appeared to be of a conſiderable depth, and to have remained there ſome time. Drawing near the ſhore, ſome of the natives ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached us, who appeared a little ſhy at firſt, but we prevailed on ſome of them to come on board; and, at length, induced them to return to the iſland, to bring a ſupply of what we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We had plenty of company after theſe had reached the ſhore, who brought us a tolerable ſupply of pigs, fruit, and roots. We traded with them till about ſix in the evening, when we ſtood off, in order to ply to windward round the iſland.</p>
                     <p>An eclipſe of the moon was obſerved in the evening of the 4th. Mr. King uſed, for the purpoſe of obſerving, a night teleſcope, with a circular aperture at the object end. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore obſerved with the teleſcope of one of Ramſden's ſextants.</p>

                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:030274_0957_0FE548CC1467A5E8"/>In the evening of the 6th, being near the ſhore, and five leagues farther up the coaſt, we again traded with the natives; but, receiving only a trifling ſupply, we ſtood in the next morning, when the number of our viſitors was conſiderable, with whom we trafficked, till two in the afternoon. We had now procured pork, fruit, and roots, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupply us for four or five days. We therefore made ſail, and ſtill plyed to windward.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook having procured a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſugar cane, and having, upon a trial, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that a decoction of it made very palat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able beer, he ordered ſome of it to be brewed for our general uſe; but, on the broaching of the caſks, not one of the crew would even taſte it. The commodore, having no other motive in preparing this beverage, than that of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſpirits for a colder climate, neither exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his authority, nor had recourſe to perſuaſion, to induce them to drink it; well knowing that, ſo long as we could be plentifully ſupplied with other vegetables, there was no danger of the ſcurvy. But, that he might not be diſappointed in his views, he ordered that no grog ſhould be ſerved in either of the ſhips. The Commodore, and his officers, continued to drink this ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane beer, whenever materials could be procured for brewing it. Some hops which we had on board, improved it much; and, it was, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, extremely wholeſome; though the Captain's
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030274_0958_0FE574EBE93A94A8"/>
inconſiderate crew, could not be perſuaded but that it was injurious to their health.</p>
                     <p>Innovations, of whatever kind, on board a ſhip, are ſure to meet with the diſapprobation of the ſeaman, though ever ſo much to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Portable ſoup, and ſour krout, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, at firſt, as improper food for human beings. Few commanders have introduced more uſeful varieties of food and drink into their ſhips, than Captain Cook has done. Few others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, have had the opportunities, or have been driven to the neceſſity of trying ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It was, nevertheleſs, owing to certain deviations from eſtabliſhed practice, that he was enabled, in a great degree, to preſerve his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the ſcurvy, a diſtemper that has often made more havoc in peaceful voyages, than the enemy in military expeditions.</p>
                     <p>Having kept at ſome diſtance from the coaſt, till the 13th, we ſtood in again, ſix leagues more to windward; and, after trading with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives who came off to us, returned to ſea. We alſo intended to have approached the ſhore again on the 15th, to get a freſh ſupply of fruit and roots; but the wind happening to be then at ſouth-eaſt, we embraced the opportunity of ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the eaſtward, in order to get round the ſouth-eaſt end of the iſland. The wind conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at ſouth-eaſt the greateſt part of the 16th; on the 17th, it was variable; and on the 18th,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030274_0959_0FE574EF3764D8E0"/>
it was continually veering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sometimes it blew in hard ſqualls; and, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t other times, it was calm with thunder, lightning, and rain. The wind was weſterly for a few hours in the afternoon; but it ſhifted, in the evening, to eaſt by ſouth. The ſouth-eaſt point of the iſland now bore ſouth-weſt by ſouth, diſtant about five leagues, and we expected that we ſhould be able to weather it; but it became calm at one the next morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we were left wholly at the mercy of a north-eaſterly ſwell, which greatly impelled us towards the land; inſomuch, that, before morning, lights were ſeen upon the ſhore, which was then at the diſtance of about a league. It was a dark night, with thunder, lightning, and rain.</p>
                     <p>A breeze from the ſouth-eaſt ſucceeded the calm at about three, blowing in ſqualls, with rain. At day-break, the coaſt extended from north by weſt, to ſouth-weſt by weſt, about half a league diſtant; a moſt dreadful ſurf breaking upon the ſhore. We had certainly been in the moſt imminent danger; from which we were not yet ſecure, the wind veering more eaſterly; ſo that for a conſiderable time, we were but ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> able to keep our diſtance from the coaſt. Our ſituation was rendered the more alarming, by the leach-rope of the main top-ſail giving way, in conſequence of which the ſail was rent in two; the top-gallant-ſails giving way in the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We ſoon, however, got others to the yards,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030274_0960_0FE57423F05955A8"/>
and left the land aſtern. The Diſcovery was at ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>me diſtance to the north, entirely clear from the land; nor did ſhe appear in ſight till eight o'clock.</p>
                     <p>It is an obvious remark, that the bolt-ropes to our ſails are extremely deficient in ſtrength or ſubſtance. This has frequently been the ſource of infinite labour and vexation; and occaſioned the loſs of much canvaſs by their giving way. It was, upon this occaſion, obſerved by Captain Cook, that the cordage, canvaſs, and other ſtores, made uſe of in the navy, are inferior, in general, to thoſe uſed in the merchant ſervice.</p>
                     <p>The Commodore alſo obſerved, that an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion prevailed among all naval officers, that the king's ſtores were ſuperior to any others; no ſhips being ſo well fitted out as thoſe of the navy. They might be right, he admits, as to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; but, he apprehends, not with reſpect to the quality of the ſtores. This, indeed, is not often tried; for theſe things are uſually condemned, or converted to other uſes, before they are half worn out. Only ſuch voyages as ours afford an opportunity of making the trial; our ſituation being ſuch, as to render it neceſſary to wear every thing to the extreme<note n="*" place="bottom">Captain Cook, in this particular, appears to be miſtaken; the beſt of cordage being made in the King's yard. In time of war, indeed, when the cordage is, from neceſſity ſupplied by contract, ſome of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior quality may ſometimes be made.</note>.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="unknown:030274_0961_0FE574F628620B10"/>When day-light appeared, the natives aſhore exhibited a white flag, as a ſignal, we imagined, of peace and friendſhip. Many of them ventured out after us; but, as the wind freſhened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we were unwilling to wait, they were preſently left aſtern. In the afternoon, we made another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to weather the eaſtern extreme, in which we failed; when the Commodore gave it up, and ran down to the Diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>Our getting round the iſland was, indeed, a matter of no importance; for we had ſeen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it to the ſouth-eaſt, which was all the Commodore aimed at: the natives having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that there was no other iſland to the windward of this. But as we were ſo near ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing our deſign, we did not entirely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the idea of weathering it, and continued to ply.</p>
                     <p>At noon, on the 20th, the ſouth-eaſt point bore ſouth, at the diſtance of three leagues. The ſnowy hills bore weſt-north-weſt; and we were within four miles of the neareſt ſhore. We were viſited, in the afternoon, by ſome of the natives, who came off in their canoes, bringing with them pigs and plantains. The latter were highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, we having been without vegetables for ſome days; but this was ſo inconſiderable a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply (hardly ſufficient for one day) that we ſtood in the next morning, till within about four miles of the land, when a number of canoes came off
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030274_0962_0FE5742AACC8D418"/>
laden with proviſions. The people in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued trading with us till four o'clock, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; at which time we had got a good ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; we therefore made ſail, ſtretching off to the northward.</p>
                     <p>We met with leſs reſerve and ſuſpicion, in our intercourſe with the people of this iſland, than we had ever experienced among any tribe of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages. They frequently ſent up into the ſhip the articles they meant to barter, and afterwards came in themſelves, to traffic on the quarter deck. The inhabitants of Otaheite, who we have ſo often viſited, have not that confidence in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. Whence it may be inferred, that thoſe of Owhyhee are more faithful in their dealings with each other, than the Otaheitans.</p>
                     <p>It is but juſtice to obſerve, that they never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to over-reach us in exchanges, nor to commit a ſingle theft. They perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand trading, and clearly comprehended the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our plying upon the coaſt. For, though they brought off plenty of pigs, and other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they were particular in keeping up their price; and, rather than diſpoſe of them at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue, would carry them to ſhore again.</p>
                     <p>At eight in the morning of the 22d, we tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſouthward. At noon, the ſnowy peak bore ſouth-weſt. We ſtood to the ſouth-eaſt till midnight, when we tacked to the north till four. We had hopes of weathering the iſland, and
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030274_0963_0FE57473F1AC2020"/>
ſhould have ſucceeded, if a calm had not enſued, and left us to the mercy of a ſwell, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled us towards the land, from which we were not above the diſtance of two leagues. Some light puffs of wind, however, took us out of danger. Whilſt we lay in this ſituation, ſome iſlanders came off with hogs, fowls, and fruit. From one of the canoes we got a gooſe, which was not larger than a Muſcovy duck. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of its plumage was dark grey, and the bill and legs were black.</p>
                     <p>After purchaſing what the natives had brought off, we made ſail, and ſtretched to the north. At midnight, we tacked and ſtood to the ſouth-eaſt. Imagining the Diſcovery would ſee us tack, we omitted the ſignal; but it afterwards appeared that ſhe did not ſee us, and continued ſtanding to the north; for, the next morning, at day-light, ſhe was not to be ſeen. But, as the weather was now hazy, we could not ſee far; it was therefore poſſible that the Diſcovery might be following us. At noon, we were in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 19° 55′, and in the longitude of 205° 3′; and were two leagues from the neareſt part of the iſland. In the evening, at ſix, the ſouthern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the iſland bore ſouth-weſt, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhore about ſeven miles diſtant. We had, therefore, now ſucceeded in our endeavours, in getting to the windward of the iſland.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="unknown:030274_0964_0FE5742C323D4848"/>The Diſcovery was not yet within ſight, but as the wind was favourable for her to follow us, we expected ſhe would ſhortly join us. We kept cruiſing off this point of the iſland, till Captain Clerke was no longer expected here. It was, at length, conjectured, that he was gone to leeward, in order to meet us that way, not having been able to weather the north-eaſt part of the iſland.</p>
                     <p>Keeping generally from five to ten leagues from the land, only one canoe came off to us till the 28th; at which time we were attended by about a dozen, bringing, as uſual, the produce of the iſland. We were concerned that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had been at the trouble of coming, as we could not poſſibly trade with them, not having yet conſumed our former ſtock; and experience had convinced us, that the hogs could not be kept a live, nor the roots be many days preſerved from putrefaction. We meant, however, not to leave this part of the iſland till we had got a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as we could not eaſily return to it, if it ſhould hereafter be found neceſſary. On the 30th, we began to be in want, but a calm prevented us from approaching the ſhore. A breeze, however, ſprung up at midnight, which enabled us to ſtand in for the land at day-break. At ten o'clock the iſlanders viſited us, bringing with them a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fruit and roots, but only three ſmall pigs. This ſcanty ſupply was, perhaps, occaſioned by
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030274_0965_0FE5747704F702E8"/>
our not having purchaſed thoſe which had lately been brought off.</p>
                     <p>For the purpoſes of traffic we brought too, but we were ſhortly interrupted with an exceſſive rain; and, indeed, we were too far from the ſhore; nor could we venture to go nearer, as we could not, for a moment, depend upon the wind's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing where it was. The ſwell too, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely high, and ſet obliquely upon the ſhore, where it broke in a moſt frightful ſurf. We had fine weather in the evening, and paſſed the night in making boards. Before day-break, on the 1ſt of January, 1779, the atmoſphere was laden with heavy clouds; and the new year was uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in with a heavy rain. We had a light breeze ſoutherly, with ſome calms. At ten, the rain ceaſed, the ſky became clear, and the wind freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</p>
                     <p>Being now about four or five miles from the ſhore, ſome canoes arrived with hogs, fruit, and roots. We traded with the people in the canoes, till three in the afternoon; when, being pretty well ſupplied, we made ſail, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the lee ſide of the iſland, in ſearch of the Diſcovery. We ſtretched to the eaſtward, till midnight, when the wind favoured us, and we went upon the other tack.</p>
                     <p>The 2d, 3d, and 4th, were paſſed in running down the ſouth-eaſt ſide of the iſland, ſtanding off and on during the nights, and employing part
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030274_0966_0FE5742E1872B290"/>
of each day in laying too, to give the natives an opportunity of trading with us. They frequently came off to us, at the diſtance of five leagues from the ſhore, but never brought much with them, at thoſe times, either from a fear of loſing their articles in the ſea, or from the uncertainty of a market. We procured a quantity of ſalt, of a moſt excellent quality.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 5th, we paſſed the ſouth point of the iſland, in the latitude of 18° 54′, beyond which the coaſt trends north 60° weſt. A large village is ſituated on this point, many of whoſe inhabitants thronged off to the ſhip with hogs and women. The lattter could not poſſibly be prevented from coming on board, and they were leſs reſerved than any women we had ever ſeen. They ſeemed, indeed, to have viſited us with no other view than to tender us their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                     <p>Having now got a quantity of ſalt, we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed only ſuch hogs as were large enough for ſalting; refuſing all thoſe that were under ſize. But we could ſeldom procure any that exceeded the weight of ſixty pounds. Happily for us, we had ſtill ſome vegetables remaining, as we were now ſupplied with but few of thoſe productions. Indeed, from the appearance of this part of the country, it ſeemed incapable of affording them. Evident marks preſented themſelves of its having been laid waſte by the exploſion of a volcano;
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030274_0967_0FE574F0C316D138"/>
and though ye had not ſeen any thing of the kind, the devaſtation it had made in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood was but too viſible.</p>
                     <p>Though the coaſt is ſheltered from the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winds, it had no anchorage; a line of an hundred and ſixty fathoms not reaching the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom within half a mile of the ſhore. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives having now left us, we ran a few miles down the coaſt in the evening, and paſſed the night in ſtanding off and on.</p>
                     <p>We were again viſited by the natives the next morning. They came laden with the ſame arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of commerce as before. Being not far from the ſhore, Captain Cook ſent Mr. Bligh, in a boat in order to ſound the coaſt, and alſo to go aſhore in ſearch of freſh water. He reported, on his return, that, within two cables lengths of the ſhore, he found no ſoundings with a line of one hundred and ſixty fathoms; that on the land, he could diſcover no ſtream or ſpring; that there was ſome rain water in holes, upon the rocks, which the ſpray of the ſea had rendered brackiſh; that the whole ſurface of the country was compoſed of flags and aſhes interſperſed with a few plants.</p>
                     <p>To our great ſatisfaction, the Diſcovery made her appearance between ten and eleven, coming round the ſouth point of the iſland, and ſhe join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us about one. Captain Clerke then came on board the Reſolution, and acquainted us, that
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030274_0968_0FE57433496C27B8"/>
having cruiſed four or five days where we were ſeparated, he plied round the eaſt ſide of the iſland; where meeting with unfavourable winds, he had been driven to ſome diſtance from the coaſt. One of the iſlanders continued on board the whole time, at his own requeſt, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to leave the ſhip, though opportunities had preſented themſelves. The night was ſpent in ſtanding off and on. In the morning we ſtood in again, and were viſited by many of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. At noon, the latitude was 19° 1′, and the longitude 203° 26′; the neareſt part of the iſland two leagues diſtant. On the 8th, at day-break, we perceived, that whilſt we were plying in the night, the currents had carried us back conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to windward; and that we were now off the ſouth-weſt point of the iſland, where we brought too, in order to enable the inhabitants to trade with us.</p>
                     <p>The night was ſpent in ſtanding off and on. Four men and ten women, who came on board the preceding day, were with us ſtill. The Commodore not liking the company of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we ſtood in ſhore, on the 9th, about noon, ſolely with a view of getting rid of our gueſts; when, ſome canoes coming off, we embraced that opportunity of ſending them away.</p>
                     <p>On the 10th, in the morning, we had light airs from north-weſt, and calms; at eleven, the wind freſhened at north north-weſt, which ſo
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030274_0969_0FE574F2A80D72D0"/>
greatly retarded us, that, in the evening at eight, the ſouth ſnowy hill bore north, 1 ½° eaſt.</p>
                     <p>At four o'clock in the morning of the 11th, the wind being at weſt, we approached the land in expectation of getting ſome refreſhments. The natives ſeeing us ſo near them, began to come off, and we continued trading with them the whole day; though we procured but a very ſcanty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, many of thoſe who came off in their canoes, not having a ſingle thing to barter. From this circumſtance, it appeared, that this part of the iſland was extremely poor, and had already fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with every thing they could ſpare.</p>
                     <p>The 12th was employed in plying off and on, with a freſh gale at weſt. A mile from the ſhore we found ground, at the depth of fifty-five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms. At five we ſtood to the ſouthward, and at midnight we had a calm. The next morning, at eight, we had a ſmall breeze at ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, and ſteered for the land.</p>
                     <p>A few canoes came off to us with ſome hogs: but they brought no vegetables, which were now much wanted. In the evening we had got the length of the ſouth-weſt point of the iſland, but, by the veering of the wind, we loſt in the night all that we had gained in the day. Being in the ſame ſituation the next morning, ſome more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes attended us; but they brought nothing which we ſtood in need of. We were now deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of roots and fruit, and therefore obliged to
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030274_0970_0FE57434CE45DAB8"/>
have recourſe to our ſea proviſions. Some canoes, however, arrived from the northward, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied us with ſome hogs and roots.</p>
                     <p>On the 15th, we had variable light airs till five in the afternoon, when a breeze at eaſt-north-eaſt ſprung up, and enabled us to ſteer along ſhore to the northward. The weather was this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably fine, and we had plenty of company; many of whom continued with us on board all night, and their canoes were towed aſtern. On the 16th, at day-break, ſeeing the appearance of a bay, the Commodore ſent Mr. Bligh, with a boat from each ſhip, to ſurvey it, being now about three leagues off.</p>
                     <p>Canoes arrived from all quarters; inſomuch that by ten o'clock in the morning, there were at leaſt a thouſand about the two ſhips, crouded with people, and laden with hogs and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. We were perfectly convinced of their having no hoſtile intentions; not a ſingle perſon having a weapon with him of any ſort. Trade and curioſity were their only inducements to viſit us. Such numbers as we had frequently on board, it might be expected that ſome of them ſhould betray a thieviſh diſpoſition. One of them took a boat's rudder from the ſhip, and was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected till it was too late to recover it. Captain Cook imagined this to be a proper opportunity to ſhew theſe iſlanders the uſe of fire arms; two or three m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſquets, and as many four pounders,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030274_0971_0FE57461CB839220"/>
were, by his orders, fired over the canoe which went away with the rudder. But as the ſhot was not intended to take effect, the ſurrounding mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude were more ſurprized than frightened.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Bligh, when he returned in the evening, reported, that he had found a bay with good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorage, and freſh water, in a deſirable ſituation. Into this bay, the Commodore determined to take his ſhips, in order to refit, and ſupply ourſelves with refreſhments. At the approach of night, the moſt conſiderable part of our viſitors retired to the ſhore; but many, at their own earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, were permitted to ſleep on board. Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, at leaſt with ſome of them, was not the only motive, for ſeveral articles were miſſing the next morning; in conſequence of which, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore came to a reſolution not to admit ſo many on any future night.</p>
                     <p>On the 17th, at eleven in the forenoon, we anchored in the bay, called by the natives <hi>Karaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kooa,</hi> within a quarter of a mile of the north-eaſt ſhore. The ſouth point of the bay bearing ſouth by weſt, and the north point weſt half north. After we were moored, the ſhips continued much crouded with the natives, and ſurrounded by a vaſt multitude of canoes. In the courſe of our voyages, we had no where ſeen ſuch vaſt numbers of people aſſembled at one place.

about the ſhips, like ſhoals of fiſh. We were ſtruck with the ſingularity of this ſcene: and few of us lamented that we had not ſucceeded in our late endeavours, to find a northern paſſage home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. To this diſappointment we were indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for reviſiting the <hi>Sandwich Iſlands,</hi> and for enriching our voyage with a diſcovery, in many reſpects the moſt important that has been made by the Europeans in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Bay of Karakakooa is ſituated in the diſtrict of Acona, on the weſt ſide of the iſland of Owhyhee. It extends about a mile in
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030274_0974_0FE57438348A87F0"/>
depth, and is bounded by two points of land, bearing ſouth-eaſt and north-weſt from each other, at the diſtance of half a league. The north point is flat and barren, on which is ſituated the village of Kowrowa. A more conſiderable village, called Kakooa, ſtands in the bottom of the bay, near a grove of ſtately cocoa-trees. A high rocky cliff, inacceſſible from the ſea-ſhore, runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Near the coaſt, on the ſouth ſide, the land has a rugged appearance; beyond which the country gradually riſes, and abounds with cultivated incloſures, and groves of cocoa-trees. The habitations of the people are ſcattered about in great plenty. Round the bay the ſhore is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a black coral rock, except at Kakooa, where there is an excellent ſandy beach, with a <hi>Morai</hi> at one extremity, and a ſpring of freſh water at the other. We moored at the north ſide of this bay, and within a quarter of a mile from the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants, perceiving our intention to anchor in the bay, came off in a ſtoniſhing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, expreſſing their joy by ſinging, ſhouting, and the moſt extravagant geſtures. The decks, fides, and riggings of our ſhips were covered with them. Women and boys, who were unable to procure canoes, came ſwimming round us in great multitudes; ſome of whom, not finding room to get on board, amuſed themſelves the whole day by playing in the water.</p>

                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or expreſſive of ſome degree of affinity.</note> to the ſovereign of the iſland, who was then on a military expedition at Mowee; whence he was expected to return in a few days. Some preſents from the Commodore attached him to our intereſts, and we found him exceedingly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us. Before we had been long at anchor, the Diſcovery had ſo many people hanging on one ſide, that ſhe was obſerved to heel conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; and our people found it impoſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the crowds from preſſing into her. Captain Cook, apprehenſive that ſhe might receive ſome injury, communicated his fears to Pareea, who inſtantly cleared the ſhip of its incumberances, and diſperſed the canoes that ſurrounded her.</p>
                     <p>From this circumſtance, it appears that the chiefs have a moſt deſpotic authority over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior people. An inſtance, ſimilar to this, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on board the Reſolution; where the crowd ſo far impeded the ordinary buſineſs of the ſhip, that we found it neceſſary to apply to Kaneena, another chief, who had alſo attached himſelf par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to Captain Cook. The inconvenience we ſuffered was no ſooner mentioned, than he ordered the natives immediately to quit the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030274_0978_0FE5743CE28E86F0"/>
when, without a moment's heſitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſaw them all jump over-board; except one perſon, who loitered behind, and, by his manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſome degree of unwillingneſs to obey. Kaneena obſerving this contempt of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, took hold of him immediately, and threw him into the ſea.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two chiefs were exceedingly well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and had countenances remarkable pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Kaneena, whoſe portrait was drawn by Mr. Webber, was as fine a figure as can be ſeen. His height was about ſix feet, his features were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and expreſſive, his deportment was eaſy, firm, and graceful, and he had dark lively eyes.</p>
                     <p>Mention has already been made, that while we were cruizing off this iſland, the inhabitants had acted fairly and honeſtly, without manifeſting the leaſt propenſity to theft; which was the more remarkable, becauſe thoſe with whom we had hitherto any dealings, were people of the loweſt rank, ſuch as fiſhermen or ſervants. The caſe was now exceedingly altered. The multitude of iſlanders, who blocked up every part of the ſhips, afforded opportunity of pilfering without danger of diſcovery, and even if detected, muſt have eſcaped with impunity from our inferiority in number. To the encouragement of their chiefs this alteration might alſo be attributed; for, as we frequently traced the booty into the poſſeſſion
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030274_0979_0FE574689FC41C50"/>
of ſome great men, there is little doubt but theſe depredations were made at their inſtigation.</p>
                     <p>The Reſolution having got into her ſtation, the two chiefs, Pareea and Kaneena, brought a third on board, whoſe name was Koah. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us as a prieſt, and one who, in his early days, had diſtinguiſhed himſelf as a warrior. He was a little old emaciated figure, having ſore red eyes, and his body covered with a leprous ſcurf, occaſioned by the immoderate uſe of the <hi>ava.</hi> Being conducted to the cabin, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Commodore with the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, threw a piece of red cloth over his ſhoulders, and retreated a few paces, made an offering of a ſmall pig, at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a diſcourſe of a conſiderable length.</p>
                     <p>During our coutinuance at Owhyhee, this ceremony was repeated often, and from a variety of circumſtances, appeared to us to be a kind of religious adoration. Red cloth is an article with which their idols are arrayed, and a pig is their common offering to the <hi>Eatooas.</hi> Their ſpeeches were delivered with a volubility that indicated them to be conformable to ſome ritual.</p>
                     <p>At the concluſion of this ceremony, Koah dined with the Commodore, and eat plentifully of the viands before him; but, like moſt of the iſlanders in theſe ſeas, he could hardly be induced to taſte our wine or ſpirits a ſecond time. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Commodore, Mr. King, and Mr. Baily,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030274_0980_0FE5743EEF2D9B30"/>
accompanied him on ſhore. As ſoon as we land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the beach, we were preceded by four men, bearing each a wand tipt with dog's hair, and pronouncing, with a loud voice, a ſhort ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in which the word <hi>Orono</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">This was Captain Cook's general appellation among the natives of Owhyhee. Sometimes it was applied by them to an inviſible being inhabiting heaven. It was alſo a title of great rank in the Iſland.</note> was very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable. The crowd which had aſſembled on the ſhore, retired at our approac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and not an individual was to be ſeen, except a few who had proſtrated themſelves on the ground, near the habitations of the adjacent village.</p>
                     <p>Before we relate an account of the peculiar ceremonies reſpecting the adoration paid to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook, it may not be unneceſſary to deſcribe the <hi>Morai,</hi> already mentioned, ſituated on the beach at <hi>Kakooa.</hi> It conſiſted of a ſquare ſolid pile of ſtones, of the length of forty yards, the breadth of twenty, and the height of fourteen. The top of it was flat, and a wooden rail ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded it, on which were diſplayed the ſkulls of thoſe natives, who had been ſacrificed on the death of their chiefs. A ruinous wooden build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſituated in the centre of the area, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the rail by a ſtone wall, dividing the whole ſpace into two parts. Five poles of about twenty feet in height, ſupported an irregular kind of ſcaffold, on the ſide next the country; and,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030274_0981_0FE5746BC6AEBD38"/>
on the ſide towards the ſea, were too ſmall houſes, with a covered communication.</p>
                     <p>Koah conducted us to the top of this pile. At our entrance we beheld two large wooden images, with moſt diſtorted features, having a long piece of wood, proceeding from the top of their heads, of a conical form inverted; the other parts were covered with red cloth. Here Captain Cook was received by a tall young man, having a long beard, who preſented him to the images, and chanted a kind of hymn, in which he was aſſiſted by Koah. We were then led to the ſide of the Morai where the poles were erected; at the foot of which twelve images were ranged in the form of a ſemicircle; the middle figure having a high table before it like the <hi>Whatta</hi> of Otaheite, on which we ſaw a putrid hog, and under it ſome cocoa-nuts, plantains, potatoes, bread-fruit, and pieces of ſugar-cane. The Commodore was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted under this ſtand by Koah; who, taking down the hog, held it towards him: when, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again addreſſed him in a long and vehement ſpeech, he ſuffered it to fall upon the ground, and aſcended the ſcaffolding with him, though at the peril of their falling.</p>
                     <p>We now beheld, advancing in ſolemn proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and entering the top of the <hi>Morai,</hi> ten men bearing a live hog, and a piece of large red cloth of conſiderable dimenſions. Advancing a few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they ſtopped, and proſtrated themſelves; and
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030274_0982_0FE5744075860E90"/>
Kaireekeea, the tall young man already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed approaching them, received the cloth, and carried it to Koah, who wrapped it round the Commodore, and made him an offering of the hog.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook was now aloft, in a ſituation truly whimſical, ſwathed in red cloth, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to keep his hold in the rotten ſcaffolding. In this ſituation he was entertained with the chanting of Koah and Kaireekeea, ſometimes in concert, and ſometimes alternately. After this office was performed, which was of conſiderable duration, Koah let the hog drop, and he and the Commodore immediately deſcended. He then conducted him to the images juſt mentioned, to each of which he expreſſed himſelf in a ſneering tone, ſnapping his fingers at them as he paſſed. He then preſented him to that in the centre; which, from its being habited in red cloth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be in the higheſt eſtimation. He fell proſtrate before this figure, and kiſſed it, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Captain Cook would do the ſame; which he readily ſubmitted to, being determined to follow Koah's directions throughout the whole of this ceremony.</p>
                     <p>We were now conveyed into the other diviſion of the Morai, where a ſpace, of about twelve feet ſquare, was ſunk three feet below the level of the area. We deſcended into this, and the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore was immediately ſeated between two idols;
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030274_0983_0FE5746DA82FD780"/>
one of his arms being ſupported by Koah, and Mr. King was requeſted to ſupport the other. A ſecond proceſſion of natives, at this time, arrived with a baked hog, a pudding, ſome cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and other vegetables. As they drew near, Kaireekeea placed himſelf before them, and preſented the hog to the Commodore, in the uſual manner; chanting as before, and his companions making regular reſponſes. Their ſpeeches and reſponſes, we obſerved, grew gradually ſhorter and ſhorter and, towards the concluſion, Kairee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keea's did not exceed three or four words, which was anſwered by the word <hi>orono.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the concluſion of this offering, the natives ſeated themſelves fronting us, and began to cut up the baked hog, to break the cocoa-nuts, and to peel the vegetables. Others were employed in brewing the <hi>ava,</hi> by chewing it in the ſame manner as at the Friendly Iſlands. Kaireekeea then chewed part of the kernel of a cocoa-nut, and wrapped it in a piece of cloth, with which he rubbed the Captain's head, face, hands, arms, and ſhoulders. The <hi>ava</hi> was afterwards handed round, and when we had all taſted it, Koah and Pareea pulled the fleſh of the hog in pieces, and proceeded to put ſome of it into our mouths. Mr. King had no particular objection to being fed by Pareea, who was remarkably cleanly in his perſon; but Captain Cook, to whom a piece was preſented by Koah, could not ſwallow a morſel,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030274_0984_0FE5744269E31948"/>
the putrid hog being ſtrong in his recollection; and as the old man, from motives of civility, had chewed it for him, his reluctance was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
                     <p>This ceremony being concluded, we quitted the <hi>Morai,</hi> after diſtributing among the populace ſome pieces of iron, and other articles, with which they were much delighted. We were then conducted in proceſſion to the boats; the men, with wands, attending, and pronouncing ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as before. Moſt of the natives again retired, and the remaining few proſtrated themſelves as we paſſed along the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>We went immediately on board, full of the idea of what we had ſeen, and perfectly ſatisfied with the honeſt diſpoſitions of our new friends. Of the ſingularity and novelty of the various ceremonies performed upon this occaſion, we can only form conjectures; but they were certainly, highly expreſſive of reſpect on the part of the inhabitants; and, as far as related to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore, they approached to adoration.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King went on ſhore, the next morning, with a guard of eight marines; having received orders to erect the obſervatory in a proper ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by which means the waterers, and other working parties, on ſhore, might be ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and protected. Obſerving a convenient ſpot for this purpoſe, almoſt in the centre of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, Pareea immediately offered to exerciſe his
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030274_0985_0FE5740D7A137A38"/>
power in our behalf, and propoſed that ſome houſes ſhould be taken down, that our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might not be obſtructed. This generous offer, however, we declined, and we made choice of a potatoe field, adjoining to the <hi>Morai,</hi> which was granted us moſt readily; and to prevent the intruſion of the natives, the place was conſecrated by the prieſts, by placing their wands round the walls which incloſed it.</p>
                     <p>This interdiction the natives call <hi>taboo,</hi> a term frequently repeated by theſe iſlanders, and ſeemed to be a word of extenſive operation. In this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it procured us more privacy than we could have wiſhed. No canoes attempted to land near us; the natives only ſat on the wall, not daring to come within the <hi>tabooed</hi> ſpace without obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our permiſſion. The men, indeed, at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, would bring proviſions into the field; but our utmoſt endeavours were ineffectual to induce the women to approach us. Preſents were tried, but without ſucceſs. Attempts were made to prevail on Pereea and Koah to bring them, but to no purpoſe; the <hi>Eatooa</hi> and Terreeoboo, they ſaid, would kill them if they did.</p>
                     <p>This circumſtance afforded great amuſement to our friends on board, whither multitudes of people (particularly women) continually flocked; inſomuch that they were frequently obliged to clear the veſſel, in order to have room to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their neceſſary duties. Two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030274_0986_0FE5744801D1BE78"/>
women were ſometimes obliged to jump, at once, into the water; where they continued to ſwim and play till they could be re-admitted.</p>
                     <p>Pareea and Koah left us on the 19th of Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to attend Terreeoboo, who had landed on a diſtant part of the iſland; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing material happened on board till the 24th. The caulkers were employed on the ſides of the ſhips, and the rigging was repaired. The ſalting of hogs was alſo a principal object of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore's attention; and as we had improved in this operation ſince the former voyages, a detail of the proceſs of it may not be thought improper.</p>
                     <p>To cure the fleſh of animals, in tropical cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, by ſalting, has long been thought imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable; putrefaction making ſo rapid a progreſs as not to allow the ſalt to take effect before the meat gets tainted. Captain Cook appears to be the firſt navigator who has attempted to make experiments relative to this buſineſs. His firſt attempts in 1774, in his ſecond voyage to the Pacific Ocean, ſo far ſucceeded, as to convince him of the error of the general opinion. As his preſent voyage was likely to be protracted a year beyond the time that proviſions had been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for the ſhips, he was obliged to contrive ſome method of procuring ſubſiſtence for the crews, or relinquiſh the proſecution of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. He, therefore, renewed his attempts,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030274_0987_0FE5740F60828668"/>
and his moſt ſanguine expectations were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely anſwered.</p>
                     <p>The hogs we cured were of various ſizes from four to ten or twelve ſtone, fourteen pound to the ſtone. They were always ſlaughtered in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; and, after ſcalding off the hair, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the entrails, the hog was cut into pieces, from four to eight pounds each, and the bones taken out of the legs and chine: in the larger ſort, the ribs were alſo taken out. The pieces were then carefully examined and wiped, and the coagulated blood taken from the veins. After this they were given to the ſalters whilſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued warm, and, when they were well rubbed with ſalt, placed in a heap on a ſtage in the open air, covered with planks, and preſſed with very heavy weights. The next evening they were again well wiped and examined, when the ſuſpicious parts were taken away. This done, they were put into a tub of ſtrong pickle, after which they were examined once or twice a day; and, if it happened that any piece had not taken the ſalt, which might be diſcovered by the ſmell of the pickle, they were inſtantly taken out and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined again, the ſound pieces being put into freſh pickle. This however, did not often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. At the end of ſix days they were examined for the laſt time; and, after being ſlightly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they were put into barrels, having a thin layer of ſalt between them. Mr. King brought
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030274_0988_0FE57449CB1DE6C8"/>
home ſome barrels of this pork, that had been pickled at Owhyhee, in January 1779, which was taſted here, by ſeveral perſons, about Chriſtmas, 1780, who declared it to be perfectly ſound and wholeſome.</p>
                     <p>But to return from this digreſſion. We had not been long ſettled at the obſervatory, before we diſcovered the habitation of a ſociety of prieſts, who had excited our curioſity by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular attendance on the <hi>morai.</hi> Their huts were erected round a pond, encloſed within a grove of cocoa-trees, by which they were ſeperated from the beach and the village, and gave the ſituation an air of religious retirement. Captain Cook being made acquainted with theſe circumſtances, he was determined to viſit them; and expecting the manner of his reception would be ſingular, he took Mr. Webber with him, to enable him to repreſent the ceremony in a drawing.</p>
                     <p>When he arrived at the beach, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Harre-no-Orono,</hi> or the houſe of Orono. On his approaching this ſacred place, he was ſeated at the foot of a wooden idol, reſembling thoſe which he had ſeen at the <hi>morai.</hi> Here Mr. King again ſupported one of his arms. He was then arrayed in red cloth, and Kaireekeea, aſſiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by twelve prieſts, preſented a pig with the uſual ſolemnities. After this ceremony, the pig was ſtrangled, and thrown into the embers of a fire, prepared for that purpoſe. When the hair
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:030274_0989_0FE57414A4933090"/>
was ſigned off, a ſecond offering was made, and the chanting repeated as before; after which, the dead pig was held, for ſome time, under Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook's noſe; and then laid, with a cocoa-nut at his feet. This part of the ceremony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluded, the performers ſat down; and the <hi>ava</hi> was brewed and handed about; a baked hog was brought in, and we were fed, as in the former ceremony.</p>
                     <p>While we continued on the bay, whenever the Commodore came on ſhore, he was preceded by one of theſe prieſts, who proclaimed the landing of the <hi>Orono,</hi> and ordered the inhabitants to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate themſelves. He was conſtantly attended by the ſame perſon, on the water, where he was ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the bow of the boat, having a wand in his hand, to give notice of his approach to the natives, who where in canoes; on which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ceaſed paddling, and fell on their faces till he had paſſed. Whenever he viſited the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatory. Kairkeereea and his aſſiſtants preſented themſelves before him, making an offering of hogs, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, &amp;c. with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed ſolemnities. Upon theſe occaſions, ſome of the inferior chiefs entreated permiſſion to make an offering to the <hi>Orono.</hi> If their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was complied with, they preſented the hog themſelves; in the performance of which, their countenances diſplayed that they were greatly impreſſed with awe and terror. Kaireekeea, and
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030274_0990_0FE5744B51E8A010"/>
the prieſts aſſiſted, and accompanied the ceremony with their accuſtomed hymns.</p>
                     <p>But their civilities extended beyond parade and ceremony; our party, on ſhore, were daily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by them with hogs and vegetables, ſufficient for our ſubſiſtance, and to ſpare; and canoes, laden with proviſions, were as regularly ſent off to the ſhips. Nothing was demanded in return, nor was the moſt diſtant hint ever given that any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was expected. Their manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring favours, appeared more like the diſcharge of a religious duty, than to reſult from mere libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. On aſking to whom we were indebted for all this munificence, we were informed, that it was at the expence of Kaoo, the chief prieſt, and grandfather to Kaireekeea, who was then in the ſuit of the ſovereign of the iſland.</p>
                     <p>We had, indeed, leſs reaſon to be ſatisfied with the behaviour of the warrior chiefs, than with that of the prieſts. In our intercourſe with the former, they were always ſufficiently attentive to their own intereſts; and, beſides their propenſity to ſtealing, which may admit of palliation from its univerſality in theſe ſeas, they had other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices equally diſhonourable. The following is one inſtance, in which we diſcovered, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, that our good friend Koah was a party prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerned.</p>
                     <p>The chiefs, who made us preſents of hogs, were always generouſly rewarded; in conſequence
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030274_0991_0FE574165FABA2B0"/>
of which, we were ſupplied with more than we could conſume. On theſe occaſions Koah, who conſtantly attended us, uſually petitioned for thoſe that we did not abſolutely want, and they were given to him of courſe. A pig was, one day, preſented to us by a man whom Koah intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as a chief; which we knew to be the pig that had, a ſhort time before been given to Koah. Suſpecting we had been impoſed upon, we found, on further enquiry, that the pretended chief was one of the common people; and from other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current circumſtances, we were perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that, in many inſtances, we had been the dupes of ſimilar impoſition.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the 24th, we were now a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find, that no canoes were permitted to put off, and that the natives confined themſelves to their houſes. At length, however, we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the bay was <hi>tabooed,</hi> and that all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with us was interdicted, oh account of the arrival of Terreeoboo their king. Not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending an accident of this kind, the ſhips were deprived of their uſual ſupply of vegetables.</p>
                     <p>On Monday the 25th, in the morning, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, by threats and promiſes, to induce the inhabitants to approach us. At length, ſome of them were venturing to put off, and a chief was obſerved to be very active in driving them away. In order to make him deſiſt, a muſquet was inſtantly fired over his head, which operated
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030274_0992_0FE5744D5FC0DC48"/>
as it was intended, and refreſhments were ſoon after to be had as uſual. In the afternoon, the ſhips were privately viſited by Terreeoboo, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only by one canoe, which had his wife and family on board. After ſtaying till almoſt ten o'clock, he returned to the village of Kow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowa.</p>
                     <p>About noon the next day, the king, in a large canoe, with ſome attendants in two others, pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled from the village, in great ſtate, towards the ſhips. Their appearance was noble and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent. Terreeoboo, and his chiefs, were in the firſt canoe, arrayed in feathered cloaks and helmets, and armed with ſpears and daggers. In the ſecond, came Kaoo, the chief prieſt, together with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s brethern, having their idols diſplayed on red cloth. Theſe idols were figures of an enormous ſize, made of wicker-work, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ornamented with ſmall feathers of a variety of colours. Their eyes were large pearl oyſters, with a black nut placed in the centre; a double row of the fangs of dogs was fixed in each of their mouths, which, as well as the reſt of their features appeared ſtrangely diſtorted. The third canoe was laden with hogs and vegetables. As they advanced, the prieſts, in the ſecon canoe, chanted their hymns with great ſolemnity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paddling round the veſſels, they did not come on board, as we expected, but made immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

towards the ſhore, at the beach where we were ſtationed.</p>
                     <p>When Mr. King beheld them approaching, he ordered our little guard to receive the king; and Captain Cook, ſeeing that he intended to go on ſhore, went thither alſo, and landed almoſt at the ſame inſtant. We uſhered them into the tent, and the king had hardly been ſeated, when he roſe up, and gracefully threw over the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's ſhoulders, the rich feathered cloak that he himſelf wore, placed a helmet on his head, and preſented him with a curious fan. Five or ſix other cloaks, of great beauty and value, were ſpread at the Commodore's feet.</p>
                     <p>Four hogs were then brought forward, by the king's attendants, together with bread-fruit, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa-nuts, and ſugar-canes. Then followed the ceremony of Terreeoboo's changing names with Captain Cook; the ſtrongeſt pledge of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among all the iſlanders of the Pacific Ocean. A ſolemn proceſſion now advanced, conſiſting of prieſts, preceded by a venerable old perſonage, followed by a train of people leading large hogs; others being laden with potatoes, plantains, &amp;c. We could inſtantly perceive, by the countenance and geſtures of Kaireekeea, that the old man who headed the proceſſion, was the chief prieſt, on whoſe bounty we were told we had ſo long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. He wrapped a piece of red cloth round the ſhoulders of Captain Cook, and, in the uſual
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:030274_0995_0FE57453145F0AC8"/>
form preſented him with a pig. He was then ſeated next the king, and Kaireekeea, and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants began their vocal ceremonies, Kaoo and the chiefs aſſiſting in the reſponſes.</p>
                     <p>In the perſon of this king, we were ſurprized to recognize the ſame emaciated old man, who came on board the Reſolution, from the north-eaſt ſide of the iſland of Mowee; and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that ſeveral of his attendants were the ſame perſons, who, at that time, continued with us the whole night. Among theſe were the king's two youngeſt ſons, the eldeſt about the age of ſixteen; and Maiha-Maiha, his nephew, whom we could not immediately recollect, having had his hair plaſtered over with a dirty paſte and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which was no bad improvement to the moſt ſavage countenance we had ever ſeen.</p>
                     <p>The formalities of the meeting being ended, Captain Cook conducted Terreeoboo, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his chiefs, on board the Reſolution. They were received with every poſſible attention and reſpect; and the Commodore as a compenſation for the feathered cloak, put a linen ſhirt upon the ſovereign, and girt his own hanger round him. Kaoo, and about half a dozen other ancient chiefs, remained on ſhore.</p>
                     <p>All this time, not a canoe was permitted to appear in the bay, and thoſe natives who did not confine themſelves to their huts, lay proſtrate on the ground. Before the king quitted the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:030274_0996_0FE5741E8489AEA0"/>
he granted leave for the natives to trade with the ſhips, as uſual; but the women (we know not upon what account) were ſtill interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>taboo;</hi> that is, to remain at home, and not have any kind of intercourſe with us.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE behaviour of the inhabitants was ſo civil and inoffenſive, that all apprehenſions of danger were totally vaniſhed. We truſted our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030274_0997_0FE57454B4415990"/>
amongſt them at all times, and upon all occaſions, without the leaſt heſitation. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ventured frequently up the country, either ſingly, or in ſmall parties, and ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued out the whole night. To relate all the inſtances of generoſity and civility, which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced upon theſe occaſions, would require volumes. In all places the people flocked about us, anxious to afford every aſſiſtance in their power, and appeared highly gratified if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to accept of their ſervices. Variety of innocent arts were practiſed to attract our notice, or to delay our departure. The boys and girls ran through their villages before us, ſtopping us at every opening, where there was a commodious place to form a group for dancing. We were, at one time, ſolicited to take a draught of the milk of cocoa-nuts, or accept of ſuch other refreſhment as their huts afforded; at another we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled by a company of young women, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted their ſkill and agility in amuſing us with ſongs and dances.</p>
                     <p>But though their gentleneſs and hoſpitality were pleaſing to us, they were addicted to ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like all the other iſlanders of theſe ſeas. This was a diſtreſſing circumſtance, and ſometimes obliged us to exerciſe ſeverity, which we ſhould have been happy to have avoided, if it had not been eſſentially neceſſary. Some expert ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were one day detected under the ſhips, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:030274_0998_0FE57420907224E0"/>
out the filling nails from the ſheathing, which they ingeniouſly performed with a flint ſtone, faſtened to the end of a ſhort ſtick. This practice was ſo injurious to our veſſels, that we fired ſmall ſhot at the offenders; but that they eaſily evad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by diving under the ſhips bottom, It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore became highly neceſſary to make an example of one of them, by flogging him on board the Diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>A large party of gentlemen, from both ſhips, ſet out, about this time, on an excurſion into the country, in order to examine its natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions; an account of which will be hereafter given. At preſent, however, we ſhall obſerve, that it afforded Kaoo a freſh opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing his civility and generoſity. No ſooner was he informed of their departure, than he ſent after them a large quantity of proviſions, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that every attention and aſſiſtance ſhould be granted them by the inhabitants of thoſe diſtricts through which they were to paſs. His conduct, on this occaſion, was ſo delicate and diſintereſted, that even the people he employed were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to accept of the ſmalleſt preſent. At the end of ſix days, the gentlemen returned, without having penetrated more than twenty miles into the iſland; owing partly to improper guides, and partly to the impracticability of the country.</p>
                     <p>On the 27th, the Reſolution's rudder was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung, and ſent on ſhore, in order to undergo a
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:030274_0999_0FE574563AA780C0"/>
thorough repair. The carpenters at the ſame time, where ſent into the country, under the guidance of ſome of Kaoo's people, to get planks for the head rail work, which was become rotten and decayed.</p>
                     <p>Captain Clerke, who was generally confined on board by ill health, paid Terreeoboo his firſt viſit on the 28th, at his habitation on ſhore. The ceremonies obſerved with Captain Cook, were performed in honour of Captain Clerke; and, on his return, he received a preſent of thirty large hogs, and ſuch a quantity of vegetables as could not be conſumed, by his crew, in leſs than a week. This was the more extraordinary, as it was quite an unexpected viſit.</p>
                     <p>Not having ſeen any of their ſports or exerciſes, the natives, at our particular requeſt, entertained us in the evening with a boxing match. Though theſe games were inferior, in every reſpect, to thoſe we had ſeen exhibited at the Friendly Iſlands; yet, as they were ſomewhat different, a ſhort account of them may not be thought impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                     <p>A vaſt concourſe of people aſſembled on an even ſpot of ground, not far diſtant from our tents. A long vacant ſpace was left in the centre of them, at the upper end of which the judges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, under three ſtandards. Slips of cloth, of various colours, were pendent from theſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; as were the ſkins of two wild geeſe, ſome ſmall birds, and a few bunches of feathers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="unknown:030274_1000_0FE57422153AF790"/>The ſports being ready to begin, the judges gave the ſignal, and two combatants appeared in view. They advanced ſlowly, drawing up their feet very high behind and rubbing their hands upon the ſoles. As they came forward, they frequently ſurveyed each other from head to foot, with an air of contempt, looking archly at the ſpectators diſtorting their features, and practiſing a variety of unnatural geſtures. When they were advanced within the reach of each other, they held both arms ſtraight out before their faces, at which part they always aimed their blows. They ſtruck with a full ſwing of the arm, which to us had a very awkward appearance. They did not attempt to parry; but endeavoured to elude their adverſary's attack, by ſtopping, or retreating. The battle was expeditiouſly decided; for if either of them fell, whether by accident, or from a blow he was deemed vanquiſhed; and the victor expreſſed his triumph by a variety of ſtrange geſtures, which uſually excited a loud laugh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſpectators, for which purpoſe it ſeemed to be calculated. The ſucceſsful combatant waited for a ſecond antagoniſt; and, if again victorious, for a third; and ſo on, till he was at laſt defeated.</p>
                     <p>It was very ſingular, in theſe combats, that when any two were preparing to attack each other, a third may advance, and make choice of either of them for his antagoniſt, when the other is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

As this exhibition was at our deſire, it was univerſally expected that ſome of us would have engaged with the natives; but, though our people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived preſſing invitations to bear a part, they did not hearken to the challenges, not having forgot the blows they received at the Friendly Iſlands.</p>
                     <p>William Whatman, a ſeaman of the gunner's crew, died this day; this event is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioned, as death had hitherto been uncommon amongſt us. He was a man in years, and much reſpected for his attachment to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook. He had ſerved twenty-one years as a marine, and then entered as a ſeaman in 1772, on board the Reſolution, and ſerved with the Commodore in his voyage towards the ſouth pole. On their return, he got admittance into Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Hoſpital, through the intereſt of Captain Cook, at the ſame time with himſelf; and, anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to follow the fortunes of his benefactor, he alſo quitted it with him, on his appointment to the command of the preſent expedition. He had been often ſubject to ſlight fevers, in the courſe of the voyage, and was infirm when we arrived in the bay; where, having been ſent for a few days on ſhore, he thought himſelf perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:030274_1002_0FE5742927C25458"/>
and requeſted to return on board. Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> requeſt was complied with; but the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had a ſtroke of the palſy, which, in two days afterwards, put a period to his life.</p>
                     <p>At the requeſt of Terreeoboo, the remains of this honeſt ſeaman were buried on the <hi>morai;</hi> the ceremony being performed with great ſolemnity. Kaoo and his brethren were preſent at the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who behaved with great decorum, and paid due attention while the ſervice was performing. On our beginning to fill up the grave, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it with great awe, and threw in a dead pig, together with ſome cocoa-nuts and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. For three ſucceſſive nights they ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, ſacrificing hogs, and reciting hymns and prayers till morning.</p>
                     <p>We erected a poſt at the head of the grave, and nailed thereon a piece of board; on which was inſcribed the name and age of the deceaſed, and the day of his departure from this life. Theſe they aſſured us they would not remove, and they will probably be permitted to remain, ſo long as ſuch frail materials can endure.</p>
                     <p>Our ſhips were much in want of fuel, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Captain Cook deſired Mr. King to treat with the prieſts for the purchaſe of the rail on the <hi>morai.</hi> Mr. King had his doubts about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of this overture, and apprehended that the bare mention of it might be deemed impious; but in this he was exceedingly miſtaken. They
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030274_1003_0FE575D6F0470A10"/>
expreſſed no kind of ſurprize at the application, and the wood was delivered without the leaſt ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation. Whilſt our people were taking it away, he ſaw one of them with a carved image; and, upon inquiry, was informed that the whole ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle (as mentioned in the deſcription of the <hi>morai</hi>) had been carried to the boats.</p>
                     <p>Though the natives were ſpectators of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, they did not ſeem to reſent it; but, on the contrary, had even aſſiſted in the removal. Mr. King thought proper to mention the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to Kaoo: who ſeemed exceedingly indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent about the matter, begging him only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the center image; which was immediately done, and it was conveyed to one of the prieſt's houſes.</p>
                     <p>The king, and his chiefs, had, for ſome time, been very importunate to know the time of our departure. Mr. King's curioſity was excited, from this circumſtance, to know the opinion theſe people had entertained of us, and what they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the objects of our voyage. He took conſiderable pains to ſatisfy himſelf on theſe points: but the only information he could get was, that they ſuppoſed we had left our native country on account of the ſcantineſs of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that we had viſited them for the ſole purpoſe of filling our bellies. This concluſion was natural enough, conſidering the meagre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſome of our crew, the voracity with
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:030274_1004_0FE57530D2FE8C80"/>
which we devoured their freſh proviſions, and our anxiety to purchaſe as much of it as we were able. One circumſtance may be added to theſe, which puzzled them exceedingly; that of our having no women with us.</p>
                     <p>It was matter of entertainment to ſee the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives patting the bellies of the ſailors (who were much improved in ſleekneſs ſince their arrival at the bay) and telling them, in the beſt manner they could, that it was time for them to depart; but, if they would return the next bread-fruit ſeaſon, they ſhould be better able to ſupply them. We had now continued ſixteen days in the bay, during which time our conſumption of hogs and vegetables had been ſo enormous, that we need not be ſurprized at their wiſhing to ſee us take our leave. But Terreeoboo had, perhaps, no other view, in his enquiries, than a deſire of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient notice, to prepare ſuitable preſents for us at our departure; for when we informed him of our intention to quit the iſland in two days, a kind of proclamation was immediately made, requiring the natives to bring in their hogs and vegetables, for Terreeoboo to preſent to the <hi>Orono.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the beach, we were this day much enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, with the buffooneries of one of the natives. In his hand he held an inſtrument of muſic, ſuch as we have already deſcribed; bits of ſea-weed were faſtened round his neck; and, round each
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030274_1005_0FE548DB218E6888"/>
leg, ſome ſtrong netting; on which were fixed ſome rows of dogs teeth, hanging looſe. His dancing was accompanied with ſtrange grimaces, and unnatural diſtortions of the features: which, though ſometimes highly ridiculous, was, upon the whole, without meaning or expreſſion. Mr. Webber made a drawing of this perſon; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the maro is tied; the figure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and of the ornaments round the legs.</p>
                     <p>Wreſtling and boxing matches afforded us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion for the evening; and we, in return, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the few fire-works we had remaining. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could more effectually excite the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe iſlanders, or ſtrike them with more exalted ideas of our ſuperioity, than ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. Though this was, in every reſpect, much inferior to that at Hapaee, yet the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people was equally great.</p>
                     <p>The carpenters which had been ſent up the country, to cut planks for the head rail-work of the Reſolution, had now been gone three days; and, not having heard from them, we began to be alarmed for their ſafety. We expreſſed our apprehenſions to old Kaoo, who appeared equally concerned with ourſelves; but while we were planning meaſures with him, for ſending proper perſons after them, they all ſafely arrived. They went farther into the country than they expected, before they found any trees ſuitable for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. This circumſtance, together with the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:030274_1006_0FE575327A156668"/>
of the roads, and the difficulty of conveying the timber to the ſhips, had ſo long detained them. They beſtowed high commendations on their guides, who not only ſupplied them with proviſions, but faithfully protected their tools.</p>
                     <p>The 4th of February being fixed for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, Terreeoboo invited Captain Cook and Mr. King, to attend him on the 3d, to Kaoo's reſidence. On our arrival there we ſaw large quantities of cloth lie ſcattered on the ground; abundance of red and yellow feathers, faſtened to the fibres of cocoa-nut huſks; and plenty of hatchets and iron ware, which had been received from us in barter. Not far from theſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited an immenſe quantity of various kinds of vegetables; and, at a little diſtance, a large herd of hogs. We ſuppoſed, at the firſt, that the whole was intended as a preſent for us; but we were informed by Kaireekeea, that it was a tribute to the king, from the inhabitants of that diſtrict. And, we were no ſooner ſeated, than the bundles were brought, and laid ſeverally at Terreeoboo's feet, and the cloth, feathers, and iron, were diſplayed before him.</p>
                     <p>The king was perfectly ſatisfied with this mark of duty from his people; and ſelected about a third of the iron utenſils, a third of the feathers, and ſome pieces of cloth; he ordered theſe to be ſet aſide by themſelves; and the remainder of the cloth, hogs, vegetables, &amp;c. were afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030274_1007_0FE574F86844DE50"/>
to Captain Cook and Mr. King. The value and magnitude of this preſent, far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing that we had met with. The whole was immediately conveyed on board. The large hogs were ſelected, in order to be ſalted for ſea ſtore; but the ſmaller pigs, and the vegetables, were divided between the crews.</p>
                     <p>We left the <hi>morai,</hi> and got our obſervatories on board. The <hi>taboo</hi> was removed, and, with it, its magical effects. As ſoon as we had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the place, the people ruſhed in, and vigilantly ſearched; hoping to find ſome valuable articles left behind. Mr. King being the laſt on ſhore, and waiting for the return of the boat, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants crowded about him, and having prevailed on him to ſit down among them, expreſſed their regret at our ſeperation. It was even with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that they would ſuffer him to depart. He was, indeed, highly eſteemed among them, as will appear from the following relation.</p>
                     <p>Having had, while we were in the bay, the command of the party on ſhore, he became more acquainted with the natives, and they with him, than thoſe who were required to be on board. He experienced great kindneſs and civility from the inhabitants in general, but the friendſhip ſhewn by the prieſts was conſtant and unbounded.</p>
                     <p>He was anxious to conciliate their eſteem: in which he ſo happily ſucceeded, that, when they were acquainted with the time of our departure,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:030274_1008_0FE575389CD0B968"/>
he was urged to remain behind, and received overtures of the moſt flattering kind. When he endeavoured to excuſe himſelf, by alledging, that Captain Cook would not permit it, they propoſed to conduct him to the mountains, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal him till the departure of the ſhips. On Mr. King's aſſuring them, that the Captain would not ſail without him, the king and Kaoo repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Captain Cook, (whom they ſuppoſed to be his father) formally requeſting that he might be ſuffered to remain behind. The Commodore, unwilling to give a poſitive refuſal, to a propoſal ſo generouſly intended, aſſured them, that he could not then part with him; but he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither the next year, when he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to oblige them.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 4th of February, early in the morning, we unmoored, and the Reſolution and Diſcovery ſailed out of the bay; attended by a vaſt number of canoes. It was Captain Cook's intention to finiſh the ſurvey of Owhyhee, before he went to the other iſlands, hoping to meet with a road more ſheltered than Karakakooa Bay; and, if he ſhould not ſucceed here, he meant to examine the ſouth-eaſt part of Mowee, where he had been informed, there was a moſt excellent harbour.</p>
                     <p>On the 5th, and the following, day, we had calm weather, and conſequently our progreſs was but ſlow. A great number of the natives fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:030274_1009_0FE574F9F0523D40"/>
us in their canoes; and Terreeoboo gave an additional proof of his eſteem for the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, by ſending after him a large preſent of hogs and vegetables.</p>
                     <p>Having a little breeze, in the night of the 5th of February, we made ſome progreſs to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and on the 6th, in the morning, we were abreaſt of a deep bay, which the natives call Toe-yah-yah. We flattered ourſelves with hopes of finding a commodious harbour in this bay, as we ſaw ſome fine ſtreams of water to the north-eaſt; and the whole appeared to be well ſhelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe obſervations ſeeming to tally with the accounts given us by Koah, who now accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Captain Cook, the Maſter was ſent in the pinnace, with Koah as his guide, to obſerve and examine the bay; Koah having firſt altered his name, out of compliment to us, to that of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannee.</p>
                     <p>The weather became gloomy in the afternoon, and ſuch violent guſts of wind blew off the land, that we were obliged to take in all the ſails, and bring too, under the mizen-ſtay-ſail. The canoes all left us as ſoon as the gale began; and Mr. Bligh, on his return, preſerved an old woman and two men from drowning, whoſe canoes had been overſet in the ſtorm. We had ſeveral wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men remaining on board, whom the natives, in their hurry to depart, had left to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="unknown:030274_1010_0FE5753A239CED98"/>Mr. Bligh reported, that he had landed at a village on the north ſide of the bay, where he was ſhewn ſome wells of water, that would not, by any means, anſwer our purpoſe; that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further into the bay; where, inſtead of meeting with good anchorage, he found the ſhores were low, and a flat bed of coral rocks extended a long the coaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upwards of a mile from the land; the depth of water, on the outſide, being twenty fathoms. During this ſurvey, Britannee had contrived to ſlip away, being, perhaps, afraid of returning, as his information had proved erroneous.</p>
                     <p>The weather became more moderate in the evening, and we again made ſail; but it blew ſo violently about midnight, as to ſplit the fore and main-top-ſails. We bent freſh ſails in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 7th, and had a light breeze, and fair weather. Being now about four or five leagues from the ſhore, and the weather very unſettled, the canoes would not venture off, ſo that our gueſts were under the neceſſity of remaining with us, though much againſt their inclination; for they were all exceedingly ſea-ſick, and many of them had left their infants on ſhore.</p>
                     <p>Though the weather continued ſqually, we ſtood in for the land in the afternoon; and, being within three leagues of it, we ſaw two men in a canoe, paddling towards us. We naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that they had been driven off the ſhore,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030274_1011_0FE574FBE0807AF8"/>
by the late violent gale; and ſtopped the ſhip's way, in order to take them in. They were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted with fatigue, that had not one of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives on board jumped into the canoe to their aſſiſtance, they would hardly have been able to fix it to the rope thrown out for that purpoſe. With difficulty, however, we got them up the ſhip's ſide, together with a child about four years of age, which had been laſhed under the thwarts of the canoe with only its head above the water. They informed us, that they had quitted the land the morning before, ſince which time they had not had food or water. Proviſion was given them with the uſual precautions, and the child entruſted to the care of one of the women; and, the next morning, they were all perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                     <p>A gale of wind coming on at midnight, we were obliged to double reef the top-ſails. At day-break, on the 8th, we found that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt had again given way; the fiſhes being ſprung and the parts ſo very defective, as to make it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to unſtep the maſt. Captain Cook, for ſome time, heſitated, whether he ſhould return to Karakakooa, or take the chance of finding a harbour in the iſlands to leeward. The bay was not ſo commodious, but that a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might probably be met with, either for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the maſts, or procuring refreſhment, the latter of which, it was imagined, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030274_1012_0FE5753BA8867748"/>
of Karakakooa had lately been pretty well drained of. It was, on the other hand, conſidered as an unprudent ſtep, to leave a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable good harbour, which once loſt, could not be regained, for the mere poſſibility of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a better, eſpecially as the failure of ſuch a contingency might have deprived us of any reſource.</p>
                     <p>We ſtood on towards the land, to give the natives on ſhore an opportunity of releaſing their friends on board; and about noon, when we were within a mile of the ſhore, ſeveral canoes came off to us, but ſo loaded with people, that no room could be found for any of our gueſts; the pinnace was therefore hoiſted out to land them; and the maſter who commanded it, was inſtructed to examine the ſouth coaſts of the bay for water, but returned without ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Variable winds, and a ſtrong current to the northward, retarded our progreſs in our return; and, in the evening of the 9th, about eight o'clock, it blew very hard from the ſouth-eaſt, which occaſioned us to cloſe reef the top-ſails. Early in the morning of the 10th, in a heavy ſquall, we found ourſelves cloſe in with the breakers, to the northward of the weſt point of Owhyhee. We had juſt room to avoid them, and fired ſeveral guns to alarm the Diſcovery, and apprize her of the danger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="unknown:030274_1013_0FE575002480ECC8"/>The weather, in the forenoon, was more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and a few canoes ventured to come off to us, when thoſe on board them informed us, that much miſchief had been occaſioned by the late ſtorms, and that a great many canoes had been loſt. We kept beating to windward the remainder of the day; and, in the evening, were within a mile of the bay; but we ſtood off and on till day-light the next morning, when we anchored in our old ſtation.</p>

                     <p>THE whole of the 11th, and part of the 12th of February, we were engaged in getting out the foremaſt, and conveying it on ſhore. Not only the head of the maſt had ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed damage, but the heel was become exceedingly rotten, having a very large hole in the middle of it. Several days being probably required to make
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030274_1015_0FE575024D679078"/>
the neceſſary repairs, Meſſieurs King and Baily got the obſervatory on ſhore, and pitched their tents on the <hi>morai,</hi> guarded by a corporal, and ſix marines. A friendly intercourſe was renewed with the prieſts, who, for our greater ſecurity, <hi>tabooed</hi> the place with their wands as before. The ſail-makers alſo repaired to the ſhore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the damages, in their department, ſuſtained by the late heavy gales. They occupied an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, lent us by the prieſts, adjoining to the <hi>morai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our reception, on coming to anchor, was ſo different from what it had been upon our firſt arrival, that we were all aſtoniſhed: no ſhouts, buſtle, or confuſion, but a ſolitary deſerted bay, with hardly a canoe ſtiring. Their curioſity, indeed, might be ſuppoſed to be diminiſhed by this time; but the hoſpitable treatment we had continually been favoured with, and the friendly footing on which we parted, induced us to expect that, on our return, they would have received us with the greateſt demonſtrations of joy.</p>
                     <p>Various were our conjectures on the cauſe of this extraordinary appearance, when the whole myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery was unravelled by the return of a boat, which we had ſent on ſhore, bringing intelligence that Terreeoboo was abſent, and that the bay was <hi>taboo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> This account appeared very ſatisfactory to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us; but others were of opinion, that there was at this time, ſomething very ſuſpicious in the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030274_1016_0FE5757C1228C5F0"/>
behaviour of the natives; and that the <hi>taboo,</hi> or interdiction, on pretence of Terreeoboo's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, was artfully contrived, to give him time to conſult his chiefs in what manner we ſhould be treated. We never could aſcertain whether theſe ſuſpicions were well founded, or whether the natives had given a true account. It is probable, indeed, that our ſudden return, for which they could aſſign no apparent cauſe, might create a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms in them; yet the conduct of Terreeoboo, who, on his ſuppoſed arrival the next morning, immediately waited on Captain Cook; and the natives, from that moment, renewing their friendly intercourſe with us, ſeem to evince that they neither meant, nor apprehended, a different kind of conduct.</p>
                     <p>An account of another accident, ſimilar to this, may be mentioned in ſupport of this opinion, which happened to us on our firſt viſit, the day before the king's arrival. A native having ſold a hog on board the Reſolution, and received the price agreed on, Pareea, who ſaw the tranſaction, adviſed the ſeller not to part with his hog, without an advanced price. For his interference in this buſineſs, he was harſhly ſpoken to, and puſhed away; and as the <hi>taboo</hi> was ſoon laid on the bay, we, at firſt, ſuppoſed it to be in conſequence of the affront offered to the chief.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two circumſtances conſidered, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to draw any certain concluſion
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030274_1017_0FE57504374189D0"/>
from the action of a people, with whoſe language and cuſtoms we are ſo imperfectly acquainted. Some idea, however, may be formed of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties thoſe have to encounter, who in their intercourſe with theſe ſtrangers, are obliged to ſteer their courſe in the midſt of uncertainty, where the moſt ſerious conſequences may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by only imaginary offences. Whether theſe conjectures are erroneous or true, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that things were conducted in their uſual quiet courſe, till the 13th of February, in the afternoon.</p>
                     <p>At the approach of evening on that day, the commander of the Diſcovery's watering party, came to inform Mr. King, that ſeveral chiefs were aſſembled near the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ach, and were driving away the natives, who aſſiſted the ſailors in rolling the caſks to the ſhore: at the ſame time declaring, that their behaviour ſeemed exceedingly ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that he imagined they would give him ſome farther diſturbance. He ſent a marine with him, agreeably to his requeſt, but permitted him to take only his ſide-arms. The officer, in a ſhort time, returned, and informed Mr. King that the inhabitants had armed themſelves with ſtones, and were become tumultuous. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went himſelf to the ſpot, attended by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, with his muſket. At their approach the iſlanders threw away their ſtones, and, on Mr. King's application to ſome of the chiefs, the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030274_1018_0FE57594ACDD84F8"/>
mob was diſperſed. Every thing being now quiet, Mr. King went to meet Captain Cook, who was then coming on ſhore in the pinnace. He related to him what had recently happened, and received orders to fire a ball at the offenders, if they again behaved inſolently, and began to throw ſtones. In conſequence of theſe directions, Mr. King gave orders to the corporal, that the ſentinels pieces ſhould be loaded with ball, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſhot.</p>
                     <p>On our return to the tents, we heard a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fire of muſquets from the Diſcovery; which we perceived to be directed at a canoe, which was haſtening towards the ſhore, with one of our ſmall boats in purſuit of it. This firing, we concluded, was the conſequence of ſome theft, and Captain Cook ordered Mr. King to follow him with a marine armed, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſeize the people as they landed. They accordingly ran to the place, where the canoe was expected to come aſhore, but did not arrive in time; the people having quitted it, and fled into the country before their arrival.</p>
                     <p>At this time they did not know that the goods had been already reſtored; and thinking it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, from what they had obſerved, that they might be of importance, they did not chooſe to relinquiſh their endeavours to recover them; and having inquired of the natives what courſe the people had taken, they purſued them till it was
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030274_1019_0FE57505C0E79528"/>
almoſt dark, when they ſuppoſed themſelves to be about three miles from the tents; and, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iſlanders amuſed them with falſe informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their purſuit, they gave up the ſearch and returned.</p>
                     <p>A difference of a more ſerious nature had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened during their abſence. The officer, who had been diſpatched in the ſmall boat after the thieves, and who was returning on board, with the booty that had been reſtored, ſeeing Captain Cook and Mr. King engaged in the purſuit of the offenders, ſeized a canoe, which was drawn upon the ſhore. This canoe unfortunately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Pareea, who, at that inſtant arriving from on board of the Diſcovery, claimed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and proteſted his innocence. The officer perſiſted in detaining it, in which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the crew of the pinnace, then wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Captain Cook; in conſequence of which a ſcuffle enſued, and Pareea was knocked down by a violent blow on the head, with an oar. Several of the natives, who had hitherto been peaceable ſpectators, began now to attack our people with ſuch a ſhower of ſtones, that they were forced to a precipitate retreat, and ſwam off to a rock, at a conſiderable diſtance from the ſhore. The pinnace was plundered immediately by the natives, and would have been entirely demoliſhed, if Pareea had not interpoſed; who had not only recovered from his blow, but had
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030274_1020_0FE575930536C338"/>
alſo forgot it at the ſame inſtant. He ordered the crowd to diſperſe, and beckoned to our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come and take poſſeſſion of the pinnace; and afterwards aſſured them that he would uſe his influence to get the things reſtored <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ch had been taken out of it. After their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>parture, he followed them in his canoe, carrying them a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman's cap, and ſome other articles of the plunder; and, expreſſing much conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                     <p>Captain Cook, when theſe particulars were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him, was exceedingly concerned; and, when he and Mr. King were returning on board, he expreſſed his fears that theſe iſlanders would oblige him to purſue violent meaſures; adding they muſt not be permitted to ſuppoſe, that they have gained any advantage over us. It was then, however, too late to take any ſteps that evening; he therefore only gave orders that every iſlander ſhould be immediately turned out of the ſhip. This order being executed, Mr. King returned on ſhore; and the events of the day having much abated our former confidence in the natives, a double guard was poſted on the <hi>morai,</hi> with orders to let Mr. King know, if any
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030274_1021_0FE5750AA1140098"/>
men were ſeen lurking about the beach. At eleven o'clock, five of the natives were ſeen creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round the bottom of the <hi>morai</hi>; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with great caution, and, at laſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they were diſcovered, immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired out of ſight. About midnight one of them ventured himſelf near the obſervatory, when a ſentinel fired over him; on which they all fled, and we had no farther diſturbance during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the night.</p>
                     <p>At day-light the next morning Mr. King went on board the Reſolution, in order to get the time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper; and in his way thither was hailed by the Diſcovery, and received information that their cutter, had ſome time in the night been ſtolen, from the buoy, where it had been moored.</p>
                     <p>On Mr. King's arrival on board, he found the marines were arming themſelves, and Captain Cook buſied in loading his double-barrelled gun. Whilſt he was acquaintng him with what had happened in the night at the <hi>morai,</hi> he eagerly interrupted him, and informed him of the loſs of the Diſcovery's cutter, and the preparations he was making to recover it. It was his uſual prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in all the iſlands of this ocean, when any thing of conſequence had been ſtolen from him, by ſome ſtratagem, to get the king, or ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Erees,</hi> on board; where he detained them as hoſtages, till the property was reſtored. This method having hitherto proved ſucceſsful, he
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030274_1022_0FE5757D9A0164F8"/>
meant to adopt on the preſent occaſion; and gave orders to ſtop every canoe that ſhould attempt to leave the bay; reſolving to ſeize and deſtroy them if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>utter could not be recovered by peaceable means. In purſuance of which, the boats of both ſhips, properly manned and armed, were ſtation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acroſs the bay; and before Mr. King quitted the ſhip, ſome great guns were fired at two canoes, that were attempting to eſcape.</p>
                     <p>Between ſeven and eight o'clock Captain Cook and Mr. King quitted the ſhip together; the former in the pinnace, with Mr. Phillips, and nine marines; and the latter in the ſmall boat. The laſt orders Mr. King received from Captain Cook were to quiet the minds of the people, on our ſide of the bay, by the ſtrongeſt aſſurances that they ſhould not be injured; to keep his people together, and to be continually on his guard. Captain Cook and Mr. King then ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; the Captain going towards Kowrowa, where Terreeoboo reſided, and Mr. King proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the beach: his firſt buſineſs, when he arrived on ſhore, was to iſſue ſtrict orders to the marines to continue within the tent, to charge their muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets with ball, and not on any conſideration, to quit their arms. He then attended old Kaoo and the prieſts at their reſpective huts, and explained to them, as well as he was able, the reaſon of the hoſtile preparations, which had ſo exceedingly alarmed them. He found they were no ſtrangers
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030274_1023_0FE5750C8A89F3C8"/>
to the circumſtance of the cutter's being ſtolen, and aſſured them, that though the Commodore was not only reſolved to recover it, but alſo to puniſh, in the moſt exemplary manner, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the theft; yet that they, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the village, on our ſide, had not the leaſt occaſion to be alarmed, or to apprehend the leaſt danger from us. He importuned the prieſts to communicate this to the people, and intreat them not to entertain an idea of fear, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue peaceable and quiet. Kaoo interrogated Mr. King, with great emotion, if any harm was to happen to Terreeoboo? He aſſured him there was not; and both he and his brethren appeared much ſatisfied with this aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook having, in the mean time, called off the launch, from the north point of the bay, and taken it with him, landed at Kowrowa, with tile lieutenant and nine marines. He proceeded immediately into the village, where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully received; the people, as uſual, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating themſelves before him, and making their accuſtomed offerings of ſmall hogs. Perceiving that his deſign was not ſuſpected, his next ſtep was, to inquire for the king, and the two boys, his ſons, who had been almoſt continually his gueſts on board the Reſolution. The boys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returned with the natives, who had been ſearching for them, and immediately conducted Captain Cook to the habitation where Terreeoboo
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:030274_1024_0FE57551494C8228"/>
had ſlept. The old man had juſt awoke; and after ſome converſation reſpecting the loſs of the cutter, from which the Commodore was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was not in any wiſe privy to it, he invited him to accompany him, and ſpend the day on board the Reſolution. The king accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the invitation, and roſe immediately to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him.</p>
                     <p>Every thing had now a proſperous appearance; the two boys were already in the pinnace, and the reſt of the party approaching the water ſide, when a woman, named Kanee-kabareea the mother of the boys, and one of Terreeoboo's favourite wives, followed him, beſeeching him, with tears and entreaties, not to venture to go on board. Two chiefs, who came with her, took hold of him, and inſiſted he ſhould proceed no farther, obliged him to ſit down. The iſlanders, now collecting in vaſt numbers along the ſhore, who had probably been alarmed by the diſcharging of the great guns, and the hoſtile appearances in the bay, gathered together round Captain Cook and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeoboo. Thus ſituated, the lieutenant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, perceiving that his men were huddled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the croud, and conſequently unable to uſe their arms, if there ſhould appear to be a neceſſity for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> propoſed to Captain Cook, to draw them up along the rocks, cloſe to the edge of the water. The populace making way for them to paſs, the lieutenant drew them up in a
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030274_1025_0FE5750E11400BD0"/>
line; within about thirty yards of the place where Terreeoboo was ſitting,</p>
                     <p>The old king continued, all this time, on the ground, bearing the moſt viſible marks of terror and dejection in his countenance. Captain Cook, unwilling to abandon the object which occaſioned him to come on ſhore, urged him moſt earneſtly to proceed: whilſt, on the other hand, if the king expreſſed any inclination to follow him, the chiefs who ſurrounded him, interpoſed; at firſt they had recourſe to prayers and entreaties, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to force and violence, and even inſiſted on his remaining on ſhore. Captain Cook, at length, perceiving that the alarm had ſpread too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and that there was not a probability of getting him off without much bloodſhed, gave up the point; at the ſame time obſerving, to Mr. Phillips, that to compel him to go on board, would probably occaſion the loſs of many of the lives of the inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding this enterprize had now fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was abandoned by Captain Cook, yet it did not appear that his perſon was in the leaſt degree of danger, till an accident happened, which occaſioned a fatal turn to the affair. The boats, ſtationed acroſs the bay, having fired at ſome canoes, for attempting to get out, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately had killed one of their principal chiefs. Intelligence of his death arrived at the village where Captain Cook then was, juſt as he had
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030274_1026_0FE5754A00D58FE0"/>
parted from the king, and was proceeding with great deliberation towards the ſhore. The fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it immediately occaſioned, was but too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous; the women and children were inſtantly ſent away, and the men were ſoon clad in their war-mats, and armed with ſpears and ſtones. One of the natives having provided himſelf with a ſtone, and a long iron ſpike (called by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives a <hi>pahooa</hi>) advanced towards the Captain, flouriſhing his weapon in defiance, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to throw the ſtone. The Captain requeſted him to deſiſt; the iſlander repeated his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, he was highly provoked, and fired a load of ſmall ſhot at him. The man was ſhielded in his war-mat, which the ſhot could not penetrate; his firing therefore, ſerved only to irritate and encourage them. Vollies of ſtones were thrown at the marines; and one of the <hi>erees</hi> attempted the life of Mr. Phillips with his <hi>pahooa;</hi> but, not ſucceeding in the attempt, he received from him a blow with the butt end of his piece. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook immediately diſcharged his ſecond bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, loaded with ball, and killed one of the moſt violent of the aſſailants. A general attack with ſtones ſucceeded, which was followed on our part, by a diſcharge of muſquetry, not only from the marines, but alſo from the people in the boats. The natives, to our great aſtoniſhment, received our fire with great firmneſs; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving time for the marines to charge again,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030274_1027_0FE5751017374C60"/>
they ruſhed in upon them with dreadful ſhouts and yells. What followed was a ſcene of horror and confuſion, which can more eaſily be conceived than properly related.<note n="*" place="bottom">Though a view of Karakakoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e of our moſt excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander! After a life, diſtinguiſhed by ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful enterprize, his death can hardly be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned premature; ſince he lived to accompliſh the great work for which he ſeemed particularly deſigned; being rather removed from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the acquiſition of glory. How ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely his loſs was lamented, by thoſe who owed their ſecurity to his ſkill and conduct, and every conſolation, to his tenderneſs and humanity, it is impoſſible to deſcribe; and the taſk would be equally difficult to repreſent the horror, dejection, and diſmay, which followed ſo dreadful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected a cataſtrophe. Let us, therefore, turn from ſo calamitous a ſcene, to the pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his character and virtues, and pay our laſt juſt tribute to the memory of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, in a ſhort hiſtory of his life, and public ſervices.</p>
                     <p>Captain James Cook was born in the year 1727, near Whitby, in Yorkſhire; and at an early age, commenced an apprenticeſhip to a ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in a neighbouring village. This not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030274_1030_0FE57517AF10FEF8"/>
ſuitable to his natural propenſity, he ſoon quitted the counter, and contracted for nine years, with the maſter of a veſſel in the coal trade. In 1755, at the commencement of the war, he entered into the king's ſervice on board the Eagle, then Commanded by Captain Hamer, and afterwards by Sir Hugh Palliſer, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his merit, advanced him to the quarter deck.</p>
                     <p>In 1758, we find him maſter of the Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, Lord Colville's flag ſhip, who then commanded the ſquadron, ſtationed on the coaſt of America. Here, as he has frequently declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he firſt read Euclid, and cloſely applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſtudy of the mathematics, with the aſſiſtance of only a few books, and his own induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. While he thus found means to cultivate his underſtanding, and ſupply, in ſome degree, the deficiencies of an early education, he was engaged in moſt of the active ſcenes of war in America. At the ſiege of Quebec, he was intruſted by Sir Charles Saunders with the execution of important ſervices, in the naval department. He was the pilot who conducted the boats to the attack of Montmorency; managed the embarkation to the heights of Abraham; and pointed out, by buoys, how the large ſhips might proceed with ſecurity up the river. The manner in which he acquitted himſelf in theſe important ſervices, procured him the eſteem and friendſhip of Sir Charles Saunders
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:030274_1031_0FE57566EB3B2380"/>
and Lord Colville, who continued his zealous patrons during the remainder of their lives. At the concluſion of the war, he was appointed, through the intereſt of Lord Colville and Sir Hugh Palliſer, to make a ſurvey of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the coaſts of Newfoundland. He was thus employed till the year 1767, when Sir Edward Hawke appointed him to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an expedition to the South Seas; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make an obſervation of the tranſit of <hi>Venus,</hi> and to proſecute diſcoveries in that part of the globe.</p>
                     <p>His ſervices, ſince this period, are too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known to require enumeration. His repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation has proportionably advanced beyond the effect of panegyric. He ſeems, indeed, to have been peculiarly qualified for this ſpecies of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. His natural inclination, the nature of his ſervices, and indefatigable application, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to compleat him for it: ſo that he acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a degree of profeſſional knowledge, as can fall to the lot of very few.</p>
                     <p>His frame and conſtitution were robuſt, and ſuch as enabled him to undergo the ſevereſt hardſhips. When neceſſity required it, he could feed, with ſatisfaction, upon the coarſeſt and moſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful food; and he ſubmitted to every kind of ſelf-denial with the greateſt compoſure and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Nor were the qualities of his mind leſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous than thoſe of his body. His underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030274_1032_0FE57519872E93C8"/>
was ſtrong and perſpicuous: his judgment, eſpecially in thoſe matters in which he was more particularly engaged, quick and ſure. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and operations, were the natural reſult of a great original genius. His valour was cool, deliberate, and determined; accompanied with a moſt aſtoniſhing preſence of mind on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of danger. His manners were plain, eaſy, and unaffected. His temper, it muſt be admitted, was too much ſubject to haſtineſs and paſſion; but this ſhould be forgotten, when it is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this diſpoſition was the moſt benevolent and humane.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are a few traits or outlines of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Captain Cook; but its diſtinguiſhing fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was, the moſt unremitting perſeverance to accompliſh his deſign, in oppoſition to dangers, difficulties and hardſhips. During all his long and tedious voyages, his eagerneſs and activity were never in the leaſt abated. No alluring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement could detain him for a moment; even thoſe intervals of recreation, which unavoidably occured in the courſe of our ſervices, and were joyfully embraced by many of his officers, were ſubmitted to, by him with impatience, if they could not be made ſubſervient to the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual proſecution of his deſigns.</p>
                     <p>It would be unneceſſary to recapitulate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which theſe qualities were diſplayed. The reſult of his ſervices, however, we ſhall juſt
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:030274_1033_0FE5759FDD85E838"/>
touch upon, under two principal heads, viz. geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy and navigation, placing each in a ſeparate and diſtinct point of view.</p>
                     <p>No ſcience, it is preſumed, has ever received greater additions from the labours of one man, than geography has done from thoſe of Captain Cook. In his firſt voyage, he diſcovered the Society Iſlands; aſcertained the inſularity of New Zealand; and diſcovered the ſtraits which ſeparate the two iſlands, and are called after his name. He explored the eaſtern coaſt of New Holland, till then unknown; an extent of twenty-ſeven degrees of latitude, and upwards of two thouſand miles.</p>
                     <p>He gave, in his ſecond expedition, a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the great problem of a ſouthern conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; having ſo completely traverſed that hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, as not to leave a poſſibility of its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unleſs it is ſo near the pole, as to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of navigation. New Caledonia, the largeſt iſland in the Southern Pacific, except New Zealand, was diſcovered in this voyage. Alſo the iſland of Georgia; and an unknown coaſt, which the Captain named Sandwich land; and having twice viſited the tropical ſeas, he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the ſituations of the old, and made ſeveral new diſcoveries.</p>
                     <p>His third and laſt voyage, however, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed above the reſt, by the extent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of its diſcoveries. Not to mention the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030274_1034_0FE5751B0E04D248"/>
ſeveral ſmaller iſlands in the Southern Pacific, he diſcovered the group, called the Sandwich iſlands; which, on account of their ſituation and produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may perhaps become an object of more co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>equence than any other diſcovery in the South Sea. He explored what had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unknown of the weſtern coaſt of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, an extent of three thouſand ſeven, hundred miles; aſcertained the proximity of the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents of Aſia and America; ſailed through the ſtraits between them, and ſurveyed the coaſts on each ſide, ſo far as to be ſatisfied of the imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability of a paſſage in that hemiſphere, from the Atlantic into the Pacific Ocean, by an eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern or weſtern courſe. He has, in ſhort, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the hydrography of the habitable globe, if we except the Japaneſe Archipelago, and the ſea of Amur, which are ſtill imperfectly known by Europeans.</p>
                     <p>His ſervices, as a navigator, are not leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and meritorious. The method which he invented, and ſo ſucceſsfully put in practice, of preſerving the health (and conſequently the lives) of ſeamen, will tranſmit his name to future ages, as a friend and benefactor to mankind.</p>
                     <p>It is well known among thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in naval hiſtory, that the advantages which have been ſought, through the medium of long ſea-voyages, have always been purchaſed at a dear rate. That dreadful diſorder which is
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030274_1035_0FE575F7426F2F28"/>
pecullar to this ſervire, muſt, without exerciſing an unwarrantable degree of tyranny over our ſeamen, have been an inſuperable obſtacle to our enterprizes. It was reſerved for Captain Cook to convince the world, that voyages might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to three or even four years, in unknown regions, and under every change of climate, without affecting the health in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and even without diminiſhing the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of life.

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have before obſerved that four of the marines, who accompanied Captain Cook, were killed by the natives on the ſpot. The others, with their lieutenant, Mr. Phillips, threw themſelves into the ſea, and made their eſcape, being protected by a ſmart fire from the boats.
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030274_1037_0FE5754458BCA440"/>
On this occaſion, a ſtriking inſtance of gallant behaviour, and of affection for his men, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played by Mr. Phillips; for he had ſcarcely got into the boat, when ſeeing one of the marines, who was not a very expert ſwimmer, ſtruggling in the water, and in danger of being taken by the iſlanders, he inſtantly leaped into the ſea to his aſſiſtance, though conſiderably wounded himſelf; and after receiving a blow on his head from a ſtone, which had almoſt ſent him to the bottom, he caught the marine by the hair, and brought him off in ſafety. Our people for ſome time kept up a conſtant fire from the boats (which during the whole tranſaction, were at no greater diſtance from the land than twenty yards), in order to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford their unfortunate companions, if any of them ſhould ſtill remain alive, an opportunity of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their eſcape. Theſe continued efforts, ſeconded by a few guns, that were at the ſame time fired from the Reſolution, having at length compelled the enemy to retire, a ſmall boat, manned by five midſhipmen, pulled towards the ſhore where they perceived the bodies lying on the ground, without any ſigns of life. However, they judged it dangerous to attempt to bring them off with ſo inconſiderable a force; and their ammunition being nearly conſumed, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the ſhips, leaving the bodies in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the natives, together with ten ſtand of arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="208" facs="unknown:030274_1038_0FE57523D0089D40"/>When the general conſternation, which the news of this misfortune had diffuſed throughout the whole company of both ſhips, had in ſome degree ſubſided, their attention was called to the party of the <hi>morai,</hi> where the maſt and ſails were on ſhore, guarded by only ſix marines. It is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to deſcribe the emotions that agitated the minds of Mr. King and his attendants, at this ſtation, during the time in which theſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences had happened, at the other ſide of the bay. Being at the diſtance only of a mile from the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of Kowrowa, they could diſtinctly perceive a vaſt multitude of people collected on the ſpot where Captain Cook had juſt before landed. They heard the firing of the muſquets, and obſerved an uncommon buſtle and agitation among the crowd. They afterwards ſaw the iſlanders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, the boats retiring from the ſhore, and paſſing and repaſſing, with great ſtillneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhips. Mr. King's heart ſoon miſgave him on this occaſion. Where ſo valuable a life was concerned, he could not avoid being alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch new and threatening appearances. Beſides this, he knew that Captain Cook, from a long ſeries of ſucceſs, in his tranſactions with the natives of this ocean, had acquired a degree of confidence, which might, in ſome ill-fated mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, put him too much off his guard; and Mr. King now ſaw all the dangers to which that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might lead, without deriving much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030274_1039_0FE57552D1B29038"/>
from the conſideration of the experience which had given riſe to it. His firſt care, on hearing the report of the muſquets, was to aſſure the iſlanders, conſiderable numbers of whom were aſſembled round the wall of our conſecrated field, and ſeemed at a loſs how to account for what they had heard and ſeen, that they ſhould meet with no moleſtation; and that, at all events, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to continue on peaceable terms with them.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King and his attendants remained in this ſituation, till the boats had returned on board, when Captain Clerke perceiving, by means of his teleſcope, that our party was ſurrounded by the natives, who, he thought, deſigned to attack them, ordered two four-pounders to be fired at the iſlanders. Theſe guns, though well aimed, did no miſchief; but they gave the natives a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof of their powerful effects. A cocoa-nut-tree, under which ſome of them were ſitting, was broken in the middle by one of the balls; and the other ſhivered a rock, which ſtood in an exact line with them. As Mr. King had, juſt before, given them the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of their ſafety, he was extremely mortified at this act of hoſtility, and, to prevent its being repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſtantly diſpatched a boat to inform Captain Clerke, that he was, at preſent, on the moſt amicable terms with the iſlanders, and that, if any future occaſion ſhould ariſe for changing his conduct towards them, he would hoiſt a jack, as
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030274_1040_0FE5752594BF0518"/>
a ſignal for Captain Clerke to afford him his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Mr King waited the return of the boat with the greateſt impatience; and after remaining for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour, under the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt anxiety and ſuſpence, his fears were at length confirmed, by the arrivel of Mr. Bligh, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſtrike the tents immediately, and to ſend on board the ſails, that were repairing. At the ſame inſtant, Kaireekeea having alſo received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the death of Captain Cook, from a native who had arrived from the other ſide of the bay, approached Mr. King, with great dejection and ſorrow in his countenance, inquiring whether it was true.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of the party, at this time, was highly critical and important. Not only their own lives, but the iſſue of the expedition, and the return of at leaſt one of the ſhips, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the ſame common danger. They had the maſt of the Reſolution, and the greater part of the ſails, on ſhore, protected by only half a dozen marines. The loſs of theſe would have been irreparable; and though the iſlanders had not as yet teſtified the ſmalleſt diſpoſition to moleſt the party, it was difficult to anſwer for the alteration, which the intelligence of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action at Kowrowa might produce. Mr. King therefore thought proper to diſſemble his belief of the death of Captain Cook, and to deſire
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030274_1041_0FE575AA26520F00"/>
Kaireekeea to diſcourage the report; apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that either the fear of our reſentment, or the ſucceſsful example of their countrymen, might perhaps lead them to ſeize the favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, which at this time preſented itſelf, of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us a ſecond blow. He, at the ſame time, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to bring old Kaoo, and the other prieſts, into a large houſe adjoining to the <hi>morai,</hi> partly from a regard to their ſafety, in caſe it ſhould have been found neceſſary to have recourſe to violent meaſures; and partly from a deſire of having him near our people, in order to make uſe of his authority with the natives, if it could be inſtrumental in maintaining peace.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King having ſtationed the marines on the top of the <hi>morai,</hi> which formed a ſtrong and advantageous poſt, intruſted the command to Mr. Bligh, who received the moſt poſitive directions to act ſolely on the defenſive, went on board the Diſcovery, in order to confer with Captain Clerke on the dangerous ſituation of our affairs. He had no ſooner left the ſpot, than the iſlanders began to annoy our people with ſtones; and juſt after he had reached the ſhip, he heard the firing of the marines. He therefore haſtily returned on ſhore, where he found affairs growing every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more alarming. The natives were provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms, and putting on their mats; and their numbers augmented very faſt. He alſo obſerved ſeveral large bodies advancing towards our party
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030274_1042_0FE575271A679138"/>
along the cliff, by which the village of Kakooa is ſeparated from the north ſide of the bay, where Kowrowa is ſituate.</p>
                     <p>They at firſt attacked our people with ſtones from behind the walls of their incloſures, and meeting with no reſiſtance, they ſoon became more daring. A few courageous fellows, having crept along the beach, under cover of the rocks, ſuddenly preſented themſelves at the foot of the <hi>morai,</hi> with an intention of ſtorming it on the ſide next the ſea, which was its only acceſſible part; and they were not diſlodged before they had ſtood a conſiderable quantity of ſhot, and had ſeen one of their number fall.</p>
                     <p>The courage of one of theſe aſſailants deſerves to be recorded. Having returned with a view of carrying off his companion, amidſt the fire of our whole party, he received a wound, which obliged him to quit the body, and retire; but, a few minutes afterwards, he again made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and receiving another wound, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of retreating a ſecond time. At that moment Mr. King arrived at the <hi>morai,</hi> and ſaw this man return a third time, faint from the loſs of blood and fatigue. Being informed of what had happened, he forbad the ſoldiers to fire; and the iſlander was ſuffered to carry off his friend, which he was juſt able to accompliſh; and then fell down himſelf, and breathed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="unknown:030274_1043_0FE575EEF74AA5D8"/>A ſtrong reinforcement from both ſhips having landed about this time, the natives retreated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their walls; which affording Mr. King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the prieſts, he ſent one of them to exert his endeavours to bring his countrymen to ſome terms, and to propoſe to them, that if they would deſiſt from throwing ſtones, he would not allow our men to fire. This truce was agreed to, and our people were ſuffered to launch the maſt, and carry off the ſails, aſtronomical inſtruments, &amp;c. without moleſtation. As ſoon as our party had quitted the <hi>morai,</hi> the iſlanders took poſſeſſion of it, and ſome of them threw a few ſtones, which, however did no miſchief.</p>
                     <p>Between eleven and twelve o'clock, Mr. King arrived on board the Diſcovery, where he found that no deciſive plan had been adopted for the regulation of our future proceedings. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Captain Cook's body, and the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the boat, were the objects, which, on all hands, we agreed to inſiſt on; and Mr. King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it as his opinion, that ſome vigorous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſhould be put in execution, if the demand of them ſhould not be inſtantly complied with.</p>
                     <p>Though it may juſtly be ſuppoſed that Mr. King's feelings, on the death of a beloved and reſpected friend, had ſome ſhare in this opinion, yet there were doubtleſs other reaſons, and thoſe, of the moſt ſerious nature that had ſome weight with him. The confidence which the ſucceſs or
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030274_1044_0FE5752D436C7ED0"/>
the natives in killing our Commander, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to leave the ſhore, muſt naturally have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired; and the advantage, however inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which they had gained over us the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, would, he had on doubt, excite them to make farther dangerous attempts; and the more particularly, as they had no great reaſon, from what they had hitherto obſerved, to dread the effects of our fire-arms. This kind of weapon, indeed, contrary to the expectation of us all, had produced in them no ſigns of terror. On our ſide, ſuch was the condition of our veſſels, and the ſtate of diſcipline among us, that, had a vigorous attack been made on us, during the night, the conſequences might perhaps have been highly diſagreeable. Mr. King was ſupported, in theſe apprehenſions, by the opinon of the greater part of the officers on board; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeemed to him more likely to encourage the iſlanders to make the attempt, than the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of our being inclined to an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they could only impute to weakneſs, or fear.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand it was urged, in favour of more conciliatory meaſures, that the miſchief was already done, and was irreparable! that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, by reaſon of their former friendſhip and kindneſs, had a ſtrong claim to our regard; and the more particularly, as the late calamitous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident did not appear to have taken its riſe from
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030274_1045_0FE575E2F93A7788"/>
any premeditated deſign; that, on the part of Terreeoboo, his ignorance of the theft, his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to accompany Captain Cook on board the Reſolution, and his having actually ſent his two ſons into the pinnace, muſt reſcue his character, in this reſpect, from the ſmalleſt degree of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; that the behaviour of his woman, and the chiefs, might eaſily be accounted for, from the apprehenſions occaſioned in their minds by the armed force, with which Captain Cook landed, and the hoſtile preparations in the bay; appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ſo unſuitable to the confidence and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in which both parties had hitherto lived, that the arming of the iſlanders was manifeſtly with a deſign to reſiſt the attempt, which they had ſome reaſon to expect would be made, to carry off their ſovereign by force, and was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be expected from a people who had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable affection for their chiefs.</p>
                     <p>To theſe dictates of humanity, other motives of a prudential kind were added; that we were in want of a ſupply of water, and other refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that the Reſolution's foremaſt would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſeven or eight days work, before it could be ſtepped; that the ſpring was advancing very faſt; and that the ſpeedy proſecution of our next ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to the northward, ought now to be our ſole object; and that, therefore, to engage in a vindictive conteſt with the natives, might not only ſubject us to the imputation of needleſs
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030274_1046_0FE575F1190A85C0"/>
cruelty, but would require great delay in the equipment of our ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Captain Clerke concurred in this latter opinion; and though Mr. King was convinced, that an early and vigorous diſplay of our reſentment would have more effectually anſwered every object both of prudence and humanity, he was, upon the whole, not ſorry, that the meaſures he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended were rejected. For though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous behaviour of the iſlanders, and their ſubſequent oppoſition to our neceſſary occupations on ſhore, ariſing, moſt probably, from a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction of our lenity, obliged us at laſt to have recourſe to violence in our own defence; yet he was not certain, that the circumſtances of the caſe would, in the opinion of the generality of people, have juſtified the uſe of force, on our part, in the firſt inſtance. Cautionary ſeverity is ever invidious, and the rigour of a preventive meaſure, when it is the moſt ſucceſsful, leaves its expediency the leaſt apparent.</p>
                     <p>While we were thus engaged, in concerting ſome plan for our future operations, a very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous concourſe of the natives ſtill kept poſſeſſion of the ſhore; and ſome of them, coining off in canoes, approached within piſtol-ſhot of the ſhips, and inſulted us by various marks of defiance and contempt. It was extremely difficult to reſtrain the ſeamen from the uſe of their arms on theſe occaſions; but, as pacific meaſures had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:030274_1047_0FE575A1628376E8"/>
on, the canoes were allowed to return unmoleſted.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King was now ordered to proceed towards the ſhore, with the boats of both ſhips, well manned and armed, with a view of bringing the iſlanders to a parley, and of obtaining, if poſſible, a conferrence with ſome of the <hi>Erees.</hi> If he ſhould ſucceed in this attempt, he was to demand the dead bodies, and particularly that of Captain Cook; to threaten them, in caſe of a refuſal, with our reſentment; but by no means to fire, unleſs attacked, and not to go aſhore on any account whatever. Theſe inſtructions were delivered to Mr. King before the whole party, in the moſt poſitive manner.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King and his detatchment left the ſhips about four o'clock in the afternoon; and, as they approached the ſhore, they perceived every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of a hoſtile reception. The natives were all in motion; the women and children retiring; the men arming themſelves with long ſpears and daggers, and putting on their war-mats. It alſo appeared, that, ſince the morning, they had thrown up breaſt-works of ſtone along the beach, where Captain Cook had landed; in expectation, perhaps, of an attack at that place.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as our party were within reach, the iſlanders began to throw ſtones at them with ſlings, but without doing any miſchief. Mr. King concluded, from theſe appearances, that all
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:030274_1048_0FE5752F4D17AB58"/>
attempts to bring them to a parley would be in effectual, unleſs he gave them ſome ground for mutual confidence: he therefore ordered the armed boats to ſtop, and advanced alone, in the ſmall boat, holding in his hand a white flag; the meaning of which, from an uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erſal ſhout of joy from the natives, he had the ſatisfaction to find was immediately underſtood. The women in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly returned from the ſide of the hill, whither they had retired; the men threw of their mats and all ſeated themſelves together by the ſea-ſide, extending their arms, and inviting Mr. King to land.</p>
                     <p>Though ſuch behaviour ſeemed expreſſive of a friendly diſpoſition, he could not avoid entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſpicions of its ſincerity. But when he ſaw Koah, with extraordinary boldneſs and aſſurance ſwimming off towards the boat, with a white flag in his hand, he thought proper to return this mark of confidence, and accordingly received him into the boat, though he was armed; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which did not contribute to leſſen Mr. King's ſuſpicions. He had, indeed, long har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured an unfavourable opinion of Koah. The prieſts had always repreſented him as a perſon of a malicious temper, and no friend to us; and the repeated detections of his fraud and treachery, had convinced us of the truth of their aſſertions. Beſides, the melancholy tranſactions of the morn-part,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030274_1049_0FE575F8C80A8090"/>
inſpired Mr. King with the utmoſt horror at finding himſelf ſo near him; and as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him, with ſeigned tears, and embraced him, Mr. King was ſo diſtruſtful of his intentions that he took hold of the point of the <hi>phaooa,</hi> which the chief held in his hand and turned it from him. He informed the iſlander, that he had come to demand the body of Captain Cook and to declare war againſt the natives, unleſs it was reſtored without delay. Koah aſſured him that this ſhould be done as ſoon as poſſible, and that he would go himſelf for that purpoſe; and after requeſting a piece of iron of Mr. King, with marks of great aſſurance, he leaped into the water, and ſwam aſhore, calling out to his countrymen, that we were all friends again.</p>
                     <p>Our people waited with great anxiety, near an hour, for his return. During this interval, the other boats had approached ſo near the ſhore, that the men who were in them entered into converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a party of the iſlanders, at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; by whom they were informed, that the Captains body had been cut to pieces, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up the country; but of this circumſtance, Mr. King was not apprized till his return to the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King now began to expreſs ſome degree of impatience at Koah's delay; upon which the chiefs preſſed him exceedingly to land; aſſuring him, that, if he would go in perſon to Terreeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:030274_1050_0FE575D405AB6A80"/>
When they found they could not prevail on Mr. King to go aſhore, they endeavoured, on pretence of converſing with him with greater caſe, to decoy his boat among ſome rocks, where they might have had it in their power to ſeparate him from the other boats. It was eaſy to ſee through theſe artifices, and he was, therefore, very deſirous of breaking off all communication with them, when a chief approached, who had particulary attached himſelf to Captain Clerke, and the officers of the Diſcovery, on board which ſhip he had ſailed, when we laſt quitted the bay, intending to take his paſſage to the iſland of Mowee. He ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> came from Terreeoboo, to acquaint our people that the body was carried up the country, but that it ſhould be brought back the following morning. There appeared much ſincerity in his manner; and being aſked, if he uttered a falſehood, he hooked together his two fore fingers, which is here underſtood as the ſign of veracity, in the uſe of which theſe iſlanders are very ſcrupulous.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King being now at a loſs how to proceed, ſent Mr. Vancouver to inform Captain Clerke of all that had paſſed; that it was his opinion, the natives did not intend to keep their word with us; and, far from being grieved at what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, were, on the contrary, inſpired with great confidence on account of their late ſucceſs, and ſought only to gain time, till they could plan ſome
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:030274_1051_0FE575E4849687B0"/>
ſcheme for getting our people into their power. Mr. Vancouver came back with orders for Mr. King to return on board, after giving the iſlanders to underſtand, that if the body was not reſtored the next morning, the town ſhould be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>When they perceived our party retiring, they endeavoured to provoke them by the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous and inſulting geſtures. Several of our people ſaid, they could diſtinguiſh ſome of the natives parading about in the cloaths which had belonged to our unhappy countrymen, and among them, an <hi>Eree</hi> brandiſhing Captain Cook's hanger and a woman holding the ſcabbard.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of Mr. King's report to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke, of what he ſuppoſed to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent temper and diſpoſition of the inhabitants, the moſt effectual methods were taken to guard againſt any attack they might make during the night. The boats were moored with top-chains; additional ſentinels were ſtationed in each of our ſhips; and guard-boats were directed to row round them, in order to prevent the iſlanders from cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cables.</p>
                     <p>In the night, we ſaw a vaſt number of lights on the hills, which induced ſome of us to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that they were removing their effects far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up into the country, in conſequence of our menaces. But it ſeems more probable, that they were kindled at the ſacrifices that were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on account of the war, in which they ſuppoſed
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:030274_1052_0FE575E153B91A50"/>
themſelves likely to be engaged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, perhaps, the bodies of our ſlain countrymen were, at that time, burning. We afterwards obſerved fires of the ſame kind, as we paſſed the iſland of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotoi; and which, according to the information we received from ſome of the natives then on board, were made on account of a war they had declared againſt a neighbouring iſland. This agrees with what we learned among the Friendly and Society Iſles, that, previous to any hoſtile ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, the chiefs always endeavoured to animate the courage of the people, by feaſts and rejoicings in the night.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed the night without any diſturbance, except from the howlings and lamentations which were heard on ſhore. Early the next morning, (Monday the 15th) Koah came along-ſide the Reſolution, with a ſmall pig, and ſome cloth, which he deſired permiſſion to preſent to Mr. King. We have already mentioned, that this officer was ſuppoſed, by the iſlanders, to be the ſon of Captain Cook; and as the latter had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuffered them to believe it, Mr. King was probably conſidered as the chief after his death. As ſoon as he came on deck, he interrogated Koah with regard to the body; and, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning evaſive anſwers, refuſed to accept his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; and was on the point of diſmiſſing him with expreſſions of anger and reſentment, had not Captain Clerke, with a view of keeping up
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030274_1053_0FE57597252381E0"/>
the appearance of friendſhip, judged it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that he ſhould be treated with the cuſtomary reſpect.</p>
                     <p>This chief came frequently to us in the courſe of the morning, with ſome trifling preſent or other; and as we always obſerved him eyeing every part of the ſhip with a great degree of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, we took care he ſhould ſee we were well prepared for our defence.</p>
                     <p>He was extremely urgent both with Captain Clerke and Mr. King to go on ſhore, imputing the detention of the bodies to the other chiefs; and aſſuring thoſe gentlemen, that every thing might be adjuſted to their ſatisfaction, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal interview with the king. However, they did not think it prudent to comply with Koah's requeſt; and, indeed, a fact came afterwards to their knowledge, which proved his want of vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. For, they were informed, that, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the action in which Captain Cook had loſt his life, Terreeoboo had retired to a cave in the ſteep part of a mountain, that hangs over the bay, which was acceſſible only by means of ropes, and where he continued for ſeveral days, having his proviſions let down to him by cords</p>
                     <p>After the departure of Koah from the ſhips, we obſerved that his countrymen, who had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by day-break, in vaſt crowds on the ſhore, flocked around him with great eagerneſs on his landing, as if they wiſhed to learn the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030274_1054_0FE575A71AC9B638"/>
he had gained, and what ſteps were to be taken in conſequence of it. It is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that they expected we ſhould attempt to put our threats in execution; and they appeared fully determined to ſtand their ground. During the whole morning, we heard conchs blowing in various parts of the coaſt; large parties were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived marching over the hills; and, upon the whole, appearances were ſo alarming, that we carried out a ſtream anchor, for the purpoſe of hauling the ſhip abreaſt of the town, in caſe of an attack; and boats were ſtationed off the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern point of the bay, in order to prevent a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize from the natives in that quarter.</p>
                     <p>The warlike poſture in which they appeared at preſent, and the breach of their engagement to reſtore the bodies of the ſlain, occaſioned freſh debates among us, concerning the meaſures which ſhould now be purſued. It was at length deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that nothing ſhould be permitted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the repair of the Reſolution's maſt, and the preparations for our departure; but that we ſhould, nevertheleſs, continue our negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the reſtoration of the bodies of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen.</p>
                     <p>The greater part of the day was employed in getting the fore-maſt in a proper ſituation on deck, that the carpenters might work upon it and alſo in making the requiſite alteration in the commiſſions of the officers. The chief command
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:030274_1055_0FE575B6400A77B0"/>
of the expedition having devolved on Captain Clerke, he removed on board the Reſolution, promoted Lieutenant Gore to the rank of Captain of the Diſcovery, appointed Meſſrs King and Williamſon firſt and ſecond Lieutenants of the Reſolution, and nominated Mr. Harvey, a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman, who had accompanied Captain Cook during his two laſt voyages, to fill the vacant lieutenancy. During the whole day, we ſuſtained no interruption from the iſlanders; and, in the evening, the launch was moored with a top-chain, and guard-boats ſtationed round each of the ſhips as before.</p>
                     <p>About eight o'clock, it being exceedingly dark, we heard a canoe paddling towards the ſhip; and it was no ſooner perceived, than both the ſentinels on deck fired into it. There were two of the natives in this canoe, who immediately roared out "<hi>Tinnee,</hi>" (which was their method of pronouncing Mr. King's name), and ſaid they were friends, and had ſomething with them which belonged to Captain Cook. When they came on board, they threw themſelves at the feet of our officers, and ſeemed to be extremely terrified. It fortunately happened, that neither of them was hurt, notwithſtanding the ball of both pieces had gone through the canoe.</p>
                     <p>One of them was the perſon, who has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, under the appellation of the <hi>taboo</hi> man, who conſtantly attended Captain Cook
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030274_1056_0FE575A89F66BDF8"/>
with the particular ceremonies we have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; and who, though a man of diſtinction in the iſland, could ſcarcely be prevented from performing for him the moſt humiliating offices of a menial ſervant. After bewailing, with many tears, the loſs of the <hi>Orono,</hi> he informed us, that he had brought a part of his body. He then gave us a ſmall bundle which he brought under his arm; and it is impoſſible to deſcribe the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with which we were ſeized, upon finding in it, a piece of human fleſh, of the weight of about nine or ten pounds. This, he ſaid, was all that now remained of the body; that the reſt had been cut in pieces, and burnt; but that the head, and all the bones, except thoſe which belonged to the trunk, were in the poſſeſſion of Terreeoboo and the other chiefs; that what we ſaw had been allotted to Kaoo, the chief of the prieſts, for the purpoſe of being uſed in ſome religious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and that he had ſent it as a teſtimony of his innocence, and of his attachment to us.</p>
                     <p>We had now an opportunity of learning whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were cannibals; and we did not neglect to avail ourſelves of it. We firſt endeavoured, by ſeveral indirect queſtions, but to each of them apart, to gain information reſpecting the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the other bodies had been treated and diſpoſed of; and, finding them very conſtant in one account, that, after the fleſh had been cut off, the whole of it was burnt; we at laſt put the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030274_1057_0FE575B7CA70E9A0"/>
direct queſtion, whether they had not fed on ſome of it? they immediately teſtified as much horror at ſuch an idea, as any European would have done; and aſked, whether that was the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice among us. They afterwards aſked us, with great earneſtneſs, and with an appearance of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, when the <hi>Orono</hi> would come again? and how he would treat them on his return; the ſame inquiry was often made in the ſequel by others; and this idea is conſiſtent with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tenour of their conduct towards him, which indicated, that they conſidered him as a being of a ſuperior ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>Though we preſſed our two friendly viſitants to continue on board till the next morning, we could not prevail upon them. They informed us, that, if this tranſaction ſhould come to the knowledge of the king, or any of the other <hi>Erees,</hi> it might be attended with the moſt fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to their whole ſociety; to prevent which, they had been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the neceſſity of coming to us in the dark; and the ſame precaution, they ſaid, would be requiſite in returning on ſhore. They further told us, that the chiefs were eager to take revenge on us for the death of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; and particularly cautioned us againſt truſting Koah, who, they aſſured us, was our implacable enemy; and ardently longed for an opportunity of fighting us, to which the blowing
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030274_1058_0FE575E60BC23D18"/>
of the conchs, that we had heard in the morning was intended as a challenge.</p>
                     <p>It alſo appeared from the information of theſe men, that ſeventeen of their countrymen were ſlain, in the firſt action, at the village of Kowro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa, five of whom were chiefs; and that Kaneena and his brother, our particular friends, were of that number. Eight, they ſaid, had loſt their lives at the obſervatory; three of whom likewiſe were perſons of the firſt diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>The two natives left us about eleven o'clock, and took the precaution to deſire, that one of or guard-boats might attend them, till they had paſſed the Diſcovery, leſt they ſhould again be fired upon, which by alarming their countrymen on ſhore, might expoſe them to the danger of detection. This requeſt was readily complied with, and we had the ſatisfaction to find, that they reached the land ſafe and undiſcovered.</p>
                     <p>We heard, during the remainder of this night, the ſame loud lamentations, as in the preceding one. Early the following morning, we received a viſit from Koah. Mr. King was piqued at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that notwithſtanding the moſt glaring marks of treachery in his conduct, and the poſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our friends the prieſts, he ſhould ſtill be ſuffered to carry on the ſame farce, and to make us at leaſt appear the dupes of his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy. Our ſituation was, indeed; become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely aukward and unpromiſing; none of the
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030274_1059_0FE548D7DA70E008"/>
purpoſes for which this pacific plan of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had been adopted, having hitherto been, in any reſpect, promoted by it. No ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer had been given to our demands; we did not ſeem to have made any progreſs towards a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with the natives; they ſtill remained on the ſhore in hoſtile poſtures, as if determined to oppoſe any endeavours we might make to go aſhore; and yet it was become abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to attempt landing, as the completing our ſtock of water would not admit of any longer delay.</p>
                     <p>We muſt remark, however, in juſtice to the conduct of Captain Clerke, that it was highly probable, from the great numbers of the iſlanders, and from the reſolution with which they ſeemed to expect our approach, that an attack could not have been made without danger; and that the loſs of even a very few men, might have been ſeverely felt by us, during the remainder of our voyage; whereas the delaying to put our menaces into execution, though, on the one hand, it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed their opinion of our valour, had the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of occaſioning them to diſperſe on the other. For this day, about twelve o'clock, upon finding that we perſiſted, in our inactivity, great bodies of them, after blowing their conchs, and uſing every method of defiance, marched off, over the hills, and never made their appearance afterwards. Thoſe, however, who remained, were not the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030274_1060_0FE5759E55407DA0"/>
leſs daring and preſumptuous. One of them had the inſolence to come within muſquet-ſhot, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Reſolution, and, after throwing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtones at us, waved over his head the hat which had belonged to Captain Cook, while his countrymen a-ſhore were exulting and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his audacity.</p>
                     <p>Our people were highly enraged at this inſult, and coming in a body on the quarter deck, begged they might no longer be obliged to put up with ſuch reiterated provocations, and requeſted Mr. King to endeavour to obtain permiſſion for them, from Captain Clerke, to take advantage of the firſt fair occaſion of avenging the death of their much-lamented Commander. On Mr. King's acquainting the Captain with what was paſſing, he ordered ſome great guns to be fired at the iſlanders on ſhore; and promiſed the crew, that, if they ſhould be moleſted at the watering-place, the next day, they ſhould then be permitted to chaſtiſe them.</p>
                     <p>Before we could bring our guns to bear, the natives had ſuſpected our intentions, from the buſtle and agitation they obſerved in the ſhip; and had retired behind their houſes and walls. We were conſequently obliged to fire, in ſome degree at random; notwithſtanding which, our ſhot produced all the effects we could deſire. For, in a ſhort time afterwards, we perceived Koah paddling towards us, with the greateſt haſte;
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030274_1061_0FE575B4B292B378"/>
and when he arrived, we learned, that ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had loſt their lives, and among the reſt Maiha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiha, a principal <hi>Eree</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">In the language of theſe iſlands, the word <hi>matee</hi> is generally uſed either to expreſs killing or wounding; and we were afterwards inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this chief had only received a trifling blow on the face, from a ſtone which had been ſtruck by one of our balls.</note>, nearly related to Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeoboo.</p>
                     <p>Not long after Koah's arrival, two boys ſwam off from the <hi>morai</hi> towards our veſſels, each armed with a long ſpear; and after, they had approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pretty near, they began, in a very ſolemn manner, to chant a ſong; the ſubject of which, from their frequently mentioning the word <hi>Orono,</hi> and pointing to the village where Captain Cook had been ſlain, we concluded to be the late ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous occurrence. Having ſung for near a quarter of an hour in a plaintive ſtrain, during all which time they continued in the water, they repaired on board the Diſcovery, and delivered up their ſpears; and, after remaining there a ſhort time, returned on ſhore. We could never learn who ſent them, or what was the object of this ceremony.</p>
                     <p>During the night we took the uſual precautions for the ſecurity of the ſhips; and, as ſoon as it was dark, the two natives, who had viſited us the preceeding evening, came off to us again. They aſſured us, that though the effects of our
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030274_1062_0FE5759CAF779C80"/>
great guns, this afternoon, had greatly alarmed the chiefs, they had by no means relinquiſhed their hoſtile intentions, and they adviſed us to be on our guard.</p>
                     <p>The following morning, which was the 17th, the boats of both ſhips were diſpatched aſhore to procure water; and the Diſcovery was warped cloſe to the beach, in order to protect the perſons employed in that ſervice. We ſoon found that the intelligence which had been ſent us by the prieſts, was not deſtitute of foundation, and that the iſlanders were determined to neglect no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of annoying us, when it could be done without much hazard.</p>
                     <p>The villages, throughout this whole cluſter of iſlands, are, for the moſt part, ſituated near the ſea; and the adjacent ground is encloſed with ſtone walls, of the height of about three feet. Theſe, we at firſt ſuppoſed, were deſigned for the diviſion of property; but we now diſcovered that they ſerved for a defence againſt invaſion, for which purpoſe they were, perhaps, chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. They conſiſt of looſe ſtones, and the natives are very dexterous in ſhifting them, with great quickneſs, to ſuch particular ſituations, as the direction of the attack may occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. In the ſides of the mountain, that ſtands near the bay, they have likewiſe holes, or caves, of conſiderable depth; whoſe entrance is ſecured by a fence of a ſimilar kind. From behind both
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030274_1063_0FE5753D8847CBF8"/>
theſe ſtations, the iſlanders perpetually harraſſed our watering party with ſtones; nor could the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable force we had on ſhore, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of muſquets, compel them to retreat.</p>
                     <p>Thus oppoſed, our people were ſo occupied in attending to their own ſafety, that, during the whole forenoon, they filled only one ton of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It being therefore impoſſible for them to perform this ſervice, till their aſſailants were driven to a greater diſtance, the Diſcovery was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to diſlodge the enemy with her great guns; which being accompliſhed by means of a few diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, the men landed without moleſtation.</p>
                     <p>The natives, however, made their appearance again, ſoon afterwards, in their uſual method of attack; and it was now deemed abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to burn down ſome ſtraggling huts, near the wall behind which they had ſheltered themſelves. In executing the orders that were given for that purpoſe, our people were hurried into acts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary devaſtation and cruelty. Some allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ought certainly to be made for their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the repeated inſults, and contemptuous behaviour of the iſlanders, and for their natural deſire of revenging the death of their beloved and reſpected Commander. But, at the ſame time, their conduct ſtrongly evinced, that the greateſt precaution is requiſite in truſting, even for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the diſcretionary uſe of arms, in the hands of private ſoldiers, or ſeamen, on ſuch occaſions.
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:030274_1064_0FE575AC20517BB8"/>
The ſtrictneſs of diſcipline, and the habits of obedience, by which their force is kept directed to ſuitable objects, lead them to conceive, that whenever they have the power, they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a right to perform. Actual diſobedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt the only crime for which they expect to receive puniſhment, they are apt to conſider it as the ſole meaſure of right and wrong; and hence they are too ready to conclude, that what they can do with impunity, they may alſo do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with honour and juſtice; ſo that the feelings of humanity, and that generoſity towards an unreſiſting enemy, which, at other times, is a ſtriking diſtinction of brave men, become but feeble reſtraints to the exerciſe of violence, when ſet in oppoſition to the deſire they naturally have of ſhewing their own power and independence.</p>
                     <p>It has been before obſerved, that directions had been given to burn only a few ſtraggling houſes, which afforded ſhelter to the iſlanders. We were therefore greatly ſurpriſed on perceiving the whole village in flames; and before a boat, that was ſent to ſtop the progreſs of the miſchief, could reach the land, the habitations of our old and conſtant friends, the prieſts, were all on fire. Mr. King had, therefore, great reaſon to lament the illneſs that confined him on board this day. The prieſts had always been under his protection; and, unfortunately, the officers then on duty having ſeldom been on ſhore at the <hi>morai,</hi> were but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:030274_1065_0FE575DA06CFAED0"/>
acquainted with the circumſtances of the place. Had he been preſent himſelf, he might in all probability, have been the means of preſerving their little ſociety from deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>In eſcaping from the flames, ſeveral of the inhabitants were ſhot; and our people cut off the heads of two of them, and brought them on board. The fate of one unhappy native was much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by all of us. As he was repairing to the well for water, he was ſhot at by one of the marines. The ball happened to ſtrike his cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſh, which he inſtantly threw from him, and ran off. He was purſued into one of the caves above-mentioned, and no lion could have defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his den with greater bravery and fierceneſs; till at length, after he had found means to keep two of our people at bay for a conſiderable time, he expired, covered with wounds. This accident firſt brought us acquainted with the uſe to which theſe caverns are applied.</p>
                     <p>About this time a man, advanced in years, was taken priſoner, bound, and conveyed on board the Reſolution, in the ſame boat, with the heads of his two countrymen. We never obſerved horror ſo ſtrongly portrayed, as in the face of this perſon, nor ſo violent a tranſition to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate joy, as when he was untied, and given to underſtand, that he might depart in ſafety. He ſhewed us that he was not deficient in gratitude,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:030274_1066_0FE575C3030AAFC0"/>
as he not only often returned afterwards with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of proviſions, but, alſo did us other ſervices.</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time after the deſtruction of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, we ſaw coming down the hill, a man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by fifteen or twenty boys, who held in their hands pieces of white cloth, plantains, green boughs, &amp;c. It happened that this pacific embaſſy, as ſoon as they were within reach, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the fire of a party of our men. This, however, did not deter them from continuing their proceſſion, and the officer on duty came up in time, to prevent a ſecond diſcharge. As they made a nearer approach, the principal perſon proved to be our friend Kaireckeea, who had fled when our people firſt ſet fire to the village, and had now returned, and expreſſed his deſire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent on board the Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>On his arrival we found him extremely thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and grave. We endeavoured to convince him of the neceſſity there was of ſetting fire to the village, by which his houſe, and thoſe of his brethren were unintentionally deſtroyed. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with us on our ingratitude and want of friendſhip; and indeed, it was not till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment, that we knew the whole extent of the injury that had been done them. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that, confiding in the promiſes Mr. King had made them, and as well as in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances they had received from the men, who had brought us ſome of Captain Cook's remains,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:030274_1067_0FE575CF4AB5CE58"/>
they had not removed their effects back into the country, as the other inhabitants had done, but had put every valuable article of their own, as well as what they had collected from us, into a houſe adjoining the <hi>morai,</hi> where they had the mortification to ſee it all ſet on fire by our people. He had, on coming on board, perceived the heads of his two countrymen lying on deck, at which he was greatly ſhocked, and earneſtly deſired that they might be thrown over-board. This requeſt, by the directions of Captain Clerke, was immediately complied with.</p>
                     <p>Our watering party returned on board in the evening, having ſuſtained no farther interruption. We paſſed a diſagreeable night; the cries and lamentations we heard from the ſhore being far more dreadful than ever. Our only conſolation, on this occaſion, aroſe from the hopes that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of ſuch ſeverities might not be requiſite in future.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that amidſt all theſe diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, the female natives who were on board, did not offer to leave us, or diſcover any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions either for themſelves or their friends on ſhore. They appeared, indeed, ſo perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, that ſome of them, who were on deck when the village was in flames, ſeemed to admire the ſpectacle, and frequently exclaimed, that it was <hi>maitai,</hi> or very fine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="238" facs="unknown:030274_1068_0FE575C9A08823E8"/>The next morning the treacherous Koah came off to the ſhips, as uſual. There being no longer any neceſſity for keeping terms with him, Mr. King was allowed to treat him as he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. When he approached the ſide of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, ſinging a ſong, and offering a hog, and ſome plantains, to Mr. King, the latter ordered him to keep off, and cautioned him never to make his appearance again without the bones of Captain Cook, leſt his life ſhould pay the forfeit of his repeated breach of faith. He did not appear much mortified with this unwelcome reception, but immediately returned on ſhore, and joined a party of his countrymen, who were throwing ſtones at our waterers. The body of the young man, who had been killed the preceding day, was found this morning lying at the entrance of the cave; and a mat was thrown over him by ſome of our people; ſoon after which they ſaw ſeveral of the natives carrying him off on their ſhoulders, and could hear them chanting, as they marched, a mournful ſong.</p>
                     <p>The iſlanders being at length convinced that it was not the want of ability to chaſtize them which had induced us at firſt to tolerate their provocations, deſiſted from moleſting our people; and, towards the evening, a chief, named Eap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po, who had ſeldom viſited us, but whom we knew to be a man of the firſt diſtinction, came with preſence from Terreeoboo to ſue for peace.

Theſe preſents were accepted, and the chief was diſmiſſed with the following anſwer: That no peace would be granted, till the remains of Captain Cook ſhould be reſtored.</p>
                     <p>We were informed by Eappo, that the fleſh of all the bones of our people who had been ſlain, as well as the bones of the trunks, had been burnt; that the limb-bones of the marines had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed among the inferior chiefs; and that the remains of Captain Cook had been diſpoſed of as follows: the head to a great <hi>Erce</hi> called Kahoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opeou; the hair to Maiha-maiha; and the arms, legs, and thighs, to Terreeoboo. After it was dark, many of the natives came off with various ſorts of vegetables; and we alſo received from Kaireekeea two large preſents of the ſame articles.</p>
                     <p>The next day was principally employed in ſending and receiving the meſſages that paſſed between Captain Clerke and the old king. Eappo was very urgent, that one of our officers ſhould go on ſhore; and offered to remain on board, in the mean time, as an hoſtage. This requeſt, however, was not complied with; and he left us with a promiſe of bringing the bones the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day. Our watering party, at the beach, did not meet with the leaſt oppoſition from the iſlanders; who, notwithſtanding our cautious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, again ventured themſelves amongſt us without any marks of diffidence or apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="240" facs="unknown:030274_1070_0FE57572F542BC30"/>On Saturday the 20th, early in the morning we had the ſatisfaction of getting the fore-maſt ſtepped. This operation was attended with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difficulty, and ſome danger, our ropes being ſo extremely rotten, that the purchaſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times gave way.</p>
                     <p>This morning, between the hours of ten and eleven, we ſaw a numerous body of the natives deſcending the hill, which is over the beach, in a ſort of proceſſion, each man carrying on his ſhoulders two or three ſugar-canes, and ſome bread-fruit, plantains, and taro, in his hand. They were preceeded by two drummers, who, when they reached the water-ſide, ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a white flag, and began beating their drums, while thoſe who had followed them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, one by one, and depoſited the preſents they had brought with them; after which they retired in the ſame order. Soon afterwards Eappo appeared in his long feathered cloak, bearing ſomething with great ſolemnity in his hands; and having ſtationed himſelf on a rock, he made ſigns that a boat ſhould be ſent him.</p>
                     <p>Captain Clerke, ſuppoſing that the chief had brought the bones of Captain Cook (which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, proved to be the caſe), went himſelf in the pinnace to receive them, and ordered Mr. King to attend him in the cutter. When they arrived at the beach, Eappo, entering the pinnace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the bones to Captain Clerke, wrapped up
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:030274_1071_0FE57546776D06A0"/>
in a great quantity of fine new cloth, and covered with a ſpotted cloak of black and white feathers. He afterwards attended our gentlemen to the Reſolution, but could not be prevailed on to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them on board; being, perhaps, from a ſenſe of decency, unwilling to be preſent at the opening of the parcel.</p>
                     <p>We found, in this bundle, both the hands of Captain Cook entire, which were well known to us from a ſcar on one of them, that divided the fore finger from the thumb, the whole length of the metacarpal bone; the ſkull, but with the ſcalp ſeparated from it, and the bones of the face wanting; the ſcalp, with the ears adhering to it, and the hair upon it cut ſhort; the bones of both the arms, with the ſkin of the fore-arms hanging to them; the bones of the thighs and legs joined together, but without the feet. The ligaments of the joints were obſerved to be entire; and the whole ſhewed ſufficient marks of having been in the fire, except the hands, which had the fleſh remaining upon them, and were cut in ſeveral places, and crammed with ſalt, moſt probably with a view of preſerving them. The ſkull was free from any fracture, but the ſcalp had a cut in the back part of it. The lower jaw and feet, which were wanting, had been ſeized, as Eappo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, by different <hi>Erees;</hi> and he alſo told us, that Terreeoboo was uſing every means to recover them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="242" facs="unknown:030274_1072_0FE5757A81DA8490"/>Eappo, and the king's ſon, came on board the next morning, and brought with them not only the remaining bones of Captain Cook, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the barrels of his gun, his ſhoes, and ſome other trifles which had belonged to him. Eappo aſſured us, that Terreeoboo, Maiha-maiha, and himſelf were extremely deſirous of peace; that they had given us the moſt convincing proofs of it; and that they had been prevented from giving it ſooner by the other chiefs, many of whom were ſtill diſaffected to us. He lamented, with the moſt lively ſorrow, the death of ſix chiefs, who had been killed by our people; ſome of whom, he ſaid, were among our beſt friends. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that the cutter had been taken away by Pareea's people, probably in revenge for the blow that he had received; and that it had been broken up the following day. The arms of the marines, which we had alſo demanded, had been carried off, he ſaid, by the populace, and were irrecoverable.</p>
                     <p>Nothing now remained, but to perform the laſt ſolemn offices to our excellent Commander. Eappo was diſmiſſed with orders to <hi>taboo</hi> all the bay; and, in the afternoon, the bones having been depoſited in a coffin, the funeral ſervice was read over them, and they were committed to the deep with the uſual military honours. Our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, on this mournful occaſion, are more eaſy to be conceived than expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="243" facs="unknown:030274_1073_0FE5754802529AC0"/>During the morning of the 22d, not a canoe was ſeen in the bay. The <hi>taboo,</hi> which Eappo, at our deſire, had laid on it the preceding day, not being yet taken off. At length that chief came off to us. We aſſured him, that we were now perfectly ſatisfied; and that, as the <hi>Orono</hi> was buried, all remembrance of the late unhappy tranſactions was buried with him. We after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards requeſted him to take off the <hi>taboo,</hi> and to make it known, that the iſlanders might bring proviſions to us as uſual. The ſhips were ſoon ſurrounded with canoes, and many of the <hi>Erees</hi> came on board, expreſſing their grief at what had happened, and their ſatisfaction at our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. Several of our friends, who did not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us with a viſit, ſent preſents of large hogs, and other proviſions. Among the reſt, the old treacherous Koah came off to us, but we refuſed him admittance.</p>
                     <p>As we were now prepared for putting to ſea, Captain Clerke imagining, that, if the intelligence of our proceedings ſhould reach the iſlands to leeward before us, it might have a bad effect, gave orders, that the ſhips ſhould be unmoored. About eight in the evening, we diſmiſſed all the natives; and Eappo, and the friendly Kaireekeea, took their leave of us in a very affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We immediately weighed anchor, and ſtood out of Karakakooa bay. The iſlanders were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in great numbers on the ſhore; and, as
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:030274_1074_0FE5757F79CBA398"/>
we paſſed along, received our laſt farewels, with every mark of good-will and affection.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HAVING cleared the land about ten, we ſtood to the northward, with a view of ſearching for an harbour, which the natives had often mentioned, on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wee.
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:030274_1075_0FE57587B8586870"/>
We found ourſelves, the next morning, driven to leeward, by a ſwell from the north-eaſt; and a freſh gale, from the ſame quarter, drove us ſtill farther to the weſtward. At mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night we tacked, and ſtood four hours to the ſouth, to keep clear of the land; and, at day-break, on the 24th, we were ſtanding towards a ſmall barren iſland, named Tahoorow, about ſeven miles ſouth-weſt of Mowee.</p>
                     <p>Giving up all proſpect of making a cloſer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the ſouth-eaſt parts of Mowee, we bore away, and kept along the ſouth-eaſt ſide of Tahoorowa. Steering cloſe round its weſtern extremity, in order to fetch the weſt ſide of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wee, we ſuddenly ſhoaled our water, and ſaw the ſea breaking on ſome rocks, almoſt right a-head. We then kept away about a league and a half, and again ſteered to the northward; when we ſtood for a paſſage between Mowee, and an iſland named Ranai. In the afternoon, the weather was calm, with light airs from the weſt. We ſtood to the north-north-weſt; but, obſerving a ſhoal about ſunſet, and the weather being unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, we ſtood towards the ſouth.</p>
                     <p>We had now paſſed the ſouth-weſt ſide of this iſland, without being able to approach the ſhore. This ſide of the iſland forms the ſame diſtant view as the north-eaſt, as ſeen when we returned from the north, in November, 1778; the hilly parts, connected by low flat iſthmus, having,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:030274_1076_0FE57589412A1C68"/>
at the firſt view, the appearance of two ſeparate iſlands. This deceptive appearance continued till we were within about ten leagues of the coaſt, which, bending a great way inward, formed a capacious bay. The weſternmoſt point off which the ſhoal runs that we have juſt now mentioned, is rendered remarkable by a ſmall hillock; ſouth of which is a fine ſandy bay; and on the ſhore, are ſeveral huts, with plenty of cocoa-trees about them.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of the day, ſeveral of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives viſited us, and brought proviſions with them. We preſently diſcovered, that they had heard of our unfortunate diſaſter at Owhyhee. They were extremely anxious to be informed of the particulars, from a woman who had hid herſelf in the Reſolution, in order to obtain a paſſage to Atooi; making particular enquiries about Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reea, and ſome other chiefs; and ſeeming much agitated at the death of Kaneena, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But, in whatever light this buſineſs might have been repreſented by the woman, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no bad effect in their behaviour, which was civil and obliging to an extreme.</p>
                     <p>During the night, the weather varied continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but on the 25th, in the morning, the wind being at eaſt, we ſteered along the ſouth ſide of Ranai, till almoſt noon, when we had baffling winds and calms till the evening; after which, we had a light eaſterly breeze, and ſteered for the
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:030274_1077_0FE575687118B1F0"/>
weſt of Morotoi. The current, which had ſet from the north-eaſt, ever ſince we left Karaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kooa bay, changed its direction, in the courſe of this day, to the ſouth-eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The wind was again variable during the night; but, early in the morning of the 26th, it ſettled at eaſt; blowing ſo freſh, as to oblige us to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-reef the top-ſails. At ſeven, we opened a ſmall bay, diſtant about two leagues, having a fine ſandy beach; but not perceiving any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of freſh water, we endeavoured to get to the windward of Woahoo, an iſland which we had ſeen in January, 1778. We ſaw the land about two in the afternoon, bearing weſt by north at the diſtance of about eight leagues. We tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſoon as it was dark, and again bore away at day-light on the 27th. Between ten and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we were about a league of the ſhore, and near the middle of the north-eaſt ſide of the iſland.</p>
                     <p>To the northward, the coaſt conſiſts of detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hills, aſcending perpendicular from the ſea; the ſides being covered with wood, and the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies between them appearing to be fertile, and well cultivated. An extenſive bay was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſouthward, bounded, to the ſouth-eaſt, by a low point of land, covered with cocoa-nut trees; off which, an inſulated rock appeared, at the diſtance of a mile from the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="248" facs="unknown:030274_1078_0FE5754F59E2C138"/>The wind continuing to blow freſh, we were unwilling to entangle ourſelves with a lee-ſhore. Inſtead of attempting, therefore, to examine the bay, we hauled up and ſteered in the direction of the coaſt. At noon, we were about two leagues from the iſland, and a-breaſt of the north point of it. It is low and flat, having a reef ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off almoſt a mile and an half. Between the north point, and a head-land to the ſouth-weſt, the land bends inward, and ſeemed to promiſe a good road. We therefore ſteered along the ſhore, at about a mile diſtance. At two, we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by the ſight of a fine river, to anchor in thirteen fathoms water. In the afternoon, Mr. King attended the two Captains on ſhore, where few of the natives were to be ſeen, and thoſe principally women. The men, we were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were gone to Morotoi, to fight Tahyterree; but their chief, Perreeorance, remained behind, and would certainly attend us, as ſoon as he was informed of our arrival.</p>
                     <p>The water, to our great diſappointment, had a brackiſh taſte, for about two hundred yards up the river; beyond which, however, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly freſh, and was a delightful ſtream. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up, we came to the conflux of two ſmall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, branching off to the right and left of a ſteep romantic mountain. The banks of the river, and all that we ſaw of Woahoo, are in fine cultivation, and full of villages; the face of the
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:030274_1079_0FE57554DEA99FE8"/>
country being alſo remarkably beautiful and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque.</p>
                     <p>As it would have been a laborious buſineſs to have watered at this place, Mr. King was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to ſearch about the coaſt to leeward; but, being unable to land, on account of a reef of coral, which extended along the ſhore, Captain Clerke reſolved to proceed immediately to Atooi. In the morning, about eight, we weighed, and ſtood to the northward; and, on the 28th, at day-light, we bore away for that iſland, and were in ſight of it by noon. We were off its eaſtern extremity, which is a green flat point, about ſun-ſet.</p>
                     <p>It being dark, we did not venture to run for the road on the ſouth-weſt ſide, but ſpent the night in plying on and off, and anchored, at nine the next morning, in twenty-five fathoms water. In running down, from the ſouth-eaſt point of the iſland, we ſaw, in many places, the appearance of ſhoal water, at ſome diſtance from the land.</p>
                     <p>Being anchored in our old ſtation, ſeveral ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes came to viſit us; but it was very obſervable, that there was not that appearance of cordiality in their manner, and complacency in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, as when we ſaw them before. They had no ſooner got on board, but one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that we had communicated a diſorder to the women, which had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>lled many perſons of
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:030274_1080_0FE5756A80E8C9C0"/>
both ſexes. He, at that time, was afflicted with the venereal diſeaſe, and minutely deſcribed the various ſymptoms which had attended it. As no appearance of that diſorder had been obſerved amongſt them, on our firſt arrival, we were, it is to be feared, the authors of this irreparable miſchief.</p>
                     <p>The principal object in view, at this place, was to water the ſhips with as much expedition as poſſible; and Mr. King was ſent on ſhore in the afternoon, with the launch and pinnace, laden with caſks. He was accompanied by the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Reſolution, who was inſtructed to trade for ſome proviſions; and they were attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a guard of five marines. Multitudes of people were collected upon the beach, by whom, at firſt, we were kindly received; but, after we had landed the caſks, they began to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly troubleſome.</p>
                     <p>Knowing, from experience, how difficult a taſk it was to repreſs this diſpoſition, without the interpoſition of their chiefs, we were ſorry to be informed, that they were all at a diſtant part of the iſland. Indeed we both felt and lamented the want of their aſſiſtance; for we could hardly form a circle, as our practice uſually was, for the ſafety and convenience of the trading party. No ſooner had we taken this ſtep, and poſted marines to keep off the populace, than a man took hold of the bayonet belonging to one of the
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:030274_1081_0FE5756F3B106068"/>
ſoldier's muſquets, and endeavoured to wrench it forcibly from his hand. Mr. King immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately advanced towards them, when the native quitted his hold, and retired; but immediately returned, having a ſpear in one hand, and a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the other; and it was with difficulty that his countrymen could reſtrain him from engaging with the ſoldier. This affray was occaſioned by the native's having received, from the ſoldier, a ſlight prick with his bayonet, to induce him to keep without the line.</p>
                     <p>Our ſituation, at this time, required great management and circumſpection; Mr. King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly enjoined, that no one ſhould preſume to fire, or proceed to any other act of violence, without poſitive commands. Having given theſe inſtructions, he was ſummoned to the aſſiſtance of the watering party, where he found the natives in the ſame miſchievous diſpoſition. They had peremptorily demanded, for every caſk of water, a large hatchet; which not being complied with, they would not permit the ſailors to roll them to the boats.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as Mr. King had joined them, one of the natives approached him, with great inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and made the ſame demand. Mr. King told him, that, as a friend, he was welcome to a hatchet, but he certainly would carry off the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without paying for it; and inſtantly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pinnace men to proceed; at the ſame
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:030274_1082_0FE575BE09C37748"/>
time calling for three marines, from the trading party, to protect them.</p>
                     <p>This becoming ſpirit ſo far ſucceeded, as to prevent any daring attempt to interrupt us, but they ſtill perſevered in the moſt teaſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting behaviour. Some of them, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of aſſiſting the ſailors in rolling the caſks towards the ſhore, gave them a different direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; others ſtole the hats from off our people's heads, pulled them backward by the ſkirts of their clothes, and tripped up their heels; the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, during all this time, ſhouting and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a mixture of mockery and malice. They afterwards took an opportunity of ſtealing the cooper's bucket, and forcibly took away his bag. Their principal aim, however, was to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of the muſquets of the marines, who were continually complaining of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to force them from their hands. Though they, in general, preſerved a kind of deference and reſpect for Mr. King, yet they obliged him to contribute his ſhare towards their ſtock of plunder. One of them approached him, in a familiar manner, and diverted his attention, whilſt another ſeized his hanger, which he held careleſsly in his hand, and ran away with it.</p>
                     <p>Such inſolence was not to be repelled by force. Prudence dictated that we muſt patiently ſubmit to it; at the ſame time, guarding againſt its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as well as we were able. Mr. King was,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:030274_1083_0FE5758B26FEF8A0"/>
however, ſomewhat alarmed, on being ſoon after informed by the ſerjeant of marines, that, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly round, he ſaw a man behind him, armed with a dagger, in the poſition of ſtriking. Though he might, perhaps, be miſtaken, in this particular, our ſituation was truly critical and alarming; and the ſmalleſt error, or miſtake, on our part, might have been of fatal conſequences.</p>
                     <p>Our people being ſeparated into three ſmall parties; one filling caſks at the lake; another rolling them to the ſhore; and a third purchaſing proviſions; Mr. King had ſome intentions of collecting them together, in order to protect the performance of one duty at a time. But, on due reflection, he thought it more adviſeable to let them proceed as they had begun. If a real at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack had been made, even our whole force could have made but a poor reſiſtance. He thought, on the other hand, that ſuch a ſtep might operate to our diſadvantage, as being an evident token of our fears. Beſides, in the preſent caſe the crowd was kept divided, and many of them wholly occupied in bartering.</p>
                     <p>The principal cauſe of their not attacking us was, perhaps, their dread of the effects of our arms; and, as we appeared to place ſo much confidence in this advantage, as to oppoſe only five marines to ſuch a multitude of people, their ideas of our ſuperiority muſt have been greatly exalted. It was our buſineſs to cheriſh this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:030274_1084_0FE575B2DC745510"/>
and, it muſt ever be acknowledged, to the honour of the whole party, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any men to behave better, in order to ſtrengthen theſe impreſſions. Whatever could be conſidered as a jeſt, they received with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and good-nature; but, if they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any ſerious attempt, they oppoſed it with reſolute looks and menaces. At length, we ſo far ſucceeded, as to get all our caſks to the ſea-ſide, without any accident of conſequence.</p>
                     <p>While our people were getting the caſks into the launch, the inhabitants thinking they ſhould have no farther opportunity of plundering, grew more daring and inſolent. The ſerjeant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines luckily ſuggeſted to Mr. King, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſending off his party firſt into the boats, by which means the muſquets would be taken out of their reach; which, as above related, were the grand objects the iſlanders had in view: and, if they ſhould happen to attack us, the marines could more effectually defend us, than if they were on ſhore.</p>
                     <p>Every thing was now in the boats, and only Mr. King, Mr. Anderſon, the gunner, and a ſeaman of the boat's crew, remained on ſhore. The pinnace laying beyond the ſurf, which we were under a neceſſity of ſwimming through, Mr. King ordered the other two to make the beſt of their way to it, and told them he would follow them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="255" facs="unknown:030274_1085_0FE575CBDAD8ECC0"/>They both refuſed to comply with this order, and it became a matter of conteſt, who ſhould be the laſt on ſhore. Some haſty expreſſion, it ſeems Mr. King had juſt before made uſe of to the ſailor, which he conſidered as a reflection on his courage, and excited his reſentment; and the old gunner, as a point of honour was now ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conceived it to be his duty to take a part in it. In this whimſical ſituation, they, perhaps, might have long remained, had not the diſpute been ſettled by the ſtones, which began to fly plentifully about us, and by the exclamations of the people from the boats, begging us to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, as the natives were armed with clubs and ſpears, and purſuing us into the water. Mr. King arrived firſt at the pinnace, and, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Anderſon was ſo far behind, as not to be entirely out of danger, he ordered one muſquet to be fired; but in the hurry of executing his orders, the marines fired two. The natives im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ran away, leaving only one man and woman on the beach. The man attempted to riſe ſeveral times, but was not able, having been wounded in the groin. The iſlanders, in a ſhort time, returned; and, ſurrounding the wounded man, brandiſhed their ſpears at us, with an air of defiance; but, by the time we reached the ſhips, ſome perſons arrived which we ſuppoſed to be the chiefs, by whom they were all driven from the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="unknown:030274_1086_0FE575916857B688"/>Captain Clerke, during our abſence, had been under terrible apprehenſions for our ſafety; which had been conſiderably increaſed by his miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome of the natives, with whom he had had ſome converſation on board. The name of Captain Cook being frequently mentioned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with circumſtantial deſcriptions of death and deſtruction, he concluded that they had received intelligence of the unfortunate events at Owhyhee, to which they alluded. But they were only endeavouring to make him underſtand, that wars had ariſen on account of the goats, which Captain Cook had left at Oneeheow, and that the poor goats had been ſlaughtered, during the conteſt for the property of them. Captain Clerke, applying theſe ſhocking repreſentations to our misfortunes at Owhyhee, and to an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of revenge, fixed his teleſcope upon us the whole time: and, as ſoon as he ſaw the ſmoke of the muſquets, ordered the boats to be put off to our aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>On the 2d of March, being the next day, Mr. King was again ordered on ſhore, with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering party. Ae we had ſo narrowly eſcaped the preceding day, Captain Clerke augmented our force from both ſhips, and we had a guard of forty men under arms. This precaution, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was found to be unneceſſary; for the beach was left entirely to ourſelves, and the ground, extending from the landing-place to the lake, <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booed.</hi>
                        <pb n="257" facs="unknown:030274_1087_0FE57585B31DAD98"/>
Hence we concluded, that ſome of the chiefs had viſited this quarter; who, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſtay, had conſiderately taken this ſtep, that we might be accommodated with ſafety. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men appeared with ſpears and daggers, on the other ſide of the river, but never attempted to moleſt us. Their women came over, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves cloſe by us, on the banks; and about the middle of the day, ſome of the men were prevailed on to bring us hogs and roots, and alſo to dreſs them for us. When we had left the beach, they came down to the ſea-ſide, and one of them had the audacity to throw a ſtone at us; but, as his conduct was highly cenſured by the reſt, we did not expreſs any kind of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>On the 3d, we completed our watering, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty; and, on returning to the ſhips, we were informed, that ſeveral chiefs had been on board, and had apologized for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their countrymen, attributing their riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behaviour to the quarrels then ſubſiſting among the principal people of the iſland, and which had deſtroyed all order and ſubordination.</p>
                     <p>The government of Atooi was diſputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Toneoneo, who had the ſupreme power when we were there the preceding year, and a youth named Teavee. By different fathers, they are both the grandſons of Perreeorannee, king of Woahoo; who gave Atooi to the former, and
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:030274_1088_0FE575BF901318D8"/>
Oneeheow to the latter. The quarrel originated about the goats which we had left at Oneeheow the year before; they being claimed by Toneo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo, as that iſland was a dependency of his. The adherents of Teavee inſiſting on the right of poſſeſſion, both parties prepared to ſupport their pretenſions, and a battle enſued juſt before our arrival, wherein Toneoneo had been defeated. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The goats, which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to ſix, and would probably have ſtocked theſe iſlands in a few years, were deſtroyed in this conteſt.</p>
                     <p>On the 4th we were viſited, on board the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, by the father-in-law, the mother, and the ſiſter of the young prince, who made ſeveral curious preſents to Captain Clerke. Among the reſt, were ſome fiſh-hooks, which were made from the bones of Terreeoboo's father, who had been killed in an unſucceſsful deſcent upon Woa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoo. Alſo a fly-flap, from the hands of the prince's ſiſter, which had a human bone for its handle, and had been given to her by her father-in-law,
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:030274_1089_0FE575C1150D1578"/>
as a trophy. They were not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by young Teavee, he being then engaged in the performance of ſome religious rites, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the victory he had obtained.</p>
                     <p>This day, and the 5th and 6th, were employed in completing the Diſcovery's water. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters were engaged in caulking the ſhips, and preparing for our next cruiſe. We no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any moleſtation from the natives, who ſupplied us plentifully with pork and vegetables.</p>
                     <p>We were now viſited by an Indian, who brought a piece of iron on board, to be formed into the ſhape of a <hi>pahooa.</hi> It was the bolt of ſome large ſhip timbers, but neither the officers nor men could diſcover to what nation it belonged; though, from the ſhape of the bolt, and the paleneſs of the iron, they were convinced it was not Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. They enquired ſtrictly of the native how he came poſſeſſed of it, when he informed them, that it was taken out of a large piece of timber, which had been driven upon their iſland, ſince we were there in January, 1778.</p>
                     <p>We received a viſit, on the 7th, from Tone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneo, at which we were ſurprized. Hearing the dowager princeſs was on board, he could hardly be prevailed on to enter the ſhip. When they met, they caſt an angry lowering look at each other. He did not ſtay long, and appeared much dejected. We remarked, however, with ſome degree of ſurprize, that the women proſtrated
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:030274_1090_0FE575D87A9B3450"/>
themſelves before him, both at his coming and going away; and all the natives on board, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with that reſpect which is uſually paid to perſons of his rank. It was ſomewhat remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that a man, who was then in a ſtate of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hoſtility with Teavee's party, ſhould venture alone within the power of his enemies. Indeed the civil diſſenſions, which are frequent in all the ſouth ſea iſlands, ſeem to be conducted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much acrimony; the depoſed Governor ſtill enjoying the rank of an <hi>Eree,</hi> and may put in practice ſuch means as may ariſe; to regain the conſequence which he has loſt.</p>
                     <p>At nine, in the morning of the 8th, we weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proceeded towards Oneeheow, and came to anchor in twenty fathoms water, at about three in the afternoon, nearly on the ſpot where we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in 1778. With the other anchor, we moored in twenty-ſix fathoms water. We had a ſtrong gale from the eaſtward in the night, and, the next morning, the ſhip had driven a whole cable's length, both anchors being almoſt brought a-head; in which ſituation we were obliged to continue, this and the two following days.</p>
                     <p>The weather being more moderate on the 12th, the Maſter was diſpatched to the north-weſt ſide of the iſland, in ſearch of a more commodious place for anchoring. In the evening, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having found a fine bay, with good anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, in eighteen fathoms water. The points of
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:030274_1091_0FE575CD61534BB8"/>
the bay were in the direction of north by eaſt, and ſouth by weſt. A ſmall village was ſituated on the north ſide of the bay, to the eaſtward of which were four wells of good water. Mr. Bligh went far enough to the north to convince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that Oreehoua, and Oneeheow, were too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate iſlands.</p>

                     <p>BEING now on the point of taking our final leave of the Sandwich Iſlands, we ſhall here give a general account of their ſituation and
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:030274_1092_0FE5756001AAF8B0"/>
natural hiſtory, as well as of the cuſtoms and manners of the natives. This will ſerve as a kind of ſupplement to the former deſcription, which was the reſult of our firſt viſit to theſe iſlands.</p>
                     <p>This group is compoſed of eleven Iſlands, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in longitude from 190° 36′ to 205° 6′, eaſt, and in latitude from 18° 54′, to 22° 15′ north. Their names, according to the natives, are, 1. Owhyhee. 2. Atooi, Atowi, or Towi; which is alſo ſome times called Kowi. 3. Woa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoo, or Oahoo. 4. Mowee. 5. Morotoi, or Morokoi. 6. Oreehoua, or Reehoua. 7. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotinnee, or Morokinnee. 8. Tahoora. 9. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, or Oranai. 10. Oneeheow, or Neeheehow. 11. Kahowrowee, or Tahoorowa. Theſe are all inhabited except Tahoora and Morotinnee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe we have enumerated, we heard of another iſland named Modoo-papapa, or Komo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doo-papapa, ſituated to the weſt-ſouth-weſt of Tahoora: it is low and ſandy, and is viſited ſolely for the purpoſe of catching turtle and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fowl. As we could never learn that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives had knowledge of any other iſlands, it is moſt probable that no others exiſt in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>
                     <p>Captain Cook had diſtinguiſhed this cluſter of iſlands by the name of the Sandwich Iſlands, in honour of the Earl of Sandwich, then firſt Lord of the Admiralty, under whoſe adminiſtration he
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:030274_1093_0FE575EBEC065708"/>
had enriched Geography with ſo many valuable diſcoveries; a tribute juſtly due to that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for the encouragement and ſupport which theſe voyages derive from his power, and for the zealous eagerneſs with which he ſeconded the views of our illuſtrious navigator.</p>
                     <p>Owhyhee, the moſt eaſterly of theſe iſlands, and by far the largeſt of them all, is of a trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular figure, and nearly equilaterial. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular points conſtitute the northern, ſouthern, and eaſtern extremities. The latitude of the northern extreme is 20° 17′ north, and its longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 204° 2′ eaſt: the ſouthern end ſtands in the longitude of 204° 15′ eaſt, and in the latitude of 18° 54′ north; and the eaſtern extremity is in the latitude of 19° 34′ north, and in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of 205° 6′ eaſt. The circumference of the whole iſland is about 255 geographical miles, or 293 Engliſh ones. Its breadth is twenty-four leagues; and its greateſt length, which lies near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a north and ſouth direction, is twenty-eight leagues and a half. It is divided into ſix ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive diſtricts, namely, Akona and Koaara, which are on the weſt ſide; Kaoo and Opoona, on the ſouth-eaſt; and Aheedoo and Amakooa, on the north-eaſt.</p>
                     <p>A mountain named <hi>Mouna Kaah,</hi> (or the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Kaah) which riſes in three peaks, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally covered with ſnow, and may be diſcerned at the diſtance of forty leagues, ſeparates the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:030274_1094_0FE5755C98BA7D78"/>
of Amakooa from that of Aheedoo. The coaſt, to the northward of this mountain, is compoſed of high and abrupt cliffs, down which fall many beautiful caſcades of water. We once flattered ourſelves with the hopes of finding a harbour round a bluff head, on a part of this coaſt, in the latitude of 20° 10′ north, and the longitude of 204° 26′ eaſt; but after we had doubled the point, and were ſtanding cloſe in, we found that it was connected, by a low valley, with another elevated head to the north-weſtward. The country riſes inland with a gradual aſcent, and is interſected by narrow deep glens, or rather chaſms; it ſeemed to be well cultivated, and to have many villages ſcattered about it. The ſnowy mountain above-mentioned is very ſteep, and its loweſt part abounds with wood.</p>
                     <p>The coaſt of Aoeedoo is of a moderate eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the interior parts have the appearance of being more even than the country towards the north-weſt. We cruiſed off theſe two diſtricts for near a month; and, whenever our diſtance from the ſhore would permit, were ſurrounded by canoes laden with refreſhments of every kind. On this ſide of the iſland we often met with a very heavy ſea, and a great ſwell; and, as there was much foul ground off the ſhore, we ſeldom made a nearer approach to the land than two or three leagues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="265" facs="unknown:030274_1095_0FE57574DB522BD0"/>The coaſt towards the north-eaſt of Apoona, which conſtitutes the eaſtern extreme of the iſland, is rather low and flat. In the inland parts the acclivity is very gradual; and the country abounds with bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to us to be the fineſt part of the whole iſland; and we were afterwards informed, that the king occaſionally reſided here. The hills, at the ſouth-weſtern extremity, riſe with ſome abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the ſea-ſide, leaving only a narrow border of low land towards the beach. The ſides of theſe hills were covered with verdure; but the adjacent country ſeemed thinly inhabited.</p>
                     <p>When our ſhips doubled the eaſt point of the iſland, we had ſight of another ſnowy mountain, called by the natives <hi>Mouna Roa</hi> (or the extenſive mountain) which, during the whole time we were ſailing along the ſouth-eaſtern ſide, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be a very conſpicuous object. It was flat at the ſummit, which was perpetually involved in ſnow; and we once obſerved its ſides alſo ſlightly covered with it for a conſiderable way down. According to the tropical line of ſnow, as determined by Monſieur Condamine, from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made on the Cordilleras in America, the height of this mountain muſt be, at leaſt, 16,020 feet. It therefore exceeds the height of the <hi>Pico de Teyde,</hi> or Peak of Teneriffe, by 3680 feet, according to the computation of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier de Borda, or 724, according to that of
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:030274_1096_0FE5755E1F31BBA8"/>
Dr. Heberden. The peaks of Mouna Kaah ſeemed to be of the heigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of about half a mile; and, as they are wholly covered with ſnow, the altitude of their ſummits muſt at leaſt be 18,400 feet.</p>
                     <p>The coaſt of Kaoo exhibits a moſt horrid and diſmal proſpect; the whole country having, to appearance, undergone an entire change from the conſequences of ſome dreadful convulſion. The ground is, in all parts, covered with cinders; and, in many places, interſected with blackiſh ſtreaks, which ſeem to mark the progreſs of a <hi>lava</hi> that has flowed, not many centuries ago, from Mouna Roa to the ſhore. The ſouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory appears like the mere dregs of a volcano. The head-land conſiſts of broken and craggy rocks, terminating in acute points, and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly piled on each other. Notwithſtanding the dreary aſpect of this part of the iſland, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains many villages, and is far more populous than the verdant mountains of Apoona. Nor is it difficult to account for this circumſtance. Theſe iſlanders not being poſſeſſed of any cattle, have no occaſion for paſturage; and are therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to prefer ſuch ground, as is either more conveniently ſituated for fiſhing, or beſt adapted to the cultivation of plantains and yams. Now amidſt theſe ruins, there are many ſpots of rich ſoil, which are, with great care, laid out in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:030274_1097_0FE575FBD4C62938"/>
and the neighbouring ſea abounds with excellent fiſh of various kinds.</p>
                     <p>Off this part of the coaſt, at leſs than a cable's length from the ſhore, we did not ſtrike ground with one hundred and ſixty fathoms of line, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in a ſmall bight to the eaſt of the ſouthern point, where we found from fifty to fifty-eight fathoms of water, over a ſandy bottom. It may be proper to obſerve, before we proceed to give an account of the weſtern diſtricts, that the whole coaſt we have deſcribed from the northern to the ſouthern extreme, affords not a ſingle harbour, nor the leaſt ſhelter for ſhipping.</p>
                     <p>The ſouth-weſtern parts of Akona are in a condition ſimilar to that of the adjoining diſtrict of Kaoo; but the country, further towards the north, has been carefully cultivated, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly populous. In this diviſion of the iſland, lies Karakakooa Bay, of which we have already given a deſcription. Scarce any thing is ſeen along the coaſt, but the fragments of black ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rocks; behind which, the ground, for the ſpace of about two miles and a half, riſes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, and ſeems to have been once covered with looſe burnt ſtones. Theſe have been cleared away by the inhabitants, frequently to the depth of three feet and upwards; and the fertility of the ſoil has amply repaired their labour. Here they cultivate in a rich aſhy mould, the cloth-plant and ſweet potatoes. Groves of cocoa-nut-trees
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:030274_1098_0FE575655B2BBBF8"/>
are ſcattered among the fields, which are incloſed with ſtone fences. On the riſing ground beyond theſe, they plant bread-fruit trees, which flouriſh with ſurpriſing luxuriance.</p>
                     <p>The diſtrict of Koaarra extends from the moſt weſterly point to the northern extreme of the iſland. The whole coaſt between them forms a ſpacious bay, which is called by the natives Toe-yah-yah, and is bounded to the northward by two conſpicuous hills. Towards the bottom of this bay there is foul corally ground, that extends to the diſtance of upwards of a mile fron the ſhore, without which there is good anchorage. The country, as far as the eye could diſcern, appeared to be fruitful and populous; but no freſh water was to be found. The ſoil ſeemed to be of the ſame kind with that of the diſtrict of Kaoo.</p>
                     <p>Having thus given an account of the coaſts of the Iſland of Owhyhee, and the adjacent country, we ſhall now relate ſome particulars reſpecting the interior parts, from the information we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from a party, who ſet out on the 26th of January, on an expedition up the country, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally with an intention of reaching the ſnowy mountains. Having previouſly procured two of the iſlanders to ſerve them as guides, they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the village about four o'clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. Their courſe was eaſterly, inclining a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the ſouth. Within three or four miles from the bay, they found the country as already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:030274_1099_0FE575ED71C1ABC0"/>
but the hills afterwards roſe with a leſs gradual aſcent, which brought them to ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive plantations, conſiſting of the <hi>taro</hi> or eddy root, and ſweet potatoes, with plants of the cloth-tree. Both the <hi>taro</hi> and the ſweet potatoes are here planted at the diſtance of four feet from each other. The potatoes are earthed up almoſt to the top of the ſtalk, with a proper quantity of light mould. The <hi>taro</hi> is left bare to the root, and the mould round it is put in the form of a baſon, for the purpoſe of holding the rain-water; this root requiring a certain degree of moiſture. At the Friendly and Society Iſles, the <hi>taro</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly planted in low and moiſt ſituations, and generally in thoſe places where there was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of a rivulet to flood it. This mode of culture was conſidered as abſolutely neceſſary; but we now found that this root, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution before-mentioned, ſucceeds equally well in a more dry ſituation. It was indeed, remarked by all of us, that the <hi>taro</hi> of the Sandwich Iſlands was the beſt we had ever taſted.</p>
                     <p>The walls, by which theſe plantations are ſeparated from each other, are compoſed of the looſe burnt ſtones, which are met with in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground; and, being totally concealed by ſugar-canes, that are planted cloſe on each ſide, form the moſt beautiful fences that can be imagined.</p>

The proſpect from this ſpot was deſcribed by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m as very delightful: they had a view of our veſſels in the bay before them; to the left they ſaw a continued range of villages, interſperſed with groves of cocoa-nut-trees, ſpreading along the ſhore; a thick wood extending itſelf behind them; and, to the right, a very conſiderable extent of ground, laid out with great regularity in well-cultivated planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diſplayed itſelf to their view. Near this ſpot the natives pointed out to them, at a diſtance from every other dwelling, the reſidence of a hermit, who, they ſaid, had, in the former part of his life, been a great chief and warrior, but had long ago retired from the ſea-coaſt of the iſland, and now never quitted the environs of his cottage. As they approached him, they proſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and afterwards preſented him with ſome proviſions. His behaviour was eaſy, frank and cheerful. He teſtified little aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the ſight of our people, and though preſſed to accept of ſome European curioſities, he thought proper to decline the offer, and ſoon withdrew to his cottage. Our party repreſented him as the moſt aged perſon they had ever ſeen, judging him to be, at a moderate computation, upwards of a hundred years of age.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="unknown:030274_1101_0FE576E72E5E02A8"/>As our people had ſuppoſed that the mountain was not more than ten or a dozen miles diſtant from the bay, and conſequently expected to reach it with eaſe early the following morning, they were now greatly ſurpriſed to find the diſtance ſcarce perceivably diminiſhed. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, with the uninhabited ſtate of the country, which they were on the point of entering, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it neceſſary to provide a ſupply of proviſions, they diſpatched one of their conductors back to the village for that purpoſe. Whilſt they waited his return, they were joined by ſeveral of Kaoo's ſervants, whom that generous old man had ſent after them, loaded with refreſhments, and fully authorized, as their route lay through his grounds, to demand, and take away with them whatever they might want.</p>
                     <p>Great was the ſurpriſe of our travellers, on finding the cold here ſo intenſe. But, as they had no thermometer with them, they could only form their judgment of it from their feelings; which, from the warm atmoſphere they had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted muſt have been a very fallacious method of judging. They found it, however, ſo cold, that they could ſcarce get any ſleep, and the iſlanders could not ſleep at all; both parties being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed during the whole night, by continual coughing, As they, at this time, could not be at any very great height, their diſtance from the ſea being no more than ſix or ſeven miles, and
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:030274_1102_0FE5764FD1F51778"/>
part of the road on a very moderate aſcent, this uncommon degree of cold muſt be attributed to the eaſterly wind blowing freſh over the ſnowy mountains.</p>
                     <p>They proceeded on their journey early the next morning, and filled their calibaſhes at a well of excellent water, ſituate about half a mile from their hut. After they had paſſed the plantations, they arrived at a thick wood which they entered by a path that had been made for the convenience of the iſlanders, who frequently repair thither for the purpoſe of catching birds, as well as procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wild or horſe-plantain. Their progreſs now became extremely ſlow, and was attended with great labour; for the ground was either ſwampy, or covered with large ſtones; the path narrow, and often interrupted by trees lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs it, which they were obliged to climb over as the thickneſs of the underwood, on each ſide, rendered it impracticable to paſs round them. They ſaw, in theſe woods, pieces of white cloth fixed on poles, at ſmall diſtances, which they imagined were land-marks for the diviſion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as they only obſerved them where the wild plantains grew. The trees were of the ſame kind with the ſpice-tree of New Holland; they were ſtraight and lofty, and their circumference was from two to four feet.</p>
                     <p>Our party having advanced nine or ten miles in the wood, had the mortification of finding
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:030274_1103_0FE576C72AA08960"/>
themſelves, ſuddenly, within ſight of the ſea, and not very far from it; the path having turned off imperceptibly to the ſouth, and carried them to the right of the mountain, which it was their intention to reach. Their diſappointment was conſiderably heightened by the uncertainty under which they now were with reſpect to its true bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as they could not, at preſent, gain a view of it from the top of the higheſt trees. They, therefore, thought proper to walk back ſix or ſeven miles to an unoccupied hut, where they had left two of their own people, and three of the natives, with the ſmall remnant of their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Here they paſſed the ſecond night, during which the air was ſo extremely ſharp, that, by the morning, their guides were all gone off except one.</p>
                     <p>Being now in want of proviſions, which laid them under the neceſſity of returning to ſome of the cultivated parts of the iſland, they left the wood by the ſame path by which they had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. When they arrived at the plantations, they were ſurrounded by the iſlanders, from whom they purchaſed a freſh ſupply of neceſſaries; and prevailed upon two of them to accompany them as guides, in the room of thoſe who had gone away. Having procured the beſt information they could poſſibly obtain, with regard to the direction of their road, the party, who were now nine in number, marched for about half a dozen miles
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:030274_1104_0FE576590B81BD60"/>
along the ſkirts of the wood, and then entered it again by a path leading towards the eaſt. They paſſed, for the firſt three miles, through a foreſt of lofty ſpice-trees, which grew on a rich loam. At the back of theſe trees they met with an equal extent of low ſhrubby trees, together with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of thick under-wood, upon a bottom of looſe burnt ſtones. This led them to another foreſt of ſpice-trees, and the ſame rich browniſh ſoil, which was again ſucceeded by a barren ridge of a ſimilar kind with the former. Theſe ridges, as far as they could be ſeen, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to run parallel with the ſea-ſhore, and to have Mouna Roa for their centre.</p>
                     <p>As they paſſed through the woods they found many unfiniſhed canoes, and huts in ſeveral places; but they ſaw none of the inhabitants. After they had penetrated almoſt three miles into the ſecond wood, they arrived at two, huts, where they ſtopped, being greatly fatigued with the days journey, in the courſe of which they had walked, according to their own computation, at leaſt twenty miles. Having found no ſprings from the time they quitted the plantations, they had greatly ſuffered from the violence of their thirſt; in conſequence of which they were obliged, before the evening came on, to ſeparate into ſmall parties, and go in queſt of water. They, at laſt, met with ſome that had been left by rain in the bottom of a half-finiſhed canoe; which,
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:030274_1105_0FE57641CC5E0BD0"/>
though of a reddiſh colour, was by no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to them.</p>
                     <p>During the night, the cold was more intenſe than before; and though they had taken care to wrap themſelves up in mats and cloths of the country, and to keep a large fire between the two huts, they could get but very little ſleep, and were under the neceſſity of walking about for the greateſt part of the night. Their elevation was now, in all probability, pretty conſiderable, as the ground, over which their journey lay, had been generally on the aſcent.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, which was the 29th, they ſet out early, with an intention of making their laſt and greateſt effort to reach the ſnowy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but their ſpirits were conſiderably depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, on finding that the miſerable pittance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they had diſcovered the preceding night, was expended. The path, which reached no farther than where canoes had been built, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now terminated, they were obliged to make their way as well as they could; frequently climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the moſt lofty trees, to explore the ſurrounding country. They arrived, about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven o'clock, at a ridge of burnt ſtones, from the top of which they had a proſpect of the Mouna Roa, which then appeared to be at a diſtance of between twelve and fourteen miles from them.</p>
                     <p>They now entered into a conſultation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould proceed any further, or reſt
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:030274_1106_0FE5766037ACA3C8"/>
contented with the view they now had of the ſnowy mountain. Since the path had ceaſed, their road had become highly fatiguing, and was growing ſtill more ſo, every ſtep they advanced. The ground was almoſt every where broken into deep fiſſures, which, being ſlightly covered with moſs, made them ſtumble almoſt continually; and the intervening ſpace conſiſted of a ſurface of looſe burnt ſtones, which broke under their feet. Into ſome of theſe fiſſures they threw ſtones, which ſeemed from the noiſe they made, to fall to a conſiderable depth; and the ground ſounded hollow as they walked upon it. Beſides theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which diſcouraged them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, they found their conductors ſo averſe to going on, that they had reaſon to think they would not be prevailed on to remain out another night. They, therefore, at length came to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of returning to the ſhips, after tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſurvey of the country from the higheſt trees they could find. From this elevation, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themſelves ſurrounded with wood towards the ſea; they were unable to diſtinguiſh, in the horizon, the ſky from the water; and betwixt them and the ſnowy mountain, was a valley of about eight miles in breadth.</p>
                     <p>The travellers paſſed this night at a hut in the ſecond foreſt; and the following day before noon, they had paſſed the firſt wood, and found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nine or ten miles to the north-eaſt of the
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:030274_1107_0FE5764ADF27E420"/>
ſhips, towards which they marched through the plantations. As they walked along, they did not obſerve a ſpot of ground, that was ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of improvement, left unplanted; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the country, from their account, could ſcarcely be cultivated to greater advantage for the purpoſes of the natives.</p>
                     <p>They were ſurpriſed at ſeeing ſeveral fields of hay; and upon their enquiry, to what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe it was applied, they were informed, that it was intended to cover the ground where the young <hi>taro</hi> grew, in order to preſerve them from being ſcorched by the rays of the ſun. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among the plantations, a few huts ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about, which afforded occaſional ſhelter to the labourers: but they did not ſee any villages at a greater diſtance from the ſea than four or five miles. Near one of them, which was ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated about four miles from the bay, they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a cave, forty fathoms in length, three in breadth, and of the ſame height. It was open at each end; its ſides were fluted, as if wrought with a chiſſel; and the ſurface was glazed over, perhaps by the action of fire.</p>
                     <p>Having thus related the principal circumſtances that occurred in the expedition to the ſnowy mountain at Owhyhee, we ſhall now proceed to deſcribe the other iſlands of this groupe.</p>
                     <p>That which is next in ſize, and neareſt in ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to Owhyhee, is Mowee. It ſtands at the
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:030274_1108_0FE576640A3864E0"/>
diſtance of eight leagues north-north-weſt from Owhyhee, and is one hundred and forty geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical miles in circuit. It is divided by a low iſthmus into two circular peninſulas, of which that to the eaſtward is named Whamadooa, and is twice as large as that to the weſt, called O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whyrookoo. The mountains in both riſe to a very great height, as we were able to ſee them at the diſtance of above thirty leagues. The northern ſhores, like thoſe of the iſle of Owhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hee, afford no ſoundings; and the country bears the ſame aſpect of fertility and verdure. The eaſt point of Mowee is in the latitude of 20° 50′ north, and in the longitude of 204° 4′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>To the ſouthward, between Mowee and the adjacent iſlands, we found regular depths with one hundred and fifty fathoms over a bottom of ſand. From the weſtern point, which is rather low, runs a ſhoal, extending towards the iſland of Ranai, to a conſiderable diſtance; and to the ſouth of this, is an extenſive bay, with a ſandy beach, ſhaded with cocoa-trees. It is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that good anchorage might be met with here, with ſhelter from the prevailing winds; and that the beach affords a commodious land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place. The country further back is very ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic in its appearance. The hills riſe almoſt perpendicularly, exhibiting a variety of peaked forms; and their ſteep ſides, as well as the deep chaſms between them, are covered with trees,
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:030274_1109_0FE57661C0E2E208"/>
among which thoſe of the bread-fruit principally abound. The ſummits of theſe hills are perfectly bare, and of a reddiſh brown hue. The natives informed us, that there was a harbour to the ſouth of the eaſtern point, which they aſſerted was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that of Karakakooa; and we alſo heard that there was another harbour, named Keepoo-keepoo, on the north-weſtern ſide.</p>
                     <p>Ranai is about nine miles diſtant from Mowee and Morotoi, and is ſituate to the ſouth-weſt of the paſſage between thoſe two iſles. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, towards the ſouth, is elevated and craggy; but the other parts of the iſland had a better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and ſeemed to be well inhabited. It abounds in roots, ſuch as ſweet potatoes, <hi>taro,</hi> and yams; but produces very few plantains and bread fruit-trees. The ſouth point of Ranai is in the latitude of 20° 46′ north, and in the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 203° 8′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Morotoi lies at the diſtance of two leagues and a half to the weſt-north-weſt of Mowee. Its ſouth-weſtern coaſt, which was the only part of it we approached, is very low; but the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind riſes to a conſiderable elevation; and, at the diſtance from which we had a view of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be deſtitute of wood. Yams are its principal produce; and it may probably contain freſh water. The coaſt, on the ſouthern and weſtern ſides of the iſland, forms ſeveral bays that promiſe a tolerable ſhelter from the trade
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:030274_1110_0FE5766B0FE98838"/>
winds. The weſt point of Morotoi is in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of 202° 46′ eaſt, and in the latitude of 21° 10′ north.</p>
                     <p>Tahoorowa is a ſmall iſland ſituated off the ſouth-weſtern part of Mowee, from which it is nine miles diſtant. It is deſtitute of wood, and its ſoil ſeems to be ſandy and unfertile. Its lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is 20° 38′ north, and its longitude 203° 27′ eaſt. Between it and Mowee ſtands the little iſland of Morrotinnee, which has no inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>Woahoo lies about ſeven leagues to the north-weſt of Morotoi. As far as we were enabled to judge, from the appearance of the north-weſtern and north-eaſtern parts (for we had not an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing the ſouthern ſide) it is by far the fineſt of all the Sandwich Iſlands. The verdure of the hills, the variety of wood and lawn, and fertile well-cultivated vallies, which the whole face of the country preſented to view, could not be exceeded. Having already deſcribed the bay in which we anchored, formed by the northern and weſtern extremes, it remains for us to obſerve, that, in the bight of the bay, to the ſouthward of our anchoring-place, we met with foul rocky ground, about two miles from the ſhore. If the ground <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ackling of a ſhip ſhould happen to be weak, and the wind blow with violence from the north, to which quarter the road is entirely open, this circumſtance might be attended with ſome degree of danger: but, provided the cables were
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:030274_1111_0FE5768746716618"/>
good, there would be no great hazard, as the ground from the anchoring-place, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite the valley through which the river runs, to the northern point, conſiſts of a fine ſand. The latitude of our anchoring-place is 21° 43′ north, and the longitude 202° 9′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Atooi is about twenty-five leagues to the north-weſt of Woahoo. Towards the north-eaſt and north-weſt, the face of the country is ragged and broken; but, to the ſouthward, it is more even; the hills riſe from the ſea-ſide with a gentle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity, and, at a little diſtance back, are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wood. Its produce is the ſame with that of the other iſlands of this cluſter; but its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants greatly excell the people of all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring iſlands in the management of their plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. In the low grounds, contiguous to the bay wherein we anchored, theſe plantations were regularly divided by deep ditches; the fences were formed with a neatneſs approaching to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and the roads through them were finiſhed in ſuch a manner, as would have reflected credit even on an European engineer. The longitude of Wymoa Bay, in this iſland, is 200° 20′ eaſt, and its latitude 21° 57′ north.</p>
                     <p>Oneeheow is five or ſix leagues to the weſtward of Atooi. Its eaſtern coaſt is high, and riſes with abruptneſs from the ſea; but the other parts of the iſland conſiſt of low ground, except a round bluff head on the ſouth-eaſtern point. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces

                     <p>Oreehoua and Tahoora are two little iſlands, ſituate in the neighbourhood of Oneeheow. The former an elevated hummock, connected with the northern extreme of Oneeheow, by a reef of coral rocks. Its latitude is 22° 2′ north, and its longitude 199° 52′ eaſt. The latter ſtands to the ſouth-eaſt, and is uninhabited: its longitude is 199° 36′ eaſt, and its latitude 21° 43′ north.</p>
                     <p>The climate of the Sandwich Iſles is, perhaps, rather more temperate than that of the Weſt India iſlands, which are in the ſame latitude; but the difference is very inconſiderable. The thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, on ſhore near Karakakooa Bay, never roſe to a greater height than 88°, and that but one day: its mean height, at twelve o'clock, was 83°. Its mean height at noon, in Wymoa Bay, was 76°, and, when out at ſea, 75°. In the iſland of Jamaica, the mean height of the thermometer, at twelve o'clock, is about 86°; at ſea 80°.</p>
                     <p>Whether theſe iſlands are ſubject to the ſame violent winds and hurricanes with the Weſt Indies, we could not aſcertain, as we were not here during any of the tempeſtuous months. However, as no veſtiges of their effects were any where to be ſeen, and as the iſlanders gave us no poſitive teſtimony of the fact, it is probable, that in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:030274_1113_0FE5763D33A0C048"/>
they reſemble the Friendly and Society Iſles, which are, in a great degree, free from ſuch tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous viſitations.</p>
                     <p>There was a greater quantity of rain, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the interior parts, during the four winter months that we continued among the iſlanders, than commonly falls in the Weſt-Indies in the dry ſeaſon. We generally obſerved clouds col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting round the ſummits of the hills, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing rain to leeward; but, after the wind has ſeparated them from the land, they diſperſe, and are loſt, and others ſupply their place. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred daily at Owhyhee; the mountainous parts being uſually enveloped in a cloud; ſhowers ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively falling in the inland country; with a clear ſky, and fine weather, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>The winds were, for the moſt part, from eaſt-ſouth-eaſt to north-eaſt. In the harbour of Kara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kakooa we had every day and night a ſea and land breeze. The currents ſometimes ſet to windward, and at other times to leeward, without the leaſt regularity. They did not ſeem to be directed by the winds, nor by any other cauſe that we can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: they often ſet to windward againſt a freſh breeze.</p>
                     <p>The tides are exceedingly regular, ebbing and flowing ſix hours each. The flood-tide comes from the eaſt, and, at the full and change of the moon, it is high-water at three quarters of an

hour after three o'clock. Their greateſt riſe is two feet ſeven inches.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the quadrupeds of theſe iſlands they are confined to three ſorts, namely, hogs, dogs, and rats. The dogs are of the ſame ſpecies with thoſe we ſaw at Otaheite, having pricked ears, long backs, and ſhort crooked legs. We did not obſerve any variety in them, except in their ſkins; ſome being perfectly ſmooth, and others having long rough hair. They are about as large as a common turnſpit, and ſeem to be extremely ſluggiſh in their nature; though this may, probably, be more owing to the manner in which they are treated, than to their natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. They are generally fed with the hogs, and left to herd with thoſe animals; and we do not recollect a ſingle inſtance of a dog being made a companion here, as is the cuſtom in Europe. Indeed, the practice of eating them ſeems to be an inſuperable bar to their being admitted into ſociety; and as there are no beaſts of prey, nor objects of chace, in theſe iſlands, the ſocial quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the dog, its attachment, fidelity, and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, will, in all probability, remain unknown to the natives.</p>
                     <p>It did not appear that the dogs in the Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich iſlands were near ſo numerous, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as at Otaheite. But, on the other hand, they have a much greater plenty of hogs, and the breed is of a larger kind. We procured from
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:030274_1115_0FE576268FC55A80"/>
them an amazing ſupply of proviſions of this ſort. We were upwards of three months, either cruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the coaſt, or in harbour at Owhyhee; during all which time the crews of both ſhips had conſtantly a large allowance of freſh pork, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that our conſumption of that article was computed at about ſixty puncheons of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight each. Beſides this quantity, and the extraordinary waſte, which, amidſt ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, could not be entirely prevented, ſixty more puncheons were ſalted for ſea ſtore. The greater part of this ſupply was drawn from the iſle of Owhyhee alone; and yet we did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it was at all exhauſted, or even that the plenty had decreaſed.</p>
                     <p>The birds of theſe iſlands are numerous, though the variety is not great. Some of them may vie with thoſe of any country in point of beauty. There are four ſpecies that ſeem to belong to the <hi>trochili,</hi> or honey-ſuckers of Linnaeus. One of them is ſomewhat larger than a bullfinch; its colour is a gloſſy black, and the thighs and rump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent are of a deep yellow. The natives call it <hi>hoohoo.</hi> Another is of a very bright ſcarlet; its wings are black, with a white edge, and its tail is black. It is named <hi>eeeeve</hi> by the inhabitants. The third is variegated with brown, yellow, and red, and ſeems to be either a young bird, or a variety of the preceding. The fourth is entirely green, with yellow tinge, and is called <hi>akaiearooa.</hi>
                        <pb n="286" facs="unknown:030274_1116_0FE57671595F1630"/>
There is alſo a ſmall bird of the fly-catcher kind; a ſpecies of thruſh, with a greyiſh breaſt; and a rail, with very ſhort wings, and no tail. Ravens are met with here, but they are extremely ſcarce; they are of a dark brown colour, inclining to black, and their note is different from that of the European raven.</p>
                     <p>We found here two ſmall birds, that were very common, and both of which were of one <hi>genus.</hi> One of theſe was red, and was uſually obſerved about the cocoa-trees, from whence it ſeemed to derive a conſiderable part of its ſubſiſtance. The other was of a green colour. Both had long tongues, which were ciliated, or fringed at the tip. A bird with a yellow head was likewiſe very commom here: from the ſtructure of its beak, our people called it a prrroquet: it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, does not belong to that tribe, but bears a great reſemblance to the <hi>lexia flavicans,</hi> or yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh croſs bill of Linnaeus. Here are alſo owls, curlews, petrels, and gannets; plovers of two ſpecies, one nearly the ſame as our whiſtling plover; a large white pigeon; the common water-hen; and a long tailed bird, which is of a black colour, and the vent and feathers under the wings yellow.</p>
                     <p>The vegetable produce of the Sandwich Iſles is not very different from that of the other iſlands of the Pacific Ocean. We have already obſerved that the <hi>taro</hi> root, as here cultivated, was ſuperior
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:030274_1117_0FE5770397045968"/>
to any we had before taſted. The bread-fruit-trees thrive here, not indeed in ſuch abundance as at Otaheite, but they produce twice as much fruit as they do on the rich plains of that iſland. The trees are nearly of the ſame height; but the branches ſhoot out from the trunk conſiderably lower, and with greater luxuriance of vegetation. The ſugar-canes of theſe iſlands grow to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſize. One of them was brought to us at Atooi, whoſe circumference was eleven inches and a quarter; and it had fourteen feet eatable. At Oneeheow we ſaw ſome large brown roots, from ſix to ten pounds in weight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a yam in ſhape. The juice, of which they yield a great quantity, is very ſweet, and is an excellent <hi>ſuccedaneum</hi> for ſugar. The natives are exceedingly fond of it, and make uſe of it as an article of their common diet; and our people likewiſe found it very palatable and wholeſome. Not being able to procure the leaves of this vegetable, we could not aſcertain to what ſpecies of plant it belonged; but we ſuppoſed it to be the root of ſome kind of fern.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE natives of the Sandwich Iſles are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the ſame extraction with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Friendly and Society Iſlands, of New-Zealand, the Marqueſas, and Eaſter Iſland; a race which poſſeſſes all the known lands between the longitudes of 157° and 260′ eaſt, and between the latitudes of 47° ſouth, and 22° north. This
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:030274_1119_0FE576299ABC8350"/>
fact, extraordinary as it is, is not only evinced by the general reſemblance of their perſons, and the great ſimilarity of their manners and cuſtoms, but ſeems to be eſtabliſhed, beyond all controverſy, by the identity of their language. It may not, perhaps, be very difficult to conjecture, from what continent they originally emigrated, and by what ſteps they have diffuſed themſelves over ſo immenſe a ſpace. They bear ſtrong marks of affinity to ſome of the Indian tribes, which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Landrones and Caroline Iſles; and the ſame affinity and reſemblance, may alſo be traced among the Malays and the Battas. At what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time theſe migrations happened is leſs eaſy to aſcertain; the period, in all probability, was not very late, as they are very populous, and have no tradition reſpecting their own origin, but what is wholly fabulous; though, on the other hand, the ſimplicity which is ſtill prevalent in their manners and habits of life, and the unadul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated ſtate of their general language, ſeem to demonſtrate, that it could not have been at any very remote period.</p>
                     <p>The Sandwich Iſlanders, in general, exceed the middle ſize, and are well made. They walk in a very graceful manner, run with conſiderable agility, and are capable of enduring a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fatigue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, upon the whole, the men are inferior, with reſpect to activity and ſtrength, to the inhabitants of the Friendly Iſlands, and
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:030274_1120_0FE5762180111ED0"/>
the women are leſs delicate in the formation of their limbs than the Otaheitean females. Their complexion is ſomewhat darker than that of the Otaheiteans; and they are not altogether ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in their perſons as the natives of the Society Iſles. Many of both ſexes, however, had fine open countenances<note place="bottom">The annexed repreſentation of a man of the Sandwich Iſles, was taken from a portrait of our friend Kaneena.</note>; and the women, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, had white well ſet teeth, good eyes, and an engaging ſweetneſs and ſenſibility of look.</p>
                     <p>The hair of theſe people is of a browniſh black, neither uniformly curling like that of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can negroes, nor uniformly ſtraight, as among the Indians of America; but varying, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, like the hair of Europeans. There is one ſtriking peculiarity in the features of every part of this great nation; which is, that, even in the moſt handſome faces, there is always obſervable, a fullneſs of the noſtril, without any flatneſs or ſpreading of the noſe, that diſtinguiſhes them from the inhabitants of Europe. It is not wholly improbable, that this may be the effect of their cuſtomary method of ſalutation, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by preſſing together the extremities of their noſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſame ſuperiority that we generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at other iſlands in the perſons of the <hi>Erees,</hi> is likewiſe found here. Thoſe that were ſeen by us were perfectly well formed; whereas the lower
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:030274_1121_0FE5762B968D7FA0"/>
claſs of people, beſides their general inferiority, are ſubject to all the variety of figure and make, that is met with in the populace of other parts of the world.</p>
                     <p>There are more frequent inſtances of defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity here, than in any of the other iſlands we viſited. While we were cruiſing off Owhyhee, two dwarfs came on board; one of whom was an old man, of the height of four feet two inches, but very well proportioned; and the other was a woman, nearly of the ſame ſtature. We after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw, among the natives, three who were humpbacked, and a young man who had been deſtitute of hands and feet, from the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his birth. Squinting is alſo common among them; and a man, who, they told us, had been born blind, was brought to us for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of being cured. Beſides theſe particular defects, they are, in general, extremely ſubject to boils and ulcers, which ſome of us aſcribed to the great quantity of ſalt they uſually eat with their fiſh and fleſh. Though the <hi>Erees</hi> are free from theſe complaints, many of them experience ſtill more dreadful effects from the too frequent uſe of the <hi>ava.</hi> Thoſe who were the moſt affected by it, had their eyes red and iflamed, their limbs emaciated, their bodies covered with a whitiſh ſcurf, and their whole frame trembling and paralytic, attended with a diſability of raiſing their heads.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="292" facs="unknown:030274_1122_0FE5761C1F3CE320"/>Though it does not appear that this drug uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſhortens life, (for Terreeoboo, Kaoo, and ſeveral other chiefs, were far advanced in years) yet it invariably brings on a premature and decrepid old age. It is a fortunate circumſtance for the people, that the uſe of it is made a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar privilege of the chiefs. The young ſon of Terreeoboo, who did not exceed twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, frequently boaſted of his being admitted to drink <hi>ava;</hi> and ſhewed us, with marks of exultation, a ſmall ſpot in his ſide that was beginning to grow ſcaly.</p>
                     <p>When Captain Cook firſt viſited the Society Iſles, this pernicious drug was very little known among them. In his ſecond voyage, he found it greatly in vogue at Ulietea; but it had ſtill gained little ground at Otaheite. During the laſt time we were there, the havock it had made was almoſt incredible, inſomuch that Captain Cook ſcarce recognized many of his former acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. It is alſo conſtantly drank by the chiefs of the Friendly Iſles, but ſo much diluted with water, that it ſcarcely produces any bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. At Atooi, likewiſe, it is uſed with great moderation; and the chiefs of that iſland are, on this account, a much finer ſet of men than thoſe of the neighbouring iſlands. It was remarked by us, that, upon diſcontinuing the uſe of this root, its noxious effects quickly wore off. We prevailed upon our friends Kaoo and
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:030274_1123_0FE5762816721BE8"/>
Kaireekeea, to abſtain from it; and they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſurpriſingly during the ſhort time we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards remained among them.</p>
                     <p>To form any probable conjectures with regard to the population of iſlands, with many parts of which we have but an imperfect acquaintance, may be thought highly difficult. There are two circumſtances, however, which remove much of this objection. One is, that the interior parts of the country are almoſt entirely uninhabited: if, therefore, the number of thoſe who inhabit the parts adjoining to the coaſt, be aſcertained, the whole will be determined with ſome degree of accuracy. The other circumſtance is, that there are no towns of any conſiderable extent, the houſes of the iſlanders being pretty equally ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in ſmall villages round all their coaſts. On theſe grounds we ſhall venture at a rough calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the number of perſons in this cluſter of iſlands.</p>
                     <p>Karakakooa bay, in Owhyhee, is about three miles in extent, and comprehends four villages of about eighty houſes each, upon an average, in all three hundred and twenty; beſides many ſtraggling habitations, which may make the whole amount to three hundred and fifty. If we allow ſix people to each houſe, the country about the bay will then contain two thouſand one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons. To theſe we may add fifty fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or three hundred ſouls, which we imagine
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:030274_1124_0FE576144FF6A3B0"/>
to be nearly the number employed among the plantations in the interior parts of the iſland; making, in all, two thouſand four hundred. If this number be applied to the whole coaſt round the iſland, a quarter being deducted for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited parts, it will be found to contain a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand perſons. The other Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Iſlands, by the ſame method of calculation, will appear to contain the following number of inhabitants: Mowee, ſixty-five thouſand four hundred; Atooi, fifty-four thouſand; Morotoi, thirty-ſix thouſand; Woahoo, ſixty thouſand two hundred; Ranai, twenty thouſand four hundred; Oneeheow, ten thouſand; and Oreehoua, four thouſand. Theſe numbers, including the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand in Owhyhee, will amount to four hundred thouſand: In this computation we have by no means exceeded the truth in the total amount.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be acknowledged, notwithſtanding the great loſs we ſuſtained from the ſudden reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and violence of theſe iſlanders, that they are of a very mild and affectionate diſpoſition, equally remote from the diſtant gravity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of the natives of the Friendly Iſles, and the extreme volatility of the Otaheiteans. They ſeem to live in the greateſt friendſhip and harmony with each other. Thoſe women who had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhewed a remarkable affection for them, and paid them a particular and conſtant attention;
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:030274_1125_0FE576052CB000A0"/>
and the men, with a willingneſs that did honour to their feelings, frequently afforded their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in thoſe domeſtic employments. We muſt, however, remark, that they are greatly inferior to the inhabitants of the other iſlands, in that beſt criterion of civilized manners, the reſpect paid to the female ſex. Here the women are not only deprived of the privilege of eating with the men, but are forbidden to feed on the beſt ſorts of proviſions. Turtle, pork, ſeveral kinds of fiſh, and ſome ſpecies of plantains, are denied them; and we were informed, that a girl received a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beating, for having eaten, while ſhe was on board one of our ſhips, a prohibited article of food. With regard to their domeſtic life, they ſeem to live almoſt wholly by themſelves, and meet with little attention from the men, though no inſtances of perſonal ill-treatment were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by us.</p>
                     <p>We have already had occaſion to mention the great kindneſs and hoſpitality, with which they treated us. Whenever we went aſhore, there was a continual ſtruggle who ſhould be moſt forward in offering little preſents for our acceptance, bringing proviſions and refreſhments, or teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other mark of reſpect. The aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſtantly received us with tears of joy, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be highly gratified with being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to touch us, and were frequently drawing compariſons between us and themſelves, with
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:030274_1126_0FE5763EB823BFF8"/>
marks of extreme humility. The young women, likewiſe, were exceedingly kind and engaging, and attached themſelves to us, without reſerve, till they perceived, notwithſtanding all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prevent it, that they had cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our acquaintance. It muſt, however, be obſerved, that theſe females were, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the inferior claſs; for we ſaw very few women of rank during our continuance here.</p>
                     <p>Theſe people, in point of natural capacity, are, by no means below the common ſtandard of the human race. The excellence of their manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their improvements in agriculture, are doubtleſs adequate to their ſituation and natural advantages. The eagerneſs of curioſity, with which they uſed to attend the armourer's forge, and the various expedients which they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, even before our departure from theſe iſlands, for working the iron obtained from us, into ſuch forms as were beſt calculated for their purpoſes, were ſtrong indications of docility and ingenuity. Our unhappy friend, Kaneena, was endowed with a remarkable quickneſs of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a great degree of judicious curioſity. He was extremely inquiſitive with reſpect to our manners and cuſtoms. He enquired after our ſovereign; the form of our government; the mode of conſtructing our ſhips; the productions of our country; our numbers; our method of building houſes; whether we waged any wars;
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:030274_1127_0FE576306CD5C880"/>
with whom, on what occaſion, and in what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner they were carried on; who was our Deity; beſides many other queſtions of a ſimilar import, which ſeemed to indicate a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive underſtanding. We obſerved two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of perſons diſordered in their ſenſes; the one a woman at Oneeheow, the other a man at Owhyhee. From the extraordinary reſpect and attention paid to them, it appeared, that the opinion of their being divinely inſpired, which prevails among moſt of the oriental nations, is alſo countenanced here.</p>
                     <p>It is highly probable, that the practice of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the bodies of enemies was originally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in all the iſlands of the Pacific Ocean, though it is not known by poſitive and deciſive evidence, to exiſt in any of them, except New-Zealand. The offering up human victims, which is manifeſtly a relique of this barbarous cuſtom, ſtill univerſally prevails among theſe iſlanders; and it is not difficult to conceive why the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of New-Zealand ſhould retain the repaſt, which was, perhaps, the concluding part of theſe horrid rites, for a longer period than the reſt of their tribe who were ſituated in more fertile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. As the Sandwich iſlanders, both in their perſons and diſpoſition, bear a nearer reſemblance to the New-Zealanders, than to any other people of this very extenſive race, Mr. Anderſon was ſtrongly inclined to ſuſpect, that, like them, they
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:030274_1128_0FE57606B16AC990"/>
are ſtill cannibals. The evidence, which induced him to entertain this opinion, has been already laid down in the tenth chapter of the third book; but, as Mr. King had great doubts of the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his concluſions, we ſhall mention the grounds on which he ventured to differ from him. With regard to the intelligence received on this head from the natives themſelves, it may not be improper to obſerve, that moſt of the officers on board took great pains to inquire into ſo curious a circumſtance; and that, except in the inſtances above referred to, the iſlanders invariably denied that any ſuch practice exiſted among them.</p>
                     <p>Though Mr. Anderſon's ſuperior knowledge of the language of thoſe people ought certainly to give conſiderable weight to his judgment, yet when he examined the man who had the little parcel containing a piece of ſalted fleſh, Mr. King, who was preſent on that occaſion, was ſtrongly of opinion, that the ſigns made uſe of by the iſlander intimated nothing more, than that it was deſigned to be eaten, and that it was very agreeable or wholeſome to the ſtomach. In this ſentiment Mr. King was confirmed, by a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which he was informed, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of his ingenious friend Mr Anderſon, namely, that moſt of the inhabitants of theſe iſlands carried about with them a ſmall piece of raw pork, well ſalted, either put into a callibaſh, or wrapped up in ſome cloth, and faſtened round
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:030274_1129_0FE5763370EF9E50"/>
the waiſt: this they eſteemed a great delicacy, and would frequently taſte it. With regard to the confuſion the lad was in, (for his age did not exceed ſixte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n or eighteen years) no perſon could have been ſurpriſed at it, who had been witneſs of the earneſt and eager manner in which Mr. Anderſon interrogated him.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King found it leſs eaſy to controvert the argument deduced from the uſe of the inſtrument made with ſharks teeth, which is of a ſimilar form with that uſed by the New-Zealanders for cutting up the bodies of their enemies. Though he believed it to be an undoubted fact, that they never make uſe of this inſtrument in cutting the fleſh of other animals, yet, as the practice of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing human victims, and of burning the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſlain, ſtill prevails here, he conſidered it as not altogether improbable, that the uſe of this knife (if it may be ſo denomin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ed) is retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe ceremonies. He was, upon the whole, inclined to imagine, and particularly from the laſt-mentioned circumſtance, that the horrible cuſtom of devouring human fleſh has but lately ceaſed in theſe and other iſlands of the Pacific Ocean. Omai acknowledged, that his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, inſtigated by the fury of revenge, would ſometimes tear with their teeth the fleſh of their ſlain enemies; but he peremptorily denied that they ever eat it. The denial is a ſtrong indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the practice has ceaſed; for in New-Zealand,
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:030274_1130_0FE5761242BEA6E8"/>
where it is ſtill prevalent, the natives never ſcrupled to confeſs it.</p>
                     <p>The Sandwich Iſlanders, almoſt univerſally, permit their beards to grow. There were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a few who cut off their beards entirely, among whom was the aged king; and others wore it only on their upper lip. The ſame variety that is found among the other iſlanders of this ocean, with reſpect to the mode of wearing the hair, is likewiſe obſervable here. They have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a faſhion which ſeems to be peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: they cut it cloſe on each ſide of their heads, down to their ears and leave a ridge, of the breadth of a ſmall hand, extending from the forehead to the neck; which, when the hair is pretty thick and curling, reſembles, in point of form, the creſt of the helmet of an ancient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. Some of them wear great quantities of falſe hair, flowing in long ringlets down their backs; while others tie it into one round bunch on the upper part of their heads, nearly as large as the head itſelf; and ſome into ſix or ſeven ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate bunches. They uſe, for the purpoſe of daubing or ſmearing their hair, a greyiſh clay, mixed with ſhells reduced to powder, which they keep in balls, and chew into a ſort of paſte, whenever they intend to make uſe of it. This compoſition preſerves the ſmoothneſs of the hair, and changes it, in proceſs of time, to a palo yellow.</p>

                        <pb n="301" facs="unknown:030274_1131_0FE5763501EEEF20"/>Necklaces, conſiſting of ſtrings of ſmall varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated ſhells, are worn by both men and women. They alſo wear an ornament, about two inches in length, and half an inch in breadth, ſhaped like the handle of a cup, and made of ſtone, wood, or ivory, extremely well poliſhed; this is hung round the neck by fine threads of twiſted hair, which are ſometimes doubled an hundred fold. Some of them, inſtead of this ornament, wear a ſmall human figure on their breaſt, formed of bone, and ſuſpended in a ſimilar manner.</p>
                     <p>Both ſexes make uſe of the fan, or fly-flap, by way of uſe and ornament. The moſt common ſort is compoſed of cocoa-nut fibres, tied looſely in bunches, to the top of a poliſhed handle. The tail-feathers of the cock, and thoſe of the tropic-bird, are uſed for the ſame purpoſe. Thoſe that are moſt in eſteem, are ſuch as have the handle formed of the leg or arm bones of an enemy killed in battle; theſe are preſerved with extraordinary care, and are handed down, from father to ſon, as trophies of the higheſt value.</p>
                     <p>The practice of <hi>tatooing,</hi> or puncturing the body, prevails among theſe people; and of all the iſlands in this ocean, it is only at New-Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the Sandwich Iſles, that the face is <hi>tatooed.</hi> There is this difference between theſe two nations, that the New-Zealanders perform this operation in elegant ſpiral volutes, and the
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:030274_1132_0FE576A3E545E2A8"/>
Sandwich Iſlanders in ſtraight lines, that interſect each other at right angles.</p>
                     <p>Some of the natives had half their body, from head to foot <hi>tatooed,</hi> which gave them a moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearance. It is generally done with great neatneſs and regularity. Several of them have only an arm thus marked; others, a leg; ſome, again, <hi>tatoo</hi> both an arm and a leg; and others only the hand. The hands and arms of the women are punctured in a very neat manner; and they have a remarkable cuſtom of <hi>tatooing</hi> the tip of the tongues of ſome of the females. We had ſome reaſon to imagine, that the practice of puncturing is often intended as a ſign of mourning, on the deceaſe of a chief, or any other calamitous occurrence: for we were frequently informed that ſuch a mark was in memory of ſuch a chief; and ſo of the others. The people of the loweſt order are <hi>tatooed</hi> with a particular mark, which diſtinguiſhes them as the property of the chiefs to whom they are reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject.</p>
                     <p>The common dreſs of the men of all ranks conſiſts, in general, of a piece of thick cloth called the <hi>maro,</hi> about a foot in breadth, which paſſes between the legs, and is faſtened round the waiſt. Their mats, which are of various ſizes, but, for the moſt part, about five feet in length, and four in breadth, are thrown over their ſhoulders, and brought forward before. Theſe, however, are rarely made uſe of, except in time
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:030274_1133_0FE5761DCE6B0E28"/>
of war, for which purpoſe they appear to be better calculated than for common uſe, ſince they are of a thick heavy texture, and capable of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blow of a ſtone or of any blunt weapon. They generally go bare-footed, except when they travel over burnt ſtones, on which occaſion they ſecure their feet with a kind of ſandal, which is made of cords, twiſted from cocoa-nut fibres.</p>
                     <p>Beſides their ordinary dreſs, there is another, which is appropriated to their chiefs, and worn only on extraordinary occaſions. It conſiſts of a feathered cloak and cap, or helmet, of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beauty and magnificence. This dreſs having been minutely deſcribed, in a former part of our work, we have only to add, that theſe cloaks are of different lengths, in proportion to the rank of the perſon who wears them; ſome trailing on the ground, and others no lower than the middle. The chiefs of inferior rank have likewiſe a ſhort cloak, which reſembles the former, and is made of the long tail-feathers of the cock, the man-of-war bird, and the tropic-bird, having a broad border of ſmall yellow and red feathers, and alſo a collar of the ſame. Others are compoſed of white feathers with variegated borders. The cap or helmet, has a ſtrong lining of wicker-work, ſufficient to break the blow of any warlike weapon; for which purpoſe it appears to be intended. Theſe feathered dreſſes ſeemed to be very ſcarce, and to be worn only by the male ſex. During
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:030274_1134_0FE576B9B54DFB18"/>
our whole continuance in Karakakooa Bay, we never obſerved them uſed, except on three occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; firſt in the remarkable ceremony of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeoboo's firſt viſit to our ſhips; ſecondly, by ſome chiefs, who appeared among the crowd on ſhore, when our unfortunate commander was killed; and thirdly, when his bones were brought to us by Eappo.</p>
                     <p>The ſtriking reſemblance of this habit to the cloak and helmet which the Spaniards formerly wore, excited our curioſity to enquire, whether there might not be ſome reaſonable grounds for imagining that it had been borrowed from them. After all our endeavours to gain information on this head, we found, that the natives had no immediate acquaintance with any other people whatever; and that no tradition exiſted among them of theſe iſlands having ever before received a viſit from ſuch veſſels as our's. However, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the reſult of our enquiries on this ſubject, the form of this habit ſeems to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient indication of its European origin; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when we reflect on another circumſtance, viz. that it is a remarkable deviation from the general agreement of dreſs, which is prevalent among the ſeveral branches of this great tribe, diſperſed over the Pacific Ocean. From this concluſion, we were induced to ſuppoſe, that ſome Buccaneer, or Spaniſh ſhip, might have been wrecked in the neighbourhood of theſe
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:030274_1135_0FE5760895AC81F8"/>
iſlands. When it is conſidered, that the courſe of the Spaniſh trading veſſels from Acapulco to Manilla, is not many degrees to the ſouth of the Sandwich Iſles, in their paſſage out, and to the north, on their return, this ſuppoſition will not, we think, be deemed improbable.</p>
                     <p>There is very little difference between the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dreſs of the men and that of the women. The latter wear a piece of cloth wrapped round the waiſt, which deſcends half way down their thighs; and ſometimes, during the cool of the evening, they throw looſe pieces of fine cloth over their ſhoulders, like the Otaheitean females. The <hi>pan</hi> is another dreſs, which the younger part of the ſex often wear; it conſiſts of the thinneſt and fineſt cloth, wrapped ſeveral times about the middle, and reaching down to the leg; ſo that it has the appearance of a full ſhort petticoat. They cut their hair ſhort behind, and turn it up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as is the cuſtom among the New-Zealanders and Otaheiteans. One woman, indeed, whom we ſaw in Karakakooa Bay, had her hair arranged in a very ſingular mode; ſhe had turned it up behind, and having brought it over her forehead, and doubled it back, ſo that it formed a ſort of ſhade to her face, and ſomewhat reſembled a ſmall bonnet.</p>
                     <p>Beſides their necklaces, which are compoſed of ſhells, or of a ſhining, hard, red berry, they wear dried flowers of the Indian mallow, formed
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:030274_1136_0FE5768397FB5BC8"/>
into wreaths; and likewiſe another elegant orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, termed <hi>craie,</hi> which is ſometimes faſtened round the hair, in the manner of a garland, but is uſually put round the neck; though it is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally worn in both theſe ways at once, as may be ſeen in the annexed repreſentation of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Sandwich Iſlands. It is a kind of ruff, about as thick as a finger, formed with great ingenuity, of very ſmall feathers, woven together ſo cloſely, that the ſurface may be ſaid to equal the richeſt velvet in ſmoothneſs. The ground is, in general, red, with alternate circles of black, yellow, and green.</p>
                     <p>We have already deſcribed their bracelets, of which they have a great variety. Some of the women of Atooi wear ſmall figures of the turtle, made very neatly of ivory or wood, faſtened on their fingers in the ſame manner that rings are worn by us. There is likewiſe an ornament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſhells, tied in rows on a ground of ſtrong net-work, ſo as to ſtrike againſt each other, while in motion; which both ſexes, when they dance, faſten either round the ankles, or juſt below the knee, or round the arm. They ſometimes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſhells, uſe for this purpoſe, the teeth of dogs, and a hard red berry.</p>
                     <p>Another ornament, if indeed it deſerves that appellation, remains to be deſcribed. It is a ſort of maſk, compoſed of a large gourd, having holes cut in it for the noſe and eyes. The top of it is
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:030274_1137_0FE576A6028CF828"/>
ſtuck full of little green twigs, which appear, at ſome diſtance, like a waving plume; and the lower part has narrow ſtripes of cloth hanging from it, ſomewhat reſembling a beard, Theſe maſks we never ſaw worn but on two occaſions, and both times by a number of perſons aſſembled in a canoe, who approached the ſide of the ſhip, laughing and making droll geſticulations. We could never learn whether they were not alſo made uſe of as a defence for the head againſt ſtones, or in ſome of their public ſports and games, or were diſguiſed merely for the purpoſes of mummery.</p>
                     <p>They dwell together in ſmall towns or villages, which contain from about one hundred to two hundred houſes, built pretty cloſe to each other without order or regularity, and have a winding path that leads through them. They are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently flanked towards the ſea-ſide, with looſe detached walls, which are, in all probability, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for ſhelter, and defence. The form of their habitations, we have before deſcribed. They are of various dimenſions, from forty-five feet by twenty-four, to eighteen by twelve. Some are of a larger ſize, being fifty feet in length, and thirty in breadth, and entirely open at one end. Theſe, we were informed, were deſigned for the accommodation of ſtrangers or travellers, whoſe ſtay was likely to be ſhort.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="308" facs="unknown:030274_1138_0FE5764C97295240"/>Their furniture having been already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we have only to add, that, at one end of their houſes, are mats, on which they repoſe, with wooden pillows, or ſleeping-ſtools, perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe of the Chineſe. Some of the beſt houſes have a court-yard before them, railed in very neatly, with ſmaller habitations for ſervants erected round it: in this area the family uſually eat and ſit in the day-time. In the ſides of the hills and amongſt the ſteep rocks, we ſaw ſeveral holes or caves, which ſeemed to be inhabited; but, the entrance being defended by wicker-work, and, in the only one that we viſited, a ſtone fence being obſerved running acroſs it within, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they were chiefly intended as places of retreat, in caſe of an attack from enemies.</p>
                     <p>The people of an inferior claſs feed principally on fiſh, and vegetables, ſuch as plantains, bread-fruit, ſweet-potatoes, ſugar-canes, yams, and <hi>taro.</hi> To theſe, perſons of ſuperior rank add the fleſh of dogs and hogs, dreſſed after the ſame method that is practiſed in the Society's Iſles. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eat fowls of a domeſtic kind, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are neither plentiful, nor in any great degree of eſtimation.</p>
                     <p>Though, on our firſt arrival at theſe iſlands, yams and bread-fruit ſeemed ſcarce, we did not find this to be the caſe on our ſecond viſit: it is therefore probable, that, as theſe vegetable articles were commonly planted in the interior parts of
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:030274_1139_0FE5769CEABFCD48"/>
the country, the iſlanders had not had ſufficient time for bringing them down to us, during our ſhort continuance in Wymoa bay, on our firſt viſit.</p>
                     <p>They ſalt their fiſh, and preſerve them in gourd-ſhells; not, indeed, with a view of providing againſt an occaſional ſcarcity, but from the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they have for ſalted proviſions; for we alſo found, that the chiefs frequently had pieces of pork pickled in the ſame manner, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a great delicacy. Their cookery is much the ſame as at the Friendly and Society Iſlands; and though ſome of our people diſliked their <hi>taro</hi> puddings, on account of their ſourneſs, others were of a different opinion. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they had not acquired the art of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the bread-fruit, and making of it the ſour paſte named <hi>maihee,</hi> as is the practice at the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety Iſles; and it afforded us great ſatisfaction, that we had it in our power to communicate to them this uſeful ſecret, in return for the generous and hoſpitable treatment we received from them.</p>
                     <p>They are very cleanly at their meals; and their method of dreſſing both their vegetable and animal food, was univerſally acknowledged to be ſuperior to ours. The <hi>Erees</hi> conſtantly begin their meals with a doſe of the extract of pepper-root, or <hi>ava,</hi> prepared in the uſual mode. The women eat apart from the other ſex, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, as before obſerved, from feeding on pork,
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:030274_1140_0FE576C9210EB908"/>
turtle, and ſome particular ſpecies of plantains. Notwithſtanding this interdiction, they would privately eat pork with us; but we could never prevail on them to taſte the two latter articles of food.</p>
                     <p>They generally riſe with the ſun; and, after having enjoyed the cool of the evening, retire to their repoſe a few hours after ſun-ſet. The <hi>Erees</hi> are occupied in making canoes and mats; the <hi>Towtows</hi> are chiefly employed in the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo in fiſhing; and the women are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the manufactory of cloth. They amuſe themſelves in their leiſure hours, with various diverſions. Their young perſons, of both ſexes, are fond of dancing; and, on more ſolemn oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, they entertain themſelves with wreſtling and boxing matches, performed after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the natives of the Friendly Iſlands; to whom, however, they are greatly inferior in all theſe reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Their dances, which bear a greater reſemblance to thoſe of the New-Zealanders, than of the Friendly or Society Iſlanders, are introduced with a ſolemn kind of ſong, in which the whole number join, the ſame time ſlowly moving their legs, and gently ſtriking their breaſts; their attitudes and manner being very eaſy and graceful. So far they reſemble the dances of the Society Iſles. After this has continued for the ſpace of about ten minutes, they gradually quicken both the
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:030274_1141_0FE5770EB006EC00"/>
tune and the motions, and do not deſiſt till they are oppreſſed with fatigue. This part of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is the counterpart of that of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of New-Zealand; and, as among thoſe people, the perſon whoſe action is the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and who continues this exerciſe the longeſt, is applauded by the ſpectators as the beſt dancer. It muſt be remarked, that, in this dance, the females only engage; and that the dances of the men reſemble what we ſaw of the ſmall parties at the Friendly Iſles; and which may, perhaps, more properly be termed the accompaniment of ſongs, with correſpondent motions of the whole body. But as we ſaw ſome boxing exhibitions, of the ſame kind with thoſe we had ſeen at the Friendly Iſles, it is not improbable that they had likewiſe here their grand ceremonious dances, wherein numbers both of men and women were performers.</p>
                     <p>The muſic of theſe people is of a rude kind; for the only muſical inſtruments that we obſerved among them, were drums of various ſizes. Their ſongs, however, which they are ſaid to ſing in parts,<note n="*" place="bottom">The circumſtance of their ſinging in parts, has been doubted by ſeveral perſons of great ſkill in muſic. Captain Burney, however, and Captain Phillips of the marines, both of whom have ſome knowledge of muſic, are ſtrongly of opinion, that they did ſing, in parts; that is, they ſung together in different notes.</note> and which they accompany with a gentle
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:030274_1142_0FE576FF9D090F48"/>
motion of their arms, like the inhabitants of the Friendly Iſlands, have a very pleaſing effect.</p>
                     <p>They are greatly addicted to gambling. One of their games reſembles our game of draughts; but, from the number of ſquares, it ſeems to be much more intricate. The board is of the length of about two feet, and is divided into two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty-eight ſquares, fourteen in a row. In this game they uſe black and white pebbles, which they move from one ſquare to another. Another of their games conſiſts in concealing a ſtone under ſome cloth, which is ſpread out by one of the parties, and rumpled in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it is difficult to diſtinguiſh where the ſtone lies. The antagoniſt then ſtrikes, with a ſtick, that part of the cloth where he ſuppoſes the ſtone to be: and the chances being, upon the whole, againſt his hitting it, odds of all degrees, varying with the opinion of the dexterity of the parties, are laid on the occaſion. Their manner of playing at bowls nearly reſembles ours: the bowls have been before deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>They often entertain themſelves with races be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween boys and girls, on which occaſions they lay wagers with great ſpirit. We ſaw a man beating his breaſt, and tearing his hair, in the violence of rage, for having loſt three hatchets at one of theſe races, which he had purchaſed from us with near half his property a very little time before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="313" facs="unknown:030274_1143_0FE576A786850588"/>Both ſexes are ſurpriſingly expert in ſwimming, which, among theſe people, is not only deemed a neceſſary art, but is alſo a favourite diverſion. One particular method, in which we ſometimes ſaw them amuſe themſelves with this exerciſe, in Karakakooa Bay, deſerves to be related. The ſurf, that breaks on the coaſt around this bay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends about one hundred and fifty yards from the ſhore; and, within that ſpace, the ſurges of the ſea are daſhed againſt the beach with extreme vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Whenever the impetuoſity of the ſurf is augmented to its greateſt height, they make choice of that time for this amuſement, which they perform in the following manner. About twenty or thirty of the iſlanders take each a long narrow board, rounded at both ends, and ſet out from the ſhore in company with each other. They plunge under the firſt wave they meet, and, after they have ſuffered it to roll over them, riſe again beyond it, and ſwim further out into the ſea. They encounter the ſecond wave in the ſame manner with the firſt. The principal difficulty conſiſts in ſeizing a favourable opportunity of diving under it; for if a perſon miſſes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per moment, he is caught by the ſurf, and forced back with great violence; and his utmoſt dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity is then required, to prevent his being daſhed againſt the rocks. When, in conſequence of theſe repeated efforts, they have gained the ſmooth water beyond the ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hey recline themſelves at
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:030274_1144_0FE576CD819FB9C8"/>
length upon their board, and prepare for their return to ſhore. As the ſurf is compoſed of a number of waves, of which every third is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be conſiderable larger than the reſt, and to flow higher upon the ſhore, while the others break in the intermediate ſpace; their firſt object is to place themſelves on the top of the largeſt ſurge, which drives them along with aſtoniſhing rapidity towards the land. If they ſhould place themſelves, by miſtake, on one of the ſmaller waves, which breaks before they gain the ſhore, or ſhould find themſelves unable to keep their board in a proper direction on the upper part of the ſwell, they remain expoſed to the fury of the next; to avoid which, they are under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of diving again, and regaining the place whence they ſet out. Thoſe perſons who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their object of reaching the ſhore, are ſtill in a very hazardous ſituation. As the coaſt is defended by a chain of rocks, with a ſmall opening between them in ſeveral places, they are obliged to ſteer their planks through one of theſe openings; or, in caſe of ill ſucceſs in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to quit it before they reach the rocks, and, diving under the wave, make their way back again as well as they are able. This is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as highly diſgraceful, and is attended with the loſs of the plank, which we have ſeen daſhed to pieces, at the very inſtant the native quitted it. The amazing courage and addreſs, with
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:030274_1145_0FE576A98DED8570"/>
which they perform theſe dangerous manoeuvres, are almoſt incredible.</p>
                     <p>The following accident ſhews at how early a period they are ſo far accuſtomed to the water, as to loſe all apprehenſions of it, and ſet its perils at defiance. A canoe, in which was a woman with her children, happening to be overſet, one of the children, an infant about four years of age, appeared to be greatly delighted with what had happened, ſwimming about at its eaſe, and playing a number of tricks, till the canoe was brought to its former poſition.</p>
                     <p>Among the amuſements of the children, we obſerved one that was frequently played at, and which ſhewed a conſiderable ſhare of dexterity. They take a ſhort ſtick, through one extremity of which runs a peg ſharpened at both ends, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about an inch on each ſide; then throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a ball formed of green leaves moulded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and faſtened with twine, they catch it on one of the points of the peg; immediately after which, they throw it up again from the peg, then turn the ſtick round, and catch the ball on the other point of the peg. Thus, for ſome time, they continue catching it on each point of the peg alternately, without miſſing it. They are equally expert at another diverſion of a ſimilar nature, throwing up in the air, and catching, in their turns, many of theſe balls; and we have often ſeen little children thus keep five balls in
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:030274_1146_0FE57701A1889840"/>
motion at once. This latter game is alſo prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the young people at the Friendly Iſles.</p>
                     <p>The figure and dimenſions of the canoes ſeen by us at Atooi, have been already deſcribed. Thoſe of the other Sandwich Iſlands were made exactly in the ſame manner; and the largeſt we ſaw was a double canoe that belonged to Terreeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boo, meaſuring ſeventy feet in length, twelve in breadth, and between three and four in depth; and each was hollowed out of one tree.</p>
                     <p>Their method of agriculture, as well as naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſembles that of the other iſlands of the Pacific. They have made conſiderable proficiency in ſculpture, and their ſkill in painting or ſtaining cloth, and in the manufacture of mats, is very great. The moſt curious ſpecimens of their ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we had an opportunity of obſerving, were the wooden bowls, in which the <hi>Erees</hi> drink <hi>ava.</hi> Theſe are, in general, eight or ten inches in diameter, perfectly round, and extremely well poliſhed. They are ſupported by three or four ſmall human figures, repreſented in different attitudes. Some of them reſt on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their ſupporters, others on the hands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over the head; and ſome on the head and hands. The figures are very neatly finiſhed, and accurately proportioned; and even the anatomy of the muſcles is well expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>They manufacture their cloth in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and of the ſame materials, as at the Society
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:030274_1147_0FE5771427FAE8B8"/>
and Friendly Iſles. That which they intend to paint, is of a ſtrong and thick texture, ſeveral folds being beaten and incorporated together; after which they cut it in breadths, two or three feet wide, and then paint it in a great variety of patterns, with ſuch regularity and comprehenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of deſign, as ſhew an extraordinary portion of taſte and fancy. The exactneſs with which even the moſt intricate patterns are continued, is really aſtoniſhing, as they have no ſtamps, and as the whole is performed by the eye, with a piece of bamboo cane dipped in paint; the hand being ſupported by another piece of the ſame ſort of cane. They extract their colours from the ſame berries, and other vegetable articles, which are made uſe of at Otaheite for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>The operation of ſtaining or painting their cloth, is confined to the females, and is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>kipparee.</hi> It is remarkable, that they always called our writing by this name. The young women would frequently take the pen from our hands, and ſhew us, that they were as well acquainted with the uſe of it as we ourſelves were; telling us, at the ſame time, that our pens were inferior to theirs. They conſidered a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript ſheet of paper, as a piece of cloth ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped after the mode of our country; and it was with the greateſt difficulty that we could make
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:030274_1148_0FE576D6868C77C8"/>
them underſtand, that our figures contained a meaning in them which theirs were deſtitute of.</p>
                     <p>They make their mats of the leaves of the <hi>pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus;</hi> and theſe, as well as their cloths, are beautifully worked in various patterns, and ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with various colours. Some of them have a ground of a ſtraw colour, embelliſhed with green ſpots; others are of a pale green, ſpotted with ſquares, or rhomboids, of red; and ſome are ornamented with elegant ſtripes, either in ſtraight or waving lines of brown and red. In this branch of manufacture, whether we regard the fineneſs, beauty, or ſtrength, theſe iſlanders may be ſaid to excel the whole world.</p>
                     <p>Their fiſhing-hooks are of various ſizes and figures; but thoſe which are principally made uſe of, are about two or three inches in length, and are formed in the ſhape of a ſmall fiſh, ſerving as a bait, with a bunch of feathers faſtened to the head or tail. They make their hooks of bone, mother-of-pearl, or wood, pointed and barbed with little bones or tortoiſe-ſhells. Thoſe with which they fiſh for ſharks, are very large, being, in general, of the length of ſix or eight inches. Conſidering the materials of which theſe hooks are compoſed, their neatneſs and ſtrength are amazing; and, indeed, upon trial, we found them ſuperior to our own.</p>
                     <p>Of the bark of the <hi>touta,</hi> or cloth-tree, neatly twiſted, they form the line which they uſe for
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:030274_1149_0FE577051C1B09B0"/>
fiſhing, for making nets, and for ſome other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. It is of different degrees of fineneſs, and may be continued to any length. They have alſo a finer ſort, which they make of the bark of a ſhrub, named <hi>areemah;</hi> and the fineſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of human hair: this laſt, however, is chiefly made uſe of for matters of ornament.</p>
                     <p>They likewiſe make cordage of a ſtronger kind, from cocoa-nut fibres for the rigging of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes. Some of this, which was purchaſed by us for our own uſe, was found to be well calculated for the ſmaller kinds of running rigging. They alſo manufacture another ſort of cordage, which is flat, and extremely ſtrong, and is principally uſed for the purpoſe of laſhing the roofs of their houſes. This laſt is not twiſted after the manner of the former ſorts, but is formed of the fibrous ſtrings of the coat of the cocoa-nut, plaited with the fingers, in the ſame mode which is practiſed by our ſeamen in making their points for the reefing of ſails.</p>
                     <p>They apply their gourds to various domeſtic purpoſes. Theſe grow to ſuch an enormous mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, that ſome of them will contain from ten to a dozen gallons. In order to adapt them the better to their reſpective uſes, they take care to give them different ſhapes, by faſtening ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages round them during their growth. Thus, ſome of them are in the form of a diſh, ſerving to hold their puddings, vegetables, ſalted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:030274_1150_0FE576F7AA805B18"/>
ſalt, &amp;c. Others are of a long cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical form, and ſerve to contain their fiſhing-tackle, which two ſorts are furniſhed with neat cloſe covers, made alſo of the gourd. Others are in the ſhape of a long-necked bottle; and, in theſe, water is kept. They frequently ſcore them with a heated inſtrument, ſo as to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to them the appearance of being painted, in a great variety of elegant deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Their pans, in which they make ſalt, are made of earth, lined with clay; and are in general, ſix or eight feet ſquare, and about two-thirds of a foot in depth. They are elevated on a bank of ſtones near the high-water mark, whence the ſalt water is conducted to the bottom of them, in trenches out of which they are all filled; and, in a ſhort time, the ſun performs the proceſs of evaporation. The ſalt we met with at Oneeheow and Atooi, during our firſt viſit, was browniſh and rather dirty; but that which we afterwards procured at Karakakooa Bay, was white, and of an excellent quality; and we obtained an ample ſupply of it, inſomuch that, beſides the quantity uſed by us in ſalting pork, we filled all our empty caſks with it.</p>
                     <p>The warlike weapons of theſe people are dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which they call by the name <hi>pahooa;</hi> ſpears, ſlings, and clubs. The <hi>pahooa</hi> is made of a black heavy wood, that reſembles ebony. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly from one to two feet in length; and has
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:030274_1151_0FE576B0D001E680"/>
a ſtring paſſing through the handle, by which it is ſuſpended to the arm. The blade is ſomewhat rounded in the middle; the ſides are ſharp, and terminate in a point. This inſtrument is intended for cloſe engagements; and, in the hands of the natives, is a very deſtructive one.</p>
                     <p>Their ſpears are of two kinds, and are formed of a hard wood, which, in its appearace, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like mahogany. One ſort is from ſix to eight feet in length, well poliſhed, and increaſing gradually in thickneſs from the extremity till within the diſtance of ſix or ſeven inches from the point, which tapers ſuddenly, and has five or ſix rows of barbs. It is probable, that theſe are uſed in the way of javelins. The other ſort, with which the warriors we ſaw at Atooi and Owhyhee were chiefly armed, are from twelve to fifteen feet in length; and, inſtead of being barbed, terminate towards the point in the manner of their daggers.</p>
                     <p>Their ſlings are the ſame with our common ſlings, except in this reſpect, that the ſtone is lodging on matting inſtead of leather. Their clubs are formed indifferently of ſeveral kinds of wood: they are of various ſizes and ſhapes, and of rude workmanſhip.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the Sandwich Iſlands, the inhabitants are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three claſſes. The <hi>Erees,</hi> or chiefs of each diſtrict, are the firſt; and one of theſe is ſuperior to the reſt, who is called, at Owhyhee, <hi>Eree-taboo,</hi> and <hi>Eree Moee;</hi> the firſt name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his authority, and the latter ſignifying that, in his preſence, all muſt proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thoſe of the ſecond claſs appear to enjoy a right of property, but have no authority. Thoſe who compoſe the third claſs, are called
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:030274_1153_0FE576DFC67AC488"/>
                        <hi>towtows,</hi> or ſervants, and have not either rank or property.</p>
                     <p>The ſuperior power and diſtinction of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeoboo, the Eree-taboo of Owhyhee, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evident from his reception at Karakakooa, on his firſt arrival. The inhabitants all proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated themſelves at the entrance of their houſes; and the canoes were <hi>tabooed,</hi> till he diſcharged the interdict. He was then juſt returned from Mowee, an iſland he was contending for, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his ſon Tewarro, whoſe wife was the only child of the king of that place, againſt Tahee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terree, his ſurviving brother. In this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was attended by many of his warriors; but we could never learn whether they ſerved him as volunteers, or whether they held their rank and property by that tenure.</p>
                     <p>That the ſubordinate chiefs are tributary to him, is evidently proved in the inſtance of Kaoo, which has been already related. It has alſo been obſerved, that the two moſt powerful chiefs of the Sandwich Iſlands, are Terreeoboo, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeoranne; the former being chief of Owhyhee, and the latter of Woahoo; all the ſmaller iſles being governed by one of theſe ſovereigns; Mowee was at this time, claimed by Terreeoboo, for his ſon and intended ſucceſſor; Atooi and Oneehow being in the poſſeſſion of the grandſons of Perreeorannee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="324" facs="unknown:030274_1154_0FE576030FBD8698"/>Without entering into the genealogy of the kings of Owhyhee and Mowee, it may be neceſſary to mention, that when we were firſt off Mowee, Terreeoboo and his warriors were there to ſupport the claims made by his wife, his ſon, and his daughter-in-law; and a battle had then been fought with the oppoſite party, in which Terreeoboo had been victorious. Matters, however, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards compromiſed; Taheeterree was to have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the three neighbouring iſlands, during his life; Teewarro to be acknowledged the Chief of Mowee, and to ſucceed to Owhyhee, on the death of Terreeoboo; together with the three iſlands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to Mowee, after the deceaſe of Taheeterre. If Teewarro, who has lately married his half ſiſter, ſhould die, and leave no iſſue behind him, thoſe iſlands deſcend to Maiha-maiha, whom we have frequently mentioned, he being the ſon of Terreeoboo's deceaſed brother: and ſhould he die without iſſue it is doubtful who would be the ſucceſſor, for Terreeoboo's two youngeſt ſons, being born of a mother who had no rank, would be debarred all right of ſucceſſion. We did not ſee Queen Rora-rora, whom Terreeoboo had left at Mowee; but we had an opportunity of ſeeing Kanee Kaberaia, the mother of the two youths of whom he was ſo extremely fond.</p>
                     <p>From what has been already mentioned, it appears pretty clearly that their government is
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:030274_1155_0FE576BDA4463588"/>
hereditary; whence it appears probable, that the inferior titles as well as property, deſcend in the ſame courſe. Reſpecting Perreorannee, we only diſcovered that he is an <hi>Eree-taboo;</hi> that he was, on ſome pretence, invading the poſſeſſion of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeterree, and that the iſlands to leeward were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his grandſons.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Erees</hi> appear to have unlimited power over the inferior claſſes of people; many inſtances of which occurred daily whilſt we continued among them. On the other hand, the people are implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient. It is remarkable, however, that we never ſaw the chiefs exerciſe any acts of cruelty, injuſtice, or inſolence towards them; though they put in practice their power over each other, in a moſt tyrannical degree: which is fully proved by the two following inſtances.</p>
                     <p>One of the lower order of chiefs, having ſhewn great civility to the maſter of the ſhip, on his examination of Karakakooa Bay; Mr. King, ſome time afterwards, took him on board the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and introduced him to Captain Cook, who engaged him to dine with us. While we remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at table, Pareea entered, whoſe countenance manifeſted the higheſt indignation at ſeeing our gueſt ſo honourably entertained. He ſeized him by the hair of the head, and would have dragged him out of the cabin, if the Captain had not interfered. After much altercation, we could obtain no other indulgence (without quarrelling
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:030274_1156_0FE5771740CA31B8"/>
with Pareea) than that our gueſt ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to remain in the cabin, on condition that he ſeated himſelf on the floor, while Pareea occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied his place at the table. An inſtance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſimilar, happened when Terreeoboo came firſt on board the Reſolution; when Maiha-maiha, who attended him, ſeeing Pareea upon deck, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him moſt ignominiouſly out of the ſhip; even though we knew Pareea to be a man of the firſt conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Whether the lower claſs have their property ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, from the rapacity of the great chiefs, we cannot certainly ſay, but it appears to be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected againſt theft and depredation. All their plantations, their houſes, their hogs, and their cloth, are left unguarded, without fear or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. In the plain country, they ſeparate their poſſeſſions by walls; and, in the woods where horſe plantains grow, they uſe white flags to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate property, in the ſame manner as they do bunches of leaves at Otaheite. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſtrongly indicate, that, where property is concerned, the power of the chiefs is not arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but ſo far limited, as to afford encouragement to the inferior orders to cultivate the ſoil, which they occupy diſtinct from each other.</p>
                     <p>The information we could obtain, reſpecting their adminiſtration of juſtice, is exceedingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. If a quarrel aroſe among the lower claſs of people, the matter was referred to the
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:030274_1157_0FE576B43A49A950"/>
deciſion of ſome chief. If an inferior chief had offended one of ſuperior rank, his puniſhment was dictated by the feelings of the ſuperior at that moment. If he ſhould fortunately eſcape the firſt tranſports of his rage, he, perhaps, found means, through the mediation of others, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for his offence, by all, or a part of his effects.</p>
                     <p>Their religion reſembles that of the Society and Friendly Iſlands. In common with each other, they have all their <hi>Morais,</hi> their <hi>Whattas</hi> their ſacred ſongs, and their ſacrifices. Theſe are convincing proofs that their religious opinions are derived from the ſame ſource. The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies here are, indeed, longer and more numerous than in the iſlands above-mentioned. And though in all theſe places, the care and performance of their religious rights, is committed to a particular claſs of people; yet we have never found a regular ſociety of prieſts, till we arrived at Kakooa, in Karakakooa Bay. <hi>Orono</hi> was the title given to the principal of this order; a title which ſeemed to imply ſomething highly ſacred, and which almoſt received adoration in the perſon of Omeeah. The privilege of holding the principal offices in this order, is doubtleſs limited to certain families. Omeeah, the <hi>Orono,</hi> was Kaoo's ſon, and Kairee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keea's nephew. Kaireekeea preſided in all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ceremonies at the <hi>morai,</hi> in the abſence of his grandfather. It was obſerved, likewiſe, that
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:030274_1158_0FE57724352F5370"/>
the ſon of Omeeah, an infant of about the age of five years, had always a number of attendants, and ſuch other marks of attention and eſteem were ſhewn him, as we never obſerved in any ſimilar inſtance. Hence we concluded, that his life was an object of much conſequence, and that he would eventually ſucceed to the high dignity of his father.</p>
                     <p>The title of <hi>Orono,</hi> we have already obſerved, was beſtowed upon Captain Cook; and it is very certain that they conſidered us as a race of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſuperior to themſelves; frequently repeating, that great <hi>Eatooa</hi> lived in our country. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite little idol (which has been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed) on the <hi>morai,</hi> in Karakakooa Bay, is called <hi>Koonoorackaiee,</hi> and is ſaid to be Terreoboo's god, who alſo reſided amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>Infinite variety of theſe images were to be ſeen, both on the <hi>morai,</hi> and about their houſes, on which they beſtow different names; but they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were held in very little eſtimation, from their contemptuous expreſſions of them, and from their expoſing them to ſale for trifles; though they generally had one particular figure in high favour, to which, whilſt it continued a favourite, all their adoration was addreſſed. They arrayed it in red cloth, beat their drums, and ſang hymns before it; placed bunches of red feathers, and different vegetables at its feet; and frequently
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:030274_1159_0FE576922C791220"/>
expoſed a pig, or a dog, to rot on the <hi>Whatta,</hi> near which it was placed.</p>
                     <p>A party of us were conducted to a large houſe, in a bay to the ſouthward of Karakakooa, in which we beheld the black figure of a man, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his toes and fingers, and his head was inclined backwards; the limbs were well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, and the whole was beautifully poliſhed. This figure was called <hi>Maee;</hi> round which thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen others were placed, with ſhapes rude and diſtorted. Theſe, we were told, were the Eatooas of deceaſed chiefs, whoſe names they repeated. Plenty of <hi>Whattas</hi> were ſeen within the place, with the remains of offerings on many of them. They alſo admit into their houſes, many ludicrous and obſcene idols, not unlike the Priapus of the ancients.</p>
                     <p>Former voyagers have remarked, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Friendly Iſlanders, pay adoration to particular birds; and it ſeems to be a cuſtom that is prevalent in theſe iſlands. Ravens are perhaps the object of it here; for Mr. King ſaw two of theſe birds perfectly tame, at the village of Kakooa, and was told they were <hi>Eatooas;</hi> he offered ſeveral articles for them, which were all refuſed; and he was particularly cautioned not to hurt or offend them.</p>
                     <p>The prayers and offerings, made by the prieſts before their meals, may be claſſed among their religious ceremonies. As they always drink <hi>ava</hi>
                        <pb n="330" facs="unknown:030274_1160_0FE5770B38C87BD8"/>
before they begin their repaſt, whilſt that is chewing, the ſuperior in rank begins a ſort of hymn, in which he is ſoon after joined by one or more of the company; the bodies of the others are put in motion, and their hands are gently clapped together in concert with the ſingers. The <hi>ava</hi> being ready, cups of it are preſented to thoſe who do not join in the hymn, which are held in their hands till it is concluded; when, with united voice, they make a loud reſponſe, and drink their <hi>ava.</hi> The performers are then ſerved with ſome of it which they drink, after the ſame ceremony has been repeated. And, if any perſon of a very ſuperior rank ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, a cup is preſented to him laſt of all. After chanting for a ſhort time, and hearing a reſponſive chant from the others, he pours a ſmall quantity on the ground, and drinks the reſt. A piece of the fleſh, which has been dreſſed, is then cut off, and, together with ſome of the vegetables, is placed at the foot of the figure of the Eatooa; and after another hymn has been chanted, they begin their meal. A ceremony, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects reſembling this, is alſo performed by the chiefs, when they drink <hi>ava</hi> between their regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meals.</p>
                     <p>According to the accounts given by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, human ſacrifices are more common here, than in any of the iſlands we have viſited. They have recourſe to theſe horrid rites on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:030274_1161_0FE57636EAA1D180"/>
of a war and previous to every great battle, or other ſignal enterprize. The death of a chief demands a ſacrifice of one or more <hi>tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tows,</hi> according to the rank he bears; and we were informed that no leſs than ten were doomed to ſuffer, on the death of Terreeoboo. This practice, however, is the leſs horrible, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy victims are totally unacquainted with their fate. Thoſe who are deſtined to fall, are attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with large clubs, wherever they may happen to be; and after they are dead, are conveyed to the place where the ſubſequent rites are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. This brings to our remembrance the ſkulls of thoſe who had been ſacrificed on the deceaſe of ſome principal chief, and were fixed to the <hi>morai</hi> at Kakooa. At the village of Kow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowa, we received further information upon this ſubject; where we were ſhewn a ſmall piece of ground, within a ſtone fence, which we were told was an <hi>Heree-eere,</hi> or burying place of a chief. The perſon who gave us this information, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one of the corners added,—and there lie the <hi>tangata</hi> and <hi>waheene-taboo,</hi> or the man and woman who became ſacrifices at his funeral.</p>
                     <p>The knocking out their fore-teeth may be, with propriety, claſſed among their religious cuſtoms. Moſt of the common people, and many of the chiefs, had loſt one or more of them; and this we underſtood was conſidered as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice to the Eatooa, to avert his
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:030274_1162_0FE576FAB5AF5CC8"/>
anger; and not like the cutting off a part of the finger at the Friendly Iſlands, to expreſs the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their grief at the deceaſe of a friend.</p>
                     <p>Of their opinions, with reſpect to a future ſtate, we had very defective information. On enquiring of them, whither the dead were gone? We were told that the breath, which they ſeemed to conſider as the immortal part, was fled to the <hi>Eatooa.</hi> They ſeemed alſo to give a deſcription of ſome place, which they ſuppoſe to be the abode of the dead; but we could not learn that they had any idea of rewards or puniſhments.</p>
                     <p>An explanation of the word <hi>taboo,</hi> may not, in this place, be improperly introduced. On aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon of the intercourſe being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erdicted, between us and the Iſlanders, the day preceding Terreeoboo's arrival, we were informed, that the bay was <hi>tabooed.</hi> The ſame interdiction took place, by our deſire, when we interred the remains of Captain Cook. The moſt implicit obedience, in theſe two inſtances, was rendered by the natives; but whether on religious principles, or in deference to civil authority, we cannot pretend to determine.</p>
                     <p>The ground on which our obſervatories were fixed, and the place where our maſts were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, were <hi>tabooed,</hi> and the operation was equally efficacious. This conſecration was performed only by the prieſts; and yet, at our requeſt, the men ventured on the ſpot which was <hi>tabooed;</hi>

whence it ſhould ſeem they entertained no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious apprehenſions, their obedience being limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed merely to our refuſal. No inducements could bring the women near us; on account, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, of the <hi>morai</hi> adjoining; which they are, at all times, prohibited from approaching; not only here, but in all the iſlands of theſe ſeas.</p>
                     <p>Women, it has been obſerved, are always <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booed,</hi> or forbidden to eat certain articles of food. We have ſeen many of them, at their meals, have their meat put into their mouths by others; and, on our requeſting to know the reaſon of it, we were informed, that they were <hi>tabooed,</hi> and not permitted to feed themſelves. This prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was always the conſequence of aſſiſting at any funeral, touching a dead body, and many other occaſions. The word <hi>taboo</hi> is indifferently applied, either to perſons or things; as, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are <hi>tabooed,</hi> the bay is <hi>tabooed,</hi> &amp;c. This word is alſo expreſſive of any thing ſacred, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted or eminent. The king of Owhyhee was called <hi>Eree-taboo,</hi> and a human victim, <hi>tangata taboo:</hi> and, among the Friendly Iſlanders, Tonga, where the king reſides, is called <hi>Tongataboo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Very little can be ſaid reſpecting their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, except that ſuch a compact ſeems to exiſt among them. It has already been mentioned, that, when Terreeoboo had left his queen Rora-rora at Mowee, another woman cohabited with him, by whom he had children, and ſeemed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:030274_1164_0FE576E96ADF6EF0"/>
attached to her; but, whether poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy is allowed, or whether it is mixed with concubinage, either among the principal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior orders, we ſaw too little of, to warrant any concluſions. From what we ſaw of the domeſtic concerns of the lower claſs of people, one man and one woman ſeemed to have the direction of the houſe, and the children were ſubordinate to them, as in civilized countries.</p>
                     <p>The following is the only inſtance of any thing like jealouſy, which we have ſeen among them; and which ſhews, that among married women of rand not only fidelity, but even a degree of reſerve is required.</p>
                     <p>At one of their boxing matches, Omeah roſe two or three times from his place, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wife with ſtrong marks of diſpleaſure, commanding her, as we ſuppoſed, to withdraw. Whether he thought her beauty engaged too much of our attention, or whatever might be his motives, there certainly exiſted no real cauſe of jealouſy. She, however, continued in her place, and, at the concluſion of the entertainment, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our party; and even ſolicited ſome trifling preſents. She was informed that we had not any about us; but that, if ſhe would accompany us to the tent, ſhe ſhould be welcome to make a choice of what ſhe liked. She was accordingly, proceeding with us; which being obſerved by Omeah, he followed in great rage, ſeized her
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:030274_1165_0FE5769E715C9CA8"/>
by the hair, and, with his fiſts, began to inflict ſevere corporal puniſhment. Having been the innocent cauſe of this extraordinary treatment, we were exceedingly concerned at it; though we underſtood it would be highly improper for us to interfere, between huſband and wife of ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior rank. The natives, however, at length, interpoſed; and the next day, we had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of meeting them together, perfectly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with each other; and, what was extremely ſingular, the lady would not permit us to rally the huſband on his behaviour; which we had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to do; plainly telling us, that he had acted very properly.</p>
                     <p>At Karakakooa Bay, we had twice an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing a part of their funeral rites. Hearing of the death of an old chief, not far from our obſervatories, ſome of us repaired to the place, where we beheld a number of people aſſembled. They were ſeated round an area, fronting the houſe where the deceaſed lay; and a man, having on a red feathered cap, came to the door, conſtantly putting out his head, and making a moſt lamentable howl, accompanied with horrid grimaces, and violent diſtortions of the face. A large mat was afterwards ſpread upon the area, and thirteen women and two men, who came out of the houſe, ſat down upon it in three equal rows; three of the women, and the two men, being in front. The women had feathered
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:030274_1166_0FE5767B439CD9B8"/>
ruffs on their necks and hands; and their ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were decorated with broad green leaves, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſcolloped. Near a ſmall hut, at one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this area, half a dozen boys were placed, waving ſmall white banners, and <hi>taboo</hi> ſticks, who would not ſuffer us to approach them. Hence we imagined, that the dead body was depoſited in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut, but we were afterwards informed that it remained in the houſe, where the tricks were playing at the door, by the manin the red cap. The company, ſeated on the mat, ſung a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly tune, accompanied with a gentle motion of the arms and body. This having continued ſome time, they put themſelves in a poſture between kneeling and ſitting, and their arms and bodies into a moſt rapid motion, keeping pace at the ſame time with the muſic. Theſe laſt exertions being too violent to continue, at intervals they had ſlower motions. An hour having paſſed in theſe ceremonies, more mats were ſpread upon the area, when the dead chief's widow, and three or four other elderly women, came out of the houſe with ſlow and ſolemn pace; and ſeated themſelves before the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, began to wail moſt bitterly, in which they were joined by the three rows of women behind them; the two men appearing melancholy and penſive. They continued thus, with little varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till late in the evening, when we left them; and, at day-light in the morning, the people
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:030274_1167_0FE5760E65501FC0"/>
were diſperſed, and every thing appeared per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly quiet. We were then given to underſtand, that the body was removed; but we could not learn how it was diſpoſed of. While we were directing our enquiries to this object, we were approached by three women of rank, who ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us, that our preſence interrupted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome neceſſary rites. Soon after we had left them, we heard their cries and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and when we met them a few hours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the lower part of their faces were painted perfectly black.</p>
                     <p>We had alſo an opportunity of obſerving the ceremonies on the funeral of one of the ordinary claſs. Hearing ſome mournful cries, iſſuing from a miſerable hut, we entered it, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered two women, which we ſuppoſed to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and daughter, weeping over the body of a man who had that moment expired. They firſt covered the body with a cloth; then, lying down by it, they ſpread the cloth over themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a melancholy kind of ſong, often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Aweb medoaah! Aweb tanee!</hi> O my father! Oh my huſband! In one corner of the houſe, a young daughter lay proſtrate on the ground, having ſome black cloth ſpread over her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſame expreſſions. On our quitting this melancholy ſcene, we found many of their neighbours, collected together at the door, who were all perfectly ſilent, and attentive to their
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:030274_1168_0FE57728746807E8"/>
lamentations. Mr. King was willing to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this opportunity of knowing in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the body would be diſpoſed of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after being convinced that it was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved when he went to bed, he ordered the ſentries to walk before the houſe, and if there were any appearances of removing the body, to acquaint him with it. The ſentries, however, were remiſs in the performance of their duty, for, before the morning, the body was taken away. On aſking how it had been diſpoſed of, they pointed towards the ſea, perhaps thereby indicating, that it had been depoſited in the deep, or that it had been conveyed to ſome burying-ground beyond the bay. The place of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the chiefs, is the <hi>morai,</hi> or <hi>heree erees,</hi> and thoſe who are ſacrificed on the occaſion, are buried by the ſide of them. The <hi>morai</hi> in which the chief was interred, who, after making a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited reſiſtance, was killed in the cave, has a hanging of red cloth round it.</p>

                     <p>WE weighed anchor on the 15th of March, at ſeven o'clock in the morning, and ſtood to the ſouth-weſt, in expectation of falling

in with the iſland of Modoopapappa; the native<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> having aſſured us that it lay in that direction, within five hours ſail of Tahoora. About four in the afternoon, a large canoe overtook us, in which were ten perſons, who were inhabitants of Oneeheow, and were proceeding to Tahoora to catch birds; particularly tropic and man-of-war birds, which are ſaid to be very numerous in that place. It has already been obſerved, that the feathers of theſe birds are held in great eſteem, being principally uſed in the ornamental part of their dreſs.</p>
                     <p>Not having ſeen the iſland at eight in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we hauled to the northward till midnight, when we tacked and ſtood to the ſouth-eaſt till day-break the next morning; when Tahoora bore eaſt-north-eaſt, diſtant about five or ſix leagues. We then ſteered weſt-ſouthweſt, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſignal for the Diſcovery to ſpread four miles upon our ſtarboard beam. We ſtood on till five, and then made a ſignal for the Diſcovery to come under our ſtern, having given over all hopes of ſeeing Modoopapappa. We ſuppoſed it might lie more ſoutherly from Tahoora, than the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we had taken; though it is very poſſible that we might have paſſed it in the night, it having been deſcribed to us as a very ſmall iſland, and almoſt even with the ſea.</p>
                     <p>On the 17th, we ſteered weſt, Captain Clerke meaning to keep nearly in the ſame parallel of
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:030274_1171_0FE5768D18F0B460"/>
latitude, till we made the longitude of Awatſka Bay; and then to ſteer north for the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul, which was alſo fixed on as our rendezvous, if we ſhould happen to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. This track was choſen, becauſe we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be yet unexplored, and we might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably meet with ſome new iſlands in our paſſage.</p>
                     <p>From the time of our loſing ſight of Tahoora, till the afternoon of the 18th, we had hardly ſeen a bird: we then ſaw ſeveral boobies, and man-of-war birds, which induced us to look out ſharply for land. The wind leſſened towards the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the heavy ſwell, which made the ſhips labour exceedingly on the 16th and 17th, was conſiderably abated. No land appeared the next day; and at noon we ſteered weſt by ſouth, in expectation of finding the trade winds (which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally blew from the eaſt by north) freſher as we advanced. It is remarkable, that, though no birds appeared in the forenoon, we had a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of boobies and man-of-war birds about us in the evening; whence we ſuppoſed that we had paſſed the land, not far diſtant from where the former flights appeared, and where approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other iſland.</p>
                     <p>We had fine weather and a moderate wind, till the 23d, when it increaſed to a ſtrong gale, and continued about twelve hours. Afterwards it became more moderate, and remained ſo till
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:030274_1172_0FE57709054A08D0"/>
noon on the 25th; at which time we had only a very light air.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 26th, we imagined we ſaw land to the weſt-ſouth-weſt; but we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our miſtake, after ſailing ſixteen leagues in that direction; and, night approaching, we again ſteered weſt. We purſued this courſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much alteration in the wind, till the 29th, when it ſhifted about, and was in the weſt for a few hours in the night; the weather being cloudy, accompanied with a great deal of rain. For ſome days paſt, we had met with ſeveral turtles, one of which was ſo remarkably ſmall, as not to exceed three inches in length. We were again viſited by man-of-war birds and an uncommon kind of boobies. They were entirely white, except a black ſpot at the tip of each wing, and had a ſtrong reſemblance of gannets, at firſt ſight.</p>
                     <p>The continuation of the light winds, with the very unſettled ſtate of the weather, and the little expectation we had of any change for the better, induced Captain Clerke to give up his plan of keeping within the tropical latitudes. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, we began, at ſix o'clock this evening, to ſteer north-weſt by north. The light winds almoſt conſtantly prevailed, after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Sandwich Iſlands; during which time the air was hot and ſultry; the thermome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being generally from 80° to 83°. We had
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:030274_1173_0FE57694127E5060"/>
alſo a conſiderable ſwell from the north-eaſt, in which the ſhips were ſtrained exceedingly.</p>
                     <p>On the firſt of April, in the morning, the wind changed to the north-eaſt by eaſt, and continued to blow a freſh breeze till the 4th, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it altered two points. At noon it blew a ſtrong gale, which continued till the 5th, in the afternoon. It then changed its direction to the ſouth-eaſt, and blew moderate, with much rain. We kept ſteering, all this time, to the north-weſt, againſt a ſlow current from that quarter. On the 4th, when our latitude was 26° 17′, and our longitude 173° 30′, we ſaw great numbers of what are called (by the ſailors) Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe men-of-war, <hi>holothuria phyſalis.</hi> Vaſt quantities of oceanic birds likewiſe attended us, among which we diſcovered the ſheer-water and albatroſs.</p>
                     <p>About noon on the 6th, we loſt the trade-wind. We were then in the latitude of 29° 50′, and the longitude of 170° 1′. Our old running ropes having been continually breaking in the late gales; we reeved all the new ones we had left, and made other neceſſary preparations for the different climate we were ſhortly to encounter. The fine weather which we experienced between the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, had not been miſemployed. The carpenters were ſufficiently engaged in repairing the boats. Our beſt bower cable having received ſo much injury in Karakakooa Bay, and off Oneheow, as
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:030274_1174_0FE5767CCA0CEBF8"/>
to occaſion forty fathoms to be cut from it; we converted that, together with ſome other old cordage into ſpun-yarn, and applied it to various purpoſes. By which means, many of our people were kept wholly employed by the boatſwain. Beſides, it was now become a troubleſome and laborious part of our duty, to air the ſails, &amp;c. which were continually growing wet, from the leakneſs of the ſides and deck of the veſſels.</p>
                     <p>There were other cares, which had the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the health of the crews for their object; and theſe continually occupied a great number of our hands. Captain Cook's eſtabliſhed orders of airing the beds, having fires between decks, ſmoking them with gunpowder, and waſhing them with vinegar, were invariably obſerved. Even the mending of the ſailors old jackets was now become a duty of importance. Thoſe who are acquainted with the habits and diſpoſition of ſeamen, require to be informed, that they are ſo accuſtomed to be directed by their officers, reſpecting the care of themſelves, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the thoughtleſſneſs of infants. It is very certain, that had our people been ſuffered to act according to their own diſcretion, the whole crew would have been naked, before half the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the voyage. It might naturally be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, from their having experienced a voyage to the north the laſt year, that they would be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſenſible of the neceſſity of paying atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:030274_1175_0FE5761F53478C00"/>
to theſe matters; but theſe reflections never operated upon them; for as ſoon as we returned to the tropical climates, their fur jackets, and other articles calculated for cold climates, were kicked about the decks as uſeleſs and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; though every one among us knew we were to make another voyage towards the Pole. They were, however, taken up and put into caſks, by the officers, and, about this time, reſtored to their proper owners.</p>
                     <p>We perceived in the afternoon ſome of the ſheathing floated by the ſhip; and diſcovered, upon examination, that about fourteen feet had been waſhed off under the lar-board bow; where the leak was ſuppoſed to have been, which had kept the people employed at the pumps, ever ſince our departure from the Sandwich Iſlands; making twelve inches water an hour. A number of ſmall crabs, of a pale blue colour, we had this day a ſight of; and were again accompanied by ſheer-waters of albatroſſes. In the night-time, the thermometer ſunk eleven degrees; and, though it was then as high as 69°, we endured much from the cold; our feelings not being yet reconciled to that degree of temperature.</p>
                     <p>We had a freſh wind from the north, till Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 8th, in the morning: it then became more moderate, and was accompanied with fair weather. Afterwards it changed its direction to the eaſt, and then to the ſouth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="346" facs="unknown:030274_1176_0FE576BF29F224D8"/>About noon, on the 9th, we were in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 32° 16′, and in the longitude of 166° 40′. On the 10th, we croſſed the track by which the Spaniſh galleons paſs from the Manillas to Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulco, and expected to have ſeen the iſland of Rica de Plata; who, according to De Liſle's chart, which points out the route of thoſe ſhips, ought to have appeared. Its latitude is there mentioned to be 34° 30′ north, and its longitude 166° eaſt. Though ſo far advanced to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we this day ſaw a tropic bird; and ſeveral other kinds of oceanic birds; ſuch as ſheer-waters, albatroſſes, puffins, and ſea-parrots.</p>
                     <p>At noon, on the 11th, our latitude was 35° 30′. and our longitude 165° 45′. We this day ſaw plenty of ſea-birds, and ſeveral bunches of ſea-weed. The Diſcovery alſo paſſed a log of wood; but no other ſigns of land appeared.</p>
                     <p>On the 12th, the wind veered to the eaſt, and blew ſo ſtrong a gale as to oblige us to ſtrike our top-gallant yards. We happened, unfortunately, to be upon the moſt diſadvantageous tack for our leak. But, having always kept it under with the hand-pumps, it gave us but little concern till Tueſday the 13th, at ſix in the afternoon, when a ſudden inundation deluged the whole ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween decks, and alarmed us much. The water, which had made its way into the coal-hole, not finding a paſſage into the well, had forced up the platforms over it, and inſtantaneouſly ſet every
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:030274_1177_0FE576404698CC08"/>
thing afloat. Our ſituation was the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing, as we could not immediately diſcover any means of relieving ourſelves. It could be of no ſervice to place a pump through the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decks into the coal-hole; and it was become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to bale the water out with buckets. We had, therefore, no other expedient left, than to cut a hole through the bulk-head, which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the coal-hole from the fore-hold, and thus form a paſſage for the water into the well. Before this could be effected, however, the caſks of dry proviſions were to be got out of the fore-hold, which took us the remainder of the night; the carpenters, therefore, could not get at the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till the next morning. The paſſage being made, the principal part of the water ran into the well, when we were enabled to get out the reſt with buckets. The leak was now greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, inſomuch that half of our people were conſtantly employed in pumping and baleing, till the 15th, at noon. Our men ſubmitted chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to this exceſſive fatigue; and, to add to their ſufferings, they had not a dry place to ſleep in: but, in order to make them ſome amends, they were permitted to have their full allowance of grog.</p>
                     <p>As the weather grew more moderate, and the ſwell abated, we cleared away the reſt of the caſks from the fore-hold, and made a proper paſſage for the water to the pumps. We ſaw a piece of
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:030274_1178_0FE576ED1A3292D0"/>
drift wood, of a greeniſh hue; and ſounded, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſound no bottom with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line. At noon, this day, we were in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 41° 52′, and in the longitude of 161° 15′.</p>
                     <p>At noon, on the 16th, our latitude was 42° 12′, and our longitude 160° 5′; and, being near the ſituation where De Gama is ſaid to have ſeen a great extent of land, we were glad of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of contributing to remove the doubts, if any yet remained, reſpecting this pretended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. It is ſomewhat remarkable that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcovered who this John De Gama was, when he lived, or at what time he made this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
                     <p>Muller relates, that the firſt account of it was in a chart publiſhed by Texeira, in 1649; who places it between the latitude of 44° and 45′, and calls it "land ſeen by John De Gama, in a voyage from China to New Spain." Why the French geographers have removed it five degrees to the eaſtward, we cannot comprehend; unleſs we ſuppoſe it to have been to make room for another freſh diſcovery made by the Dutch, called Company's land.</p>
                     <p>The wind was very unſettled the whole day, and blew in freſh guſts, which were ſucceeded by dead calms. Though theſe were not unpromiſing appearances, yet, after ſtanding off and on the whole day, without perceiving land, we ſteered to the northward; not chuſing to loſe much time
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:030274_1179_0FE5761093A0C7C0"/>
in ſearch of an object, the exiſtence of which was univerſally diſbelieved. The whole of the 16th, our people were employed in drying their wet things, and in airing the ſhips below.</p>
                     <p>The increaſing inclemency of the northern climate was now ſeverely felt. On the 18th, in the morning, we were in the latitude of 45° 40′, and the longitude of 160° 25′. We had ſnow, ſleet, and ſtrong gales from the ſouth-weſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſeaſon of the year, and the quarter from which the wind came, this is rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumſtance. In the day-time of the 19th, the thermometer remained at the freezing point, and fell to 29° at four in the morning. On comparing the degree of heat, during the ſultry weather at the beginning of this month, with the extreme cold which we now endured, ſome idea may be formed of our ſufferings upon ſo rapid a change.</p>
                     <p>The gale which we had on the 18th, had ſplit moſt of the ſails we had bent; and as theſe were our ſecond ſuit, we were obliged to have recourſe to our laſt and beſt ſet. Captain Clerke's difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were augmented by the ſea being generally ſo rough, and the ſhips ſo extremely leaky, that there was no place to repair the ſails in, except his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which was a ſerious inconvenience to him, in his declining ſtate of health.</p>
                     <p>At noon on the 20th, our latitude was 40° 45′ north, and our longitude 161° 15′ eaſt, and we
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:030274_1180_0FE57729F9E4C148"/>
earneſtly expected to fall in with the coaſt of Aſia; when the wind ſhifted to the north, where it continued the day following. Though our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was thus retarded, we were conſiderably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by the fair weather it produced. On the 21ſt, in the forenoon, we had the ſight of a whale, and a land bird; and, as the water appeared muddy, we founded in the afternoon, but could not find ground with an hundred and forty fathoms of line. In the courſe of the three preceding days, we ſaw a large quantity of wild-fowl, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembling ducks. This uſually indicates the vicinity of land, but no other ſigns of it had been ſeen ſince the 16th, in which time we had ſailed an hundred and fifty leagues and upwards.</p>
                     <p>The wind ſhifted to the north-eaſt, on the 22d, and was attended with miſty weather. The cold was ſo intenſe, and the ropes frozen to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it was a buſineſs of great difficulty to force them through the blocks. On comparing our preſent poſition with the ſouthern parts of Kamtſchatka, as given in the Ruſſian charts, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke thought it might be dangerous to run on towards the land all night. We therefore tacked at ten, ſounded, and had ground with ſeventy fathoms of line.</p>
                     <p>At ſix in the morning of the 23d, the fog clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away we ſaw mountains covered with ſnow, and a high conical rock, at the diſtance of about three or four leagues. ſoon after we had taken
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:030274_1181_0FE576AEA7F76E18"/>
this imperfect view, a thick fog again appeared. According to our maps, we were now but eight leagues from the entrance of Awatſka Bay; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the weather cleared up, we ſtood in to take a nearer ſurvey of the country; when a moſt diſmal and dreary proſpect preſented itſelf. The coaſt is ſtraight and uniform, without bays, or inlets; from the ſhore, the ground riſes in moderate hills, and behind them are ranges of mountains, whoſe ſummits penetrate the clouds. The whole was covered with ſnow, except the ſides of ſome cliffs, which roſe too perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from the ſea, to permit the ſnow to lie upon them.</p>
                     <p>The wind blew ſtrong from the north-eaſt, with hazy weather and fleet, from the 24th to the 28th; the thermometer, during that time, being never higher than 30 ½°. The ſhip reſembled a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete maſs of ice; the ſhrouds being ſo incruſted with it, as to double their dimenſions: and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the oldeſt ſeaman among us had never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſuch continued ſhowers of fleet, and that extremity of cold, which we had now to encounter. The inclemency of the weather, the difficulty of working our ſhips, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant duty required at the pumps, rendered the ſervice intolerable to many of our crew; ſome of whom were much froſt-bitten, and others were confined with colds. We continued ſtanding four hours on each tack, having ſoundings of ſixty
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:030274_1182_0FE5772BE2B32208"/>
fathoms, when within three leagues of the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but no ſounding at double that diſtance.</p>
                     <p>We had, on the 25th. an imperfect glance of the entrance of Awatſka Bay, but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to venture into it, in the preſent condition of the weather. We again ſtood off, when we loſt ſight of the Diſcovery, which gave us little concern, being now almoſt arrived at the place of rendezvous.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 28th, the weather cleared up, with a light breeze continuing from the ſame quarter. Having a fine warm day we were in expectation of a thaw, and therefore the men were buſied in taking the ice from the rigging, ſails, &amp;c. that it might not fall upon our heads. At noon, when our latitude was 52° 44′, and our longitude 159°, the entrance of Awatſka Bay bore north-weſt, at the diſtance of about three or four leagues; and, at three in the afternoon, we ſtood in with a fair wind from the ſouthward, having ſoundings from twenty-two to ſeven fathoms.</p>
                     <p>The mouth of Awatſka Bay opens in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of north north-weſt. On the ſouth ſide, the land is moderately high: it riſes, to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, into a bluff-head. Three remarkable rocks lie in the channel between them, not far from the north-eaſt ſide; and, on the oppoſite ſide, a ſingle rock of a conſiderable ſize. There is a look-out houſe on the north-head, which is uſed as a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:030274_1183_0FE5769B65CD1020"/>
when any of the Ruſſian ſhips are expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the coaſt. It had a flag-ſtaff in it; but there did not appear to be any perſon there.</p>
                     <p>Paſſing the mouth of the bay, which extends about four miles in length, a circular baſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf, of about twenty-five miles in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; in which, at about four o'clock, we anchored in ſix fathom water; fearing to run foul of a ſhoal mentioned by Muller to lie in the channel. Great quantities of looſe ice drifted with the tide in the middle of the bay; but the ſhores were wholly blocked up with it. Plenty of wild-fowl, of various kinds, were ſeen; alſo large flights of Greenland pigeons; together with ravens and eagles. We looked at every corner of the bay, to ſee if we could diſcern the town of St. Peter and St. Paul, which, from the accounts we had received at Oonalaſhka, we ſuppoſed to be a place of ſtrength and conſequence. At laſt we perceived to the north-eaſt, ſome miſerable log-houſes, and a few conical huts, amounting, in the whole to about thirty; which, from their ſituation we concluded to be Petropaulowſka. In juſtice, however, to the hoſpitable treatment we found here, it may not be amiſs to anticipate the reader's curioſity, by aſſuring him, that our diſappointment proved in the end, a matter of entertainment to us. In this wretched extremity of the earth, beyond conception barbarous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable, out of the reach of civilization, bound
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:030274_1184_0FE576CBF75B5360"/>
and barricadoed with ice, and covered with ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſnow, we experienced the tendereſt feelings of humanity, joined to a nobleneſs of mind, and elevation of ſentiment, which would have done honour to any clime or nation.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 29th, at day-light, Mr. King was ſent with the boats to examine the bay, and to preſent the letters to the Ruſſian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, which we had brought from Oonalaſhka. We proceeded towards the village juſt mentioned, and, having advanced as far as we could with the boats, we got upon the ice, which reached about half a mile from the ſhore. Mr. King was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Mr. Webber, and two of the ſeamen, whilſt the maſter went to finiſh the ſurvey; the jolly boat being left to carry us back.</p>
                     <p>Probably the inhabitants had not, by this time, ſeen either the ſhips or the boats; for, even on the ice, no appearance of a living creature could be ſeen in the town. When farther advanced on the ice, a few men were ſeen hurrying back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards; and afterwards a ſledge with one perſon in it, and drawn by dogs, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.</p>
                     <p>Struck with the unuſual ſight, and admiring the civility of this ſtranger, who we ſuppoſed was coming to our aſſiſtance, we were aſtoniſhed to ſee him turn ſhort round, and direct his courſe towards the <hi>oſtrog.</hi> We were equally chagrined and diſappointed at this abrupt departure; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:030274_1185_0FE57690A7049238"/>
as our journey over the ice began to be both difficult and dangerous. At every ſtep we took, we ſunk almoſt knee-deep in the ſnow; and, though there was tolerable footing at the bottom, the weak parts of the ice were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable, and we were continually expoſed to the riſk of breaking through it. Indeed this accident actually happened to Mr. King; but, by the aſſiſtance of a boat-hook, he was enabled to get upon firm ice again.</p>
                     <p>The nearer we approached the ſhore, we found the ice ſtill more broken. The ſight of another ſledge advancing towards us, however, afforded us ſome comfort. But, inſtead of coming, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us, the driver ſtopt ſhort, and called out to us. Mr. King immediately held up Iſmyloff's letters. In conſequence of which, he turned about, and went full ſpeed back again; followed with the execrations of ſome of our party. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to draw any concluſion from this unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able behaviour, we ſtill proceeded towards the <hi>oſtrog,</hi> with the greateſt circumſpection; and, when at the diſtance of about a quarter of a mile from it, we obſerved a body of armed men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards us. To avoid giving them any alarm, and to preſerve the moſt peaceable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Mr. King and Mr. Webber marched in front, and the men, who had boat-hooks in their hands, were ordered in the rear. The armed party conſiſted of about thirty ſoldiers, preceded
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:030274_1186_0FE576E1A4CBE048"/>
by a perſon with a cane in his hand. Within a few paces of us, he halted, and drew up his men in a martial order. Mr. King preſented Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loff's letters to him, and vainly endeavoured to make him underſtand that we were Engliſh, and had brought theſe diſpatches from Oonalaſhka.</p>
                     <p>Having attentively examined us, he conducted us towards the village in ſolemn ſilence, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly halting his men, and making them perform different parts of their manual exerciſe; in order to ſhew us, perhaps, that if we ſhould preſume to offer any violence, we ſhould have to deal with thoſe who knew what they were about.</p>
                     <p>During the whole of this time, Mr. King was in his wet clothes, ſhivering with cold; yet he could not avoid being diverted with this mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary parade, though it was attended by an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable delay. Arriving, at length, at the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the commanding officer of the party, we were uſhered in; and, after giving orders to the military without doors, our hoſt appeared, accompanied by the ſecretary of the port. One of the letters from Imyloff was now opened, and the other ſent expreſs to Bolcheretſk, a town on the weſt ſide of Kamtſchatka, and the place of reſidence of the Ruſſian commander of this province.</p>
                     <p>It appears extraordinary, that the natives had not ſeen the Reſolution the preceding day, when we anchored in the bay; nor this morning till our

boats approach the ice. The firſt ſight of the ſhip, we underſtood, had ſtruck them with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable panic. The garriſon was inſtantly put under arms; two field-pieces were placed before the commander's houſe; and powder, ſhot, and lighted matches were all in readineſs.</p>
                     <p>The officer, who had conducted us to his houſe, was a ſerjeant; and alſo the commander of the <hi>oſtrog.</hi> After he had recovered from the alarm which our arrival had produced, the kindneſs and hoſpitality of his behaviour was aſtoniſhing. His houſe, indeed, was intolerably hot, but remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably neat and clean. After Mr. King had chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his clothes, by putting on a complete ſuit of the ſerjeant's, at his earneſt requeſt; we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to partake of a dinner, which was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the beſt he could procure; and, conſidering our viſit was unexpected, was ingeniouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. To have prepared ſoup and <hi>bouillit,</hi> would have required ſome time; inſtead of which, we had ſome cold beef ſliced, with boiling water poured over it. After that we were regaled with a large roaſted bird, the taſte of which was moſt delicious, though we were unacquainted with its ſpecies. Having eaten a part of this, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and fiſh were ſerved up, dreſſed in two different methods. Soon after which the bird ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared again in ſavoury and ſweet <hi>pates.</hi> Our liquor was ſuch as the Ruſſians diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>quaſs,</hi> and was the moſt indifferent
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:030274_1189_0FE576DE40729020"/>
part of our entertainment. The ſerjeant's wife ſerved up ſeveral of the diſhes, and was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſit down at table with us.</p>
                     <p>Our repaſt being finiſhed, during which our converſation was limited to a few bows, and other perſonal tokens of mutual reſpect, we ſtrove to explain to our hoſt, the occaſion of our viſit to this port. Probably Iſmaloff had written to them on this ſubject, in the letters we had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as we made him readily conceive our meaning; but, as there was not a perſon in the place, who knew any other language than Ruſſian or Kamtſchadale, we found it extremely difficult to comprehend what he endeavoured to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to us. After much time ſpent in our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to underſtand each other, the ſum of the intelligence we had received appeared to be, that, though we could not be ſupplied with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions or ſtores at this place, yet thoſe articles were to be procured, in great plenty, at Bolche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retſk. That he doubted not, but the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would readily ſupply us with what we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that, till he had received his orders, neither he, nor any of the natives, could even venture on board the veſſel.</p>
                     <p>It being now time for us to depart, and as Mr. King's clothes were not yet dry, he again had recourſe to the ſerjeant's benevolence for his leave to carry thoſe on board which he had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of him. This requeſt was chearfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:030274_1190_0FE5770CC4041F38"/>
with; and a ſledge, with five dogs, and a driver, was inſtantly provided for each of our party. This mode of conveyance afforded high entertainment for the ſailors; and they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted ſtill more, when they found that the two boat-hooks had a ſledge appropriated ſolely to themſelves. Theſe ſledges are ſo light, and ſo admirably conſtructed for the purpoſes they are intended, that they went ſafely and expeditiouſly over the ice, which we ſhould have found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to have paſſed on foot.</p>
                     <p>The boats, on our return, were towing the Reſolution towards the village; and, at ſeven, we moored cloſe to the ice; the entrance of the bay bearing ſouth by eaſt, and the <hi>oſtreg</hi> north, at the diſtance of one mile and a half.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 30th, the caſks and cables were taken to the quarter-deck, to lighten the veſſel forward; and the carpenters proceeded to ſtop the leak, which had occaſioned us ſo much trouble. It appeared to have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſome ſheathing falling off from the larboard-bow, and the oakum having been waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out from between the planks. We had ſuch warm weather in the middle of the day, that the ice began to break away very faſt, and almoſt choaked up the entrance of the bay. Several of our officers waited upon the ſerjeant, who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with great civility; and Captain Clerke made him a preſent of two bottles of rum, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:030274_1191_0FE57731DDB72998"/>
he could not ſend him any thing more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. In our return, he received twenty fine trouts, and ſome excellent fouls of the grouſe kind. Though the bay ſwarmed with ducks and Greenland pigeons, our ſportſmen had no ſucceſs, for they were ſo exceedingly ſhy as not to come within ſhot.</p>
                     <p>On the firſt of May, in the morning, we ſaw the Diſcovery ſtanding in the bay; a boat was diſpatched to her aſſiſtance, and ſhe was moored, in the afternoon, cloſe by the Reſolution. We were then informed, that, after the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came clear on the 28th, (the day ſhe parted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) they were to leeward of the bay; and the following day, when they got abreaſt of it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the entrance choaked up with ice, they fired guns and ſtood off, ſuppoſing we could not be here; but afterwards, perceiving it was only drift ice, they ventured to come in.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the 2d, we had heavy ſhowers of ſnow, and the weather was ſo exceedingly unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, that the carpenters could not proceed in their buſineſs. In the evening the thermometer ſtood at 28°, and the froſt in the night was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſevere.</p>
                     <p>Two ſledges being obſerved to drive into the village, on the morning of the 3d, Mr. King was ordered on ſhore, to learn whether any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was arrived from the commander of Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka, which the ſerjeant informed us might be
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:030274_1192_0FE5767E52792810"/>
reaſonably expected about this time. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Bolcheretſk to St. Peter and St. Paul's, is one hundred and thirty-five Engliſh miles. The dogs were ſent off with our diſpatches, on the 29th at noon; and returned with an anſwer, as we were afterwards informed, early this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo that they performed a journey of two hundred and ſeventy miles, in a little more than three days and a half.</p>
                     <p>For the preſent, however, the return of the commander's anſwer was concealed from us; and, on Mr. King's arrival at the ſerjeant's, he was informed that he ſhould hear from him the next day. While Mr. King was on ſhore, the boat in which he came, and another belonging to the Diſcovery, were bound faſt by the ice. In this ſituation, the Diſcovery's launch was ſent to their aſſiſtance, which ſoon partook of the ſame fate; and, ſhortly after, they were ſurrounded with ice to a great extent. Thus ſituated, we were obliged to continue on ſhore till the evening; when, giving over the thoughts of getting the boats off at that time, ſome of us were conveyed in ſledges to the edge of the ice, where the boats from the ſhip took us off, and the reſt continued all night on ſhore.</p>
                     <p>It froze extremely hard during the night; but, in the morning of the 4th, the floating ice was drifted away by a change of wind; and the boats
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:030274_1193_0FE576B256127F58"/>
were ſet at liberty without ſuſtaining the ſmalleſt damage.</p>
                     <p>At ten in the forenoon, ſeveral ſledges arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the edge of the ice, a boat was ſent from the ſhip to conduct thoſe who were in them on board. One of them proved to be a Ruſſian merchant from Bolcheretſk, whoſe name was Fedoſitſch; and the other a German, named Port, with diſpatches from Major Behm, commander of Kamtſchatka, to Captain Clerke.</p>
                     <p>Arriving at the edge of the ice, and ſeeing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly the magnitude of the ſhips, which were then within two hundred yards of them, they were exceedingly alarmed; and before they ventured to embark, ſtipulated that two of our boat's crew ſhould remain on ſhore, as hoſtages for their ſafety. It afterwards appeared, that Iſmyloff, in the epiſtle he had written to the commander, (for reaſons which we cannot comprehend) had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned our veſſels as two ſmall trading boats; and that the ſerjeant, having ſeen the ſhips but at a diſtance, had not rectified that miſtake.</p>
                     <p>After they were come on board, we perceived by their timorous and cautious behaviour, that they entertained ſome very extraordinary appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. They were greatly elated, however, when the German found a perſon among us, with whom he could enter into converſation. Mr. Webber ſpoke that language fluently, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, though not without difficulty, that
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:030274_1194_0FE576BBEF8C2E20"/>
we were Engliſhmen and friends. Mr. Port was introduced to Captain Clerke, to whom he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the commander's letter. It was written in the German language, and merely compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, giving him and his officers an invitation to Bolcheretſk. Mr. Port alſo told Captain Clerke, that the Major had been miſinformed, reſpecting the ſize of the ſhips, and the ſervice in which we were engaged; Iſmyloff having called our two veſſels Engliſh packet-boats, and warned him to be cautious; intimating, as he ſuppoſed, that he ſuſpected we were pirates. This letter, he ſaid, had given birth to various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about us at Bolcheretſk; that the Major apprehended we might be on a trading plan, and therefore had ſent a merchant to us; but that the officer next in command, imagined we were French, arrived with ſome hoſtile intentions, and that meaſures ought to be purſued accordingly. He added, that the Major had been obliged to exert all his authority to prevent the inhabitants from quitting the town, ſo much were they alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the apprehenſion of our being French.</p>
                     <p>Theſe alarms were principally occaſioned by ſome circumſtances in an inſurrection which had happened at Bolcheretſk, not many years ago, in which the commander was killed. We were told, that Beniowſki, an exiled Poliſh officer, ſeeing the town in great confuſion, took that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeizing upon a galliot, lying at the
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:030274_1195_0FE57733B06F8D28"/>
entrance of the Bolchoireeka, and forced a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number of Ruſſian ſailors on board to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigate her; that part of the crew were put on ſhore at the Kourile Iſlands, and Iſmyloff among the reſt; who, as we have already obſerved, puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled us exceedingly with a narrative of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action at Oonalaſhka; though we then found it difficult to underſtand all the circumſtances at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it: that he had a view of Japan; made Luconia, where he was inſtructed how to ſteer to Canton; that arriving there, he got a paſſage to France in one of the French India ſhips; moſt of the Ruſſians having alſo returned to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope in French ſhips; and afterwards proceeded to Peterſburgh. We gathered the circumſtances of the above ſtory, from three of Beniowſki's crew, whom we met with in the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul.</p>
                     <p>We received a farther corroboration of theſe facts, on our arrival at Canton, from the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men belonging to the Engliſh factory there; who informed us, that a perſon in a Ruſſian galliot had arrived there, who told them he came from Kamtſchatka, and that the French factory had furniſhed him with a paſſage to Europe.</p>
                     <p>We were much diverted with the fears and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of theſe people; and eſpecially with an account, given by Mr. Port, of the ſerjeant's extreme caution the day before. On ſeeing Mr. King and ſome other gentlemen come on ſhore,
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:030274_1196_0FE57715B88EAB10"/>
he concealed him and the Ruſſian merchant in the kitchen, to give them an opportunity of liſtening to our converſation with each other, in order to diſcover, whether we were Engliſhmen or not.</p>
                     <p>Imagining, from the appearance of Mr. Port, that he might probably be the commander's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, we was conſidered in that light, and was invited, with the Ruſſian merchant, to dine with Captain Clerke. Soon, however, we began to ſuſpect, from the behaviour of the merchant, that Mr. Port was no more than a common ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; but, not chooſing to ſacrifice our little comforts at our pride, we avoided an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by not permitting ſuch a queſtion to be propoſed to him; he therefore continued upon a footing of equality with us, and we, in return, reaped the advantage of his abilities as a linguiſt.</p>

                     <p>BY the aſſiſtance of our interpreter, we were now enabled to converſe with the Ruſſians, with ſome degree of facility; and the firſt objects of our enquiries, were the means of procuring freſh proviſions and naval ſtores; particularly the latter, for the want of which we had been long
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:030274_1198_0FE576F599056D10"/>
in great diſtreſs. It appeared, upon enquiry, that the whole country about the bay, could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh no other live cattle than two heifers; and theſe the ſerjeant engaged to procure for us. Our next applications were made to the merchant, whoſe terms for ſerving us were ſo exorbitant, that Captain Clerke thought it expedient to ſend an officer to the commander at Bolcheretſk, to learn the price of ſtores at that place. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination being communicated to Mr. Port, he ſent an expreſs to the commander to acquaint him with our intentions, and to remove the ſuſpicions that were entertained, reſpecting the purpoſes of our voyage.</p>
                     <p>Captain Clerke fixed upon Mr. King for this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>vice, and ordered him to prepare for ſetting out the next day, together with Mr. Webber, who was to accompany him as interpreter. That day and the next, however, proved too ſtormy for beginning a journey through ſo deſolate and wild a country; but on the 7th of May, the weather became more favourable, and we ſet out in the ſhip's boats, early in the morning, in order to arrive at the entrance of the Awatſka at high water, on account of the ſhoals at the mouth of that river. The country boats were to meet us here, to conduct us up the ſtream. Captain Core was alſo added to our party; and we were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Mr. Port and the Ruſſian mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, with two coſſacks, having been previouſly
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:030274_1199_0FE5778A0D338828"/>
furniſhed with warm furred clothing; a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary precaution, as it began to ſnow briſkly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after our ſetting out. About eight o'clock, we were ſtopped by ſhoal water, within a mile of the mouth of the river, when ſome Kamtſchadales took us and our baggage, in ſome ſmall canoes, and conveyed us over a bank of ſand, which the rapidity of the river had thrown up, and which, we are informed, was continually ſhifting. Having paſſed this ſhoal, the water again deepened, and we were furniſhed with a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious boat, reſembling a Norway yawl, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey us up the river; together with canoes for the reception of our baggage.</p>
                     <p>The breadth of the mouth of the Awatſka is about a quarter of a mile, but it gradually nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed as we advanced. Having proceeded a few miles, we paſſed ſeveral branches; many of which we were told, emptied themſelves into other parts of the bay; and that ſome of thoſe, on the left, ran into the Paratounca river. For the firſt ten miles, the general direction of the river, from the bay, is to the north; and afterwards it turns to the weſtward. Except this bend, it chiefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a ſtraight courſe; and flows through a low flat country, to the diſtance of thirty miles from the ſea, which is ſubject to frequent inundations. Six men were employed in puſhing us on with long poles, three of them being at each end of the boat; and proceeded againſt the ſtream, at
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:030274_1200_0FE5779755B0E310"/>
the rate of about three miles an hour. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors endured this ſeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> labour for ten hours; ſtopping only once, and that for a ſhort ſpace of time, to take a little refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>Being told, at our firſt ſetting out, that we could eaſily reach Karatchin that night, we were greatly diſappointed to find ourſelves fifteen miles from that place at ſun-ſet. This was attributed to the delay in paſſing the ſhoals, both at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the river, and in many other places.</p>
                     <p>Our men being exceedingly fatigued, and as the difficulty of navigating the river would have increaſed by the darkneſs of the night, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined all thoughts of proceeding on our journey that evening: we therefore fixed upon a place that was tolerably well ſheltered, and, clearing it of the ſnow, erected a ſmall marquée, which we had providentially taken with us; and, with the aſſiſtance of a good fire, and ſome excellent punch, paſſed the night agreeably. Our principal incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience was the being obliged to keep at a conſiderable diſtance from the fire; for, as ſoon as it was lighted, it thawed every part round it into an abſolute puddle. The Kamtſchadales were extremely alert and expeditious in erecting our marquée, and cooking our proviſions; but we were much ſurprized at finding they had brought with them their utenſils for making tea, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as a moſt intolerable hardſhip if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:030274_1201_0FE57795A9F30768"/>
two or three times a day, regale themſelves with drinking tea.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as it was light, in the morning, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on our journey, and, before we had made much progreſs, were met by the <hi>Toion,</hi> or chief of Karatchin, who, being apprized of our coming, had provided canoes that were better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated for navigating the higher parts of the river. A commodious veſſel (made by laſhing two canoes together) furniſhed with fur cloaks, and lined with bear-ſkins, was alſo procured for us. We now proceeded rapidly, the Toion's people being remarkably expert in this kind of buſineſs. At ten we arrived at the <hi>oſtrog,</hi> named Karatchin, and the ſeat of his command; where we were received by the Kamtſchadale men and women, and ſome Ruſſian ſervants belonging to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, Fedoſitch. They were all attired in their beſt habilments; thoſe of the women being gay and pleaſing, and conſiſting of a looſe robe of white nankeen, gathered cloſe round the neck, and faſtened with a ſilk collar. A ſhort jacket, without ſleeves, was worn over this, conſiſting of different coloured nankeens; and they had petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats made of a ſlight Chineſe ſilk. Their ſhifts, which were alſo made of ſilk, had ſleeves extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wriſts; and their heads were bound with coloured ſilk handkerchiefs, which entirely concealed the hair of the married women; but the unmarried ones placed the handkerchief under
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:030274_1202_0FE5779AC77C7D18"/>
the hair, permitting it to flow looſely down the ſhoulders.</p>
                     <p>Karatchin was pleaſantly ſituated on the ſide of the river, and was compoſed of three log-houſes, nineteen <hi>balagans,</hi> or ſummer habitations, and three <hi>jourts,</hi> which are houſes under ground. The <hi>Toion,</hi> to whoſe dwellings we were then conducted, was a plain decent man, ſprung from a Ruſſian mother, and a Kamtſchadale father. His houſe, like all others in this country, conſiſted of only two apartments. All the furniture in the outer room, was a long narrow table, with a bench round it; and the inner apartment, which was the kitchen, was alſo very ſcantily furniſhed. But the hearty welcome, and kind attention of our hoſt, amply compenſated for the poverty of his habitation.</p>
                     <p>The wife of the <hi>Toion</hi> was an excellent cook, and ſerved us with various ſorts of fiſh and game, and different kinds of heath-berries, which had been preſerved ſince the laſt year. Whilſt we were dining in this miſerable hut, the gueſts of abſolutely ſtrangers, and at the extremity of the habitable globe, a ſolitary half-worn pewter ſpoon attracted our attention. Its form was familiar to us, and the word <hi>London</hi> was ſtamped upon the back of it. It is impoſſible to expreſs the anxious hopes and tender remembrances, this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance excited in us. Thoſe who have been long abſent from their native country, will readily
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:030274_1203_0FE5778753B4AD80"/>
conceived what inexpreſſible pleaſure ſuch trifling incidents can give.</p>
                     <p>Having now quitted the river, the next part of our journey was to be performed on ſledges; but the thaw had been ſo great in the day-time, as not to permit us to ſet out, till the ſnow was become hard and firm by the coldneſs of the evening. This furniſhed us with an opportunity of walking about the village, which was the only place in this country, that we had ſeen free from ſnow. It was ſituated on a flat, of about a mile and an half in circuit. The leaves of the trees were juſt budding, and the verdure was ſtrongly contraſted with the ſurrounding hills, which remained cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſnow. The ſoil appeared to be capable of producing common vegetables, we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find that not a ſpot of it was cultivated. Neither were the inhabitants poſſeſſed of cattle of any ſort. In ſhort, their ſituation, during the winter months, muſt be wretched beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. They were now removing from their <hi>jourts</hi> to their <hi>balagans,</hi> which gave us an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of obſerving both theſe ſorts of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The people invited us, very civilly, into their houſes; chearfulneſs and content were viſible in every countenance, to which the approaching change of ſeaſon might perhaps contribute.</p>
                     <p>On returning to our hoſt's, ſupper was prepared for us, conſiſting of the ſame articles which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed our former repaſt. When we had finiſhed
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:030274_1204_0FE57798DE3A7AC8"/>
our meal, we entertained the <hi>Toion</hi> and his wife with punch made of ſome of our ſpirits; and Captain Gore, with his wonted generoſity, made them ſome valuable preſents: after which, they retired to the kitchen, leaving us in the other room; on the benches of which we ſpread our bear-ſkins, and ſought a little repoſe; having firſt ſettled with our conductors, to proceed on our journey, when the ground was judged to be in a ſuitable condition.</p>
                     <p>The melancholy howlings of the dogs awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us about nine the ſame evening. During the whole time our baggage was laſhing upon the ſledges, their horrid noiſe continued; but, when they were yoked, and prepared for travelling, a chearful yelping ſucceeded, which ceaſed the inſtant they marched off.</p>
                     <p>The annexed engraving will ſhew the figure of the ſledges: it was taken from one brought over by Mr. King, and now in the poſſeſſion of Sir Aſhton Lever. The length of the body is about four feet and an half, and the breadth one foot. It is made in the form of a creſcent, of light tough wood, faſtened together with wicker work; and, among the principal people, is elegantly ſtained with red and blue; the ſeat being covered with furs or bear-ſkins. It has four legs, about two feet in height, reſting on two long flat pieces of wood, of the breadth of five or ſix inches, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a foot beyond the body of the ſledge, at
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:030274_1205_0FE577728A97B350"/>
each end. Theſe run up before, ſomewhat like a ſkait, and are ſhod with the bone of ſome ſea-animal. The carriage is ornamented, at the fore part with taſſels off coloured cloth, and leather thongs. It has a croſs bar, to which the harneſs is joined; and links of iron, or ſmall bells, are hanging to it, which, by the jingling, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to encourage the dogs. They ſeldom carry more than one perſon at a time, who ſits a ſide, with his feet on the lower part of the ſledge, having his baggage and proviſions, in a bundle behind him. The uſual number of dogs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in drawing this carriage, is five; four of them yoked two and two, and the other acting as leader. The reins being faſtened to the collar, inſtead of the head, have no great command; and are therefore uſually hung upon the ſledge; the driver depending principally on their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his voice. Great care and attention are conſequently uſed in training up the leader, which frequently becomes very valuable on account of his ſteadineſs and docility; the ſum of forty rubles (or ten pounds) being no unuſual price for one of them. The rider has alſo a crooked ſtick, anſwering the purpoſe both of whip and reins; with which, by ſtriking in the ſnow, he can regulate the ſpeed of the dogs, or even ſtop them at pleaſure. When they are inattentive to their duty, he often chaſtiſes them by throwing it at them. The dexterity of the riders, in pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:030274_1206_0FE577A08098A620"/>
this ſtick up again, is very remarkable, and is the moſt difficult manoeuvre in the exerciſe of their profeſſion: nor is it, indeed, ſurprizing that they ſhould be ſkilful in a practice in which they are ſo materially intereſted; for, they aſſured us, that if a driver ſhould happen to loſe his ſtick, the dogs immediately diſcover it; and, unleſs their leader is both ſteady and reſolute, they will inſtantly ſet off full ſpeed, and never ſtop till their ſtrength is exhauſted; or till the carriage is overturned and daſhed to pieces, or hurried down a precipice, when all were buried in the ſnow. The accounts of the ſpeed of theſe animals, and of the hardſhips and fatigues they ſuffer, would have appeared incredible, had they not been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the greateſt authority. We ourſelves were witneſſes of the extraordinary expedition with which the meſſenger returned, who had been diſpatched to Bolcheretſk with the news of our arrival at St. Peter and St. Paul's, though the ſnow was exceedingly ſoft. The Governor of Kamtſchatka aſſured us, that this journey was uſually performed in two days and an half; and that he had once received an expreſs from that harbour in twenty-three hours</p>
                     <p>During the winter, the dogs are fed on the offals of dried and ſtinking fiſh; and, even this miſerable food is withheld from them, a day before they ſet out on a journey; and they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to eat a morſel of any thing till they
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:030274_1207_0FE5778D199E51B0"/>
arrive at the end of it. They are frequently kept faſting for two entire days, in which time they will perform a journey of great extent. The ſhape of theſe reſembles that of the Pomeranian breed, but they are conſiderably larger.</p>
                     <p>Not chuſing to rely upon our own ſkill, we had each of us a man to conduct the ſledge, which, in the condition the roads then, were proved a very laborious buſineſs: for, as the thaw had been prevalent in the vallies, through which was our regular road, we were obliged to travel along the ſides of the hills; our guides being under the neceſſity of ſupporting the ſledges, on the lower ſides, with their ſhoulders, for many miles together. Mr. King was attended by a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured Coſſack, who was ſo imperfect in his buſineſs, that he was continually overturned, which afforded entertainment to his companions. The party conſiſted of ten ſledges in the whole. That which conducted Captain Gore, was formed of two laſhed together, and was plentifully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with furs and bear-ſkins. It was drawn by ten dogs, yoked four abreaſt; and thoſe which were laden with heavy baggage, were drawn by the ſame number.</p>
                     <p>We had proceeded about four miles on our journey, when it began to rain, which, together with the darkneſs of the night, threw us into ſome confuſion. It was, after ſome little conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, agreed, that we ſhould continue where
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:030274_1208_0FE577A496F74D90"/>
we were till day-light; we therefore ſecured our ſledges, wrapped ourſelves up in furs, and waited patiently for the morning. At three o'clock we were ſummoned to proceed; our guides expreſſing their apprehenſions, that if we waited any longer, the thaw would perhaps ſtop us, and prevent our advancing or returning. Though we had many difficulties to encounter, owing principally to the bad condition of the road, we got ſafe to an <hi>oſtrog</hi> about two in the afternoon. It is called Natcheekin, and is ſituated on a ſmall ſtream, which falls into the Belchoireka, at ſome diſtance below the town. It is twenty-five miles from Karatchin; which, by their account, we could have compaſſed in four hours, had the froſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; but the ſnow was ſo ſoft that the poor animals ſunk up to their bellies at almoſt every ſtep; and it was indeed ſurprizing that they ſhould be able to ſupport themſelves under ſo fatiguing a journey.</p>
                     <p>This inconſiderable <hi>oſtrog</hi> conſiſts of one log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, the reſidence of the <hi>Toion,</hi> one <hi>jourt,</hi> and ſive <hi>balagans.</hi> We were received here with the ſame civility and hoſpitality as at Karatchin; and, in the afternoon, were conducted to a remarkable hot ſpring, at a ſmall diſtance from this village. Before we came very near it, we ſaw a riſing ſteam from it, as from a boiling caldron; and, when we approached it, we perceived a ſtrong ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effluvia. A baſon of about, three feet in
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:030274_1209_0FE577668AA309A8"/>
diameter, is formed by the main ſpring; beſides which, there are ſeveral leſſer ſprings, of equal heat, in the adjacent ground; by which means the whole ſpot, conſiſting of about an acre, was ſo very hot that we could not remain two minutes in the ſame place. The water iſſuing from theſe ſprings, ſupplies a ſmall bathing pond, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a little rivulet, which conducts it into the river, at the diſtance of about an hundred and fifty yards. Great cures they informed us, had been effected by this bath, in rheumatiſms, ſcorbutic ulcers, ſwelled and contracted joints, and many other diſorders. Where theſe ſprings flow, the ground is on a gentle aſcent; have a green hill of a moderate ſize behind it. Some plants ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thrive here with great luxuriance, among which we obſerved the wild garlick.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of the 10th, we embarked on the Bolchoireeka; and going with the ſtream, expected to arrive at our journey's end the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>gh Bolcheretſk is eighty miles from Natcheekin, we were informed, that, in the ſummer, when the melting of ſnow on the mountains has rendered the river full and rapid, the canoes have often gone there in a ſingle day: but now they told us we ſhould be much longer, the ice having broken up only three days before our arrival, and our's being the firſt boat that had attempted to paſs. There was but too much truth in this intelligence; for we were greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:030274_1210_0FE5774231D435D8"/>
by the ſhallows; and, though the ſtream was rapid in many places, we frequently had ripplings and ſhoals, and were under the neceſſity of hauling the boats over them. On each ſide of the river, the country was romantic, but not diverſified: the courſe of it being between craggy mountains, of a moſt dreary and barren aſpect; with nothing to vary the ſcene, except now and then the ſight of a bear, or a flock of wild fowl. This and the following night, we ſlept under our marquée, on the banks of the river, and ſuffered greatly from the ſeverity of the weather.</p>
                     <p>On the 12th, at day-light, we had paſſed the mountains, and were proceeding through a low extenſive plain, on which were a number of ſhrubby trees. At nine in the morning, we reached an <hi>oſtrog,</hi> called Opatchin, of about the ſame magnitude as Karatchin, and ſuppoſed to be fifty miles from Natcheekin. A ſerjeant and four Ruſſian ſoldiers had been here two day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, waiting for our arrival; who inſtantly diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a light boat to Bolcheretſk to give intelligence of our approach. A magnificent canoe, plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully furniſhed with ſkins and furs, was prepared for our reception, and we were very commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly equipped; but our fellow-travellers were excluded. It gave us ſome concern to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from our old companion Mr. Port, who daily grew more ſhy and diſtant, as we drew nearer to the completion of our journey.

indeed, before we ſet out, that he was not entitled to the reſpect we had ſhewn him; but, finding him diſcreet, and not preſuming, we had inſiſted on his faring as we did, throughout the journey. We performed the remainder of our paſſage, with the utmoſt eaſe and expedition; for, as we deſcended, the river grew more rapid, and had very few obſtructions.</p>
                     <p>On our approaching Kamtſchatka, we judged, from an appearance of great ſtir and buſtle, that our reception was to be in form. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was diſagreeable to us; as decent clothing had long been ſcarce among us; and our travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling habits formed a ſtrange aſſemblage of the modes of India, Europe, and Kamtſchatka. To make a parade through the metropolis in this motley trim, we thought would appear ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and, as we obſerved a crowd of people col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected on the banks of the river, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the commander would receive us at the water-ſide, we ſtopped at the houſe of a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, about a quarter of a mile before we came to the town. Here we diſpatch Mr. Port with a meſſage to his excellency, acquainting him, that, as ſoon as we had put off our travelling dreſſes, we would attend him at his own houſe, to pay our reſpects to him; and entreated him not to think of waiting to conduct us. He perſiſted, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in his reſolution of paying us this compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and we immediately proceeded to join him
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:030274_1212_0FE577A2A4968BF0"/>
at the entrance of the capital. We were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably aukward and defective in making our firſt ſalutations; not having been accuſtomed to bowing and ſcraping, for at leaſt two years and an half. The commander received us in a moſt engaging manner; but we had the mortification to diſcover, that he had almoſt wholly forgot the French language; ſo that only Mr. Webber had the ſatisfaction of converſing with him, as he ſpoke the German, which was his native tongue.</p>
                     <p>Major Behm was accompanied by Captain Shmelaff, the next in command, and another officer; the whole body of merchants attended alſo. We were conducted to the commander's houſe, where we were politely and reſpectfully received by his lady; who had prepared tea and other refreſhments for us. The firſt compliments being over, Captain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore deſired Mr. Webber to acquaint the Major, that we were diſtreſſed for want of naval ſtores, freſh proviſions, flour, and other neceſſaries; and that we were convinced we could not receive much aſſiſtance from him, in the country about Awatſka Bay, from what we had already ſeen and heard; that the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of conveying heavy ſtores over the penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula, at that ſeaſon, we were but too ſenſible of, from the difficulties we had encountered in our journey; and that we could not delay the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of our voyage, to wait for any material change. Here the Major interrupted Mr. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:030274_1213_0FE577486BE0DD48"/>
by obſerving, that he knew not what they were capable of doing; that he ſhould not beſtow a thought upon the difficulties of ſupplying our wants; he only wiſhed to know what articles we ſtood in need of, and the time he could be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for procuring them. After expreſſing our acknowledgments for his obliging condeſcenſion, we preſented him an account of the naval ſtores, cattle, and flour, we were directed to purchaſe; and informed him, that we intended to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute our voyage about the 5th of June.</p>
                     <p>After this the converſation became more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and it might naturally be ſuppoſed, that we were anxious to obtain ſome information re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſqecting our native country. Having been three years abſent, we entertained the moſt flattering expectations, of receiving ſome intereſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from Major Behm: but we were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappointed, when he aſſured us, that he could not communicate any intelligence of a much later date than that of our quitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The commander, ſuppoſing we might be fatigued, and deſirous of repoſe, begged leave to conduct us to our lodgings, at about ſeven o'clock. It was uſeleſs to proteſt againſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, to which we had no other title than that of being ſtrangers. That alone, with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Livonian, was ſufficient to counterbalance every other conſideration. In going along, we paſſed two guard-houſes, where the men were
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:030274_1214_0FE577A61C9F6C50"/>
under arms in compliment to Captain Gore, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re conducted to a neat decent houſe, which the Major had appointed for our reſidence, while we continued at Kamtſchatka. We had two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels poſted at our door, and a ſerjeant's guard in an adjoining houſe. Having diſpoſed of us in our apartments, the Major took his leave, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to viſit us the next day. We were now at leiſure to diſcover the conveniences which he had amply provided for us. Our fellow-travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Mr. Port, and a ſoldier, of a rank between that of a ſerjeant and a corporal, (called a <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properſckaek</hi>) were fixed upon to be our male do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics. We had alſo a houſekeeper, and a cook, who were ordered to obey Mr. Port's directions in dreſſing us a ſupper, after the Engliſh mode of cookery. In the courſe of the evening, we were favoured with a number of civil meſſages, from the principal inhabitants of the town, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely obſerving, that their attending to pay their reſpects to us at that time, would add to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, but they would do themſelves that honour the next morning. Such attention and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſo uncultivated and deſolate a country, formed a contraſt highly in favour of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; and, in addition to their civility, at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, the ſerjeant brought the report of his guard to Captain Gore.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 13th, compliments were ſent us by the Major, Captain Shmelaff, and the
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:030274_1215_0FE577740FA6C278"/>
moſt reſpectable people of the town, from all whom we were honoured with viſits ſoon after. The two former having, after we had retired to reſt, enquired of Mr. Port what articles we ſtood in the greateſt need of on board the ſhips; they inſiſted on our ſharing with their garriſon, in the ſmall ſtock of proviſions they had then remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; lamenting, at the ſame time, that our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, ſhould happen to be in that ſeaſon of the year, when ſcarcity reigned univerſally among them; the ſloops from Okotſk not being yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with their annual ſupply.</p>
                     <p>We thankfully accepted the liberal offer of theſe hoſpitable ſtrangers; on condition, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that we ſhould be made acquainted with the price of the articles we received from them, that Captain Clerke might draw upon the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling Office, in London, for the amount. This was refuſed, in the moſt poſitive terms; and, though repeatedly urged, the Major always ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped us ſhort, by ſaying, that his miſtreſs would be highly gratified at his rendering every aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his power to the Engliſh, who are her good friends and allies; and that it would give her a peculiar ſatisfaction to find, that, in ſuch remote regions, her dominions had afforded any relief to veſſels engaged in ſuch important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. He added, that he could not, therefore, act ſo contrary to the principles of his Empreſs, as to think of receiving any bills; but if we
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:030274_1216_0FE57775ED54BC80"/>
inſiſted on it, we might give him a bare certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the articles he might ſupply us with, which he would tranſmit to the court of Ruſſia, as evidence of having performed his duty.. All farther acknowledgments, continued he, muſt be ſubmitted to the two courts, but you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me from acceding to your propoſal.</p>
                     <p>This matter being adjuſted, he requeſted to be informed reſpecting our private wants, ſaying he ſhould conſider it as offering him an affront, if we applied to any of the merchants, or had dealing with any other perſon except himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Not being able to make an adequate return for ſuch ſingular generoſity, he had only our thanks and admiration. At this moment, Mr. King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, that Captain Clerke had ſent by him a ſet of the engravings to Captain Cook's ſecond voyage, deſiring him to preſent it, in his name, to the commander. Nothing could have been more acceptable to him than this preſent, the Major being an enthuſiaſt in all matters relative to diſcoveries. Captain Clerke had alſo given Mr. King a diſcretionary power, of permitting the commander to ſee a chart of the diſcoveries made in the preſent voyage; and judging from his ſituation and diſpoſition of mind, that he would be highly gratified by ſuch a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though, from motives of delicacy, he had only aſked a few general queſtions on the ſubject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="386" facs="unknown:030274_1217_0FE577689283CEA0"/>
Mr. King repoſed in him that confidence, which his whole conduct ſo juſtly merited.</p>
                     <p>He felt this compliment as it was intended he ſhould; and was ſtruck at beholding, in one view, the whole of that coaſt on the ſide of Aſia and America, which his countrymen had been ſo long employed in acquiring an imperfect knowledge of.</p>
                     <p>Except this mark of confidence, and the ſet of copper-plates already mentioned, we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with us deſerving of his acceptance; for it was hardly worth noticing, that Mr. King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on his ſon (who was quite a youth) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a ſilver watch; and contributed to his little daugter's happineſs, by preſenting her with two pair of ear-rings, of French paſte. He alſo gave Captain Shmaleff the thermometer which he had uſed on his journey, when he engaged to keep a regiſter of the temperature of the air for one whole year, and to tranſmit it to Mr. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, with whom he was acquainted.</p>
                     <p>This day we dined at the commander's, who, ever ſtudious to gratify our curioſity, had prepared a variety of diſhes dreſſed after the Ruſſian and Kamtſchadale manner, beſides a number of others in the Engliſh ſtyle. In the afternoon, we took a ſurvey of the town, and the adjacent country. The ſituation of Bolcheretſk is in a low ſwampy plain, extending to the ſea of Okotſk, being about forty miles in length, and of a conſiderable breadth. It lies north of the Bolchoi-reka (or
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:030274_1218_0FE5775B02F10958"/>
great river) and on a peninſula, which has been ſeparated from the continent by a large canal, under the directions of the preſent commander; which has added ſtrength to it as a fortreſs, and rendered it much leſs ſubject to inundations. The depth of the river, below the town, is from ſix to eight feet, and the breadth about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile. At the diſtance of twenty-two miles, it empties itſelf into the ſea of Okotſk; where it is capable of admitting pretty large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. No corn, of any kind, is cultivated in this part of the country; and the Major aſſured us, that his was the only garden that had been plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In general, the earth was covered with ſnow: the parts which were free from it, were full of black turfy hillocks. We ſaw about twenty or thirty cows; and the commander had ſix good horſes. Theſe, and their dogs, are there only tame animals: being obliged to keep a great number of the latter, they can rear only ſuch cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as are a match for them in ſtrength and ſize. For, during the whole of the ſummer ſeaſon, the dogs are turned looſe, to provide entirely for themſelves; and are ſometimes ſo ravenous, that they will even venture to attack the bullocks.</p>
                     <p>The buildings in Bolcheretſk are all in the ſame ſtyle; they conſiſt of logs of wood, and are thatched. The Major's houſe is conſiderably larger than the reſt, and has there capacious rooms neatly papered; but the <hi>talc,</hi> which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:030274_1219_0FE5778B93465B50"/>
the windows, gave them a diſagreeable and mean appearance. The town conſiſt of low buildings, in rows of five or ſix habitations each, connected together by a paſſage extending the whole length of them; having the kitchen and ſtore-houſe on one ſide, and the dwelling apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the other. There are alſo barracks for the Ruſſian ſoldiers and Coſſacks; a tolerable church; a court-room; and, at the end of the town, a number of <hi>Balagans.</hi> The number of the inhabitants is between five or ſix hundred. A handſome entertainment was given by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, in the evening, to which were invited all the reſpectable inhabitants of both ſexes.</p>
                     <p>We made a private application, the next day, to Fedoſitch, the merchant, in order to purchaſe ſome tobacco; the ſailors having been without that favourite commodity for upwards of a year. This however, like other ſimilar tranſactions, came immediately to the knowledge of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and, in a very ſhort time after, we were ſurpriſed to find four bags of tobacco in our houſe, each containing upwards of a hundred pounds; which the Major requeſted might be preſented to our ſailors, in his name, and that of the garriſon under his command. By the ſame conveyance, we received twenty loaves of ſugar, and as many pounds of tea, which they requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the officers to accept of; as they underſtood that we were almoſt deſtitute of thoſe articles. A
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:030274_1220_0FE5777F1E9D8A28"/>
preſent was alſo ſent by Madame Behm, for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke, which conſiſted of honey, butter, figs, rice, and other articles; accompanied with her beſt wiſhes, that in his infirm ſtate, they might prove ſerviceable to him. We ſtrenuouſly endeavoured to oppoſe this profuſion of bounty, and were extremely anxious to reſtrain it; fully convinced that they were giving us almoſt the whole ſtock of their garriſon. But the anſwer we received from the Major, on theſe occaſions, generally was, That he had been in diſtreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he was ſenſible that we muſt now be in that ſituation. The length of time, indeed, ſince we had touched at any known port, appeared to them almoſt incredible, and ſeemed to require the evidence of our maps, and other concurrent circumſtances, to obtain their credit. Among the latter, we ſhall mention a curious fact, which Major Behm related to us this morning, and which he ſaid he ſhould not have known how to account for, but for our arrival.</p>
                     <p>Among the people of the north of Aſia, it is well known, that the Tſchutſki only have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their independence, and reſiſted all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Ruſſians to reduce them. The laſt attempt was in 1750, and after variety of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary advantages on each ſide, the Ruſſian forces retreated, after having loſt their commanding of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer. The Ruſſians afterwards removed their frontier frotreſs, from the Anadyr to the Ingiga
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:030274_1221_0FE5775C895319A8"/>
a river which runs into the northern extremity of the ſea of Okotſk, and gives its name to a gulph, weſt of that of Penſhinſk. On the day of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Bolecheretſk, the Major had received diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches from this fort, acquainting him, that a party of the Tſchutſki had arrived there, with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary offers of friendſhip and a tribute. That, on aſking the cauſe of ſo unexpected an alteration in their ſentiments, they had acquainted his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that two large Ruſſian boats had viſited them, towards the end of the preceding ſummer: that they had been ſhewn the greateſt kindneſs by the people who were in them, and had entered into a league of amity with them; and that, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, they came to the Ruſſian fort, in order to ſettle a treaty upon terms agreeable to both nations. This remakable tale had given riſe to much ſpeculation, both at Ingiginſk and Bolcheretſk; and muſt have remained utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, had it not been elucidated by us. It was no ſmall ſatisfaction to us, to have thus ſhewn the Ruſſians, even by accident, the beſt method of collecting tribute, and extending their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; in hopes that the good underſtanding, which this event has produced, may reſcue a brave people from ſuch powerful invaders.</p>
                     <p>We were this day engaged to dine with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Shmaleff, who in order to vary our amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, entertained us with an exhibition of danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the Ruſſian and Kamtſchadale ſtyle. It
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:030274_1222_0FE57780A5B405F8"/>
is impoſſible to convey an adequate idea of this uncouth exhibition. The figure of the Ruſſian dance, reſembled thoſe of our hornpipes, and conſiſted of one, two, or four performers at a time. Their ſteps were exceedingly ſhort and quick, their feet being raiſed but a very little way from the ground; their arms were hung down cloſe to the ſides, the body being kept, the whole time, erect and immoveable, except when the performers paſſed each other, when the hand was ſuddenly raiſed with an awkward motion. But, if the Ruſſian dance was unmeaning and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the Kamtſchadale was infinitely more ſo. The principle aim, in their performances, is to repreſent the clumſy geſtures of the bear, which the inhabitants of this country have frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of obſerving in various ſituations. To deſcribe the awkward poſtures, exhibited on theſe occaſions, would appear tedious and unintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In general, however, the body was bowed, and the knees bent, whilſt the arms were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in imitating the motions of that awkward animal.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpent much time in our journey to Bolcheretſk, and being informed that our return might, perhaps, be more difficult and tedious we were obliged to acquaint the Major, this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our intention of departing the next day. We could not think of leaving our new acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance without regret; and were agreeably ſurpriſed,
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:030274_1223_0FE5774B82640F80"/>
when the Major promiſed to accompany us, if we would ſtay but one day longer. He told us, that he had made up his diſpatches, and reſigned the command of Kamtſchatka to Captain Shmaleff; having made the neceſſary preparations for his departure to Okotſk, which was ſhortly to take place; but that he ſhould be happy in poſtponing his journey, and at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>nding us to St. Peter and St. Paul's, in order to be ſatisfied, that nothing which could be done to ſerve us, ſhould be omitted.</p>
                     <p>For the articles which Mr. King had given to the Major's children, he received, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a moſt magnificent Kamtſchadale dreſs, ſuch as the principal <hi>Toions</hi> wear on the moſt ſolemn occaſions. This habit, as we are informed by Fedoſitch, muſt have coſt, at leaſt, one hundred and twenty roubles. He alſo at the ſame time, was preſented with a handſome ſable muff, as a preſent from his daughter.</p>
                     <p>We dined this day (the 15th) with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who, willing to give us an opportunity of ſeeing as much as we could of the manners and cuſtoms of the country, invited all the principal inhabitants of the town, to his houſe this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The dreſſes of the women were ſplendid after the Kamtſchadale manner. Captain Shma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leff's lady, and the wives of the other officers of the garriſon, were dreſſed in a pretty taſte, partly in the Siberian, and partly in the European mode. Madame Behm, in particular, appeared in a grand
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:030274_1224_0FE577829A32E8C0"/>
European dreſs. The richneſs and variety of the ſilks worn by the women, as well as the ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their dreſs, was very ſtriking: and the whole had the air of ſome enchanted ſcene, in the midſt of the moſt deſert and dreary country in the univerſe. The entertainments of this night were dancing and ſinging.</p>
                     <p>As we had fixed upon the next morning for our departure, we retired early to our apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where three travelling dreſſes preſented themſelves to our view, made after the Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadale mode, which had been provided for us by the commander. He came to us himſelf ſoon after, to ſee that proper care was taken in pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our things. We had, indeed, no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable load of baggage; for excluſive of his liberal preſents, Captain Shmaleff, and ſeveral other individuals, ſhewed us many inſtances of kindneſs and generoſity.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday, the 16th, early in the morning, we were preparing for our departure, when we were invited to take our leave of Madame Behm, in our paſſage to the boats. Already impreſſed with ſentiments of the warmeſt gratitude, for the benevolent and generous treatment we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at Bolcheretſk, they were much heightened by the effecting ſcene which followed. On quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our apartments, we ſaw all the ſoldiers and coſſacks of the garriſon drawn up on one ſide, and, on the other, were all the male inhabitants
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:030274_1225_0FE577636B12E2D0"/>
of the town, in their beſt clothing; the whole body of the people joining in a melancholy ſong, which, we were informed, it was uſual to ſing on the departure of friends. Thus we marched till we arrived at the commander's houſe, preceded by the drums and muſic belonging to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. Here we were received by Madame Behm, accompanied by ſeveral ladies, habited in long ſilk cloaks, lined with furs of various colours: forming a moſt ſplendid appearance. Having partook of ſome refreſhment which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us, we proceeded to the water-ſide, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the ladies, who joined with the reſt of the people in the ſong; and, having taken leave of Madame Behm, after aſſuring her that the ſenſe of the hoſpitality of Bolcheretſk, would be indelible in our hearts, we were two much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected not to haſten into the boats. At putting off, we received three cheers, which we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately returned; and, on doubling a point, where we laſt beheld our friendly entertainers, they ſtill added to our feelings, by a farewell cheer!</p>
                     <p>On our return, the ſtream was ſo exceedingly rapid, that, notwithſtanding the utmoſt exertions of our conductors, we did not arrive at the firſt village, Opatchin, till the 17th in the evening, which did not exceed the rate of twenty miles a day. On the 19th, we reached Natcheekin, and croſſed the plain to Karatchin on the 20th. The road was in much better order than when
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:030274_1226_0FE5776506246EF8"/>
we paſſed it before, as it froze ſmartly in the night of the 19th. We proceeded down the Awatſka river on the 21ſt, and paſſed over the ſhoals, at the entrance of the bay, before it was dark. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole of our journey, we were highly pleaſed with the willingneſs and alacrity, with which the <hi>Toions</hi> and their Kamtſchadales aſſiſted us at the different <hi>oſtrogs.</hi> On ſeeing the Major, joy appeared in every countenance; and they were much affected upon being informed that he would ſhortly leave them.</p>
                     <p>A meſſenger had been diſpatched from Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheretſk to Captain Clerke, acquainting him with the nature of our reception; and that the Major intended to accompany us on our return; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing him, at the ſame time, of the day he might expect us. We obſerved, with pleaſure, as we approached the harbour, all our boats coming towards us. The men were all clean, and the officers as well arrayed as their ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes would then permit them to be. The Major was ſtruck at the healthly appearance of our ſailors, and was ſurprized to ſee that many of them had no other covering than a ſhirt and trowſers, though it actually ſnowed at that very inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Major Behm had expreſſed an inclination to viſit the ſhips before he landed; but, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Captain Clerke was extremely ill, he thought it would be improper to diſturb him at

ſo late an hour; it being then after nine o'clock. Mr. King therefore attended him to the ſerjeant's houſe, and afterwards went on board to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to Captain Clerke what had happened at Bolcheretſk. He was much concerned to find that, during his abſence, that officer's health was conſiderably impaired; inſtead of growing better, as we flattered ourſelves it might, from undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed repoſe in the harbour, and a milk and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable diet.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, Mr. King conducted the Major to the ſhips; where he was received with every poſſible mark of diſtinction, and ſaluted with thirteen guns. He was attended by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Ruſſian galliot, two merchants from Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheretſk, a maſter of a ſloop, and the prieſt of the village of Paratounca.</p>
                     <p>Having viſited the captain, and taken a view of the two ſhips, he returned to dine on board the Reſolution. In the courſe of the afternoon, the curioſities which we had collected were ſhewn him, and an aſſortment of each article preſented to him by Captain Clerke. Here we cannot ſuppreſs an inſtance of great generoſity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in our ſailors; who, being informed of the handſome preſent which had been made them by the Major, voluntarily requeſted that their grog might be withheld, and their allowance of ſpirits preſented to the garriſon of Bolcheretſk; ſaying they knew brandy was extremely ſcarce in that
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:030274_1228_0FE5773747C24460"/>
country, the ſoldiers on ſhore having offered four roubles a bottle for it. We could not but admire this extraordinary ſacrifice, knowing how much the ſailors felt, when abridged or deprived of their grog. Indeed, they never had that article withheld from them but in warm weather, that they might enjoy a greater proportion when it was moſt neceſſary; but this generous propoſal would deprive them of it, even in the inclement ſeaſon we had naturally to expect in our northern expedition. The officers, however, would not permit them to ſuffer by their generoſity, and ſubſtituted, in the room of the ſmall quantity of brandy, which the Major conſented to accept, an equal quantity of rum. A dozen or two of Cape wine for Madame Behm, and ſome other trifling preſents which we were enabled to make, were accepted with great politeneſs. The tobacco was diſtributed the next morning, among the crews of both veſſels; every man that chewed or ſmoked tobacco being allowed three pounds, and the others only one.</p>
                     <p>It has been obſerved that the Major had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the command of Kamtſchatka, and was ſpeedily to repair to Peterſburgh; and he now expreſſed his willingneſs to convey any diſpatches we might chuſe to commit to his care. Such an opportunity was not to be neglected; and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke requeſted him to take the charge of ſome papers relative to our voyage, to the Britiſh
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:030274_1229_0FE57811EE3DB138"/>
Ambaſſador at the Ruſſian court. At firſt, we intended to tranſmit only a conciſe journal of our proceedings; but, after mature conſideration, Captain Clerke was of opinion, that the whole account of our diſcoveries might ſafely be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the care of a man, who had given the ſtrongeſt proofs of probity and virtue. Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, that a very hazardous part of the voyage was ſtill to be performed, he reſolved to ſend, by him, the whole of Captain Cook's journal; together with his own, from the death of that commander, till our arrival at Kamtſchatka; and alſo a chart of our diſcoveries. Mr. Bayly and Mr. King alſo determined to ſend an account of our proceedings to the board of longitude. From theſe precautions, had any accident befallen us, the Admiralty would have become poſſeſſed of the principal facts of our voyage. It was farther reſolved, that a ſmaller packet ſhould be diſpatched from Okotſk, which the Major ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed would reach Peterſburgh by December; and that he expected to arrive there himſelf in February or March.</p>
                     <p>The Major was entertained alternately in the two ſhips, as well as we were able, the three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing days. He departed on the 25th, and was ſaluted with thirteen guns; the ſailors, at their own requeſt, expreſſing their regard for him by three cheers. Mr. King and Mr. Webber attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, the next morning, ſome few miles up
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:030274_1230_0FE5776DD1BEA9E0"/>
the Awatſka river, where the Ruſſian prieſt and his family were waiting to bid a laſt adieu to their commander.</p>
                     <p>On taking our leave of the Major, it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſay, whether the worthy prieſt and his family or ourſelves were moſt affected. Though our acquaintance had been of ſhort duration, his behaviour had inſpired us with the higheſt eſteem for him; and we could not part (perhaps for ever) with one, to whom we were under ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite obligations, without indulging the moſt tender feelings. Excluſive of the ſtores, which might probably be carried to a public account, the value of the private preſents he beſtowed on us, muſt have amounted to upwards of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. But, however extraordinary this generoſity may appear, it was exceeded by his delicacy in conferring favours, and his ingenious endeavours to prevent our feeling the weight of obligations, which he knew we were unable to requite. In ſupporting a public character, and maintaining the honour of his ſovereign, he is ſtill more entitled to our admiration, as he was actuated by ſentiments the moſt noble and enlarged. The ſervice in which we were engaged, he told us, was for the general benefit of mankind; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled us to the offices of humanity, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of citizens, in whatever country we might be driven. That by affording us ſuch relief as was in his power, he was certain that he was acting
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:030274_1231_0FE5773E8A7231C0"/>
agreeably to the wiſhes of his empreſs; and that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> could not ſo entirely forget her character, or his own honour, as to barter for the performance of a duty. Among other things, he ſaid, he made a particular point of ſetting a good example to the Kamtſchadales, who were juſt emerging from a ſtate of barbariſm; that they conſidered the Ruſſians as their patterns, in every reſpect; and that he hoped, they would in future, think it a duty incumbent on them to render ſtrangers every aſſiſtance in their power, and believe it to be the univerſal practice of all poliſhed and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized nations.</p>
                     <p>The Major, having ſo far as he was capable, relieved our preſent diſtreſſes, he was not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of our future wants; and imagining we ſhould not be able to diſcover the paſſage we were in ſearch of, and that we ſhould return to Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka; he procured from Captain Clerke, the particulars of what flour and cordage he ſhould want, promiſing to ſend them from Okotſk, to wait our arrival. He alſo preſented the Captain with a written paper, enjoining every Ruſſian ſubject to aſſiſt us to the utmoſt of their abilities.</p>

                  <head>LIFE OF CAPTAIN JAMES COOK.</head>
                  <p>WITH AN ELEGANT PORTRAIT.</p>
                  <p>CAPTAIN JAMES COOK, eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as a navigator, was born at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a ſmall village in the North Riding of York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, diſtant about ſix miles from Stockton upon Tees, on the 27th of October 1728. His father, whoſe name was alſo James, and who, from his dialect, was ſuppoſed to be a Northumbrian, lived in the humble ſtation of a farmer's ſervant; he married a woman of the ſame rank with himſelf, and they were both noted in their neighbourhood for their honeſty, ſobriety and induſtry. Young Cook received the firſt rudiments of his education at the place in which he was born, from the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtreſs of the village; but his father in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the character he had obtained for dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſkill in his profeſſion, having been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed bailiff, on a farm belonging to the late
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030274_1233_0FE577B3857EE028"/>
Thomas Scottow, Eſq. called Airy Holme, he removed thither with his family, and his ſon James, being then about eight years of age, was, at Mr. Scottow's expence, put to a day ſchool in Ayton, where he was inſtructed in writing and the principles of arithmetic.</p>
                  <p>Before he had attained to the age of thirteen, he was bound apprentice to a ſhopkeeper at Staiths, a fiſhing town, ten miles north of Whitby; but as he had a ſtrong inclination for a ſea-faring life, and as his paſſion for it was, perhaps, ſtrengthened by the opportunities he had of frequenting the company of thoſe employed in that line, on ſome quarrel between him and his maſter, he obtained his diſcharge, and ſoon after bound himſelf, for ſeven years, to Meſſrs. J. and H. Walker of Whitby, who were Quakers, and principal own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of two ſhips conſtantly employed in the coal trade. After the expiration of his time, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſerve, in the coal and other branches of trade, as a common ſailor, till he was at length promoted to be mate of one of Mr. J. Walker's ſhips. During this period, nothing very ſtriking appeared either in his character or conduct; nor did he exhibit any marks of thoſe ſuperior abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which have done ſo much honour to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation, which give him a title to be ranked amongſt the moſt celebrated navigators, and which will render his name immortal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:030274_1234_0FE577BC24DAC8B0"/>In the ſpring of the year 1755, hoſtilities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced between Great Britain and France. As an order had been iſſued from the Admiralty for impreſſing ſeamen, Mr. Cook, who was then in the river with his ſhip, afraid of being preſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved if poſſible to conceal himſelf, but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards, that this might be difficult, if not impoſſible, he thought it would be beſt to enter voluntarily into his Majeſty's ſervice, and to try his fortune in the Royal Navy. In purſuance of this deſign, he repaired to a houſe of rendezvous at Wapping, and entered with an officer belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Eagle, a ſhip of ſixty guns, at that time commanded by Captain Hamer. To this ſhip, Captain, now Sir Hugh Palliſer, being appointed in the month of October 1755, Cook's d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ligence, and his attention to the duties of his profeſſion, did not eſcape his notice; he ſoon diſtinguiſhed him to be an able and active ſeaman, and as all the officers were unanimous i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> opinion reſpecting him, and ſpoke highly in his favor, the Captain gave him every encouragement which he poſſibly could.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this period, Mr. Oſbaldeſton, then Member of Parliament for Scarborough, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſolicited by ſome of his neighbours, who had heard of Cook's merit, and the notice taken of him by his Captain and officers, wrote a lette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in his favor to Captain Palliſer, requeſting he would point out in what manner they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030274_1235_0FE577B8ABEB87C0"/>
towards his promotion. The Captain, in his reply, did full juſtice to Cook's character, but he informed Mr. Oſbaldeſton, that as he had been only a ſhort while in the Navy, he could not be appointed a commiſſioned officer; adding that a Maſter's warrant, might, perhaps, be procured for him, by which he would be placed in a ſituation ſuited to his talents, and in which he had no doubt, he would diſcharge his duty with credit to himſelf, and with honour to thoſe who patroniſed him.</p>
                  <p>On the 10th of May, 1759, he obtained a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Warrant for the Grampus ſloop; but this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment did not take place, as the proper Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that veſſel unexpectedly returned. Four days after, he was made Maſter of the Garland; but here again he was diſappointed, for, upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, it was found, that he could not join the ſhip, as ſhe had failed ſome days before: however, on the 15th of May, he was appointed to the Mercury, which was deſtined for North-America, to join the fleet under the command of Sir Charles Saunders, who, in conjunction with General Wolf, was then engaged in the ſiege of Quebec. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that memorable ſiege, it was found neceſſary to take ſoundings in the channel of the river St. Lawrence, directly oppoſite to the French camp at Montmorency and Beauport, in order that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dmiral might be enabled to lay his ſhips before the enemies batteries, and to cover the Britiſh army, in an attack which the General intended to make
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030274_1236_0FE577C3F354A000"/>
on the French camp. As this was a dangerous and difficult ſervice, and as Cook's ſagacity and reſolution were now well known, Captain Palliſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> recommended him as a proper perſon to undertake it, and in this choice he was not diſappointed; for Cook performed it in the completeſt manner, and to the full ſatisfaction of his employers. He did not, however, effect his purpoſe without great riſk: having been engaged in this buſineſs during night, for ſeveral nights ſucceſſively, he was at length diſcovered by the enemy, who ſent a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of canoes filled with Indians, to ſurround him, and he had no alternative, but to make for ſhore on the iſland of Orleans, near the guard of the Engliſh hoſpital, to which he was ſo cloſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, that he had ſcarcely leaped from the bow of the boat, which belonging to one of the ſhips of war when the Indians entered it by the ſtern, and having taken poſſeſſion of it, carried it off in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. There is reaſon to believe, that before this period, Cook had ſcarcely uſed a pencil, and was entirely unacquainted with drawing; but ſuch were the powers of his mind, and his aptitude for acquiring knowledge, that he ſoon made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter of every object to which he applied, and notwithſtanding the diſadvantages under which he labored, he furniſhed the Admiral with as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete a draught of the channel and ſoundings as could have been made by the moſt expert ſurveyor in the time of profound peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030274_1237_0FE577BA9F9ACE18"/>Another important ſervice which our naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor performed while on the American ſtation, does no leſs honour to his memory, and deſerves alſo to be mentioned. The navigation of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver St. Lawrence is both difficult and dangerous, and was particularly ſo then to the Engliſh, who were not well acquainted with that part of North America, and who had no chart, on the correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which they could depend. The Admiral, therefore, who had received ſo favorable a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Mr. Cook's abilities, appointed him to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey thoſe parts of the river below Quebec which navigators accounted to be moſt dangerous, and this buſineſs he executed with the ſame diligence, activity and ſkill, as he had diſplayed on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer occaſion. When he had completed his chart of the river it was publiſhed, with ſoundings and directions for ſailing in it, and ſo great was its accuracy, that it hath never ſince been found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to publiſh another.</p>
                  <p>After the expedition to Quebec, Mr. Cook, by a warrant from Lord Colvill, was appointed Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Northumberland, on the 22d of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1759. In this ſhip his lordſhip ſtaid the following winter, as Commodore, at Hali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ax, and Cook's behavior in his new ſtation did not fail to gain him the friendſhip and eſteem of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. Senſible that he was now in the road to promotion, he ſpent the leiſure hours which the winter ſeaſon gave him, in acquiring ſuch branches
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030274_1238_0FE577BE47B84D98"/>
of knowledge as might qualify him for future ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. At Halifax he firſt read Euclid, and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſtronomy. The books he was able to procure were indeed few, but application and induſtry ſupplied many deficiencies, and enabled him to make a progreſs ſuperior to what could be expected from the advantages he enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>While Mr. Cook was Maſter of the Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, under Lord Colvill, that ſhip came to Newfoundland in September, 1762, to aſſiſt in the recapture of the iſland. After that object was accompliſhed, the Engliſh fleet remained ſome days at Placentia, in order to put it in a better ſtate of defence. During this time Mr. Cook had again an opportunity of diſplaying his diligence, and manifeſting his zeal for the good of his Majeſty's ſervice; he ſurveyed the harbour and heights of that place, and by this attracted the notice of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, afterwards Admiral Graves, who was at that time commander of the Antelope, and Governor of Newfoundland. The Governor, from this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, having been induced to aſk him a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of queſtions, his anſwers were ſo ſatisfactory, that he thence conceived a very favorable opinion of his abilities and nautical knowledge, and this was ſtill farther increaſed by a longer acquaintance with him. Poſſeſſed of an active genius, ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, perhaps, by the ſucceſs which had attended his paſt labors, and the hopes of promotion, Cook continued to diſplay the moſt unremitting aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030274_1239_0FE57744323A5A48"/>
in order to make himſelf acquainted with the American coaſt, and to facilitate its navigation, while the eſteem which Captain Graves entertain for him was greatly heightened by the repeated teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies of his good behaviour, given by all the officers under whom he had ſerved.</p>
                  <p>In the latter end of the year 1762, Mr. Cook returned to England, and on the 21ſt of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he married, at Barking in Eſſex, a young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the name of Batts, whom he tenderly loved and who had every claim to his warmeſt regard and affection; but his ſituation in life, and the high and important ſervices to which he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, did not ſuffer him long to enjoy matrimonial felicity without interruption.</p>
                  <p>Peace being concluded in 1763 between En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, France, and Spain, Captain Graves was again ſent out as Governor of Newfoundland. As this country was conſidered to be of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in a commercial view, and as it had been the principal object of contention between the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and the French, the Governor obtained, though with ſome difficulty, an eſtabliſhment for the ſurvey of its coaſts; and Mr. Cook, on the recommendation of Captain Graves, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to carry this plan into execution. He, therefore, went out with that gentleman, and having ſurveyed the ſmall iſlands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, which, by treaty, had been ceded to the French, and which they were ſuffered to take
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030274_1240_0FE577C583304CA8"/>
poſſeſſion of, after the buſineſs was finiſhed, he returned to England, towards the concluſion of the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the year following, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his friend and patron Sir Hugh Palliſer, who was appointed Commodore and Governor of Labradore and Newfoundland, in the ſame ſtation in which he had been under Captain Graves. For this employment Mr. Cook was well qualified, and the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rts of his ſurveys, which he afterwards publiſhed, reflected the higheſt credit on his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He explored the inland part of the iſland of Newfoundland, in a much more accurate manner than had ever been done before, and by penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the heart of the country diſcovered ſeveral large lakes, the poſition of which is diſtinctly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the general chart. It appears, that Mr. Cook was occaſionally engaged in this ſervice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to England for the winter ſeaſon, till the year 1767, which was the lateſt period of his being employed as Marine Surveyor of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. That he had by this time made a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable knowledge in practical aſtronomy is evident, from a ſhort paper written by him, which was inſerted in the fifty-ſeventh volume of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Tranſactions, entitled <hi>An ohſervation of an Eclipſe of the ſun at the iſland of Newfoundland, Auguſt the</hi> 5<hi>th,</hi> 1766, <hi>with the longitude of the place of obſervation deduced from it.</hi> This obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made at one of the Burgeo iſlands, near Cape Ray, in lat. 47° 36′ 19″, on the ſouth-weſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030274_1241_0FE577FA1B3E80A8"/>
extremity of Newfoundland, and Mr. Cook's paper having been communicated to Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Witchell, he compared it with an obſervation made on the ſame eclipſe by the Reverend Mr. Hornſby, and thence computed the difference of longitude of the places of obſervation making proper allowance for parallax, and the prolate ſpheroidal figure of the earth. It appears from the Philoſophical Tranſactions, that Cook was at this time accounted an able mathematician.</p>
                  <p>Though many diſcoveries have been made at different periods, by Britiſh navigators, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the preſent reign to carry the ſpirit of enterprize to its utmoſt extent, and to direct it for the accompliſhment of the nobleſt purpoſes. Soon after peace was concluded in 1763, two voyages round the world were undertaken, under the patronage of his preſent Majeſty, which were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Captains Byron, Wallis, and Cartaret, and before the two latter returned another was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon, the principal object of which was the improvement of aſtronomy. It having been calculated, that the planet Venus would paſs over the Sun's diſk in 1769, it was judged that the beſt place for obſerving this phenomenon, would be either at the Marqueſas, or at one of thoſe iſlands which Taſman called Amſterdam, Rotterdam and Middleburgh, and which are now better known by the appellation of the Friendly Iſles. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of the greateſt importance to aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, the Royal Society, with a laudable zeal
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030274_1242_0FE577C796537058"/>
for the advancement of that ſcience, preſented a memorial to his Majeſty, requeſting among other things, that a veſſel might be fitted out at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of government, to convey proper perſons to obſerve the tranſit of Venus at one of the above mentioned places. This petition was readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, and orders having been ſent to the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty to provide a veſſel for that purpoſe, on the 3d of April Mr. Stephens informed the Society, that a bark had been taken up, and would be got ready with all convenient ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>The perſon originally fixed upon to conduct this expedition was Mr. Dalrymple, an eminent Member of the Royal Society, who had diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his enquiries reſpecting the geography of the ſouthern ocean. Though this gentleman had not been regularly bred to the ſea, he inſiſted upon hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a brevet commiſſion, as Captain of the veſſel, before he ſhould ſet out. Sir Edward Hawke, who was then at the head of the Admiralty, violently oppoſed this meaſure, and being preſſed on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, declared, he would rather ſuffer his right hand to be cut off than ſign ſuch a commiſſion. Both parties were inflexible; it was therefore found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to look out for ſome other perſon to conduct the expedition, and Mr. Stephens, Secretary to the Admiralty, having recommended Mr. Cook, and this recommendation being ſtrengthened by the teſtimony of Sir Hugh Palliſer, who was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his abilities and merit, he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030274_1243_0FE57801A415D2D0"/>
to this important ſervice by the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and promoted to the rank of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the Royal Navy, on the 25th of May 1768.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as this appointment had taken place, Sir Hugh Palliſer was ordered to provide a veſſel ſuited for ſuch a voyage. He examined a great many of thoſe which were then lying in the Thames, and with Mr. Cook's aſſiſtance of whoſe judgment he entertained the higheſt opinion, he at length, fixed upon one of three hundred and ſeventy tons burthen, which was afterwards named the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                  <p>Captain Wallis having returned from his voyage round the world while preparations were making for Cook's expedition, and that gentleman having ſignified to the Royal Society, that Port Royal har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in King George's Iſland, which he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and which is now known by the name of Otaheite, would be the moſt convenient ſituation for obſerving the tranſit, Captain Wallis's opinion was adopted, and orders were given to the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to repair thither. Mr. Charles Green, who had been under Dr. Bradley, at the Royal Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory, at Greenwich, was appointed to aſſiſt Mr. Cook, in conducting the aſtronomical part of the voyage. He was accompanied alſo by Joſeph Banks, Eſq. now Sir Joſeph Banks, Bart. and Dr. Solander, the former of whom, at an early period of life, and at a great expence to himſelf, embarked in this tedious and hazardous enterprize, with the nobleſt of all views, that of promoting the cauſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030274_1244_0FE577C987E85A60"/>
of ſcience, and enlarging the knowledge of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Though the principal intention of this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was to obſerve the tranſit of Venus, it was thought proper, to make it comprehend other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects alſo; Mr. Cook, therefore, was directed, after he had accompliſhed his main buſineſs, to proceed in making further diſcoveries in the great Southern Seas. The complement of the Endeavour conſiſted, beſides the Commander, of eighty-four perſons. She was victualled for eighteen months, and ten carriage and twelve ſwivel guns were ſent on board of her, together with abundance of ammunition and all neceſſary ſtores.</p>
                  <p>The Endeavour being completely fitted for ſea, Mr. Cook ſailed from Deptford, on the 30th of July 1768, and on the 13th of Auguſt anchored in Plymouth Sound, from which, after a few days ſtay, he proceeded to ſea, and reached Madeira on the 13th of September. Having laid in a freſh ſtock of beef, water and wine at this iſland, our navigator purſued his voyage; but on the 7th of November, finding that ſeveral articles of the ſhip's proviſions were likely to fall ſhort, he determined to touch at Rio de Janeiro, where he had no doubt of meeting with a friendly reception. In this, however, he was diſappointed; and though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſupply of water, and ſuch other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as in like circumſtances, the people of one civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized nation would ſcarcely refuſe to thoſe of an other, he could not make the Viceroy, who appears to have been jealous of the deſigns of the Engliſh,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030274_1245_0FE57803E54C2C08"/>
and who beſides, was not celebrated for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, comprehend the true intent of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>On the 7th of December, the Endeavour got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſail, and on the 14th of January, 1769, Mr. Cook entered the Strait of Le Maire, and next day anchored in the Bay of Good Succeſs, where the following remarkable adventure happened to Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and ſome others who accompanied them in a botanical excurſion. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſcended a mountain in ſearch of plants, they were expoſed to ſuch an intenſe degree of cold, that Dr. Solander was ſeized with a torper, which had nearly put a period to his exiſtence. Two black ſervants who attended our adventurers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually died, and this event took place in the midſt of ſummer, in that part of the world, and at the cloſe of a day, the beginning of which was as mild and warm as the month of May uſually is in England.</p>
                  <p>After doubling Cape Horn, and diſcovering ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral iſlands, moſt of which appeared to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and to be clothed with the moſt beautiful verdure, Mr. Cook arrived in ſight of Otaheite, on the 11th of April, and on the 13th the Endeavour came to anchor in Port Royal Bay, which by the natives is called <hi>Matavai.</hi> The firſt object which engaged our navigator's attention upon his arrival here, does the higheſt honor to his good ſenſe and humanity. As he was ſenſible that his ſtay at the iſland was not likely to be long, and that much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030274_1246_0FE577CFA44E6730"/>
upon the manner in which the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved towards the natives, he drew up a ſet of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations for the conduct of his people, and gave expreſs orders that they ſhould be ſtrictly obſerved. Theſe orders were as follows: Firſt, "To endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor by every fair means to cultivate a friendſhip with the natives; and to treat them with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable humanity. Secondly, a proper perſon or perſons will be appointed to trade with the natives for all manner of proviſions, fruit, and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the earth, and no officer or ſeaman, or other perſon belonging to the ſhip, except ſuch as are ſo appointed, ſhall trade, or offer to trade for any ſort of proviſion fruit, or other productions of the earth, unleſs they have leave to do ſo. Thirdly, every perſon employed on ſhore, or on any duty whatſoever, is ſtrictly to attend to the ſame, and if by any neglect, he loſeth any of his arms or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tools, or ſuffers them to be ſtolen, the full value thereof will be charged againſt his pay, according to the cuſtom of the navy in ſuch caſes, and he ſhall receive ſuch farther puniſhment as the nature of the offence may deſerve. Fourthly, the ſame penalty will be inflicted on every perſon who is found to embezzel, trade, or offer to trade with any part of the ſhip's ſtores, of whatſoever nature they may be. And laſtly, no ſort of iron, or any thing that is made of iron, or any ſort of cloth, or other uſeful or neceſſary articles, are to be given in exchange for any thing but proviſion."</p>
                  <p>Having accompliſhed the grand object of his expedition, a particular account of which may be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030274_1247_0FE578056935CA18"/>
ſeen in the ſixty-firſt volume of the Philoſophical Tranſactions, our navigator began to think of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his voyage, in obedience to the orders which he had received from the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty. Having therefore, got every thing in readineſs for his departure, and having taken on board a native of the country, named <hi>Tupia,</hi> who brought with him a boy of 13 years of age, and earneſtly entreated that he might be allowed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Engliſh, he weighed anchor on the 13th of July, after a ſtay of three months. To give a particular account of all the places viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Cook, in the courſe of this voyage, would be tedious; let it therefore be ſufficient to ſay, that, after aſcertaining New-Zealand to be two iſlands, and after ſpending ſix months in exploring their coaſts, he made for New-Holland, where he anchored, in Botany Bay, on the 28th of April, 1770. Great part of the coaſts of this extenſive country Mr. Cook examined alſo, and finding on his arrival at Batavia, to which he had directed his courſe, that it would be dangerous to proceed to Europe, without inſpecting the Endeavour's bottom, he requeſted leave from the Governor to heave her down, which was readily complied with. Before the veſſel was refitted, the dreadful effects of that unhealthy climate were ſeverely felt. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, were attacked by fevers, and in a little time almoſt every perſon both on board and on ſhore, was ſick. This circumſtance occaſioned a great delay, and though ſeveral of the gentlemen
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030274_1248_0FE577D17562B3C8"/>
were conſiderably better by the time the ſhip was ready for ſea, yet the number of ſick even then amounted to forty, and the reſt of the company were in a very feeble condition. What may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear rather ſingular is, that the ſailmaker, an old man, between ſeventy and eighty years of age, and who got drunk every day during the time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at Batavia, was the only perſon who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in full health. Three ſeaman, and Mr. Green's ſervant died, together with the ſurgeon, <hi>Tupia</hi> and his companion <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ayeto.</hi> The former did not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall a ſacrifice to the unwholeſomeneſs of the climate: having been accuſtomed to ſeed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally upon vegetables, he ſoon contracted thoſe diſorders which are incident to a ſea life, and in all probability would have ſunk under them, even if the Engliſh had not been obliged to go to Batavia.</p>
                  <p>On the 27th of December Mr. Cook departed from Batavia, and having taken in a freſh ſupply of wood and water, together with ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at Prince's Iſland, he directed his courſe for the Cape of Good Hope; but before he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that place, the ſeeds of diſeaſe which had been received at Batavia appeared with alarming ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and reduced the ſhip's crew to the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſituation. Mr. Banks' life was almoſt deſpaired of, and ſo dreadful was the ravage of the diſtemper, that ſcarcely a night paſſed but ſome dead body was committed to the deep. In the courſe of ſix weeks, Mr. Sporing, one of Mr.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030274_1249_0FE57807506B9530"/>
Banks' aſſiſtants, Mr. Parkinſon, his natural hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry painter, Mr. Green, the aſtronomer, the boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain, the carpenter, and his mate, Mr. Monk-houſe, the midſhipman, another midſhipman, the old ſailmaker and his aſſiſtant, the ſhip's cook, the corporal of the marines, two of the carpenter's crew, and nine of the ſeamen, all ſhared the ſame fate. The loſs in all amounted to twenty-three perſons, beſides the ſeven who died at Batavia.</p>
                  <p>The evident proofs which Mr. Cook exhibited of his ſagacity, reſolution and activity, during this perilous enterprize, in which he had encountered many dangers and difficulties, gave him a juſt claim to the protection of government, and to the favour of his ſovereign. He was, therefore, ſoon after his arrival, promoted to be a commander in his Majeſty's navy, by commiſſion bearing date Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 29th, 1771. On this occaſion, he wiſhed to have been appointed a Poſt Captain; but Lord Sandwich, who was now at the head of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, though he had the greateſt eſteem for our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigator, would not comply with his requeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would have been inconſiſtent with the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed order of the naval ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Though Captain Cook had fully accompliſhed the main object of his voyage, and though he had afterwards traverſed great part of the Pacific Ocean, and explored the coaſts of New-Zealand and New Holland, he had not, however, been able to determine the grand queſtion, reſpecting a <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Auſtralis Incognita,</hi> or <hi>ſouthern continent,</hi> which had long amuſed Europe. The firſt perſon who
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030274_1250_0FE577D2F9F82238"/>
ſeems to have entertained any notion of this kind, was the famous Quiros, who was ſent out for the expreſs purpoſe of diſcovering it; but he did not ſucceed, and all thoſe who made the ſame attempt afterwards were equally unſucceſsful. To deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, therefore, this point, of ſo much importance to geography and navigation, a ſecond expedition was planned out, at the deſire of his Majeſty, whoſe patronage of literature and ſcience has been eminently conſpicuous; and no perſon appeared better qualified to undertake it than Captain Cook.</p>
                  <p>When this deſign was fully reſolved upon, two veſſels, which had been both built at Whitby, by the ſame perſon who had built the Endeavour, were purchaſed of Captain William Hammond, of Hull. The largeſt, which was about four hundred and ſixty-two tons burthen, was called the Reſolution, and the other, which was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably leſs, was named the Adventure. On the 28th of November, 1771, Captain Cook was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the command of the former, and about the ſame time Mr. Tobias Furneaux to that of the latter. In the equipment of theſe veſſels, every poſſible attention was beſtowed; they were ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the beſt ſtores and proviſions, and every article ſuited to the nature of the expedition was put on board of them, beſides abundance of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcorbutics, ſuch as malt, ſour krout, ſalted cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, portable broth, ſaloup, muſtard, marmalade of carrots, and inſpiſſated juice of wort and beer.</p>
                  <p>The advancement of ſcience was equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted. Mr. Wm. Hodges, an eminent landſcape
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030274_1251_0FE5774F8FE847E8"/>
painter, was engaged to make drawings of ſuch objects as could not be ſo well comprehended from deſcriptions; Mr. John Reinhold Foſter, and his ſon, were appointed to explore the natural hiſtory of the countries they might viſit, and Mr. Wm. Wales, and Mr. Wm. Bayley, were choſen on purpoſe to make aſtronomical obſervations.</p>
                  <p>On the 9th of April 1772, Captain Cook ſailed from Deptford, and on the 3d of July, joined the Adventure in Plymouth Sound. From Plymouth, he departed on the 13th of the ſame month, and having touched at Madeira, to obtain a ſupply of water, wine and other neceſſaries, proceeded on his voyage, but finding that his water would not laſt to the Cape of Good Hope, without putting his men to ſhort allowance, he reſolved to touch at St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd Iſlands, in order to get a freſh ſtock. On the 10th of Auguſt he arrived at Port Praya, in that iſland, and having procured a ſufficiency of water and other refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, put to ſea again, on the 14th, and on the 30th of October, came to anchor in Table Bay, at the Cape of Good Hope, where he was received with the greateſt politeneſs by the Governor, and promiſed every aſſiſtance that the place could afford. From the Cape our commander departed on the 22d of November, in ſearch of a <hi>ſouthern continent,</hi> and having got clear of the land, directed his courſe for Cape Circumciſion; but a dreadful gale of wind coming on about the 6th of December, which at times was ſo furious, that the ſhips could carry no ſail, they were driven ſo far to the eaſtward of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030274_1252_0FE577D4E33F7FA0"/>
their courſe, that no hopes were left of reaching the intended ſpot.</p>
                  <p>On the 10th of December, our navigators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to meet with iſlands of ice, one of which was ſo concealed by the hazineſs of the weather, that they were almoſt cloſe upon it before it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Captain Cook judged, that it might be about fifty feet high, and half a mile in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. It was flat on the top, and its ſides roſe in a perpendicular direction, againſt which the ſea broke with amazing fury, and was daſhed up to a great height. By the 17th of January 1773, he had reached the latitude of 67° 15′, where he found the ice entirely cloſed, and on the 17th of March, after two months longer navigation amidſt mountains and iſlands of ice, which ſeemed to threaten deſtruction on every ſide, conſidering that it would be very improper to continue longer in high ſouthern latitudes, he reſolved to quit them, and to proceed to New-Zealand, with a view of looking for the Adventure, which had parted from him on the 8th of February, and that he might have an opportunity of procuring ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his people. He therefore, ſteered his courſe for that iſland, and came to anchor in Duſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky Bay, on the 26th of March, from which he proceeded to Queen Charlotte's Sound, where he had the ſatisfaction of meeting with the Adventure, after an abſence of fourteen weeks.</p>
                  <p>Quitting New-Zealand, in company with the Adventure, Captain Cook paid a viſit to his old friends at Otaheite, the Society and Friendly Iſles,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030274_1253_0FE5780D387041E8"/>
and having examined a ſpace of more than forty degrees of longitude, between the tropicks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Queen Charlotte's Sound. Here he changed the rigging of his ſhip for ſuch as might be able to withſtand ſtorms and the ſeverity of high ſouthern latitudes; and again ſet ſail on the 27th of November, to explore the unknown parts of the Pacific Ocean. In this perilous navigation, he was expoſed to dangers which none but a man poſſeſſed of the greateſt reſolution could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered; yet ſuch was his ſtrength of mind, and ſo great was his ſkill in navigation, that though often interrupted by iſlands of ice, among which he was ſometimes as it were incloſed, and though his veſſel was almoſt every moment in hazard of being daſhed to pieces, by large maſſes, which floated around, he advanced amidſt all theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles till nature ſet bounds to his courſe. Many of theſe ice-iſlands were two and three hundred feet in height, and between two and three miles in circuit, with perpendicular ſides or cliffs, that could not be beheld without aſtoniſhment.</p>
                  <p>On the 26th of January, 1774, our navigators paſſed the Antarctic circle for the third time in 109 degrees of weſt longitude, where they found the mildeſt ſun-ſhine they had ever experienced in the frigid zone. This circumſtance induced them to hope, that they ſhould be able to penetrate as far towards the ſouth as others had done towards the north; but the next day, they diſcovered a ſolid field of ice before them, which extended from eaſt to weſt farther than the eye could reach. Within

this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ninety-ſeven iſlands were counted, beſides thoſe on the outſide, many of which were large, and had the appearance of a ridge of mountains, riſing one above another, till they were loſt in the clouds. The outer, or northern edge of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe field, was compoſed of looſe or broken ice, packed ſo cloſely together, that there was no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of entering it; but Captain Cook was of opinion, that there muſt be land to the ſouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it. "If there is," ſays he, "it can afford no better retreat for birds, or any other animals than the ice itſelf, with which it muſt be entirely covered." He then adds, "I, who was ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous not only of going farther than any body had gone before, but as far as it was poſſible for man to go, was not ſorry at meeting with this interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it in ſome meaſure relieved us, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the dangers and hardſhips inſeparable from the navigation of the ſouthern polar regions. Since then, we could not proceed farther to the ſouth, no other reaſon need be aſſigned for my tacking and ſtanding back to the north, being at this time in the latitude of 70° 10′ ſouth and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 106° 54′ weſt."</p>
                  <p>Our navigator next went in queſt of land ſaid to have been diſcovered by Juan Fernandez, no veſtiges of which he could find. He then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Marqueſas, diſcovered in 1565, and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſecond time during this voyage the iſland of Otaheite, where having procured ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſailed for the New-Hebrides which though diſcovered as early as 1606, by Quitos,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030274_1255_0FE5780EDF8657D0"/>
had never been ſufficiently explored. Beſides aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining the extent and ſituation of theſe iſlands, which had been barely ſeen by others, he acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a knowledge of ſeveral before unknown, which entitled him to give the whole that appellation by which they are now diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Captain Cook continued ſurveying theſe iſlands during the month of Auguſt, 1774, and having ſet ſail on the 1ſt of Auguſt, diſcovered a large track of land, to which he gave the name of New-Caledonia. The coaſts of this he explored alſo, and found it to be the moſt conſiderable of all the tropical iſlands in thoſe parts, and except New-Holland and New-Zealand, the largeſt that has been ſeen in the South Pacific Ocean. On leaving New-Caledonia, he fell in with an uninhabited iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, on the 10th of October, which he named Norfolk Iſle, in honor of the noble family of How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and finding that proviſions were now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to run ſhort, he determined to ſail again for New-Zealand, where he came to anchor on the 18th of October. Here he continued till the 10th of November, when he again ſet out, in purſuit of his great object, the determination of the queſtion concerning the exiſtence of a ſouthern continent; but having ſailed till the 27th, in different degrees of latitude, extending from 43° to 55° 48′ ſouth without ſucceſs, he gave up all hopes of finding it, and reſolved to ſteer directly for the weſt entrance of the ſtraits of Maghalhaens, with a view of coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſouth ſide of Terra del Fuego, round Cape Horn to the ſtrait Le Maire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:030274_1256_0FE5774074588340"/>During the reſt of the voyage very little remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occured. After leaving Terra del Fuego, our navigator proceeded round Cape Horn, paſſed through Strait Le Mair, to Staten Iſland, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing explored part of the neighbouring ſeas, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his courſe to the Cape of Good Hope, from which he ſailed to England, where he arrived on the 19th of July, 1775, having been abſent from it three years and eighteen days.</p>
                  <p>Though the queſtion reſpecting the exiſtence of a ſouthern continent was now fully determined, there remained ſtill another important object to be inveſtigated, the practicability of a northern paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Pacific Ocean. It had long been a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite ſcheme with navigators, and particularly the Engliſh, to diſcover a ſhorter and more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the Eaſt Indies, than that by the Cape of Good Hope. Several attempts were made for this purpoſe, both by our own countrymen, and the Dutch; but with ſo little ſucceſs, that it ceaſed for many years to be an object of purſuit. In the beginning of the preſent century it was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by Mr. Dobbs, and Captain Middleton was ſent out by government in 1741, and Captain Smith and Captain Moore in 1746; but though an act of parliament had been paſſed, which ſecured a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of twenty thouſand pounds to the diſcoverer, the accompliſhment of this favorite object continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at as great a diſtance as ever.</p>
                  <p>To aſcertain whether this matter, of ſo much importance to geography and navigation, could be carried into execution, was reſerved for the glory of the preſent reign. The idea was very warmly eſpouſed by the Firſt Lord of the Admiralty, and it was reſolved that a voyage ſhould be undertaken for that purpoſe. For the conduct of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, it was evident that great ſkill and ability
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030274_1257_0FE5781066B9F4A8"/>
were requiſite, and though no one was ſo well qualified for it as Captain Cook, yet none of his friends, not even Lord Sandwich, preſumed to ſolicit him on the ſubject. The ſervice he had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſcience and navigation was ſo great, the labors he had ſuſtained, and the dangers he had encountered were ſo many, and ſo various, that it was deemed not reaſonable to aſk him to engage in freſh perils. His advice, however, was requeſted, reſpecting the propereſt perſon for undertaking the voyage, and in order to determine this point, the Captain, Sir Hugh Palliſer, and Mr. Stephens, were invited to dinner at Lord Sandwich's houſe. In the courſe of the converſation, while they were diſcourſing on the importance of the deſign, and the conſequences that were likely to reſult from it to ſcience and navigation, Cook's mind was ſo fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the magnitude of the object, that he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtarted up and declared, that he himſelf would undertake the direction of it. No propoſal could be received with more pleaſure. Lord Sandwich immediately laid the affair before his Majeſty, and Capt. Cook was appointed to the expedition, on the 10th of February, 1776.</p>
                  <p>When the command of the enterpriſe was thus ſettled, much to the ſatisfaction of thoſe who had ſet it on foot, it was conſidered as a matter of great importance to determine what might be the beſt courſe to be purſued in the voyage. All former navigators round the globe had returned by the Cape of Good Hope; but to Capt. Cook was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the arduous taſk of attempting the ſame thing, by reaching the high northern latitudes, between A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia and America; and it appears, that this plan was adopted in conſequence of his own ſuggeſtions. He was, therefore, ordered to proceed to the Pacific Ocean, through that chain of iſlands which he had before viſited, in the tropical regions of the ſouth,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030274_1258_0FE577DD397BB6A8"/>
and thence, if practicable, to make his way into the Atlantic. To give every poſſible encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the proſecution of this great deſign, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of intereſt were added to the ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igations of duty. In the act of parliament paſſed in 1745, the reward of twenty thouſand pounds was offered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to veſſels <hi>belonging to any of his Majeſty's ſubjects:</hi> ſhips belonging to government being thus excluded. Beſides this, the reward was entirely confined to ſuch as ſhould diſcover a paſſage through Hudſon's Bay, but by a new act, which paſſed in 1776, it was declared, that if any ſhip belonging to any of his Majeſty's ſubjects or <hi>to his Majeſty</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould find and ſail through any paſſage by ſea, between the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and Pacific Oceans, in <hi>any direction,</hi> or parallel of the northern hemiſphere, to the northward of the fifty-ſecond degree of northern latitude, the owners of ſuch ſhips, if belonging to any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects, <hi>or the commander, officers and ſeaman of ſuch ſhip, if belonging to his Majeſty,</hi> ſhould receive as a reward for ſuch diſcovery the ſum of twenty thouſand pounds.</p>
                  <p>The veſſels fixed upon by government for this ſervice, were the Reſolution and the Diſcovery. The command of the former was given to Captain Cook, and that of the latter to Capt. Clerk, who had been our navigator's ſecond lieutenant in his ſecond voyage. Nearly the ſame complement of men and officers was aſſigned to each as before, and the utmoſt attention was employed by the Admiralty Board to have them equipped in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleateſt manner. Every article that could tend to preſerve the health of the ſeamen was provided in abundance; and that the inhabitants of Otaheite, and of the other iſlands in the South Seas where the Engliſh had been treated with ſo much hoſpitality, might be benefited by the expedition, his Majeſty
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030274_1259_0FE548DD3AE07E98"/>
was graciouſly pleaſed to order an aſſortment of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful animals to be put on board, and to be left in thoſe countries. Beſides theſe, the Captain was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a quantity of European garden-ſeeds, and the Board of Admiralty added ſuch articles of commerce as were moſt likely to promote a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercourſe with the natives of the other hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, and to induce them to carry on a profitable traffic with the Engliſh. Additional clothing, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſeverities of a cold climate, was likewiſe ordered for the crews of the two ſhips, and nothing was denied our navigators that could contribute to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſen the hardſhips of the expedition, or to render their ſituation comfortable.</p>
                  <p>As the ſhips were to touch at Otaheite and the Society Iſles, it had been determined to ſend back by this opportunity Omai, a native of that country, whom Capt. Furneaux brought with him to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the former voyage. He therefore left London on the 24th of June, 1776, in company with the Captain, and every preparation being completed, they ſailed for Plymouth, where they were joined by the Diſcovery. From Plymouth our navigators directed their courſe to Teneriff, to procure a freſh ſupply of corn and hay, for the ſubſiſtence of their live ſtock. They then proceeded to the Cape, where they ſtaid from the 18th of October till the 30th of November, and having touched at Kergue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len's Iſland, and Van Diemen's Land, diſcovered by Taſman in 1642, arrived at Queen Charlotte's Sound, in New-Zealand, on the 12th of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1777.</p>
                  <p>At New-Zealand they ſtaid about two weeks, during which time they acquired much additional knowledge reſpecting its productions, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and cuſtoms of its inhabitants. They then paid a viſit to the Friendly Iſles, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome time, and where Captain Cook neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected

no opportunity of making ſuch obſervations as might be ſerviceable to navigation and aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. From the information which he then receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it appears, that this Archipelago is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive; above one hundred and fifty iſlands were reckoned up by the natives, who made uſe of bits of leaves to aſcertain their number; and Mr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon, with his uſual diligence, procured all their names. Sixty-one of theſe iſles have their proper places and names marked out upon the chart of the Friendly Iſles, and the ſketch of the harbour of Tongataboo, which are given in the account pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of this expedition.</p>
                  <p>On the 17th of July Capt. Cook took his final leave of the Friendly Iſles, and, reſuming his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, reached Otaheite on the 12th of Auguſt. From Otaheite he proceeded to ſome other of the Society Iſles, and having diſpoſed of Omai, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his wiſhes, and diſtributed part of his live ſtock, in ſuch a manner as he thought would beſt anſwer the propoſed end, he determined to purſue his courſe to the northward. Setting ſail, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from <hi>Bolabola,</hi> on the 8th of December, he croſſed the line about the 24th, and on the 18th of January, 1778, diſcovered an iſland, which he, however, could not reach. Soon after another appeared, on which he went on ſhore, and in the courſe of a few days, a whole group was ſeen which Capt. Cook, in honor of Lord Sandwich, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of the Sandwich Iſlands. Thoſe which he ſaw were ſituated between the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 20° 30′, and 22° 15′ north, and between the longitude of 199° 29′, and 201° 30′ eaſt.</p>
                  <p>On quitting theſe iſlands, Captain Cook proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to range along the weſtern ſide of America, and after giving names to ſeveral capes and headlands, which appeared in ſight, came to anchor in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, where the country preſented a very different
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030274_1261_0FE5781C601FFFC0"/>
aſpect from what he had ſeen before. The ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the mountains were clothed in ſheets of ſnow, while the valleys between them and the grounds on the ſea coaſt, both high and low, were covered to a conſiderable breadth, with tall ſtreight trees, which formed a moſt beautiful proſpect, as of one immenſe foreſt. On his firſt arrival in this inlet, he had honored it with the name of King George's Sound; but he afterwards found that it was called <hi>Nootka</hi> by the natives. Having ſtaid nearly a month here, to complete the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of the ſhips, our navigators proceeded north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and entered another inlet, from which great things were expected, as they entertained the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hopes, that it would be found to communicate either with the ſea to the north, or with Baffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On this account, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was traced as high as the latitude of 60° 30′, and the longitude of 210°, being ſeventy leagues from its entrance, but without ſucceſs; for after ſeveral fruitleſs attempts to diſcover a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through it, this idea was abandoned, and Captain Cook named it River Turnagain. Lord Sandwich has ſince diſtinguiſhed it by the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cook's River.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indefatigable in purſuit of his favorite object, Captain Cook continued his reſearches, and arrived on the 27th of June, 1778, at the iſland of <hi>Oona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

A prodigious number
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030274_1262_0FE577E098105EB0"/>
of ſea-horſes lay upon it, ſome of which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for food, as at this time there was a great want of freſh proviſions, and though many of the ſailors were diſappointed, having at firſt concluded that theſe animals were ſea-cows, yet ſuch was the general anxiety for a change of diet, that our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers lived on them as long as they laſted.</p>
                  <p>From the 26th of April, the time that Capt. Cook left Nootka, to the 29th of July, many important diſcoverie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> were made, which it is impoſſible to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize here. They form a valuable addition to thoſe made in the courſe of his two former voyages, and, in point of extent, ſurpaſs all that the Ruſſians had accompliſhed in a long ſeries of years, though in parts belonging or contiguous to their own em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He had previous to the laſt mentioned peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, traverſed the Icy Sea beyond Beering's Strait, in various directions, and through numberleſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and obſtructions; but he never abandoned the purſuit of his favorite object till the ice increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much, as to preclude all hopes of attaining it, at leaſt during that year. The ſeaſon being far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and the time when the froſt was expected to ſet in being faſt approaching, he thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent to make any farther attempts to find a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the Atlantic, till the next ſummer. He, therefore, began now to look out for a place where he might, beſides procuring wood and water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently paſs the winter, and as none ſeemed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adapted for that purpoſe than ſome of the Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Iſles, he determined to direct his courſe thither.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto this expedition, though attended with many dangers and difficulties, had been marked with no peculiar diſaſter, and our illuſtrious commander was no doubt flattering himſelf with the hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſucceſsful in his reſearches the next ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but little did he think that the <hi>Sandwich Iſles,</hi> which he conſidered as the moſt important diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030274_1263_0FE5781E9F758338"/>
of all that had been made by Europeans in the Pacific Ocean, would in the reſult prove fatal, and that he ſhould there fall by the murdering dagger of a barbarian. To relate an event of this kind muſt ever be a painful taſk to a feeling mind; but it muſt be doubly ſo, when it appears that the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſufferer became a victim to his own humanity.</p>
                  <p>In Captain Cook's former viſit to this group of iſlands, he had obſerved five of them ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the latitude of 20° 30′, and 22° 15′ north, and between the longitude of 199° 30′, and 201° 30′ eaſt, the names of which were <hi>Woahoo, Atooi, Oneeheow, Oreehoua</hi> and <hi>Tahoora;</hi> but on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſouthward, with an intent of paſſing the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he diſcovered on the 26th of November, when he came to the latitude of 20° 55′, a ſixth, named <hi>Mowee,</hi> and on the 30th, another, which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of <hi>Owhyhee.</hi> As this iſland appeared to be of greater extent and importance that any of the reſt, our navigator ſpent nearly ſeven weeks in ſailing round it, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining its coaſts. Whilſt he was employed in this buſineſs, the inhabitants came off from time to time in great numbers with their canoes, and readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in traffic. On this occaſion their behaviour was open and unreſerved, and afforded much leſs cauſe for ſuſpicion than that of any other people among whom our navigators had ever been. It was even remarked, that the people of Otaheite it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with whom he had been ſo intimately connected, had never diſplayed ſuch unbounded confidence in the integrity and good treatment of the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>On the 17th of January, 1779, our navigators came to anchor in the Bay of <hi>Karakakooa,</hi> which is ſituated on the weſt ſide of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he iſland of <hi>Owhyhee,</hi> and extends about a mile in depth. It is bounded by two points of land, bearing ſouth-eaſt and north-weſt from each other, at the diſtance of half a league:
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030274_1264_0FE577E81489EB58"/>
on the northernmoſt of which is ſituated a village called <hi>Kowrowa.</hi> A more conſiderable village ſtands in the bottom of the Bay, near a ſtately grove of cocoa-nut trees, and a high rocky cliff, inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the ſea ſhore, runs between them. Near the coaſt on the ſouth ſide, the land has a rugged appearance, but farther inland the country gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſes, and abounds with cultivated encloſures and groves of cocoa trees.</p>
                  <p>While Capt. Cook remained here, the iſlanders behaved with the greateſt friendſhip, and ſeemed very much diſpoſed to render him every aſſiſtance in their power. Several of their chiefs paid him a viſit, and when he himſelf went on ſhore, he was received with very extraordinary ceremonies, which fell little ſhort of adoration. He had likewiſe an interview with <hi>Terreeoboo,</hi> the king of the iſland, whom he carried on board the Reſolution, where he was treated with every mark of reſpect, and in return for a beautiful feathered cloak which he had beſtowed on our navigator, the Captain put a linen ſhirt on his Majeſty, and girt his own hanger round him. In ſhort, during the intercourſe which was kept up between the natives and the Engliſh, the greateſt harmony prevailed, and the quiet, inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive behavior of the former baniſhed every appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger from the breaſts of our voyagers. The iſlanders, however, began at length to be very inquiſitive about the time of their departure; but this is not much to be wondered at, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that during ſixteen days, which they had been in the harbour of <hi>Karakakooa,</hi> they had made an enormous conſumption both of hogs and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables. It afterwards appeared, that theſe enquiries were made with no other view than that they might provide a ſufficient quantity of proviſions for them when they quitted the iſland; for it was obſerved,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030274_1265_0FE5782076797AF8"/>
that the King, on being informed that they were about to depart in a few days, made a kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation throughout the villages, requiring the people to bring in their hogs and vegetables, that his Majeſty might preſent them to the <hi>Orono</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Orono</hi> was a title of high honor beſtowed on Captain Cook.</note>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took his leave of the country. A circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which ſeems to prove the affectionate regard which the people of <hi>Owhyhee</hi> had for our voyagers is, that their prince ſtrongly ſolicited Mr. King to remain among them, and waited upon Capt. Cook whoſe ſon he ſuppoſed him to be, with a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that he might be left.</p>
                  <p>On the 4th of February, Captain Cook quitted <hi>Karakakooa Bay,</hi> with an intention of finiſhing the ſurvey of <hi>Owhyhee,</hi> and of proceeding afterwards to the reſt of the iſlands, in queſt of ſome road which might afford better ſhelter to the veſſels; but a gale of wind ariſing, in the courſe of a few days the Reſolution had the misfortune to ſpring the head of her foremaſt, in ſuch a dangerous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it was found neceſſary to return to <hi>Kara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kakooa,</hi> in order to have it repaired. It does not ſufficiently appear from the accounts given of Capt. Cook's death, whether the natives were diſpleaſed or not with this ſecond viſit. Captain King ſays, "That our voyagers, upon coming to anchor, were ſurpriſed to find their reception very different from what it had been on their firſt arrival; but Mr. Samwell, whoſe veracity ſeems unqueſtionable, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that he ſaw nothing which could induce him to believe, that there was any change in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or behavior of the inhabitants. However this may be, it is certain, that ſome acts of theft committed by the iſlanders, and the attempts of the Engliſh to puniſh them, and to recover their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, were the preludes to that unhappy commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which deprived the Britiſh navy of one of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030274_1266_0FE577EACFC10CF0"/>
its brighteſt ornaments, and our illuſtrious navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator of his life.</p>
                  <p>Theſe people it ſeems had a ſtrong propenſity to thieving, and one of them having been detected in carrying of the amourer's tongs from the forge, was puniſhed with a pretty ſevere flogging, and ſent out of the ſhip. This example, however, did not deter another, who, having ſnatched the tongs and chiſſel from the ſame place, jumped overboard with them, and ſwam for the ſhore. The maſter and a midſhipman were inſtantly diſpatched after him in the ſmall cutter, upon which the Indian made for a canoe, where he was taken on board by one of his countrymen, and though ſeveral muſkets were fired at them, they ſoon got out of gun ſhot, and eſcaped. <hi>Pareah,</hi> one of their chiefs, afterwards brought back the ſtolen articles, but on his return, being met by the Reſolution's pinnace, with five men in her, who inſiſted upon having the thief delivered up, or the canoe which had taken him in, a ſcuffle enſued, and the natives began to pelt the Engliſh with ſtones. This commotion was, however, quelled by the interference of <hi>Pareah;</hi> but another circumſtance of the ſame kind ſoon after occured, which widened the breach between them. Some of the iſlanders found means in the night time to take away the Diſcovery's large cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which lay ſwamped at the buoy of one of her anchors, and ſhe was not miſſed till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sunday, February the 14th. When Captain Clerke had informed Captain Cook of this event, he returned on board, with orders for the launch and ſmall cutter to go, under the command of the ſecond lieutenant, and to lie off the eaſt ſide of the Bay, in order to intercept all canoes that might attempt to get out; and if he found it neceſſary, to fire upon them. At the ſame time, the third
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030274_1267_0FE57821FB1C2BF0"/>
lieutenant of the Reſolution, with the launch and ſmall cutter, was ſent out on the ſame ſervice, to the oppoſite ſide of the Bay, and the maſter was diſpatched in the large cutter, in purſuit of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble canoe already under ſail, and making the beſt of her way out of the harbor.</p>
                  <p>As it had been Capt. Cook's uſual cuſtom in all the iſlands of the South Seas, when any thing of conſequence had been ſtolen, to ſecure the perſon of the King, or of ſome of the principal <hi>Erees,</hi> and to detain them as hoſtages, until the property was reſtored, he reſolved to adopt this method on the preſent occaſion. He therefore left the ſhip about ſeven o'clock, attended by the lieutenant of marines, a ſerjeant, a corporal, and ſeven private men, and the pinnace's crew were alſo armed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Mr. Roberts. As they rowed towards the ſhore, Captain Cook ordered the launch to leave her ſtation at the weſt point of the Bay, in order to aſſiſt his own boat, which clearly ſhews that he was not unapprehenſive of meeting with reſiſtance, and that he was deſirous of making ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary preparations for the defence of himſelf and his people. When he landed, the natives flocked round him in great crowds, ſhewed him the uſual marks of reſpect, by proſtrating themſelves before him, and being ignorant of his intention in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhore, frequently aſked him if he wanted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ogs or proviſions. As ſoon as he had found the King, who came out of a houſe without any h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſitation, where he had been aſleep, the Captain took him by the hand, and invited him in a friendly manner to go on board, to which he readily conſented. Thus far matters appeared in a favorable train, but in a little time the iſlanders were obſerved to be buſy in arming themſelves with long ſpears, clubs, and daggers, and in putting on thick mats, which
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030274_1268_0FE5774D08A84B18"/>
they uſed as armor. This hoſtile appearance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and became more alarming on the arrival of two men in a canoe, from the oppoſite ſide of the Bay, with the news of a chief having been killed by one of the Diſcovery's boats. The Captain, who by this time, was ſurrounded by a great crowd, thinking his ſituation rather hazardous, ordered the lieutenant of marines to march his ſmall party to the water ſide, where the boats lay, within a few yards of the ſhore, and the Indians readily made a line for them to paſs, without offering them the leaſt moleſtation. The diſtance they had to go might be about fifty or ſixty yards, and Capt. Cook followed, having hold of the King's hand, who was attended by his wife, two ſons, and ſeveral chiefs, and who accompanied him without reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. When they had reached the pinnace, the younger ſon immediately ſtepped in, expecting his father to follow; but juſt as he arrived at the water ſide, his wife threw her arms round his neck, and with the aſſiſtance of two chiefs, forced him to ſit down by the ſide of a double canoe. Capt. Cook expoſtulated with them on this behavior; but they would not ſuffer the King to proceed, telling him, that he would be put to death if he went on board the ſhip.</p>
                  <p>One of the chiefs having been ſeen lurking near, with a dagger partly concealed, and another of the natives having made an attempt to wrench a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet from the ſerjeant of marines, Capt. Cook ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that as the Indians were becoming more daring and tumultuous, he could not take the King off by force without ſacrificing the lives of many of his people, he therefore reſolved to act only on the defenſive, and to ſecure a ſafe embarkation for his ſmall party, who were now cloſely preſſed by a body of ſeveral thouſand people; one man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030274_1269_0FE578298D180530"/>
to dart his ſpear at Capt. Cook, who was thereupon forced to fire in his own defence; but he miſſed the perſon he aimed at, and happened to kill another cloſe to him, who was equally forward in the tumult. The ſerjeant obſerving to him that he had miſſed the man he aimed at, received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to fire at him, which he immediately did, and killed him. The impetuoſity of the iſlanders was by this time ſomewhat repreſſed, they fell back ſeemingly in confuſion, but being puſhed on by thoſe behind, returned to the charge, and poured a volley of ſtones among the marines, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting for orders, returned it with a general diſcharge of muſquetry, which was inſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a fire from the boats.</p>
                  <p>At this Captain Cook was heard to expreſs his aſtoniſhment; he waved his hand to the boats, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them to ceaſe firing, and bade them come nearer in to receive the marines.—What followed after this ſeems to have been a ſcene of confuſion. After the marines had fired, the Indians ruſhed among them, and forced them into the water, where four of them were killed. Their lieutenant was wounded, but fortunately eſcaped, and was taken up by the pinnace. "Captain Cook, who was then the only one remaining on the rock, was obſerved making for the pinnace, holding his left hand againſt the back of his head, to guard it from the ſtones, and carrying his muſquet under the other arm. An Indian who had followed him, but with caution and timidity, at laſt advanced upon him unawares, and with a large club<note n="*" place="bottom">Some have ſaid, that he received the firſt injury from a dagger. The account here given, is that of Mr. Samwell, who publiſhed a relation of this melancholy affair, which ſeems to be written with great preciſion and accuracy.</note> or ſtake, gave him a blow on the back of the head, and then
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030274_1270_0FE577ECFB97E3D0"/>
precipitately retreated. By this ſtroke, Captain Cook ſeemed to be ſtunned, he ſtaggered a few paces, then fell on his hand and one knee, and dropped his muſquet. As he was riſing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could recover his feet, another Indian ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him in the back of the neck with an iron dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He then fell in a bite of water about knee deep, where others crowded upon him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to keep him under; but ſtruggling very ſtrongly with them, he got his head up, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his look towards the pinnace, ſeemed to ſolicit aſſiſtance. Though the boat was not above five or ſix yards from him, yet from the crowded and confuſed ſtate of the crew, it ſeems it was not in their power to ſave him.— The Indians got him under again, but in deeper water; he was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, able to get his head up once more, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt ſpent in the ſtruggle, he naturally turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the rock, and was endeavouring to ſupport himſelf by it, when a ſavage gave him a blow with a club, and he was ſeen alive no more.—They hauled him lifeleſs upon the rocks, where they ſeemed to take a ſavage pleaſure in uſing every barbarity to his dead body, ſnatching the daggers out of each others hands, to have the horrid ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of piercing the fallen victim of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous rage."</p>
                  <p>Thus periſhed, in the fifty-firſt year of his age, this truly eminent and valuable man, equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for his ſkill as a navigator, and for the heroic conſtancy and firmneſs of his mind. In whatever point of view we conſider his character, we ſhall find juſt ſubject for admiration. Cool and deliberate in judging, ſagacious in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, active in executing, and perſevering in his enterprizes, he ſupported labors, overcame diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and encountered dangers, which ſeldom
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030274_1271_0FE57756EEC43AA0"/>
fall to the lot of one man. Though rigid in diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, he was mild, juſt and humane; and his people, to whom he was a father, were obedient to him, rather from motives of affection than fear. —His conſtitution was ſtrong, and his mode of living temperate. He was modeſt, and rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in company; but among thoſe with whom he was acquainted, he was found to be a lively, ſenſible and intelligent companion. His perſon was about ſix feet high, and though a good look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, he was plain both in addreſs and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. His head was ſmall; his hair, which was dark brown, he wore tied behind. His face was full of expreſſion, his noſe exceedingly well ſhaped, his eyes, which were ſmall, and of a brown caſt, were quick and piercing, and his eyebrows were prominent, which gave his countenance altogether an air of auſterity.</p>

Behm, who had accompanied them to our ſhips; we ſhall now recount the tranſactions which paſſed at Petropaulowſka during their abſence.</p>
                     <p>On the 7th of May, not long after they had quitted the bay of Awatſka, a great piece of ice drove againſt the Reſolution, and brought home the ſmall bower anchor; in conſequence of which the other anchor was weighed, and the ſhip was moored again. The carpenters, who were occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſtopping the leak, were under the neceſſity of taking off great part of the ſheathing from the bows; and many of the trunnels were found to be ſo looſe and rotten, that they were drawn out eaſily with the fingers. On Tueſday the 11th, heavy gales blew from the north-eaſt, which obliged both our veſſels to ſtrike their yards and top-maſts; but the weather becoming more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in the afternoon and the ice having drifted away as far as the mouth of the harbour of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropaulowſka, we warped cloſe to the ſhore for the greater convenience of procuring wood and water, and again moored, as before; the mouth of the bay ſhut in by the moſt ſoutherly point of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowina harbour, bearing ſouth, and the town north half weſt, at the diſtance of half a mile.</p>
                     <p>On the 12th, a party was detached on ſhore to cut wood, but made little progreſs in that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, on account of the ſnow, which ſtill covered the ground. A convenient ſpot, abreaſt of the ſhips, was cleared, where there was a good run
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:030274_1291_0FE5786D1F992068"/>
of water; and a tent being pitched for the cooper, our empty caſks were landed, and the ſail-makers ſent aſhore.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 15th, as the beach was then clear of ice, a party was ſent to haul the ſeine, and caught a plentiful ſupply of fine flat fiſh for the companies of both ſhips. From this time, indeed, till we quitted the harbour, we were even overpowered with the great quantities of fiſh which came in from every quarter. The <hi>Toions,</hi> both of this town, and of Paratounca, a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring village, had received orders from Major Bemh to employ, in our ſervice, all the Kamtſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales; ſo that it frequently happened, that we could not take into the ſhips the preſents which were ſent us. They generally conſiſted of herrings, trout, flat fiſh, and cod. The former, which were in their higheſt perfection, and of a delicious fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, were in extreme plenty in this bay. The people of the Diſcovery, at one time ſurrounded ſuch an amazing quantity in their ſeine, that they were obliged to throw over a very conſiderable number, leſt the net ſhould be broken to pieces; and the cargo they landed was ſtill ſo abundant, that, beſides having a ſufficient ſtock for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate uſe, they filled as many caſks as they could conveniently ſpare for ſalting; and, after ſending on board the Reſolution a tolerable quantity for the ſame purpoſe, they left behind ſeveral buſhels upon the beach.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:030274_1292_0FE578576232E9D0"/>The ice and ſnow now began rapidly to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and plenty of nettle-tops, celery, and wild garlick were gathered for the uſe of the crews; which being boiled with portable ſoup and wheat, furniſhed them with an excellent and ſalutary breakfaſt; and with this they were every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupplied. The birch-trees were alſo tapped, and the ſweet juice, of which they produced great quantities, was conſtantly mixed with the brandy allowed to the men.</p>
                     <p>On the 16th, a ſmall bullock was killed, which the ſerjeant had procured for the ſhip's compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Its weight was two hundred and ſeventy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>two pounds. It was ſerved out to both the crews for their Sunday's dinner, and was the firſt freſh beef which they had taſted ſince the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our veſſels from the Cape of Good Hope in December 1776; a period of almoſt two years and a half.</p>
                     <p>John Macintoſh, the carpenter's mate, expired this evening, after having been afflicted with a dyſentery ever ſince we had left the Sandwich Iſles. He was a peaceable and induſtrious man, and greatly regretted by his meſs-mates. Though he was the fourth perſon that we had loſt by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs during our voyage, he was the firſt who, from his age and conſtitution, could be ſaid to have had, on our ſetting out, an equal chance of life with the reſt of his companions. Watman was ſuppoſed by us to be about ſixty years old;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030274_1293_0FE5782CD352ABA8"/>
and Roberts, and Mr. Anderſon from the decline which had manifeſtly commenced before our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from England, moſt probably could not, under any circumſtances, have lived to a later pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod than they did.</p>
                     <p>Captain Clerke's health continued daily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, notwithſtanding the ſalutary change of diet which Kamtſchatka afforded him, the prieſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratounca, as ſoon as he was informed of the weak ſtate he was in, ſupplied him every day with milk, bread, fowls, and freſh butter, though his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was ſixteen miles from the harbour where our ſhips were ſtationed.</p>
                     <p>The Ruſſian hoſpital, near the town of St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and St. Paul, was, at our firſt arrival, in a very deplorable ſtate. All the ſoldiers were in a greater or leſſer degree, afflicted with the ſcurvy, many being in the laſt ſtage of that diſorder. The reſt of the Ruſſian inhabitants were likewiſe in a ſimilar condition; and we obſerved, that our friend the ſerjeant, by drinking too freely of the ſpirits he had received from us, had brought on himſelf, in the courſe of a few days, ſeveral of the moſt alarming ſymptoms of that diſeaſe. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke, deſirous of relieving them from this lamentable ſtate, put them all under the care of our ſurgeons, and gave orders, that a ſupply of ſour krout, and malt, for wort, ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their uſe. A ſurpriſing alteration ſoon took place in the figures of moſt of them; and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030274_1294_0FE5783FC10E8200"/>
their ſpeedy recovery was chiefly attributed to the effects of the ſweet wort.</p>
                     <p>On Tuesday the firſt of June, two hundred and fifty poods or nine thouſand pounds weight of rye flour, were brought on board the Reſolution; and the Diſcovery received a proportional quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. We were ſupplied with this flour from the ſtores of Petropaulowſka. The men were now put on their full allowance of bread, which, from the time of our leaving the Cape of Good Hope, they had not been indulged in. The ſame day, we completed our ſtock of water, ſixty-five tons having been conveyed on board.</p>
                     <p>We had freſh breezes, and heavy rains, on the 4th of June, ſo that we were diſappointed in our deſign of dreſſing the ſhips, and obliged to content ourſelves with firing one and twenty guns, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Majeſty's birth-day, and celebrating it, in other reſpects, in the beſt manner we could. Port, who on account of his ſkill in languages, was left with us, partook, as well as the ſerjeants (in the capacity of commandant of the place) of the entertainment of the day. The worthy prieſt of Paratounca, having been informed that it was the anniverſary of our ſovereign's birth-day, gave likewiſe a ſumptuous feaſt, at which ſeveral of our gentlemen were preſent, who were highly pleaſed with their entertainment, of which dancing formed a part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030274_1295_0FE57849E6375728"/>On Sunday the 6th, twenty head of cattle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, having been ſent us, by the directions of the commander, from the Verchni <hi>oſtrog,</hi> which ſtands on the river Kamtſchatka, at the diſtance of almoſt a hundred miles from this place. Theſe cattle were of a moderate ſize; and though the Kamtſchadales had been ſeventeen days in driving them down to the harbour, were in good condition when they arrived. The four ſucceeding days were employed in making preparations for putting to ſea; and on Friday the 11th, about two o'clock in the morning, we began to unmoor. Before, however, we had got up one anchor, ſo violent a gale ſprung up from the north-eaſt, that we thought proper to moor again, ſuppoſing, from the poſition of the entrance of the bay, that the current of wind would, in all probability, ſet up the channel. The pinnace was diſpatched to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the paſſage, and returned with intelligence, that the wind blew violently from the ſouth-eaſt, with a great ſwell, ſetting into the bay; ſo that any attempt to get out to ſea would have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with conſiderable riſque.</p>
                     <p>Port now took his leave of us, carrying with him the box containing the journals of our voyage, which Major Behm was to take charge of, and the packet that was to be forwarded by expreſs. On the 12th, the gale having abated, we began unmooring again; but, after having broken the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030274_1296_0FE548E599C0BE30"/>
meſſenger, and reeved a running purchaſe with a ſix inch hawſer, which likewiſe broke three times, we were, at laſt, under the neceſſity of heaving a ſtrain at low water, and waiting for the flowing of the tide to raiſe the anchor. This meaſure ſucceeded, though not without damaging the cable. About three o'clock in the afternoon, the beſt bower was weighed, and we ſet ſail; but, at eight, the tide making againſt us, and the wind being inconſiderable, we anchored again in ten fathoms water, off the mouth of Rako<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wina harbour: the <hi>oſtrog</hi> being at the diſtance of between two and three miles, bearing north by eaſt half eaſt; the elevated rock, on the weſtern ſide of the paſſage, bearing ſouth; and the needle rocks, on the eaſtern ſide of the paſſage, ſouth-ſouth-eaſt half eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, at four o'clock, we got under way with the tide of ebb; and, as there was a perfect calm, the boats were diſpatched a-head for the purpoſe of towing the ſhips. About ten, a ſouth-eaſterly wind ſpringing up, and the tide having turned, we were obliged to let go our anchors again, in ſeven fathoms; the <hi>oſtrog</hi> bearing north half eaſt, at the diſtance of a mile from the land that was neareſt to us; and the three needle rocks being in the direction of ſouth half eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore and Lieutenant King landed in the afternoon on the eaſt ſide of the paſſage.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030274_1297_0FE5784212DDAE70"/>
where they obſerved, in two different places, the remains of ſpacious villages; and, on the ſide of a hill, they ſaw an old ruined parapet, with four or five embraſures. It had guns mounted on it in Beering's time, as that navigator himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us; and commanded the paſſage up the mouth of the bay. Not far from this ſpot, were the ruins of ſome ſubterraneous caverns, which our two gentlemen conjectured to have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines.</p>
                     <p>We weighed anchor, with the ebb tide, about ſix o'clock in the afternoon, and turned to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but, two hours after, a thick fog coming on, we were under the neceſſity of bringing to, our ſoundings not affording us a ſufficient direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſteering between ſeveral ſunken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ocks, ſituated on each ſide of the paſſage we were to make. The next morning (Monday the 14th) the fog in ſome degree diſperſing, we weighed as ſoon as the tide began to ebb; and, there being little wind, the boats were ſent a-head to tow; but, about ten o'clock, both the wind and tide ſet in ſo ſtrong from the ſea, that we were once more obliged to caſt anchor, in thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen fathoms water, the high rock being at the diſtance of ſix furlongs, in the direction of weſt one quarter ſouth. We continued, during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the day, in this ſituation, the wind blowing freſh into the mouth of the bay. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030274_1298_0FE57858E5181030"/>
the evening, the weather was extremely dark and cloudy with an unſettled wind.</p>
                     <p>We were ſurprized, before day-light, on the 15th, with a rumbling noiſe, that reſembled diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant thunder; and, when the day appeared, we found that the ſides and decks of our ſhips were covered, near an inch thick, with a fine duſt like emery. The air was at the ſame time loaded and obſcured with this ſubſtance; and, towards the volcano mountain, which ſtands to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the harbour, it was exceeding thick and black, inſomuch that we were unable to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the body of the hill. About twelve o'clock, and during the afternoon, the loudneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions increaſed; and they were ſucceeded by ſhowers of cinders, which in general were of the ſize of peas, though many of thoſe that were picked up from the deck were larger than a hazel nut. Several ſmall ſtones, which had undergone no alteration from the action of the fire, fell with the cinders. In the evening we had dreadful claps of thunder and vivid flaſhes of lightning, which, with the darkneſs of the ſky, and the ſulphureous ſmell of the air, produced a very awful and tremendous effect. Our diſtance from the foot of the mountain was, at this time, about eight leagues.</p>
                     <p>At day-break on the 16th, we got up our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, and ſtood out of the bay; but the wind falling, and the tide of ebb ſetting acroſs the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030274_1299_0FE57863CD64D158"/>
on the eaſtern ſhore, we were driven very near the three needle rocks, ſituated on that ſide of the entrance, and were under the neceſſity of hoiſting out the boats, for the purpoſe of towing the ſhips clear of them. At twelve o'clock, we were at the diſtance of ſix miles from the land; and our depth of water was forty three fathoms, over a bottom of ſmall ſtones, of the ſame kind with thoſe which had fallen upon our decks, after the late eruption of the volcano.</p>
                     <p>The country had now a very different appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from what it had on our firſt arrival. The ſnow, except what remained on the ſummits of ſome very lofty mountains, had vaniſhed; and the ſides of the hills, which abounded with wood in many parts, were covered with a beautiful verdure.</p>
                     <p>It being the intention of Captain Clerke to keep in ſight of the coaſt of Kamtſchatka, as much as the weather would allow, in order to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain its poſition, we continued to ſteer towards the north-north-eaſt, with variable light winds, till the 18th. The volcano was ſtill obſerved to throw up immenſe volumes of ſmoke; and we did not ſtrike ground with one hundred and fifty fathoms of line, at the diſtance of twelve miles from the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>The wind blew freſh from the ſouth on the 18th and the weather became ſo thick and hazy, that it was imprudent to make any further attempts at
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030274_1300_0FE5785ACA0619E0"/>
preſent to keep in ſight of the land. However, that we might be ready, whenever the fog ſhould clear up, to aſſume our ſurvey, we ran on in the direction of the coaſt, (as repreſented in the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian charts) and fired ſignal guns for the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to proceed on the ſame courſe. At eleven o'clock, juſt before we loſt ſight of land, Chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poonſkoi Noſs, ſo denominated by the Ruſſians, was at the diſtance of ſeven or eight leagues, bearing north-north-eaſt.</p>
                     <p>At three o'clock in the morning of the 20th, the weather becoming clearer, we ſtood in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the land, and, in the ſpace of an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, ſaw it a-head, extending from north-weſt to north-north-eaſt, at the diſtance of about five leagues. The northern part we conjectured to be Kronotſkoi Noſs; its poſition in the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian charts, nearly agreeing with our reckoning in reſpect to its latitude, which was 54° 42′ north; though, in point of longitude, we differed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably from them; for they place it 1° 48′ eaſt of Awatſka; whereas our computation makes it 3° 34′ eaſt of that place, or 162° 17′ eaſt of Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich. The land about this cape is very elevated, and the inland mountains were at this time cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſnow. There is no appearance of inlets or bays in the coaſt; and the ſhore breaks off in ſteep cliffs.</p>
                     <p>We had not long been gratified with this view of the land, when the wind freſhened from the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030274_1301_0FE5784E6F1E83E8"/>
ſouth-weſt, bringing on a thick fog, which obliged us to ſtand off in the direction of north-eaſt by eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The fog diſperſing about noon, we again ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the land, expecting to fall in with Kam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatſkoi Noſs, and gained a ſight of it at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break on the 21ſt. The ſouth-weſt wind being ſoon after ſucceeded by a light breeze that blew off the land, we were prevented from approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the coaſt ſufficiently near to determine its direction, or deſcribe its aſpect. At twelve o'clock, our longitude was 163° 50′, and our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 55° 52′; the extremes of the land bore north-weſt by weſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ¾ weſt, and north by weſt ¾ weſt; and the neareſt part was at the diſtance of about twenty-four miles.</p>
                     <p>At nine in the evening, when we had approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about ſix miles nearer the coaſt, it appeared to form a projecting peninſula, and to extend eleven or twelve leagues in the direction nearly of north and ſouth. It is level, and of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate elevation; the ſouthern extreme terminates in a low ſloping point; that to the northward forms a ſteep bluff head; and between them, ten or twelve miles to the ſouth of the northern cape, there is a conſiderable break in the land. On both ſides of this break, the land is low. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable hill, reſembling a ſaddle, riſes beyond the opening; and a chain of lofty mountains capped with ſnow, extends along the back of the whole peninſula.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:030274_1302_0FE5789D01323A88"/>The coaſt running in an even direction, we were uncertain with reſpect to the poſition of Kamtſchatſkoi Noſs, which, according to Mr. Muller, forms a projecting point towards the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the peninſula; but we afterwards found, that, in a late Ruſſian map, that appellation is given to the ſouthern cape. The latitude of this from ſeveral accurate obſervations, was 56° 3′; and its longitude, 163° 20′. To the ſouth of this peninſula, the greater river Kamtſchatſka runs into the ſea.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon being too far advanced for us to make an accurate ſurvey of the coaſt of Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka, it was the deſign of Captain Clerke, in our courſe to Beering's Straights, to aſcertain chiefly the reſpective ſituations of the projecting points of the coaſt. We therefore ſteered acroſs a ſpacious bay, laid down between Kamtſchat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkoi Noſs and Olutorſkoi Noſs, with a view of making the latter; which is repreſented by the Ruſſian geographers, as terminating the peninſula of Kamtſchatka, and as being the ſouthern limit of the country of the Koriacs.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 22d, we paſſed a dead whale, which emitted a moſt horrible ſmell, perceivable at the diſtance of three or four miles. It was covered with a very conſiderable number of gulls, petrels, and other oceanic birds, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galing themſelves upon it. On the 24th, the wind, which had ſhifted about during the three
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030274_1303_0FE5785582012730"/>
preceding days, ſettled at ſouth-weſt, bringing on clear weather, with which we proceeded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north-eaſt by north, acroſs the bay, having no land in ſight. In the courſe of this day we obſerved a great number of gulls, and were diſguſted with the indelicate manner of feeding of the arctic gull, which has procured it the appellation of the paraſite. This bird, which is rather larger than the common gull, purſues the latter ſpecies whenever it meets them; the gull after flying about for ſome time, with loud ſcreams and manifeſt indications of extreme terror, drops its excrement, which its purſuer inſtantly darts at, and catches in its beak before it falls into the ſea.</p>
                     <p>At one o'clock in the afternoon of the 25th, when we were in the latitude of 59° 12′, and in the longitude of 168° 35′, a very thick fog came on, about the time we expected to obtain a view of Olutorſkoi Noſs, which (if Muller's poſition of it, in the latitude 59° 30′, and in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of 167° 36′, is right) could then have been only a dozen leagues from us; at which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we might eaſily have diſcerned land of a moderate height. Our depth of water, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, was ſo great, that we had no ground with a hundred and ſixty fathoms of line.</p>
                     <p>The fog ſtill continuing, prevented us from making a nearer approach to the land, and we ſteered eaſt by north at five o'clock, which is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more eaſterly than the Ruſſian charts repreſent
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030274_1304_0FE57860C0578258"/>
the trending of the coaſt from Olutorſkoi Noſs. The next day, a freſh gale blew from the ſouth-weſt, which laſted till noon on the 27th, when the weather clearing up, we ſteered to the north, with an intention of making the land. Our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, at this time, was 59° 49′, and our longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 175° 43′. Though we ſaw ſome ſhags in the morning, which are imagined never to fly far from land, yet there was no appearance of it during the whole day. However, the next morning, about ſix o'clock, we had ſight of it towards the north-weſt. The coaſt appeared in hills of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate elevation; but, inland, others were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved conſiderably higher. The ſnow lying in patches, and no wood being perceived, the land had a very barren aſpect.</p>
                     <p>At nine o'clock, we were ten or eleven miles from the ſhore, the ſouthern extreme bearing weſt by ſouth, about ſix leagues diſtant, beyond which the coaſt ſeemed to incline to the weſt. This point being in the longitude of 174° 48′, and in the latitude 61° 48′, is ſituated, according to the Ruſſian charts, near the mouth of the river Opuka. The northern extremity, at the ſame time bore north by weſt; between which, and a hill bearing north-weſt by weſt weſt, the coaſt appeared to bend towards the weſt, and form a deep bay.</p>
                     <p>At the diſtance of about eight miles from the land, we obſerved a ſtrong rippling; and being
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030274_1305_0FE5785056FF5440"/>
under apprehenſions of meeting with foul ground, we made ſail to the north-eaſt, along the coaſt. On heaving the lead, we found the depth of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be twenty-four fathoms, over a bottom of gravel. We therefore concluded, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance above-mentioned, was occaſioned by a tide, then running to the ſouthward. At noon, the extremes of the land bearing weſt-ſouth-weſt and north-north-eaſt, we were abreaſt of the low land, which, we now obſerved, joined the two points, where we had before expected to diſcover a deep bay. The coaſt bends a little towards the weſt, and has a ſmall inlet, which is, perhaps, the mouth of ſome inconſiderable river. Our longitude was now 175° 43′, and our latitude 61° 36′.</p>
                     <p>During the afternoon, we continued our courſe along the coaſt, at the diſtance of four or five leagues, with a breeze from the weſt, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſoundings from twenty-eight to thirty-ſix fathoms. The coaſt exhibited an appearance of ſterility, and the hills roſe to a conſiderable ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation inland, but the clouds on their tops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented us from determining their height. About eight o'clock in the evening, ſome of our people thought they ſaw land to the eaſt by north; upon which we ſtood to the ſouthward of eaſt; but it proved to be nothing more than a fog bank. At midnight, the extreme point bearing north-eaſt eaſt, we conjectured that it was St. Thadeus's
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030274_1306_0FE5786EA578F8C8"/>
Noſs; to the ſouth of which the land inclines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the weſt, forming a deep bight, wherein the river Katirka, according to the charts publiſhed by the Ruſſians, is ſituate.</p>
                     <p>The weather, on the 29th, was unſettled, with the wind at the north-eaſt point. The next day, at twelve o'clock, our longitude was 180°, and our latitude 61° 48′. At this time, St. Thadeus's Noſs bore north-north-weſt, at the diſtance of twenty-three leagues; and beyond it we perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the coaſt extending almoſt directly north. The eaſternmoſt point of the Noſs is in the latitude 62° 50′, and in the longitude of 179°. The land about it, from its being diſcerned at ſo great a diſtance, may juſtly be ſuppoſed to be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable height. During this and the preceding day, we ſaw numbers of ſea-horſes, whales, and ſeals; alſo albatroſſes, gulls, ſea-parrots, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemots, &amp;c. Taking the advantage of a little calm weather, ſeveral of our people employed themſelves in fiſhing, and caught plenty of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent cod. Our ſoundings were from ſixty-five to ſeventy-five fathoms.</p>
                     <p>At noon, on Thurſday the firſt of July, Mr. Bligh, Maſter of the Reſolution, having moored a ſmall keg with the deep ſea lead, in ſeventy-five fathoms water, found that the ſhip made a courſe to the north by eaſt, about half a mile in an hour: this was attributed by him to the effect of a ſoutherly ſwell, rather than to that of any
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030274_1307_0FE5787066459F68"/>
current. The wind, towards the evening, freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening from the ſouth-eaſt, we ſteered to north-eaſt by eaſt, for the point that Beering calls Tſchukotſkoi Noſs, which we had obſerved on the 4th of September the preceding year, at the ſame time that we perceived, towards the ſouth-eaſt, the Iſle of St. Lawrence. This cape, and St. Thadeus's Noſs, from the north-eaſtern and ſouth-weſtern extremes of the extenſive Gulph of Anadir, into the bottom of which the river of that name diſcharges itſelf, ſeparating, as it paſſes, the country of the Tſchutſki from that of the Koriacs.</p>
                     <p>On the 3d of July, at twelve o'clock, our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was 63° 33′, and our longitude 186° 45′. Between twelve and one, we deſcried the Tſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kotſkoi Noſs, bearing north half weſt, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of thirteen or fourteen leagues. At five in the afternoon, we ſaw the iſland of St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in the direction of eaſt three-quarters north; and alſo another iſland, which we imagined was between St. Lawrence and Anderſon's Iſland, about eighteen miles eaſt-ſouth-eaſt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. As we had no certain knowledge of this iſland, Captain Clerke was inclined to have a nearer view of it, and immediately hauled the wind towards it: but it unfortunately happened, that we were unable to weather the Iſle of St. Lawrence, and were therefore obliged to bear up again, and paſs them all to the leeward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="unknown:030274_1308_0FE5787A5DA733A8"/>The latitude of the Iſland of St. Lawrence, according to the moſt accurate obſervations, is 63° 47′; and its longitude is 188° 15′. This iſland, if its boundaries were at preſent within our view, is about three leagues in circumference. The northern part of it may be diſcerned at the diſtance of ten or a dozen leagues. As it has ſome low land to the ſouth-eaſt, the extent of which we could not perceive, ſome of us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that it might perhaps be joined to the land to the eaſtward of it: we were, however, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the hazineſs of the weather, from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining this circumſtance. Theſe iſlands, as well as the land adjoining to the Tſchukotſkoi Noſs, were covered with ſnow, and preſented a moſt diſmal aſpect. About midnight, the Iſle of St. Lawrence was five or ſix miles diſtant, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouth-ſouth-eaſt; and our ſoundings were eighteen fathoms. We were accompanied with ſea fowl of various ſorts, and obſerved ſome guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemots and ſmall creſted hawks.</p>
                     <p>As the weather continued to thicken, we loſt ſight of land till Monday the 5th, when we had a view of it both to the north-eaſt and north-weſt. Our longitude, at this time, was 189° 14′, and our latitude 65° 24′. As the iſlands of St. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede, which are ſituated in Beering's Straight, between the two continents of Aſia and America, were determined by us the preceeding year to be in the latitude of 95° 48′, we were at a loſs how
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030274_1309_0FE578BE48A45378"/>
to reconcile the land towards the north-eaſt, with the poſition of thoſe iſlands. We therefore ſtood for the land till three o'clock in the afternoon, when we were within the diſtance of four miles from it, and diſcovering it to be two iſlands, were pretty well convinced of their being the ſame; but the hazineſs of the weather ſtill continuing, we, in order to be certain, with reſpect to our ſituation, ſtood over to the Aſiatic coaſt, till about ſeven o'clock in the evening; at which time we had approached within two or three leagues of the eaſtern cape of that continent.</p>
                     <p>This cape is an elevated round head of land, and extends about five miles from north to ſouth. It forms a peninſula, which is connected with the continent by a narrow iſthmus of low land. It has a bold ſhore; and three lofty, detached, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rocks, are ſeen off its north part. It was at preſent covered with ſnow, and the beach encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with ice. We were now convinced of our having been under the influence of a ſtrong cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſetting to the northward, which had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned an error of twenty miles in our computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the latitude at noon. At the time of our paſſing this Straight the laſt year, we had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a ſimilar effect.</p>
                     <p>Being now certain with regard to our poſition, we ſteered north by eaſt. At ten o'clock in the evening, the weather clearing up, we ſaw, at the ſame inſtant, the remarkable peaked hill near
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030274_1310_0FE57865D9F5ACF8"/>
Cape Prince of Wales, on the North American coaſt, and the Eaſt Cape of Aſia, with the two iſlands of St. Diomede between them.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of this day, we ſaw ſeveral large white gulls, and great numbers of very ſmall birds of the hawk kind. The beak of the latter was compreſſed, and large in proportion to the body of the bird; the colour was dark brown, or rather black, the breaſt whitiſh, and towards the abdomen a reddiſh brown hue was viſible.</p>
                     <p>On the 6th, at twelve o'clock, our latitude was 67°, and our longitude 191° 6′. Having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed many large maſſes of ice, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that it adhered, in ſeveral places, to the ſhore of the Aſiatic continent, we were not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed when we fell in, about three o'clock, with an extenſive body of it, ſtretching towards the weſt. This appearance conſiderably diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged our hopes of proceeding much further to the north this year, than we had done the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding. There being little wind in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, the boats were hoiſted out in purſuit of the ſea-horſes, great numbers of which were ſeen on the detached pieces of ice; but they returned without ſucceſs: theſe animals being extremely ſhy, and, before our people could come within gun-ſhot of them, always retreated into the water.</p>
                     <p>Having hoiſted in the boats at ſeven o'clock in the evening, we ſtood on to the north-eaſt-ward,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030274_1311_0FE578B39B811788"/>
with a freſh ſoutherly breeze, intending to explore the American continent, between the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of 68° and 69°, which, on account of the foggy weather, we had not an opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the laſt year. In this attempt we were partly diſappointed again: for, on the 7th, about ſix o'clock in the morning, we were ſtopped by a large body of ice, ſtretching from north-weſt to ſouth-eaſt; but, not long afterwards, the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon becoming clear, we had a view of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can coaſt, at the diſtance of about ten leagues, extending from north-eaſt by eaſt to eaſt, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between 68° and 68° 20′ of northern latitude. The ice not being high, we were enabled by the clearneſs of the weather to ſee over a great extent of it. The whole exhibited a compact ſolid ſurface, not in the leaſt thawed; and ſeemed alſo to adhere to the land.</p>
                     <p>The weather becoming hazy ſoon after, we loſt ſight of the land; and it being impoſſible to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer to it, we ſteered to the north-north-weſt, keeping the ice cloſe on board; and having, by noon, got round its weſtern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, we found that it trended nearly north. Our longitude, at this time, was 192° 34′, and our latitude 68° 22′. We proceeded along the edge of the ice, to the north-north-eaſt, during the remainder of the day, paſſing through many looſe pieces which had been ſeparated from the main body, and againſt which our veſſels were
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030274_1312_0FE578D65E3AB948"/>
driven with great violence, notwithſtanding our utmoſt caution. About eight in the evening, we paſſed ſome drift-wood: at midnight the wind veered to the north-weſt; and there were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhowers of ſnow and ſleet. The thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter had now fallen from 38° to 31°.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, at five o'clock, the wind ſhifting more to the northward, we could conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue no longer on the ſame tack, by reaſon of the ice, but were under the neceſſity of ſtanding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the weſt. Our depth of water, at this time was nineteen fathoms; from which, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with our remarks on the ſoundings in the preceding year, we inferred, that our preſent diſtance from the coaſt of America did not exceed ſix or ſeven leagues; but our view was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within a much narrower compaſs, by a heavy fall of ſnow. Our latitude, at twelve o'clock, was 69° 21′, and our longitude 192° 42′.</p>
                     <p>At two in the afternoon, the weather became clearer, and we ſound ourſelves cloſe to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe of ice, which from the maſt-head, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to conſiſt of very large compact bodies, united towards the exterior edge, but, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts, ſome pieces were obſerved floating in vacant ſpaces of the water: it extended from weſt-ſouth-weſt to north-eaſt by north. We bore away towards the ſouth, along the edge of it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to get into clearer water; for the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030274_1313_0FE57843F6DF7088"/>
ſtrong northerly winds had drifted down ſuch numbers of looſe pieces, that we had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with them for ſome time, and were unable to prevent the ſhips from ſtriking againſt ſeveral of them.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 9th, a freſh gale blew from the north-north-weſt, accompanied with violent ſhowers of ſnow and ſleet. The thermometer, at noon, was at 30°. We ſteered weſt-ſouth-weſt, and kept as near the main body of ice as we could; but had the misfortune to damage the cut-water againſt the drift pieces, and rub off ſome of the ſheathing from the bows. The ſhocks, indeed, which our ſhips received, were frequently very ſevere, and were attended with conſiderable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. Our latitude, at noon, was 69° 12′, and our longitude 188° 5′.</p>
                     <p>Having now ſailed almoſt forty leagues to the weſt, along the edge of the ice, without perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any opening, or a clear ſea. beyond it towards the north, we had no proſpect of making further progreſs to the northward at preſent. Captain Clerke, therefore, determined to bear away to the ſouth by eaſt, the only quarter which was clear, and to wait till the ſeaſon was ſomewhat more advanced, before he made any further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, to penetrate through the ice. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to employ the intermediate time in ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bay of St. Lawrence, and the coaſt ſituate to the ſouth of it, as it would be a great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030274_1314_0FE5784CE82AE1F8"/>
to have a harbour ſo near, in caſe of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture damage from the quantity of ice, in theſe parts. We were alſo deſirous of paying another viſit to the Tſchutſki; and more particular ſince the acconuts we had heard of them from Major Behm.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of this determination, we made ſail to the ſouthward, till the 10th at noon, when we paſſed conſiderable quantities of drift ice, and a perfect calm enſued. The latitude, at this time, was 68° 1′, and the longitude, 188° 30′. This morning we ſaw ſeveral whales, and in the afternoon, there being great numbers of ſea-horſes on the pieces of ice that ſurrounded us, we hoiſted out the boats, and diſpatched them in purſuit of thoſe animals. Our people had more ſucceſs on this occaſion, than they had on the 6th; for they returned with three large ones, and a young one, beſides having killed or wounded ſome others. They were witneſſes of ſeveral ſtriking inſtances of parental affection in theſe animals. All of them, on the approach of the boats towards the ice, took their young ones un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their fins, and attempted to eſcape with them into the ſea. Some, whoſe cubs were killed or wounded, and left floating upon the ſurface of the water, roſe again, and carried them down, ſometimes juſt as our men were on the point of taking them into the boat; and could be traced bearing them to a conſiderable diſtance through the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030274_1315_0FE5F7865E3F5110"/>
water, which was ſtained with their blood. They were afterwards obſerved bringing them, at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, above the ſurface, as if for air, and again plunging under it, with a horrid bellowing. The female, in particular, whoſe young one had been, killed, and taken into the boat, became ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that ſhe even ſtruck her two tuſks through the bottom of the cutter.</p>
                     <p>About eight o'clock in the evening, an eaſterly breeze ſprung up, with which we continued to ſteer to the ſouthward; and, at midnight, fell in with many extenſive bodies of ice. We attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to puſh through them under an eaſy ſail, that the ſhips might ſuſtain no damage; and when we had proceeded a little further towards the ſouth, nothing was viſible but a very large and compact maſs of ice, extending to the north-eaſt, ſouth-weſt, and ſouth-eaſt, as far as the eye could reach. This formidable obſtacle prevented our viſiting the Tſchutſki; for no ſpace remained open, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept back again to the northward. We therefore tacked, at three o'clock in the morning of the 11th, and ſtood to that quarter. The latitude, at noon, was 67° 49′, and the longitude 188° 47′.</p>
                     <p>On Monday the 12th, we had light winds and hazy weather. On examining the current, we found it ſet towards the north-weſt, at the rate of half a mile an hour. We continued our northerly courſe, with a breeze from the ſouth, and fair weather, till ten o'clock in the morning of the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030274_1316_0FE5788C71D33FC0"/>
13th, when we again found ourſelves cloſe in with a ſolid maſs of ice, to which we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no limits from the maſt-head. This was an effectual diſcouragement to all our hopes of penetrating further; which had been greatly raiſed, by our having now advanced almoſt ten leagues, through a ſpace, which, on the 9th, had been found to be occupied by impenetrable ice. Our ſituation, at this time, was nearly in the middle of the channel, betwixt the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents; our latitude was 69° 37′; and the main body of the ice extended from weſt-ſouth-weſt to eaſt-north-eaſt.</p>
                     <p>As, in that part of the ſea where we now were, there was no probability of getting further to the north, Captain Clerke determined to make a final attempt on the coaſt of America, for Baffin's Bay, ſince we had found it practicable to advance the furthereſt on this ſide, in the preceding year. We accordingly, during the remainder of the day, worked to the windward, with a freſh breeze from the eaſt. We obſerved ſeveral fulmars and arctic gulls, and paſſed two trees, both of which ſeemed to have lain a loner time in the water. The larger one was, in length, ten or eleven feet, and in circumference, about three, without either the bark or branches.</p>
                     <p>We proceeded to the eaſtward on the 14th, with thick foggy weather. The next day, the wind blowing freſh from the weſt, and having,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030274_1317_0FE5789B6A46F7B0"/>
in ſome meaſure, diſperſed the fog, we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſteered to the north, in order to have a nearer view of the ice; and we were ſoon cloſe in with it. It extended from north-north-weſt to north-eaſt, and was ſolid and compact; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts were ragged, and of various heights; the inner ſurface was even: and, as we ſuppoſed, from eight to ten feet above the level of the ſea. The weather becoming moderate during the reſt of the day, we ſhaped our courſe according to the trending of the ice, which, in ſeveral places, formed deep bays.</p>
                     <p>The wind freſhened in the morning of the 16th, and was accompanied with frequent and thick ſhowers of ſnow. At eight o'clock in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, we had a ſtrong gale from the weſt-ſouth-weſt, which brought us under double-reefed top-ſails; when, the weather in ſome degree clearing up, we found ourſelves, as it were, embayed; the ice having ſuddenly taken a turn to the ſouth-eaſtward, and encompaſſing us, in one compact body, on all ſides but the ſouth. In conſequence of this, we hauled our wind to the ſouthward, being, at that time, in twenty-ſix fathoms water, and in the latitude of 70° 8′ north; and, as we imagined, at the diſtance of about five-and-twenty leagues from the American coaſt.</p>
                     <p>At four in the afternoon, the gale increaſing, we got the top-gallant-yards down upon the deck, ſurled the mizen top-ſail, and cloſe-reefed the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030274_1318_0FE578F35FBE4FF0"/>
fore and main-top-ſails. About eight o'clock, finding that our ſoundings had decreaſed to twenty-two fathoms, which we conſidered as an indication of our near approach to the coaſt of America, we tacked and ſteered to the north-ward. In the night we had boiſterous weather, attended with ſnow: but, the next morning, it was clear and moderate; and, at eight o'clock, we got the top-gallant-yards acroſs, and bore away, with the wind ſtill at weſt-ſouth-weſt. Our latitude, at noon, was 69° 55′, and our lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, 194° 30′. The wind ſlackened in the evening, and, about midnight, we had a calm.</p>
                     <p>A light breeze ariſing from the eaſt-north-eaſt, at five in the morning of the 18th, we continued our progreſs towards the north, with a view of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining the ice as ſoon as poſſible. We ſaw numbers of ſea-parrots, and ſmall ice-birds, and alſo many whales; and paſſed ſeveral logs of drift-wood. The latitude, at twelve o'clock, was 70° 26′, and the longitude 194° 54′. Our ſoundings, at the ſame time, were three-and-twenty fathoms; and the ice extended from north to eaſt-north-eaſt, being about one league diſtant.</p>
                     <p>At one o'clock in the afternoon, obſerving, that we were cloſe in with a firm united maſs of ice, ſtretching from eaſt to weſt-north-weſt, we tacked, and, the wind veering to the weſtward, ſtood to the eaſt, along the edge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, till eleven in the evening. A very thick fog then coming
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030274_1319_0FE5789EE2AD3668"/>
on, and the depth of water decreaſing to nineteen fathoms, we hauled our wind to the ſouthward.</p>
                     <p>Though we perceived no ſea-horſes on the body of ice, yet, on the detached fragments of it, they were ſeen in herds, and in greater numbers than we had ever before obſerved. About nine o'clock in the evening, a white bear ſwam cloſe by the Diſcovery; it afterwards went towards the ice, on which were likewiſe two others.</p>
                     <p>The weather clearing up at one in the morning of the 19th, we bore away to the north-eaſt till two o'clock, when we were again ſo completely embayed by the ice, that no opening remained, except to the ſouthward; to which quarter we therefore directed our courſe, and returned through a very ſmooth water, with favourable weather, by the ſame way we had come in. We were unable to penetrate further towards the north than at this time, when our latitude was 70° 33′, which was about five leagues ſhort of the point to which we had advanced the preceding ſummer. We ſtood to the ſouth-ſouth-weſt, with light winds from the north-weſt, near the edge of the main body of ice, which was ſituated on our left hand, extending between us and the American coaſt. At noon, our latitude was 70° 11′, and our lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 196° 15′; and our ſoundings were ſixteen fathoms. We ſuppoſed, from this circumſtance, that the Icy Cape was at the diſtance of only ſeven or eight leagues from us: but, though the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030274_1320_0FE5790F10F2F188"/>
was, in general, pretty clear, there was, at the ſame time, a haſineſs in the horizon ſo that we could not expect to have an opportunity of ſeeing the cape.</p>
                     <p>Two white bears appearing in the water during the afternoon, ſome of our people immediately purſued them in the jolly boat, and were ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to kill them both. The larger one, which was, in all probability, the dam of the younger, being ſhot firſt, the other would not leave it, though it might have eſcaped with eaſe on the ice, while the men were re-loading their muſquets; but continued ſwimming about, till, after having been ſeveral times fired upon, it was ſhot dead. The length of the larger one, from the ſnout to the end of the tail, was ſeven feet two inches; its circumference, near the fore-legs, was four feet ten inches; the height of the ſhoulder was four feet three inches; and the breadth of the ſore-paw was ten inches. The weight of its four quarters was four hundred and thirty ſix pounds. The four quarters of the ſmalleſt weighed two hundred and fifty-ſix pounds.</p>
                     <p>Theſe animals furniſhed us with ſome good meals of freſh meat. Their fleſh, indeed, had a ſtrong fiſhy taſte, but was infinitely ſuperior to that of the ſea-horſe; which, however, our people were again perſuaded, with no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, to prefer to their ſalted proviſions.</p>
                     <p>

The latitude, at noon, was 69° 33′, and the longitude 194° 53′. Our depth of water, at the ſame time, was nineteen fathoms. The land was at the diſtance of eight or ten leagues, extending from ſouth by eaſt to ſouth-ſouth-weſt, half weſt, being the ſame we had ſeen the preceding year; but it was at preſent, much more covered with ſnow than at that time; and the ice ſeemed to adhere to the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>We continued to ſail in the afternoon, through a ſea of looſe ice, and to ſteer towards the land, as near as the wind, which blew from eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, would permit. A thick fog came on at eight o'clock in the evening, and the wind abated. Obſerving a rippling in the water, we tried the current, and found it ſet to the eaſt-north-eaſt, at the rate of a mile in an hour: we therefore reſolved to ſteer before the wind, during the night, in order to ſtem it, and oppoſe the large pieces of looſe ice, which were ſetting us on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A connected ſolid field of ice, thus baffling all our efforts to make a nearer approach to the land and (as we had ſome reaſon to imagine) adhering to it, we relinquiſhed all hopes of a north-eaſt paſſage to Great-Britain.</p>

                     <p>IN conſequence of Captain Clerke's determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to relinquiſh all attempts on the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican coaſt, and to make his final efforts, in ſearch of a paſſage, on the coaſt of the Aſiatic continent, we ſteered weſt-north-weſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during the afternoon of the 21ſt of July, through a great quantity of looſe ice. About ten o'clock in the evening, diſcovering the main body of ice through the fog, right a-head, and very near us, and being
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030274_1324_0FE5790D27C1FE68"/>
unwilling to ſtand to the ſouthward, ſo long as we could poſſibly avoid it; we hauled our wind, which was eaſterly, and made ſail to the north; but in the ſpace of an hour afterwards, finding that the weather became clearer, and that we were ſurrounded by a compact field of ice on all ſides, except to the ſouth-ſouth-weſt, we tacked, and ſteered in that direction, for the purpoſe of getting clear of it. On the 22d at noon, our latitude was 69° 30′, and our longitude 187° 30′. In the afternoon, we again came up with the ice, which extending to the north-weſt, and ſouth-weſt, obliged us to proceed to the ſouthward, in order to weather it.</p>
                     <p>It may not be improper to remark, that, ſince the 8th of July, we had twice traverſed this ſea, in lines almoſt parallel with the run we had juſt now made; that we were unable in the firſt of thoſe traverſes, to penetrate ſo far north, by eight or ten leagues, as in the ſecond; and that in the laſt we had again met with a connected maſs of ice, generally about five leagues to the ſouthward of its poſition in the preceding run. This makes it evident, that the large compact fields of ice, obſerved by us, were moveable, or diminiſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, at the ſame time, it does not authoriſe any expectation of advancing much farther, even in the moſt favourable ſeaſons.</p>
                     <p>About ſeven o'clock in the evening, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being hazy, and no ice viſible, we made ſail
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030274_1325_0FE579195A086DC0"/>
to the weſtward; but, between eight and nine, the haze diſperſing, we found ourſelves in the midſt of looſe ice, and very near the main body, we therefore ſtood upon a wind, which was ſtill eaſterly, and continued to beat to windward during the night, hoping to weather the looſe pieces, which the wind drove down upon us in ſuch quantities, that we were in great danger of being blocked up by them.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, the clear water, in which we ſteered to and fro, did not exceed a mile and a half, and was leſſening every moment. At length, after exerting our moſt ſtrenuous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to clear the looſe ice, we were under the neceſſity of forcing a paſſage to the ſouth, which we accompliſhed between ſeven and eight, though not without ſubjecting the ſhip to ſome very ſevere ſhocks. The Diſcovery was not ſo ſucceſsful, for, about eleven o'clock, when ſhe had almoſt got clear out, ſhe became ſo entangled by ſeveral large pieces, that her progreſs was ſtopped, and ſhe immediately dropped to leeward, and fell broadſide foremoſt, on the edge of a conſiderably body of ice; and there being an open ſea to windward, the ſurf occaſioned her to ſtrike with violence upon it. This maſs, at length, either ſo far broke, or moved, as to give the crew an opportunity of making another effort to eſcape; but it unfortunately happened, that, before the ſhip gathered way enough to be under
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030274_1326_0FE578E0DAAAFEF0"/>
command, ſhe fell to leeward a ſecond time, on another fragment, and the ſwell rendering it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to lie to windward, and finding no proſpect of getting clear, they puſhed into a ſmall opening, furled their ſails, and made the veſſel faſt with ice hooks.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw them in this dangerous ſituation at noon, at the diſtance of about three miles from us, in a north-weſt direction; a freſh gale from the ſouth-eaſt driving more ice towards the north-weſt, and augmenting the body that lay between us. Our latitude at this time was 69° 8′; our longitude 187°; and our ſoundings were twenty-eight fathoms. To add to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which began to force themſelves on our minds, between four and five in the afternoon, the weather becoming thick and hazy, we loſt ſight of the Diſcovery. However, that we might be in a ſituation to afford her every poſſible aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we ſtood on cloſe by the edge of the ice. About ſix o'clock the wind ſhifting to the north, gave us ſome hopes, that the ice might drift away, and releaſe her from her danger; and in that caſe, as it was uncertain in what condition ſhe might come out, we continued, every half hour, to fire a gun, with a view of preventing a ſeparation. Our fears for her ſafety did not ceaſe till nine, when we heard her guns fired in anſwer to ours; and not long afterwards, being hailed by her, we were informed, that, upon the change of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030274_1327_0FE578FC21C2B728"/>
wind, the ice began to ſeparate; and that her people, ſetting all the ſails, forced a paſſage through it. We alſo learned, that while they were ſurrounded by it, they found the ſhip drift with the main body towards the north-eaſt, at the rate of half a mile an hour. We found, that ſhe had rubbed off much of the ſheathing from her bows, and was become very leaky, from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent blows ſhe had received when ſhe fell upon the edge of the ice.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 24th, we had freſh breezes from the ſouth-weſt, with hazy weather, and ſteered to the ſouth-eaſt till eleven o'clock in the forenoon, when our courſe was again obſtructed by a large body of looſe ice, which extended from north-north-eaſt to ſouth-ſouth-eaſt; and to which we could diſcover no end. We therefore kept working to windward, and at twelve o'clock our latitude was 68° 53′, and longitude 188°. About four in the afternoon, it became calm, and the boats were hoiſted out in purſuit of the ſea-horſes, which appeared in prodigious he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> on each ſide of us. Ten of them were killed by our people, which were as many as could be made uſe of by us for eating, or for converting into lamp oil. We kept it on with a ſouth weſterly wind, along the edge of the ice, which extended in a direction nearly eaſt and weſt, till four in the morning of the 25th, when perceiving a clear ſea beyond it, to the ſouth eaſtward, we ſteered that
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030274_1328_0FE578BFCE043DD8"/>
way, with an intention of forcing through it. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d cleared it by ſix, and continued, during the remaining part of the day, to run towards the ſouth-eaſt, with no ice in ſight.</p>
                     <p>At noon, our latitude was 68° 38′, our longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 189° 9′, and our ſoundings thirty fathoms. We tacked at midnight, and ſtood to the weſt, with a freſh ſoutherly gale; and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at ten, the ice again made its appearance, extending from north-weſt to ſouth. It was looſe, and drifted by the force of the wind towards the north. At twelve, our latitude was 68°, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 88° 10′, and our depth of water was twenty-eight fathoms. For the remainder of the day, and till noon on the 27th, we ſtood backwards and forwards, to clear ourſelves of different pieces of ice. The latitude at noon was 67° 47′, and the longitude 181°.</p>
                     <p>At two in the afternoon, we had ſight of the continent to the ſouth by eaſt; and at four, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing run, ſince noon, to the ſouth-weſt, we were encompaſſed by looſe maſſes of ice, with the main body of it in view, ſtretching in the direction of north by weſt, and ſouth by eaſt, as far as the eye could reach, beyond which we deſcried the Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic coaſt, bearing ſouth, and ſouth by eaſt.</p>
                     <p>It being now neceſſary to come to ſome deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination reſpecting the courſe we were next to ſteer, Captain Clerke diſpatched a boat, with the carpenters, on board the Diſcovery, to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030274_1329_0FE578B573C03EC8"/>
into the particulars of the damage ſhe had lately received. They returned, in the evening, with the report of Captain Gore, and of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters of both veſſels, that the damages ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained were ſuch as would require three weeks to repair; and that it would be requiſite, for that purpoſe, to make the beſt of their way to ſome port.</p>
                     <p>Thus, finding our farther progreſs to the north, as well as our nearer approach to either continent, obſtructed by immence bodies of ice, we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it as not only injurious to the ſervice, by endangering the ſafety of the ſhips, but likewiſe fruitleſs with reſpect to the deſign of our voyage to make any farther attempts for the diſcovery of a paſſage. This, therefore, added to Captain Gore's repreſentations, determined Captain Clerke to loſe no more time in what he concluded to be an unattainable object, but to proceed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o the bay of Awatſka, to repair our damages there, and, before the winter ſhould ſet in, to take a ſurvey of the coaſt of Japan.</p>
                     <p>Great was the joy that appeared on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of every individual, as ſoon as Captain Clerke's reſolutions were made known. We were all completely weary of a navigation full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and in which the greateſt perſeverance had not been rewarded with the ſmalleſt proſpect of ſucceſs. We therefore turned our faces towards home, after an abſence of three years, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030274_1330_0FE578AA85983C58"/>
delight and ſatisfaction, notwithſtanding the very long voyage we had ſtill to make.</p>
                     <p>We worked to windward on the 28th, with a freſh breeze from the ſouth-eaſt, being ſtill in ſight of the coaſt of Aſia. At four in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cape Serdze Kamen bore ſouth-ſouth-weſt, at the diſtance of ſix or ſeven leagues. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in different places, upon the ſummits of the hills, which riſe inland on each ſide of this Cape, protuberances of a conſiderable height, which had the appearance of pillows of ſtone, or great rocks.</p>
                     <p>The next day, the wind being ſtill unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we made but ſlow progreſs to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. About midnight, we had foggy weather, attended with a breeze from the north-north-weſt, with which we ſteered to the ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, through the ſtraits, and had no land in our view till ſeven in the evening of the 30th, when the fog diſperſing, we ſaw Cape Prince of Wales, bearing ſouth by eaſt, at the diſtance of about ſix leagues; and the iſland of St. Diornede ſouth-weſt by weſt. We now ſtood to the weſt, and at eight made the Eaſt Cape, which at midnight, was four leagues diſtant, bearing weſt by north.</p>
                     <p>During the night we ſteered to the ſouth-ſouth-weſt, with a freſh breeze from the weſt north-weſt, and on the 31ſt, at four in the morning, the Eaſt Cape bore north-north-eaſt and the north-eaſt part of the Bay of St. Lawrence,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030274_1331_0FE578624721C288"/>
(where our ſhips anchored the preceding year) weſt by ſouth, its diſtance being twelve miles. As we could not have worked up to windward, without a greater conſumption of time, than the object ſeemed to deſerve, we ran acroſs the bay regretting the loſs of this opportunity of paying another viſit to the Tuſchutſki. At twelve o'clock our latitude was 65° 6′, and longitude 189°. The ſouth point of the bay of St. Lawrence was ſeven or eight leagues diſtant, bearing north by weſt one quarter weſt.</p>
                     <p>Having now paſſed Beering's Straits, and finally quitted the north-eaſt coaſt of Aſia, it may not, perhaps, be improper, on this occaſion, to ſtate our reaſons for adopting two general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions relative to its extent, in oppoſition to the ſentiments of Mr. Muller. The firſt is, that the promontory called Eaſt Cape is actually the moſt eaſterly point of that quarter of the globe; or, in other words, that no part of that continent extends in longitude beyond 190° 22′ eaſt. The ſecond is, that the latitude of the north eaſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extreme is ſomewhat to the ſouthward of 70° north. With regard to the former, if ſuch land really exiſts, it muſt certainly be to the north of the 69th degree of latitude, where the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries made in our preſent voyage terminate. We ſhall therefore, in the firſt place, endeavour to inveſtigate the probable direction of the coaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:030274_1332_0FE57928441D5458"/>Ruſſia being the only nation, that has hitherto navigated this part of the ocean, all our infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation reſpecting the poſition of the coaſt to the northward of Cape North, is derived from the journals and charts of the perſons who have been engaged, at different times, in determining the bounds of that extenſive empire; and theſe are, in general, ſo confined, contradictory, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that we cannot eaſily form a diſtinct idea of their pretended, much leſs collect the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of their real diſcoveries. On this account, the extent and figure of the peninſula, inhabited by the Tſchutſki, ſtill remains a point, on which the Ruſſian geographers are greatly divided in their opinions. Mr. Muller, in the map which he publiſhed in 1754 ſuppoſes that this country extends towards the north-eaſt, as far as the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 75°, and the longitude of 190° eaſt of Greenwich; and that it ends, in a round cape, which he denominates Tſchukotſkoi Noſs. To the ſouth of this cape, the coaſt, as he imagines, forms a bay to the weſt, bounded in the latitude of 67° 18′ by Serdze Kamen, the moſt northerly point obſerved by Beering in his expedition in 1728. The map publiſhed in 1776 by the aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy of St. Peterſburg, gives a new form to the whole peninſula, placing its north-eaſternmoſt extreme in the latitude 73°, longitude 178° 30′, and the moſt eaſterly point in latitude 65° 30′, longitude 189° 30′. All the other maps we have
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030274_1333_0FE5792307A33B10"/>
ſeen, both manuſcript and printed, vary between theſe two, apparently more according to the fancy and conjectures of the compiler, than on any grounds of more accurate intelligence. The only particular in which there is a general coincidence, with very little variation, is the poſition of the Eaſt Cape in the latitude of 66°. The form of the coaſt, both to the north and ſouth or the Eaſt Cape, in the map of the academy is extremely erroneous, and may be entirely diſregarded. In Mr. Muller's map, the coaſt towards the north has ſome degree of reſemblance to our ſurvey, as far as the latter extends, except that he does not make it trend ſufficiently to the weſt, but makes it recede only about 5° of longitude, between the latitude of 66° and 69°; whereas it actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes near ten. Between the latitude of 69° and 74°, the coaſt, according to him, bends round to the north and north-eaſt, and forms a large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory. On what authority he has thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the coaſt, is next to be examined.</p>
                     <p>The ingenious Mr. Coxe, whoſe accurate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches in this ſubject, give great weight to his ſentiments, is of opinion, that the extremity of the Noſs in queſtion, was never paſſed except by Deſhneff and his party, who ſailed in the year 1648, from the river Kovyma, and are imagined to have got round it into the Anadyr. As the narrative of this expedition, the ſubſtance of which has been given by Mr. Coxe, in his account of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030274_1334_0FE578CAE7E53608"/>
Ruſſian diſcoveries, comprehends no geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal delineations of the coaſt along which they ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our conjectures reſpecting its poſition muſt be derived from incidental circumſtances; and from theſe it evidently appears, that the Tſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kotſkoi Noſs of Deſhneff, is, in reality, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory named by Captain Cook, the Eaſt Cape. Speaking of the Noſs, he ſays, that a perſon may ſail from the iſthmus to the Anadyr, with a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wind, in three days, and three nights. This perfectly agrees with the ſituation of the Eaſt Cape, which is about one hundred and twenty leagues from the mouth of the river Anadyr; and there being no other iſthmus to the north between that and the latitude of 69°, it ſeems evident, that, by this deſcription he certainly means either the Cape in queſtion, or ſome other ſituated to the ſouth of it. He ſays, in another place, that, oppoſite to the iſthmus, there are two iſlands in the ſea, upon which were obſerved ſome of the Tſchutſki nation, in whoſe lips pieces of the teeth of the ſea-horſes were fixed. This exactly coincides with the two iſlands that lie to the ſouth-eaſt of the Eaſt Cape. We obſerved, indeed, no inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants upon them; but it is by no means impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that a party of Americans from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite continent, whom this deſcription ſuits, might have accidentally been there at that time, and he might eaſily mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>take them for a tribe of the Tſchutſki.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:030274_1335_0FE579250C2E7820"/>Theſe two circumſtances ſeem to us to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive on the point of the Tſchukotſkoi Noſs, though there are others of a more dubious nature from the ſame authority, and which now remain to be inveſtigated. Deſhneff, in another account, ſays, that in going from the Kovyma to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyr, a great promontory which projects very far into the ſea, muſt be doubled; and that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory extends between north and north-eaſt. It was, perhaps, from theſe expreſſions, that Muller was induced to repreſent the country of the Tſchutſki, in the form we find in his map; but, if he had been acquainted with the poſition of the Eaſt Cape, as determined by Captain Cook, and the ſtriking agreement between that and the promontory or iſthmus (for it muſt be remarked, that Deſhneff ſtill appears to be ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame thing), in the circumſtances above-mentioned, we are confident that he would not have thought thoſe expreſſions of ſufficient weight to authoriſe his extending the north-eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extreme of Aſia, either ſo far to the north or to the eaſt. For theſe words of Deſhneff may be reconciled with the opinion we have adopted, if we ſuppoſe that navigator to have taken theſe bearings from the ſmall bight lying to the weſt of the cape.</p>
                     <p>The next authority, on which Muller has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, ſeems to have been the depoſition of the Coſſac Popoff, taken at the Anadirſkoi <hi>oſtrog,</hi> in

1711. This Coſſac was ſent by land, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with ſeveral others, to demand tribute from the independent Tſchutſki tribes, who inhabited the parts about the Noſs. The firſt circumſtance, in the narative of this journey, that can tend to lead to the ſituation of Tſchukotſkoi Noſs, is its diſtance from Anadirſk; and this is repreſented as a journey of ten weeks, with loaded rein-deer; for which reaſon, it is added, their day's jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was very inconſiderable. We cannot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, conclude much from ſo vague an account, but as the diſtance between the Eaſt Cape and the <hi>oſtrog</hi> exceeds two hundred leagues in a direct line, and conſequently may be ſuppoſed to allow twelve or fourteen miles a day, its ſituation is not incompatible with Popoff's calculation.</p>
                     <p>Another circumſtance ſtated in this depoſition is, that their rout lay at the foot of a rock named Matkol, ſituate at the bottom of a ſpacious gulph. This gulf Muller conjectures to be the bay he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aid down between the latitudes of 66° and 72° and he accordingly places the rock Matkol in the center of it; but it appears to be more probable, that it might be a part of the Gulf of Anadyr, which they would doubtleſs touch upon in their journey from the oſtrog to the Eaſt Cap.</p>
                     <p>What ſeems, however, to put this point beyond all diſpute, and to prove that the Cape which Popoff viſited cannot be the northward of the latitude of 69°, is that part of his depoſition,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030274_1337_0FE57934B8570CC8"/>
which relates to an iſland lying off the Noſs, from whence the oppoſite continent might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. For, as the two continents, in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 69°, diverge ſo far as to be upwards of one hundred leagues diſtant, it is certainly very improbable, that the coaſt of Aſia ſhould again trend in ſuch a manner to the eaſt, as to come almoſt within ſight of the American coaſt.</p>
                     <p>Should theſe arguments be thought concluſive againſt the form and extent of the peninſula of the Tſchutſki, as repreſented by Mr. Muller, it will follow, that the Eaſt Cape is the Tſchukot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkoi Noſs of the earlier Ruſſian navigators<note n="*" place="bottom">We mention the earlier Ruſſian navigators, becauſe Beering, and, after him, the late Ruſſian geographers, have affixed this appellation to the ſouth-eaſt cape of the peninſula of the Tſchutſki, which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed by the name of the Anadirſkoi Noſs.</note>; and, conſequently, that the undeſcribed coaſt, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the latitude of 69° to the mouth of the Kovyma, muſt conſequently trend more or leſs towards the weſt. As an additional proof of this, we may obſerve, that Tſchukotſkoi Noſs is conſtantly laid down as dividing the ſea of Kovyma from that of Anadyr, which (we are of opinion) could not poſſibly be, if any large cape had projected to the north-eaſt in the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced latitudes.</p>
                     <p>Another queſtion ariſing on this point, is, to what degree of northern latitude this coaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030274_1338_0FE57880EAADA8C0"/>
before it inclines more immediately to the weſt. If the poſition of the mouth of the Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyma, both with regard to its latitude and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, were accurately aſcertained, it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be eaſy to form a plauſible conjecture upon this head. Captain Cook was always ſtrongly induced to believe, that the northern coaſt of Aſia, from the Indigirka eaſtward, has hitherto been uſually laid down above two degrees to the northward of its true ſituation; and he has therefore, on the authority of a map that was in his poſſeſſion, and on the intelligence which he received at Oonalaſhka, placed the mouth of the Kovyma, in his chart of the north-eaſt coaſt of Aſia, and the north-weſt coaſt of America, in the latitude of 68°. Should the Captain be right in this conjecture, it is probable, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eaſons which we have already ſtated, that the coaſt of Aſia does not, in any part, exceed 70° before it trends towards the weſt, and conſequently, that we were within one degree of its north-eaſtern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. For if the continent be imagined to extend any where to the north of Shelatſkoi Noſs it can ſcarcely be ſuppoſed that ſuch an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtance would have been omitted by the Ruſſian Navigators, who mention no remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able promontory between the Anadyr and the Kovyma except the Eaſt Cape. Another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which Deſhneff relates, may, perhaps, be deemed a farther confirmation of this opinion,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030274_1339_0FE578A711600B38"/>
namely, that he met with no obſtruction from ice in ſailing round the north-eaſtern extremity of Aſia; though he adds that this ſea is not at all times ſo free from it; as indeed evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his not ſucceeding in his firſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and, ſince that, from the failure of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauroff, as well as from the interruptions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments we met with, in two ſucceſſive years, in our preſent voyage.</p>
                     <p>That part of the continent, which is between Cape North, and the mouth of the Kovyma, is one hundred and twenty-five leagues in longitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal extent. About a third of this diſtance from the Kovyma eaſtward, was explored in 1723, by Fedot Amoſſoff, a <hi>Sinbojarſkoi</hi> of Jakutz, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Mr. Muller, that its direction was eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It has ſince that time been ſurveyed, with ſome degree of accuracy, by Shalauroff, whoſe chart makes it trend to the north-eaſt by eaſt, as far as Shelatſkoi Noſs, which he places at the diſtance of about forty-three leagues to the eaſt of the Kovyma. The ſpace, therefore, between the Noſs and Cape North, upwards of eighty leagues, is the only part of the Ruſſian dominions now remaining unaſcertained.</p>
                     <p>If the Kovyma, however, be erroneouſly laid down, in point of longitude as well as latitude, (a ſuppoſition by no means improbable) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the unexplored coaſt will diminiſh in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. The reaſons which incline us to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030274_1340_0FE578E304B17250"/>
that in the Ruſſian charts, the mouth of the river is placed conſiderably too far to the weſt, are the following: firſt, becauſe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that have been given of the navigation of the Frozen Ocean, from that river, round the North-Eaſtern extreme of Aſia, to the gulf of Anadyr, do not agree with the ſuppoſed diſtance between thoſe places; ſecondly, becauſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Anadyr to the Kovyma, over land, is repreſented by former Ruſſian travellers as a journey of no very great length, and eaſily performed: thirdly, becauſe the coaſt from the Shelatſkoi Noſs of Shalauroff appears to trend directly ſouth-eaſt towards the Eaſt Cape. If this be really the caſe, it may be inferred, that as we were, in all probability, not more than one degree to the ſouthward of Shelatſkoi Noſs, only ſixty miles of the coaſt of Aſia are unaſcertained.</p>
                     <p>It is highly probable, that a north<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>weſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Atlantic into the Pacific Ocean does not exiſt to the ſouthward of the fifty-ſixth degree of latitude. If, therefore, a paſſage really exiſts, it muſt certainly be either through Baffin's-bay, or by the north of Greenland, in the weſtern hemiſphere; or in the eaſtern, through the Frozen Sea, to the north of Siberia; and on whichever ſide it is ſituated, the navigator muſt paſs through the ſtraits diſtinguiſhed by the name of Beering's Straits. The impracticability of penetrating into the Atlantic Ocean on either ſide, through theſe
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030274_1341_0FE578FDE455D1A0"/>
ſtraits, is therefore all that now remains to be offered to the reader's conſideration.</p>
                     <p>The ſea to the northward of Beering's Straits, was found by us to be more free from ice in Auguſt than in July, and perhaps in ſome part of September it may be ſtill more clear of it. But, after the autumnal equinox, the length of the days diminiſhes ſo faſt, that no farther thaw can be expected; and we cannot reaſonably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſo great an effect to the warm weather in the laſt fortnight in the month of September, as to imagine it capable of diſperſing the ice, from the moſt northern parts of the coaſt of America. Admitting this, however, to be poſſible, it muſt at leaſt be allowed, that it would be highly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to attempt to avoid the Icy Cape by running to the known parts of Baffin's Bay, (a diſtance of about twelve hundred and ſixty miles) in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time as that paſſage can be ſuppoſed to remain open.</p>
                     <p>There appears, on the ſide of Aſia, ſtill leſs probability of ſucceſs, not only from what came to our own knowledge, relative to the ſtate of the ſea to the ſouthward of Cape North, but likewiſe from what we have gathered from the experience of the Lieutenants under the direction of Beering, and the journal of Shalauroff, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that on the north of Siberia.</p>
                     <p>The poſſibility of ſailing round the north-eaſtern extremity of Aſia, is undoubtedly proved
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030274_1342_0FE57900F3A8BB40"/>
by the voyage of Deſhneff, if its truth be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but when we reflect, that, ſince the time of that navigator, near a century and a half has elapſed, during which, in an age of curioſity and enterprize, no perſon has yet been able to follow him, we can entertain no very ſanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the public benefits which can be derived from it. But even on the ſuppoſition, that, in ſome remarkably favourable ſeaſon, a veſſel might find a clear paſſage round the coaſt of Siberia, and arrive in ſafety at the mouth of the Lena, ſtill there remains the Cape of Taimura, extending to the ſeventy-eighth degree of latitude, which no navigator has hitherto had the good fortune to double.</p>
                     <p>Some, however, contend, that there are ſtrong reaſons for believing, that the nearer approach we make to the Pole, the ſea is more clear of ice; and that all the ice we obſerved in the lower lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, had originally been formed in the great rivers of Siberia and America, from the breaking up of which the intermediate ſea had been filled. But even if that ſuppoſition be true, it is no leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there can be no acceſs to thoſe open ſeas, unleſs this prodigious maſs of ice is ſo far diſſolved in the ſummer, as to admit of a ſhip's making its way through it. If this be the real fact, we made choice of an improper time of the year for attempting to diſcover this paſſage, which ſhould have been explored in the months of
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030274_1343_0FE57893AE33DD98"/>
April and May, before the rivers were broken up. But ſeveral reaſons may be alledged againſt ſuch a ſuppoſition. Our experience at Petropaulowſka, gave us an opportunity of judging what might be expected farther northward; and upon that ground, we had ſome reaſon to entertain a doubt, whether the two continents might not, during the winter, be even joined by the ice: and this coincided with the accounts we heard in Kamt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatſka, that, on the coaſt of Siberia, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, in the winter, go out from the ſhore, upon the ice, to diſtances that exceed the breath of the ſea, in ſome parts, from one continent to the other.</p>
                     <p>The following remarkable particular is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the depoſition above referred to. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the land ſeen from the Tſchutſki Noſs, it is ſaid, that, during the ſummer, they ſail in one day to the land in <hi>baidares,</hi> a kind of veſſel formed of whale-bone, and covered with the ſkins of ſeals; and, in the winter, as they go ſwift with rein-deer, the journey may alſo be performed in a day. A ſatisfactory proof, that the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were generally connected by the ice.</p>
                     <p>Muller's account of one of the expeditions undertaken for the purpoſe of diſcovering a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed iſland in the Frozen Ocean, is ſtill more remarkable. His narrative is to the following purport. In 1714, a new expedition was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared from Jakntzk, under the conduct of Alexei
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030274_1344_0FE578A8CB635FF0"/>
Markoff, who was to ſet ſail from the mouth of the Jana; and if the Schitiki were not well adapted for ſea voyages, he was to build, at a convenient place, proper veſſels for proſecuting the diſcoveries without any great riſque. Upon his arrival at Uſt-janſkoe Simovie, the port where he was to embark, he diſpatched an account, dated the 2d of February, 1515, to the Chancery of Jakutzka, intimating that it was impracticable to navigate the ſea, as it was conſtantly frozen both in winter and ſummer; and that, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the expedition could only be proſecuted with ſledges drawn by dogs. He accordingly ſet out in this manner, accompanied with nine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the 10th of March, in the ſame year, and returned to Uſt-janſkoe Simovie on the 3d of the ſucceeding month. The account of his journey is as follows; that, for the ſpace of ſeven days, he travelled with as much expedition as his dogs could draw, (which, in good tracks, and favourable weather, is from eighty to a hundred werſts in a day) directly to the northward, upon the ice, without obſerving any iſland: that he was prevented from proceeding farther, by the ice, which roſe like mountains in that part of the ſea: that he had aſcended ſome of the hills of ice, whence he could ſee to a great diſtance around him, but could diſcern no land: and that, at length, proviſions for his dogs being deficient,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030274_1345_0FE578CC6C6CE8D8"/>
many of them died, which reduced him to the neceſſity of returning.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the above-mentioned arguments, which proceed upon an admiſſion of the hypotheſis, that the ice in this ocean comes from the rivers, others may be adduced, which afford good reaſon for ſuſpecting the truth of the hypotheſis itſelf. Captain Cook, whoſe opinion, with regard to the formation of ice, had originally coincided with that of the theoriſts we are now endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to confute, found ſufficient grounds, in the preſent voyage, for changing his ſentiments. We obſerved, that the coaſts of both continents were low, that the depth of water gradually decreaſed towards them, and that a ſtriking reſemblance prevailed between the two; from which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as well as from the deſcription given by Mr. Hearne of the copper-mine river, we have room for conjecturing, that, whatever rivers may diſcharge themſelves into the Frozen Ocean, from the continent of America are of a ſimilar nature with thoſe on the Aſiatic ſide; which are ſaid to be ſo ſhallow at their entrance, as to admit only veſſels of inconſiderable magnitude; whereas, the ice ſeen by us, riſes above the level of the ſea, to a height that equals the depth of thoſe rivers; ſo that its entire altitude muſt be, at leaſt, ten times greater.</p>
                     <p>Another circumſtance will naturally offer itſelf, in this place, to our conſideration, which ſeems
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030274_1346_0FE578FF6F0D93F8"/>
to be very incompatible with the opinion of thoſe who ſuppoſe that land is neceſſary for the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ice; we mean, the different ſtate of the ſea about Spitſbergen, and of that which is to the northward of Beering's Straits. It is incumbent on thoſe philoſophers to explain how it happens, that in the former quarter, and in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of much known land, navigators annually penetrate to near eighty degrees of northern lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; whereas, on the other ſide, no voyager has been able, with his utmoſt efforts, to proceed beyond the ſeventy-firſt degree; where, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the continents diverge nearly in the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eaſt and weſt, and where there is no land yet known to exiſt in the vicinity of the pole. For the farther ſatisfaction of our readers on this ſubject, we refer them to Dr. Forſter's " Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round the World," where they will find the queſtion, of the formation of the ice, diſcuſſed in a full and ſatisfactory manner, and the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of open polar ſeas, diſproved by many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible arguments.</p>
                     <p>To theſe remarks, we ſhall ſubjoin a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive view of the progreſs made by us to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at the two different ſeaſons in which we were occupied in that purſuit; together with ſome general obſervations reſpecting the ſea, and the coaſts of the two continents, which lie to the north of Beering's Straits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:030274_1347_0FE578B8E82701C8"/>In the year 1778, we did not diſcover the ice, till we advanced to the latitude of 70°, on the 17th of Auguſt; and we then found it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact bodies, which extend as far as the eye could diſcern, and of which the whole, or a part was moveable; ſince, by its drifting down upon our ſhips, we were almoſt hemmed in between that and the land. After we had experienced, both how fruitleſs and dangerous it would be, to attempt to penetrate farther to the northward, between the land and the ice, we ſtood over to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſide of Aſia, between the latitudes of 69° and 70°; after encountering in this tract very large fields of ice, and through the fogs, and thickneſs of the weather, prevented us from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely tracing a connected line of it acroſs, yet we were certain of meeting with it before it reached the latitude of 70°, whenever we made any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſtand to the north.</p>
                     <p>On the 26th of Auguſt, in the latitude of 69° ¾ and the longitude of 184°, we were obſtructed by it in ſuch quantities, that we could not paſs either to the north or weſt; and were under the neceſſity of running along the edge of it to the ſouth-ſouth-weſt, till we perceived land which proved to be the Aſiatic coaſt. With the ſeaſon thus far advanced, the weather ſetting in with ſnow and ſleet, and other indications of the approach of winter, we relinquiſhed our enterprize for that time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="unknown:030274_1348_0FE579162D0730F0"/>In our ſecond attempt, we did little more than confirm the remarks made by us in the firſt; for we never had an opportunity of approaching the continent of Aſia higher than 67° of latitude, nor that of America in any parts, except a few leagues between the latitude of 68° and 68° 20′, that we had not ſeen in the preceding year. We now met with obſtruction from ice 3° over; and our efforts to make farther progreſs to the northward, were chiefly confined to the middle ſpace between the two coaſts. We penetrated near 3° farther on the ſide of America, than that of Aſia, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with the ice both years ſooner, and in more conſiderable quantities, on the latter coaſt. As we advanced in our northerly courſe, we found the ice more ſolid and compact; however, as in our different traverſes from one ſide to the other, we paſſed over ſpaces which had before been covered with it, we imagined, that the greateſt part of what we ſaw was moveable. Its height, on a medium, we eſtimated at eight or ten feet, and that of the higheſt at ſixteen or eighteen. We again examined the currents twice, and found that they were unequal, though they never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one mile an hour. We likewiſe found the currents to ſet different ways, but more from the ſouth-weſt than any other quarter; yet, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their direction might be, their effect was ſo inconſiderable, that on concluſions, with reſpect
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030274_1349_0FE578C1519A2250"/>
to the exiſtence of any paſſage towards the north, could poſſibly be drawn from them.</p>
                     <p>We found July infinitely colder than Auguſt. The thermometer, in the firſt of theſe months, was once at 28°, and very frequently at 30°; whereas, during the laſt year, it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common in Auguſt, to have it ſo low as the freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing point. In both ſeaſons, we experienced ſome high winds, all of which blew from the ſouth-weſt. Whenever the wind was moderate from any quarter, we were ſubject to fogs; but they were obſerved to attend ſoutherly winds more conſtantly than others.</p>
                     <p>The ſtraits, between the American and Aſiatic continents, at their neareſt approach, in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 66°, were aſcertained by us to be thirteen leagues, beyond which they diverge to north-eaſt by eaſt, and weſt-north-weſt; and in the latitude of 69°, their diſtance from each other is about three hundred miles. In the aſpect of the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to the north of the ſtraits, a great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance is obſervable. Both of them are deſtitute of wood. The ſhores are low, with mountains further inland, riſing to a great height. The ſoundings, in the mid-way between them, were twenty-nine and thirty fathoms, gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing as we approached either continent; with this difference, however, that the water was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhallower on the coaſt of America than on that of Aſia, at an equal diſtance from land. The
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030274_1350_0FE578F1AD16ADC8"/>
bottom, towards the middle, was a ſoft ſlimy mud; and near either ſhore, it was a browniſh ſand, intermixed with a few ſhells, and ſmall frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bones. We found but little tide or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and that little came from the weſt.</p>
                     <p>We will now reſume the narrative of our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which was continued till the 31ſt of July; on which day we had proceeded, at noon, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen leagues to the ſouthward of the eaſt cape. We had light airs from the ſouth-weſt till the firſt of Auguſt, at noon, when our latitude was 64° 23′, and our longitude 189° 15′; the Aſiatic coaſt extending from north-weſt by weſt, to weſt half ſouth, at the diſtance of about twelve leagues, and the land to the eaſtward of St. Lawrence bearing ſouth half weſt.</p>
                     <p>On Monday the ſecond, the weather being clear, we perceived the ſame land at noon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from weſt-ſouth-weſt half weſt to ſouth-eaſt, and forming many elevated hummocks, which bore the appearance of ſeparate iſlands. The latitude, at this time, was 64° 3′, the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 189° 28′, and our ſoundings were ſeventeen fathoms. We were not near enough to this land to aſcertain whether it was a group of iſlands, or only a ſingle one. We had paſſed its moſt weſterly point in the evening of the third of July, which we then ſuppoſed to be the iſle of St. Lawrence; the eaſternmoſt we ſailed cloſe by in September the preceding year, and this we deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030274_1351_0FE578E6E35E2F18"/>
Clerke's Iſland; and found it compoſed of a number of lofty cliffs, connected by very low land. Though theſe cliffs, the laſt year, were miſtaken by us for ſeparate iſlands, till we made a very near approach to the ſhore, we are ſtill inclined to conjecture, that the iſle of St. Lawrence is diſtinct from Clerke's Iſland, as there appeared betwixt them a conſiderable ſpace, where we did not obſerve the leaſt appearance of riſing ground. In the afternoon, we likewiſe ſaw what had the appearance of a ſmall iſland, to the north-eaſt of the land that we had ſeen at noon, and which, from the thickneſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we only had ſight of once. We ſuppoſed its diſtance to be nineteen leagues from the iſland of St. Lawrence, in the direction of north-eaſt by eaſt half eaſt.</p>
                     <p>We had light variable winds on the 3d, and ſteered round the north-weſt point of the iſle of St. Lawrence. The next day, at noon, our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was 64° 8′, longitude 188°; the iſland of St. Lawrence bearing ſouth one quarter eaſt, at the diſtance of ſeven leagues.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, a freſh breeze ariſing from the eaſt, we ſteered to the ſouth-ſouth-weſt, and quickly loſt ſight of St. Lawrence. On Saturday the ſeventh, at twelve o'clock, the latitude was 59° 38′ and the longitude 183°. We had a calm in the afternoon, and caught a great number of cod, in ſeventy-eight fathoms of water. From
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030274_1352_0FE578C8B18F7060"/>
this period to the 17th, we were making the beſt of our way towards the ſouth, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable occurence, except that the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the weſt, forced us more to the eaſtward than we wiſhed, it being our intention to make Beering's Iſland.</p>
                     <p>On Thursday the 17th, between four and five in the morning, we deſcried land to the north-weſt, which we could not approach, as the wind blew from that quarter. Ac mid-day, the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was 53° 49′, and the longitude 168° 5′. The land in view bore north by weſt, at the diſtance of twelve or fourteen leagues. This land we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to be the iſland Mednoi, which is placed in the Ruſſian charts to the ſouth-eaſt of Beering's Iſland. It is elevated land, and was at this time apparently free from ſnow. We reckon it to be in the latitude of 54° 28′, and the longitude of 167° 52′. We did not ſtrike ground with one hundred and fifty fathoms of line.</p>
                     <p>Captain Clerke being now no longer able to get out of his bed, ſignified his deſire, that the officers would receive their orders from Mr. King; and directed that we ſhould repair, with all convenient ſpeed, to the bay of Awatſka. The wind continuing weſterly, we ſteered a ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly courſe, till early in the morning of the 19th; when, after rain of a few hours continuance, it blew from the eaſt, and increaſed to a ſtrong gale. We made the moſt of it while it laſted,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030274_1353_0FE578C34D71B238"/>
by ſtanding towards the weſt, with all the ſail we could bear. The next day, the wind varying to the ſouth-weſt, we ſteered a weſt-north-weſt courſe. The latitude, at noon, was 53° 7′, and the longitude 162° 49′. On the 21ſt, between five and ſix in the morning, we perceived a very lofty peaked mountain on the coaſt of Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka, known by the name of Chepoonſkoi Mountain, bearing north-weſt-by-north, at the diſtance of between twenty-five and thirty leagues. At noon the coaſt was obſerved to extend from north-by-eaſt to weſt, with a very great hazineſs upon it; and it was about twelve leagues diſtant. We had light airs during the remainder of this, as well as the following day, and found no ground within one hundred and forty fathoms of line.</p>
                     <p>At nine o'clock in the morning, on Sunday the 22d of Auguſt, Capt. Charles Clerke expired, in the thirty-eighth year of his age. His death was occaſioned by a conſumption, which had manifeſtly commenced before his departure from England, and of which he had lingered, during the whole continuance of the voyage. His very gradual decay, had for a long time rendered him a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly object to his friends; but the firmneſs and equanimity with which he bore it, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant flow of good ſpirits, which he retained even to the laſt hour, and a chearful reſignation to his fate, furniſhed them with ſome conſolation. It was impoſſible, not to feel an uncommon degree
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030274_1354_0FE578882F40D128"/>
of compaſſion for a gentleman, who had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a ſeries of thoſe difficulties and hardſhips, which muſt be the inevitable lot of every ſeamen, and under which he at laſt ſunk. He was bred to the navy from his youth, and had been in many engagements during the war which began in the year 1756. In the action between the Bellona and Courageux, he was ſtationed in the mizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top, and was carried overboard with the maſt; but was afterwards taken up, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the leaſt injury. He was midſhipman on board the Dolphin, commanded by Commodore Byron, when ſhe firſt ſailed round the world; and was afterwards on the American ſtation. In the year 1768, he engaged in a ſecond voyage round the world, in the ſituation of maſter's mate of the Endeavour; and, during the expedition, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a lieutenancy. In the Reſolution he made a third voyage round the world, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of ſecond lieutenant: and in a ſhort time after his return, in 1775, he was appointed maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and commander. In the preſent expedition, he was appointed captain of the Diſcovery, and to accompany Captain Cook. By the calamitous death of the other, he naturally ſucceeded, as has been already related, to the chief command.</p>
                     <p>It would ſavour of injuſtice and ingratitude to his memory, not to mention, that, during the ſhort time he commanded the expedition, he was moſt remarkably zealous for its ſucceſs. When
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030274_1355_0FE5791B456F72F0"/>
the principal command devolved upon him, his health began rapidly to decline; and he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal in every reſpect, to encounter the ſeverity of a high northern climate. The vigour of his mind, however, was not, in the leaſt, impaired by the decay of his body: and though he was perfectly ſenſible, that his delaying to return to a warmer climate, was depriving himſelf of the only chance of recovery; yet, ſo attentive was he to his duty, that he was determined not to ſuffer his own ſituation to bias his judgment to the prejudice of the ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he therefore perſevered in the ſearch of a paſſage, till every officer in the expedition, declared they were of opinion it was impracticable, and that any farther attempts would be equally hazardous and ineffectual.</p>

                     <p>CAPTAIN King ſent a meſſenger to Captain Gore, to acquaint him with the death of Captain Clerke, who brought a letter from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030274_1357_0FE578E4F34D8798"/>
Gore, containing an order for Captain King to exert his utmoſt endeavours to keep in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Diſcovery, and, if a ſeparation ſhould happen, to repair, as ſoon as poſſible to St. Peter and St. Paul. Our latitude, at noon, was 53° 8′ north, and our longitude 160° 40′ eaſt; Cheepoonſkoi Noſs then bearing weſt. In the afternoon, we had light airs, which continued till noon on the 23d; when, a freſh breeze ſpringing up from the eaſt, we ſteered for the entrance of Awatſka-bay; which we ſaw about ſix in the evening, bearing weſt-north-weſt, diſtant about five leagues. At eight, the light-houſe, which now furniſhed a good light, was about three miles diſtant, and bore north-weſt-by-weſt. It was now a perfect calm; but, as the tide was favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the boats were ſent a-head, and towed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the narrow parts of the entrance. On the 24th, at one in the morning, we dropped anchor, the ebb tide then ſetting againſt us.</p>
                     <p>We weighed about nine o'clock, and went up the bay with light airs, which being afterwards ſucceeded by a light breeze, we anchored before three in the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul; having up our enſign half ſtaff, as the body of our late Captain was in the veſſel; and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery followed us in a very ſhort time.</p>
                     <p>Soon after we had anchored, we were viſited by our old friend, the Serjeant, (ſtill the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer of the place) who brought with him
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030274_1358_0FE5792C7438AAE8"/>
a preſent of berries, intended for Captain Clerke. He was much affected at hearing of his death, and ſeeing the coffin wherein his body was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited. As the deceaſed Captain had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly requeſted to be buried on ſhore, and gave the preference to the church at Paratounca, we embraced this opportunity of conſulting with the Serjeant, about the neceſſary ſteps to be purſued upon the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>After much converſation on this ſubject, which was very imperfectly carried on, for want of an interpreter, we gathered intelligence that de L'Iſle, and ſome other Ruſſian gentlemen, who had died here, were buried near the barracks, at the <hi>oſtrog</hi> of St. Peter and St. Paul; and that this place would certainly be more eligible than Paratounca, as the church was ſhortly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thither. We, therefore, determined to wait the arrival of the Prieſt of Paratounca, who was immediately to be ſent for, as being the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beſt qualified to give us any information we required upon the ſubject. The Serjeant, at the ſame time, expreſſed his intentions of ſending an expreſs to the commander of Bolcheretſk, with intelligence of our arrival; when Captain Gore begged to avail himſelf of that opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying a letter to him, wherein he requeſted that ſixteen head of black cattle might be ſent with all poſſible diſpatch. And, as the commander was unacquainted with any language except his
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030274_1359_0FE57909B315A300"/>
own, the particulars of our requeſt were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Serjeant, who not only undertook to ſend the letter, but alſo an explanation of its contents.</p>
                     <p>It was a general remark among us that, though the face of the country had improved in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſince we had left it, the Ruſſians looked even worſe than they did then. They made the very ſame obſervation with reſpect to us; and, as neither party ſeemed pleaſed with the diſcovery, we mutually conſoled ourſelves by caſting the blame upon the country, whoſe verdant and lively complexion, had occaſioned an appearance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs on our own.</p>
                     <p>Though the eruption of the volcano was ſo extremely violent when we quitted the bay, we were informed that no damage had been received from it here. Several ſtones, however, that were as large as a gooſe's egg, had fallen at the <hi>oſtrog.</hi> This was the principal news we had to enquire after, and all the intelligence they had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to us, excepting that of Sopoſnicoff's arrival from Oonalaſhka, who took charge of the pacquet ſent by Captain Cook to the Admiralty, and which, we had the pleaſure to find, had been forwarded.</p>
                     <p>On the 25th of Auguſt, in the morning, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gore, in conſequence of the death of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke, made out the new commiſſions. He appointed himſelf to the command of the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030274_1360_0FE578CE6963B7E8"/>
and Mr. King to that of the Diſcovery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Lanyan, who was maſter's mate of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and who had been in that capacity in the former voyage, on board the Adventure, was appointed to the vacant lieutenancy. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing arrangements were the conſequence of theſe promotions. Lieutenants Burney and Rick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (from the Diſcovery) were appointed firſt and ſecond Lieutenants of the Reſolution; and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Williamſon, firſt Lieutenant of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Captain King, by the permiſſion of Captain Gore, took in four midſhipmen, who had rendered themſelves uſeful to him in aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical calculations; and whoſe aſſiſtance was become the more neceſſary, as we had not an ephemeris for the preſent year. And, that aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical obſervations might not be neglected to be made in either ſhip, Mr. Bayly took Captain King's place in the Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>On the ſame day, we were attended by the worthy Prieſt of Paratounca. His expreſſions of ſorrow, at the death of Captain Clerke, did honour to his feelings. He confirmed what the Serjeant had related with regard to the intended removal of the Church, and aſſured us the timber was actually preparing; but ſubmitted the choice of either place entirely to Captain Gore.</p>
                     <p>As the Diſcovery had ſuffered great injury from the ice, eſpecially on the 23d of July, and had continued exceedingly leaky ever ſince, it was
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030274_1361_0FE5783B6595DF38"/>
apprehended that ſome of her timbers might have ſtarted; the carpenters of the Reſolution were therefore ſent to aſſiſt thoſe of the Diſcovery in repairing her; and they accordingly began to rip the damaged ſheathing from the larboard bow. It was diſcovered, by this operation, that three feet of third ſtrake were ſtaved, and the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſtarted. To accommodate thoſe who were to be employed on ſhore, a tent was erected, and a party was ſent into the country, north of the harbour, to fell timber. The obſervatories were placed at the weſt end of the village, near which was erected a tent, as an abode for the Captains Gore and King.</p>
                     <p>As we proceeded to remove the ſheathing, the decayed ſtate of the ſhip's hull became more and more apparent. Eight feet of a plank in the wale were ſo exceedingly rotton, that we were obliged to ſhift it the next morning. We were now totally at a ſtand, as nothing could be found to replace it in either ſhip, without cutting up a top-maſt; which ought to be the laſt expedient to have recourſe to. In the afternoon, the carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were diſpatched in ſearch of a tree of a proper ſize for the purpoſe. Fortunately they diſcovered a birch, which was probably the only one of ſufficient magnitude in the whole neighbourhood of the bay, and which we had ſawed down when we were laſt here; conſequently it had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being a little ſeaſoned. This was
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030274_1362_0FE578F4E4CC5578"/>
prepared on the ſpot, and taken on board the Diſcovery the next morning.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon being now far advanced, Captain King was unwilling that any hindrance or delay ſhould happen through him, to Captain Gore's farther views of diſcovery, and therefore ordered the carpenters to rip off no more of the ſheathing than ſhould be found abſolutely neceſſary for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the damages occaſioned by the ice. He was apprehenſive of their meeting with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed planks, which he thought had better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that ſtate, than have their places ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with green birch, even ſuppoſing it could be procured.</p>
                     <p>All hands were now fully employed in their ſeparate departments, that we might be perfectly ready for ſea, by the time the carpenters had completed their buſineis. Four men were ſet apart to haul the ſeine for ſalmon, which were caught in immenſe quantities, and were of a moſt excellent quality. After the wants of both ſhips were ſufficiently ſupplied, we daily ſalted down almoſt a hogſhead. We had four invalids, who were employed in gathering greens, and cooking for thoſe who were on ſhore. We alſo landed our powder in order to have it dried; and the blubber of the ſea-horſes, with which both ſhips had completely furniſhed themſelves in our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the north, was now boiled down for oil, and was become a very neceſſary article, having
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030274_1363_0FE578466A5C2590"/>
long ſince expended all our candles. The cooper was alſo employed in his department.</p>
                     <p>Both ſhips companies were thus fully engaged till Saturday afternoon, which was given up to every man (except the carpenters) to enable them to waſh their linen, and get their clothes in toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able order, that they might appear decently on the Sunday.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the 29th, in the afternoon, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the laſt ſad offices to Captain Clerke. The officers and crew of the two veſſels attended him in proceſſion to the grave; the ſhips, at the ſame time, firing minute guns; and, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the ſervice, three vollies were fired by the marines. The body was interred under a tree, which ſtands on a little eminence in the valley north of the harbour, where the ſtore-houſes and hoſpital are ſituated; this being, as Captain Gore ſuppoſed, ſuch a ſituation as was moſt conſonant to the wiſhes of the deceaſed. The Prieſt of Paratounca alſo recommended this ſpot, imagining it would be very near the centre of the new church. This worthy paſtor joined in the proceſſion, walking with the gentleman who read the ſervice. All the Ruſſians in the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſſembled on the occaſion, and reſpectfully aſſiſted in the ſolemnity.</p>
                     <p>On Monday the 30th, the ſeveral parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed their reſpective employments, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mentioned in the courſe of the preceding
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030274_1364_0FE578B700248B78"/>
week; and on the 2d of September, the carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters proceeded to rip off ſuch of the ſheathing as had been injured by the ice, from the ſtarboard-ſide; having firſt ſhifted the damaged planks, and repaired and caulked the ſheathing of the larboard bow. Four feet of a plank were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the third ſtrake under the wale, ſo much ſhaken as to require to be replaced; which was accordingly done; and on the 3d, the ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was repaired.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon of the 3d, we got ſome ballaſt on board; after which we unhung the rudder, and cauſed it to be conveyed on ſhore, the lead of the pintles being much worn, and a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the ſheathing rubbed off. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters of the Reſolution not being immediately wanted, this was put in proper order the next day; but finding the rudder immoderately heavy, (heavier indeed than that of the Reſolution) we let it remain on ſhore to dry, and conſequently to become lighter.</p>
                     <p>An enſign arrived this day from Bolcheretſk, with a letter from the commander of that place to Captain Gore; which we requeſted the Serjeant to peruſe, and, by his aſſiſtance, we at length underſtood, that proper orders had been given reſpecting the cattle; and that in a few days we might expect to ſee them; and that Captain Shmaleff, who ſucceeded Major Behm in his command, would pay us a viſit immediately on
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030274_1365_0FE5793930DEFC80"/>
the arrival of a ſloop which he expected from Okotſk. The bearer of the letter was the ſon of Captain Lieutenant Synd, who, about eleven years ago, was appointed to the command of an expedition of diſcovery between Aſia and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and now reſided at Okotſk. He told us he was appointed to receive our directions, and to ſupply us with every thing that our ſervice might require. That he ſhould remain with us, till it was convenient for the commander to leave Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheretſk; and then he was to return, or the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon would be without an officer.</p>
                     <p>The Ruſſians, in Kamtſchatka, could not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with a better account of Synd than Mr. Coxe has given us; though they ſeemed entirely diſpoſed to communicate what they really knew. Major Behm could only give us this general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that the expedition had miſcarried, and that the commander had been much cenſured. It was evident that he had been on the coaſt of Africa, ſouth of Cape Prince of Wales; and, as he was too far north to meet with ſea-otters, which the Ruſſians ſeem to have in view in all their attempts at diſcoveries, it is probable, that his return without having made any, from whence commercial advantages might be reaped, was the cauſe of his diſgrace, and on that account his voyage is ſpoken of with contempt by all the Ruſſians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:030274_1366_0FE579429FCF91E8"/>But, to proceed; on the 5th of September, all the parties that were on ſhore returned to the ſhip, and were employed in ſcrubbing her bottom, and getting in ſome ſhingle ballaſt. Two of our guns, which had been ſtowed in the fore-hold, we now got up, and mounted them on the deck, as we were ſhortly to viſit thoſe nations, where our reception would probably be regulated by the reſpectability of our appearance. On the 8th, the Reſolution hauled on ſhore, in order to repair ſome damages ſhe had received from the ice in her cut-water; and our carpenters, in their turn, were ordered to aſſiſt her.</p>
                     <p>We began, about this time, to make a ſtrong decoction from a ſpecies of dwarf pine, which is very plentiful in this country, judging it would hereafter be uſeful in making beer, and that we might perhaps be able to procure ſugar, or a ſubſtitute for it, to ferment with it, at Canton. We knew, however, it would be an admirable medicine for the ſcurvy, and therefore were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deſirous of procuring a conſiderable ſupply; as moſt of the preventatives with which we had furniſhed ourſelves, were either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, or had loſt their efficacy through long keeping. When we had prepared about a hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of it, the ſhip's copper was found to be remarkably thin, and that in many places, it was even cracked. This obliged us to deſiſt,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030274_1367_0FE578EFAB183DE8"/>
and orders were given that, for the future, it ſhould be uſed as ſparingly as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who may hereafter be engaged in long voyages, would act judiciouſly if they provided themſelves with a ſpare copper; or, at leaſt, they ſhould be fully convinced that the copper, uſually furniſhed, ſhould be remarkably ſtrong and durable. Theſe neceſſary utenſils are employed in ſo many extra-ſervices, particularly in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant one of brewing antiſcorbutic decoctions, that ſome ſuch proviſion ſeems abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and the former appears the more eligible, becauſe a much greater quantity of fuel would be conſumed in heating coppers that were very thick.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 10th, the boats from both the ſhips were ordered to tow a Ruſſian galliot into the harbour, which had juſt arrived from Okotſk. She had been no leſs than thirty-five days on her paſſage, and, from the light-houſe, had been obſerved a fortnight before, beating up towards the mouth of the bay. The crew had, at that time, diſpatched their only boat on ſhore, in order to procure water, which they were much in need of; but, the wind increaſing, the boat was loſt; the galliot was again driven to ſea, and thoſe on board ſuffered inconceivable hardſhips.</p>
                     <p>On board this galliot there were fifty ſoldiers, their wives and children, they had alſo ſeveral paſſengers, and their crew conſiſted of twenty-five;
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030274_1368_0FE579214E134198"/>
making, in the whole, upwards of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons; which, for a veſſel of eighty tons, was a great number, eſpecially as ſhe was heavily laden with ſtores and proviſions. This galliot, and the ſloop which we ſaw here in May, are built in the manner of the Dutch doggers.</p>
                     <p>Soon after the veſſel had come to anchor, we were viſited by a <hi>Pul-parouchich,</hi> or Sub-lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who arrived in her, and who was ſent to take the command of this place. Some of the ſoldiers, we were informed, were intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce the garriſon; and two pieces of cannon were brought on ſhore, to ſerve as an additional defence of the town. From theſe circumſtances, it is pretty apparent that the Ruſſian commanders in Siberia, had, from our viſiting this place, been induced to attend to the defenceleſs ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and the honeſt Serjeant ſhrewdly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that, as we had found the way thither, others might do the ſame, who might not be ſo welcome as ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>Having repaired the damages which the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution had ſuffered by the ice, ſhe hauled off from the ſhore the next morning; and, in the courſe of the day, we got ſome pitch, tar, cordage, and twine from the galliot. Their ſcanty ſtore rendered them unable to ſupply us with canvaſs, and they could not comply with our application for that article. She furniſhed us, however, with an hundred and forty ſkins of flour, amounting
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030274_1369_0FE57917D4A051B8"/>
to 13, 782 Engliſh pounds. Till this day, we had a continual courſe of dry weather, but now a heavy rain ſucceeded, attended with ſtrong ſqualls of wind, which occaſioned us to ſtrike our yards and top-maſts.</p>
                     <p>Sunday the 12th, was a day of reſt: but, as the weather continued foul, our men could not employ themſelves in gathering the berries which grew in ſuch vaſt quantities about the coaſt, or amuſe themſelves by any other paſtime on ſhore. Enſign Synd left us this day to return to Bolche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retſk, with the remainder of the ſoldiers who had arrived in the galliot. While he remained here, he had been our conſtant gueſt; and, on his father's account, we thought him in ſome degree belonging to us; and, as one of the family of diſcoverers, entitled to a ſhare of our eſteem.</p>
                     <p>The Serjeant, as being commander of the place, had hitherto been admitted to our tables; and his company was additionally welcome to us, becauſe he was ſenſible and quick in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; and comprehended, better than any other perſon, the few Ruſſian words that we had acquired. Whilſt Enſign Synd remained, among us, he very politely ſuffered him to enjoy the ſame privileges; but, when the new commander arrived from Okotſk, the Serjeant, for what cauſe we did not underſtand, fell into diſgrace, and was no longer permitted to ſit in the company of his own officers. Our endeavours to obtain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030274_1370_0FE5794425CF42A0"/>
for him, we perceived would have been ineffectual; for, though it would have been highly agreeable to us, it was, perhaps, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with their diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>On the 14th we had completed the ſtowage of the holds, got our wood and water on board, and were ready for ſea at a day's notice. But, it ſhould be obſerved, that, though every thing on board was in this degree of readineſs, we could not think of taking our departure, becauſe the cattle were not yet arrived from Verchnei; and freſh proviſions were now become the moſt important article of our wants, and eſſentially neceſſary for preſerving the health of our people. As there was a proſpect of fine weather, this was conſidered as a favourable opportunity of engaging in ſome amuſement on ſhore, and acquiring ſome little knowledge of the country. A party of bear hunting was therefore propoſed by Captain Gore, and the propoſal was readily acceded to.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 17th, we ſet out on this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detion; which was deferred till that day, in order to give a little reſt to the Hoſpodin Ivaſkin, a new acquaintance who had arrived here on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday, and who was to be of our party. Major Behm had deſired this gentleman, who uſually reſides at Verchnei, to attend us on our return to the harbour, and aſſiſt us as an interpreter; and, from what we had heard of him before his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, our curioſity to ſee him was much excited.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:030274_1371_0FE5793AB3FBF008"/>He is allied to a conſiderable family in Ruſſia, and his father was a general in the ſervice of the empreſs. He received his education partly in Germany, and partly in France; he had been page to the empreſs Elizabeth, and bore an enſign's commiſſion in her guards. At ſixteen years of age he was <hi>knowted,</hi> had his noſe ſlit, and was baniſhed to Siberia. He was afterwards tranſported to Kamtſchatka, and had then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided there thirty-one years. His perſon was tall and thin, and his viſage furrowed with deep wrinkles. Old age was ſtrongly depicted in his whole figure, though he had hardly entered his fifty-fourth year.</p>
                     <p>Great was our diſappointment when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that he had ſo totally forgotten the French and German languages as not to be able to ſpeak a ſingle ſentence, nor readily to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any thing that was ſaid to him in either of thoſe languages. Thus were we unfortunately deprived of what we expected would have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed a favourable opportunity of acquiring fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information reſpecting this country. We alſo promiſed ourſelves much ſatisfaction in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hiſtory of this extraordinary man, which he might, perhaps, be induced to relate to ſtrangers who could probably be ſerviceable to him, but who could not be ſuppoſed to take advantage from what he might ſay, to his prejudice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="unknown:030274_1372_0FE579462629CA68"/>The cauſe of his baniſhment remained a ſecret to every one in this country, but it was generally ſuppoſed he had been guilty of ſome atrocious offence; eſpecially as ſeveral of the commanders of Kamtſchatka have exerted their intereſt to get him recalled, in the reign of the preſent empreſs; but, ſo far from getting him recalled, they were not able to obtain a change of his place of baniſhment. He aſſured us that, for twenty years, he had not taſted a morſel of bread, nor had been allowed any kind of ſubſiſtence; but had lived, all that time with the Kamtſchadales, on what he had procured from the chace by his own activity and toil. Afterwards a ſmall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was allowed him, and his ſituation has been rendered much leſs intolerable, ſince Major Behm was appointed to the command. Being taken notice of by ſo reſpectable a character, who often invited him to become his gueſt, others were induced to follow his example. The Major had alſo occaſioned his penſion to be increaſed to a hundred roubles a year, which is an enſign's pay in every other part of the empreſs's dominions, but, in this province, all the officers have double pay. Major Behm informed us that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained permiſſion for him to go to Okotſk, where he was to reſide in future; but that, at preſent, he ſhould leave him behind, as he might probably be uſeful to us as an interpreter, on our return to</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="unknown:030274_1373_0FE548E328473010"/>Orders having been given to the firſt lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of both ſhips, that the rigging ſhould be repaired as far as the late ſupply of ſtores would permit, we proceeded on our hunting party, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the corporal of the Kamtſchadales; but, previous to our looking out for game, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the head of Behm's Harbour, which is an inlet on the weſt ſide of the bay. This having been a favourite place of Major Behm's, we had named it after that officer, though by the natives it is called Tareinſka.</p>
                     <p>As we advanced towards this harbour, we ſaw the <hi>Toion</hi> of St. Peter and St. Paul, in a canoe having with him his wife and two children, and another inhabitant of Kamtſchatka. He had juſt killed two ſeals on an iſland in the entrance of the harbour, and was returning home with them, as well as with a large quantity of berries which he had gathered. The wind having veered to the ſouth-weſt, in purſuance of his advice we now changed our route, and, inſtead of proceeding up the harbour, took a northerly courſe towards a pool of water, at a ſmall diſtance from the mouth of the river Paratounca, which was much frequented by the bears.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as we had landed, the wind unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately veered to the eaſtward, and once more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed our hopes of meeting with any game; the Kamtſchadales having often aſſured us, that there was no probability of finding any bears,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030274_1374_0FE5791FC972E260"/>
as we were to the windward; thoſe animals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſed of extraordinary acuteneſs in ſcent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their purſuers, which, under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, enabled them to avoid danger. We therefore returned to the boat, and, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a tent for that purpoſe, paſſed the night upon the beach. The next day, being govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the opinion of our guides, we croſſed the bay, and proceeded to the head of Rokoweena Harbour; where we ſecured our boats, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards went on foot with all our baggage.</p>
                     <p>Having walked about five or ſix miles, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the ſea-ſide, three miles north of the light-houſe head. From hence, a continued nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row border of level ground adjoining to the ſea, extended itſelf towards Chepoonſkoi Noſs as far as we could ſee. It is entirely covered with heath, and produces berries in great abundance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which are called crow and partridge berries.</p>
                     <p>We were told, that there was almoſt a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of finding a number of bears, feeding upon theſe berries; but, as the weather was ſhowery, it was unfavourable to us. Accordingly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we purſued our courſe along the plain; and, though ſeveral bears were ſeen at a diſtance, we could not by any means, get within ſhot of them. This diverſion was therefore changed to that of ſpearing ſalmon, which we ſaw in throngs, driving through the ſurf into a ſmall river. Here
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030274_1375_0FE579411A18A230"/>
we could not help remarking the inferiority of the Kamtſchadales, at this kind of fiſhing, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Oonalaſhka; neither were their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though pointed with iron, near ſo well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the purpoſe, nor fabricated with that neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which thoſe of the Americans were, though only pointed with bone. On aſking the cauſe of this inferiority, we were informed by the corporal, who had long reſided among the Americans, that formerly the natives of Kamtſchatka uſed ſuch darts and ſpears as thoſe of the Americans, and, like theirs, headed and barbed with bone, and were as dexterous as the latter in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. We could not ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand each other to diſcover the real cauſe of this change, but ſuppoſe it may be the effect of an imperfect ſtate of improvement. Fortunately, however, the water afforded us a little proviſion; for ill ſucceſs had not only attended us in the chace by land, but we had failed in our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſhooting wild-fowl, after having almoſt depended upon a ſupply of them for our ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and, on its failure, began to think it almoſt time to return to our head-quarters.</p>
                     <p>The Kamtſchadales who attended us, at length diſcovered, that our not meeting with game was occaſioned by our going in too large a party, and by the unavoidable noiſe that was the natural conſequence of it. This judicious remark in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us to ſeparate; Captain King, Ivaſkin, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030274_1376_0FE5794A15F36E38"/>
the corporal, forming one party; the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Captain Gore, and the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. We paſſed the night under our tent, and, on the morning of the 19th, ſet out by different routs, in order to make a kind of circuit round the country, and meet at St. Peter and St. Paul.</p>
                     <p>Captain King, and his party, took the courſe of the river, at whoſe mouth he had fiſhed for the ſalmon; and, after being completely ſoaked with heavy rains the whole morning, they took ſheller, about three in the afternoon, in ſome old <hi>balagans,</hi> which were the remains of a Kamtſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale village, without having ſeen a ſingle bear in their long and tedious journey.</p>
                     <p>At firſt we ſeemed inclined to continue here all night, that we might reſume the chaſe early in the morning; but, as the weather began to clear, and a freſh breeze ſprung up from a quarter hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to our deſigns, the Hoſpodin, whom former ſeverities had rendered unable to endure fatigue, and who was now more particularly diſtreſſed from having his ſnuff-box exhauſted of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, grew very importunate with us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home. The old corporal was extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to conſent, alledging, that we were at a conſiderable diſtance from the harbour, and that the badneſs of the way would probably hinder us from compleating our journey, before night had overtaken us. Ivaſkin's entreaties, however, at length prevailed, and the corporal conducted us
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030274_1377_0FE578901FEB47A8"/>
by the ſide of ſeveral ſmall lakes, which are pretty numerous in the flat part of this country. They are from half a mile to two miles long, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally about half a mile in breadth. The water in them is very clear and freſh, and they abound with red-coloured fiſh, not unlike a ſmall ſalmon, both in ſhape and ſize. The margins of theſe lakes were uſually covered with half-eaten fiſh, being fragments left by the bears, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a moſt intolerable ſtench. We frequently arrived at places which had juſt been quitted by the bears, but were never able to come within reach of them.</p>
                     <p>At night we reached the ſhips, after having been full twelve hours upon our legs. Poor Ivaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin ſeemed perfectly overcome with fatigue, and was probably the more ſenſibly affected by it, for want of a ſupply of ſnuff; for, almoſt at every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ep, his hand ſunk mechanically into his pocket, and inſtantly roſe again with his huge empty box. Juſt as we arrived at the tent, the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came exceedingly rough and wet, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated ourſelves on our not having ſtaid another day from our general rendezvous. The Hoſpodin's box was immediately repleniſhed, and, regaling upon a good ſupper, we forgot the fatigues and diſappointments of our journey.</p>
                     <p>The next day (Monday the 20th) we received the diſagreeable intelligence, that our friend, the ſerjeant, had ſuffered corporal puniſhment, which
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030274_1378_0FE57A315572E3F8"/>
had been inflicted on him by command of the old <hi>Put-parouchick.</hi> None of us could learn the cauſe of his diſpleaſure; but it was ſuppoſed to have ariſen from ſome little jealouſy, which had been excited by our civility to the former. Imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, that the offence, whatever it might be, could not merit a chaſtiſement ſo diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, we were both ſorry and angry at what had happened. The friendly and familiar terms on which we had lived with him, and the eſteem we were known to entertain for him, made the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front appear perſonal to ourſelves. For we had conſulted the worthy Major Behm, who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſerjeant's friend, how we could render him ſome ſervice, for the excellent order he had preſerved in the <hi>oſtrog</hi> during our ſtay, and for his extreme readineſs to oblige us, upon every occaſion that preſented itſelf. The Major ſaid, a letter of recommendation to the Governor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, would probably have a good effect; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Clerke accordingly had given him one, which, together with his own repreſentations, he fully expected would get the ſerjeant advanced in his profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>We were unwilling to remonſtrate on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, till Captain Shmaleff ſhould arrive. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, our very imperfect knowledge of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, would not permit us to enter into any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion upon this buſineſs. But, when we were
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030274_1379_0FE579AF45A4C360"/>
next viſited by the <hi>Put-parouchick,</hi> the coolneſs of our reception muſt fully have teſtified our chagrin.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday, the 22d of September, being the anniverſary of the coronation of George the Third, we fired twenty-one guns; and, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the day, prepared as elegant a feaſt as our ſituation would allow of. The arrival of Captain Shmaleff was announced the very moment we were ſitting down to dinner. We were equally pleaſed and ſurprized at this intelligence. Firſt, becauſe he came ſo opportunely to take a ſhare in the feſtivity of the day; and, in the next place, having lately been informed that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a ſevere illneſs had rendered him unequal to the journey. We had the ſatisfaction to hear that this had been merely an excuſe; that, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we were diſtreſſed for tea, ſugar, &amp;c. he was hurt at the idea of coming empty-handed, and therefore had deferred his ſetting out, impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waiting for the arrival of a ſloop from Okotſk; but hearing no intelligence of her, and fearing we ſhould ſail before he had viſited us, he was reſolved to proſecute the journey, though he had nothing to preſent to us but apologies for the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Bolcheretſk.</p>
                     <p>He told us, at the ſame time, that the reaſon of our not having received the black cattle, which we had requeſted to be ſent down, was, that the heavy rains at Verchnei, had abſolutely prevented their ſetting out. So much politeneſs
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030274_1380_0FE57A1AA2F2CAE8"/>
and generoſity demanded the beſt anſwer we were capable of making; and he was, the next day, ſaluted with eleven guns, on coming on board the Reſolution: ſamples and ſpecimens of our curioſities were then preſented to him; to which Captain Gore added a gold watch, and a fowling-piece. He was entertained on board the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the next day, and on the 25th, he returned to Bolcheretſk.</p>
                     <p>No entreaties could prevail on him to extend his viſit, having, as he aſſured us, ſome expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that the ſub-governor-general would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in the ſloop which he expected from Okotſk, as he was then on a tour through all the provinces of the governor-general of Jakutſk. Without any application from us, he re-inſtated the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant in his command, before his departure, having reſolved to take the <hi>Put-parouchick</hi> with him. We alſo underſtood, that he was much offended with him for puniſhing the ſerjeant, as there did not appear to be the ſlighteſt grounds for inflicting ſuch chaſtiſement.</p>
                     <p>Encouraged by the Captain's great readineſs to oblige us, we ventured to requeſt a ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for another inhabitant of Kamtſchatka. It was to requite an honeſt old ſoldier, who kept a kind of open houſe for the inferior officers, and who had done a thouſand good offices, both for them and the whole crew. The Captain obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complied with our wiſhes, and dubbed him
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030274_1381_0FE579A1563B3538"/>
inſtantly a corporal; telling him, at the ſame time, to thank the Engliſh officers for his very great promotion.</p>
                     <p>It may not here be unneceſſary to remark, that the lower claſs of officers in the Ruſſian army, have a greater pre-eminence above the private men than thoſe in the Britiſh ſervice can poſſibly conceive. It was, indeed, a matter of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, to ſee a ſerjeant aſſume all the ſtate, and exact as much homage from thoſe beneath him, as though he had been a field officer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there are ſeveral gradations of rank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, of which other countries are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant; there being no leſs than four inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſteps between a ſerjeant and a private ſoldier; and many conſiderable advantages may probably ariſe from this ſyſtem. Subordinate ranks in the ſea ſervice, are known to produce the moſt ſalutary effects, by creating emulation; and the officers of ſuperior rank are thereby enabled to beſtow an adequate reward on almoſt every poſſible degree of merit.</p>
                     <p>The diſcipline of the Ruſſian army, though ſo extremely remote from the ſeat of government, is remarkable for its ſtrictneſs and ſeverity; not exempting even the commiſſioned officers. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and bread and water diet, is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the latter for inconſiderable offences. A good friend of ours, who was as an enſign in this place, informed us, that the puniſhment he
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030274_1382_0FE57A3976CE2AA8"/>
received for having been concerned in a drunken frolic, was three months impriſonment in the black hole, with bread and water only for his ſubſiſtence; which ſo affected his whole nervous ſyſtem, that he has never ſince enjoyed a ſufficient flow of ſpirits to qualify him for a convivial meeting.</p>
                     <p>Captain King attended Captain Shmaleff as far as the entrance of Awatſka river, and having taken leave of him, embraced that opportunity of viſiting the prieſt of Paratounca. He attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to church on Sunday the 26th, when his whole congregation conſiſted of his own family, three men, and the ſame number of boys, who aſſiſted in the ſinging; and the whole of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was performed with great ſolemnity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                     <p>Though the church is built of wood, it is much ſuperior to any building either in this town, or in that of St. Peter and St. Paul. Among the ſeveral paintings with which it is ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are two pictures of St. Peter and St. Paul, which were preſented by Beering; and which might vie with the firſt European performances in the intrinſic riches of its drapery; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts of it being compoſed of thick plates of real ſolid ſilver, ſo faſhioned as to imitate the foldings of the robes which decorate the figures, and fixed upon the canvaſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:030274_1383_0FE579F7F9D4B3E8"/>Another hunting party was ſet on foot the next day, when Captain King ſubmitted himſelf to the direction of the pariſh clerk, who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great reputation as a bear-hunter. About ſun-ſet they arrived at one of the larger lakes, where it was deemed neceſſary to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much as poſſible: this was eaſily effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among ſome long graſs and bruſh-wood, of which there was great plenty near the water's edge. We had not been long in this ſituation, before our ears were agreeably ſaluted with the growl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bears, in almoſt every quarter round about us; and we ſoon had the pleaſure of beholding one of them in the water, ſwimming in a direct courſe to where we lay concealed. At this time the moon ſhone ſo as to afford a conſiderable light; and, as the animal advanced towards us, three of us fired at it almoſt at the ſame inſtant. Immediately the beaſt turned ſhort upon one ſide, and ſet up a moſt horrible noiſe; which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yelling, growling, nor roaring, but a very extraordinary mixture of the whole three.</p>
                     <p>We could eaſily perceive that the animal was ſeverely wounded, and that it reached the bank with difficulty; whence it retreated to ſome thick buſhes not far diſtant, ſtill continuing to make that dreadful noiſe. The Kamtſchadales ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be mortally wounded, and that it could proceed no farther; but judged it an act of imprudence to attempt to rouſe it again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030274_1384_0FE5799799797FE8"/>
It was then after nine o'clock; and, as the night became over-caſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a change of weather was to be apprehended, we thought it adviſeable to return home, and wait till morning for the gratification of our curioſity; when we accordingly repaired to the ſpot, and found the bear dead from the wounds it had received. It was a female and larger than the ordinary ſize. But, as this account of our hunting party may convey a wrong idea of the method uſually pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in this ſport, a few words may be neceſſary to be added on this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>The natives generally contrive to reach the ground, frequented by the bears; about ſun-ſet. Their firſt buſineſs when they arrive there, is to look out for their tracks, and to attend particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the freſheſt of them; always paying a regard to the ſituation with reſpect to conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and taking aim at the animal as it paſſes by, or as it advances or goes from them. Theſe tracks are numerous between the woods and the lakes, and are often found among the long ſedgy graſs and brakes on the margin of the water. Having determined upon a convenient ſpot for concealment, the hunters fix their crutches in the ground, on which they reſt their firelocks, pointing them in a proper direction. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards kneel or lie down, as the circumſtances of their ſituations may require; and, having their
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030274_1385_0FE5796A8DD7E648"/>
bear-ſpears in readineſs by their ſide, wait the arrival of their game.</p>
                     <p>Theſe precautions are extremely neceſſary, on many accounts, that the hunters may make ſure of their mark: for the price of ammunition is ſo high at Kamtſchatka, that the value of a bear will not purchaſe more of it than will load a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet four or five times. It is much more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial on another conſideration; for, if the firſt ſhot ſhould not render the animal incapable of purſuit, fatal conſequences too frequently enſue. The enraged beaſt makes immedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ly towards the place from whence the ſound and ſmoke iſſue, and furiouſly attacks his adverſaries. They have not ſufficient time to re-load their pieces, as the bear is ſeldom ſired at till he comes within the diſtance of fifteen yards; therefore, if he ſhould not happen to fall, they immediately prepare to receive him upon their ſpears; their ſafety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, in a great meaſure, on their giving him a mortal ſtab as he advances towards them. Should he parry the thruſt, (which theſe animals are ſometimes enabled to do, by the ſtrength and agility of their paws) and break in upon his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, the conflict becomes dreadful, and it is ſeldom that the loſs of a ſingle life will ſatisfy the beaſt's revenge.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs or diverſion of bear-hunting, is particularly dangerous at two ſeaſons of the year: in the ſpring, when they firſt iſſue from their
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030274_1386_0FE579812D394D10"/>
caves, after having ſubſiſted the whole winter (as it is here poſitively aſſerted) ſolely on ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their paws; and eſpecially if the froſt ſhould continue to be ſevere, and the ice in the lakes is not broken up; as they cannot then have recourſe to their cuſtomary and expected food. Thus becoming exceedingly famiſhed, they grow fierce and ſavage in proportion; purſuing the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants by the cent; and, prowling about at a diſtance from their uſual tracks, dart upon them unawares. Under theſe circumſtances, as the natives have no idea of ſhooting flying, or even running, or in any manner without reſting their piece, they often fall a ſacrifice to their rapacity. The time of their copulation, is the other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſeaſon to meet with them; and that is uſually about this time of the year.</p>
                     <p>We have already mentioned a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of natural affection in theſe animals. Many of a ſimilar nature, and equally affecting, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently related by the Kamtſchadales; who, from this circumſtance, derive conſiderable advantage in hunting. They never preſume to ſire at a young bear, if the dam is upon the ſpot; for, if the cub ſhould happen to be killed, ſhe becomes enraged to an immoderate degree; and, if ſhe can only obtain a ſight of the offender, ſhe is ſure to be revenged of him, or die in the attempt. On the other hand, if the mother ſhould be ſhot, the cubs continue by her ſide after ſhe has been
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030274_1387_0FE5794C4D025668"/>
a long time dead; exhibiting, by the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting geſtures and motions, the moſt poignant affliction. The hunters, inſtead of commiſerating their diſtreſſes, embrace theſe opportunities of deſtroying them. If the veracity of the Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadales is to be depended on, the ſagacity of the bears is as extraordinary as their natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p>Innumerable are the ſtories which they relate to this effect. One remarkable inſtance, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we cannot avoid mentioning, as it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted among the natives as a well-atteſted fact. It is the ſtratagem they put in practice to catch the bareins, which run too ſwift for them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſucceſs in purſuing them. Theſe animals herd together in great numbers, and their uſual haunts are low grounds, at the feet of rocks and precipices, where they delight in browſing. The bear purſues them by the ſcent, till he obtains a view of them; and then advances warily, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſituation above them; at the ſame time concealing himſelf among the rocks as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, till he is almoſt immedietely over them, and near enough to carry his purpoſe into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then, with his paws, he puſhes down large pieces of the rock amongſt the herd below. If he perceives that he has ſucceeded in maiming any of the flock, he immediately purſues them, and according to the injury the poor bareins have received, he either proves ſucceſsful in overtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>The Kamtſchadales acknowledge infinite obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the bears, for all the little progreſs they have hitherto made, as well in the ſcience as the polite arts. They confeſs themſelves indebted wholly to thoſe animals for all their knowledge in phyſic and ſurgery; that, by obſerving what herbs they have applied to the wounds they have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what methods they have purſued when they were languid and out of order, they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a knowledge of moſt of thoſe ſimples which they have now recourſe to, either as external or internal applications. But, the moſt ſingular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of all is, that they admit the bears to be their dancing-maſters; though the evidence of our own ſenſes places this matter beyond all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; for, in the bear-dance of the Kamtſchadales, every geſture and attitude peculiar to that animal, was faithfully exhibited. All their other dances are ſimilar to this in many particulars, and thoſe attitudes are thought to come the neareſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which moſt reſemble the motions of the bear.</p>
                     <p>On the 28th of September, Captain King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the ſhips, not a little pleaſed with his excurſion, as it gave him an opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the country, and of obſerving the actions of the Kamtſchadales when they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030274_1389_0FE57957E7CB9F40"/>
no reſtraint, which evidently was not the caſe when they were in the company of the Ruſſians.</p>
                     <p>Nothing worth mentioning occurred till the 30th, when Captain Gore went to Paratounca, in order to have an eſcutcheon put up in the church, which had been prepaired by Mr. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. It had an inſcription on it, mentioning Captain Clerke's age and rank, and the nature of the expedition which he commanded at the time of his deceaſe. To the tree, under which he was interred, a board was affixed with a ſimilar inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on it.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore, before his departure, ordered Captain King to get the ſhips out of the harbour, that they might be in readineſs to ſail. This, however, was prevented, by a violent gale of wind on the 1ſt of October, which continued the whole day; but, on the 2d, both the veſſels warped out of the harbour, and anchored in ſeven fathoms water, about a quarter of a mile from the <hi>oſtrog.</hi> The day before we quitted the harbour the cattle from Verchnei arrived; and, that the men might have the full enjoyment of this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſupply, by eating it whilſt it was freſh, Captain Gore determined to ſtay in the ſame ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion five or ſix days longer.</p>
                     <p>This time was far from being miſapplied, for the pumps, ſails, and rigging of each ſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an additional repair. Captain King, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained permiſſion to uſe the copper belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030274_1390_0FE579CF798115A8"/>
to the Reſolution, and being ſupplied with molaſſes by Captain Gore, was enabled to brew a ſufficient quantity of beer to laſt the crew a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and to make ten additional puncheons of ſtrong ſpruce eſſence. This ſupply was the more acceptable, as our laſt caſk of ſpirits was now ſerving out, except a ſmall quantity reſerved for caſes of emergency.</p>
                     <p>As the 3d of October was the name-day of the Empreſs of Ruſſia, we were perfectly inclined to ſhew it every poſſible reſpect. The prieſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratounca, Ivaſkin, and the ſerjeant, were invited to dine with us; and an entertainment was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the two Toions of Paratounca, and St. Peter and St. Paul; as well as for the inferior officers of the garriſon, and the moſt reſpectable of the Kamtſchadale inhabitants. All the other natives were invited to partake in common with the ſhips companies; a pound of excellent beef being ſerved out to every man, and the remainder of our ſpirits was made into grog, and diſtributed amongſt them. Twenty-one guns were fired upon the occaſion; and, conſidering we were in a very remote part of the Empreſs's dominions, the whole was conducted in a manner not unworthy ſo illuſtrious a character.</p>
                     <p>On the 5th of October, we received a freſh ſupply of tea, ſugar, and tobacco, from Bolche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retſk. Captain Shmaleff having met this preſent on his return, he ſent a letter with it, informing
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030274_1391_0FE5798E63CD6BA8"/>
us that the ſloop from Okotſk had arrived in his abſence, and that Madame Shmaleff had inſtantly diſpatched a courier with theſe few preſents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting our acceptance of them.</p>
                     <p>On the 6th and 7th of October, the appearance of foul weather prevented our unmooring; but on the 8th, we ſailed towards the mouth of the bay, and all the boats were hoiſted in; but our progreſs was ſtopped by the wind veering to the ſouth, which obliged us to drop anchor, the <hi>oſtrog</hi> bearing north, at the diſtance of half a league. The wind blowing from the ſame quarter, and the weather being foggy all the forenoon on the 9th, we continued in our ſtation.</p>
                     <p>At four in the afternoon of the ſame day, we again unmoored; but, whilſt we were raiſing our laſt anchor, we were informed that the drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of marines had fled from the boat, which had juſt left the village, and that he had been lately ſeen with a Kamtſchadale woman, to whom he was known to have been much attached, and who had frequently importuned him to ſtay behind. This man was entirely uſeleſs to us, having been rendered lame by a ſwelling in his knee; and, on that very account, Captain King was the more unwilling to leave him behind, leſt he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a miſerable burthen to himſelf, as well as to the Ruſſians. He therefore applied to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant to ſend parties of his men in purſuit of him; and, in the mean time, the ſailors viſited a well-known
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030274_1392_0FE57A0A8F7CBCA8"/>
haunt of his in the neighbourhood, where the drummer and his woman were found together. On the return of our deſerter, we weighed anchor, and immediately followed the Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>As we have now taken our leave of St. Peter and St. Paul, a particular account of Awatſka bay, and the adjoining coaſt, may not be unacceptable to the reader; as it is perhaps the ſafeſt, and moſt extenſive harbour that has ever been diſcovered; and the only one, in this part of the world, that can admit veſſels of conſiderable burthen. The term bay, properly ſpeaking, is rather inapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a place ſo completely ſheltered as Awatſka; but when it is conſidered how looſe and vague ſome navigators have been, in their denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of certain ſituations of ſea and land, as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, bays, roads, ſounds, &amp;c. we are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently warranted to exchange a popular name, for one that may perhaps ſeem more conſiſtent with propriety.</p>
                     <p>The entrance into Awatſka bay is in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 52° 51′ north, and the longitude of 158° 48′ eaſt. It lies in the bight of another exterior bay, formed by Cape Gavareea to the ſouth, and Cheepooſkoi Noſs to the north. The latter of theſe head-lands bears from the former, north-eaſt by north, and is thirty-two leagues diſtant. From Cape Gavareea to the entrance of Awatſka Bay, the coaſt takes a northerly direction, and extends about eleven leagues. It conſiſts of a
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030274_1393_0FE579B9067D3D58"/>
chain of ragged cliffs and rocks, and, in many parts, preſents an appearance of bays or inlets; but on a nearer view, low ground was ſeen that connected the head-lands.</p>
                     <p>From the entrance of Awatſka bay, Cheepoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkoi Noſs bears eaſt-north-eaſt, diſtant ſeventeen leagues. The ſhore, on this ſide, is flat and low, with hills behind, gradually riſing to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able height. The latitude of Cape Gavareea is 52° 21′.</p>
                     <p>This remarkable difference of the land on the ſides of Awatſka Bay, together with their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent bearings, are very proper guides to ſteer for it, in coming from the ſouthward; and when it is approached from the northward, Cheepoonſkoi Noſs becomes very conſpicuous; it being a high projecting head-land, and is united to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, by a large extent of level ground, lower than the Noſs. Whether viewed from the north or ſouth, it preſents the ſame appearance.</p>
                     <p>We have been rather particular in deſcribing this coaſt, having experienced the want of ſuch a deſcription; for, if we had poſſeſſed a tolerably good account of the form of the coaſt on both ſides of Awatſka Bay, we ſhould, when we firſt viſited it, have arrived there two days ſooner then we did, and conſequently have avoided part of the tempeſtuous weather, which we experienced in plying off the mouth of the harbour. Beſides as the fogs are ſo prevalent in theſe ſeas, it often
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030274_1394_0FE579CC14756188"/>
happens that an obſervation for aſcertaining the latitude cannot be taken. It ſhould alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that land makes a very deceptive appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance when covered with ſnow, or when viewed through an hazy atmoſphere; both which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances prevail here for a conſiderable part of the year, and render it neceſſary for every mariner to be acquainted with as many diſcriminating objects as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>If the weather ſhould happen to be ſufficiently clear to admit a view of the mountains, both on the coaſt and its neighbourhood, the ſituation of Awatſka bay may be preciſely known, by the two high mountains to the ſouth of it. That neareſt the bay is in the form of a ſugar-loaf; the other, which is more inland, is flat at the top, and not quite ſo high. There are three very conſpicuous mountains the north of the bay: that fartheſt to the weſt, appears to be higheſt; the next, which is a <hi>volcano</hi> mountain, may readily be known by the ſmoke iſſuing from its top. The third is the moſt northerly, and might, with ſome propriety, be called a cluſter of mountains, as it preſents ſeveral flat tops to our view.</p>
                     <p>When we got within the capes, and into the eaſtward bay, a light-houſe on a perpendicular head-land, will point out the entrance of the bay of Awatſka to the north. Many ſunken rocks lie to the eaſtward of this head-land, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three miles into the ſea; and which,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030274_1395_0FE57A275A27A9D8"/>
with a moderate ſea or ſwell, will always ſhew themſelves. A ſmall round iſland lies four miles to the ſouth of the entrance, principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of high pointed rocks, one of which is ſtrikingly remarkable, as being larger and more perpendicular than the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The entrance into the bay is, at firſt, about three miles wide, and one mile and an half in the narroweſt part; the length is four miles, in a north-north-weſt direction. A noble baſon, of about twenty-five miles in circumference, lies within the mouth; in which are the harbours of Rakoweena to the eaſt, Tarcinſka to the weſt, and St. Peter and St. Paul to the north.</p>
                     <p>The breadth of Tarcinſka harbour is three miles, and the length about twelve. A narrow neck of land ſeparates it from the ſea at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and it ſtretches to the eaſt-ſouth-eaſt. As far as we ſurveyed, we never found leſs that ſeven fathoms water; but the ice hindered us from getting to the bottom of the harbour.</p>
                     <p>The entrance of the harbour of Rakoweena is impeded by a ſhoal in the middle of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, which, in general, makes it neceſſary to warp in unleſs there ſhould happen to be a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind. Were it not for this circumſtance, this harbour would be preferable to the other two. Its breadth is from one mile to half a mile, and its length three miles, running in a ſouth-eaſt
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030274_1396_0FE57A0C7990E870"/>
and eaſterly direction. It is from thirteen to three fathoms in depth.</p>
                     <p>One of the moſt convenient little harbours we have ſeen, is St. Peter and St. Paul. Half a dozen ſhips may be commodiouſly moored in it, head and ſtern; and it is, in every reſpect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for giving them any kind of repairs. The ſouth ſide of this harbour is formed by a low, narrow, ſandy neck, on which the <hi>oſtrog</hi> is built. The mid-channel is only two hundred and ſeventy feet acroſs, in which there is ſix fathoms and an half water; the deepeſt water within is ſeven fathoms; and all over a muddy bottom. Some inconvenience was, however, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the toughneſs of the ground, which often broke the meſſenger, and made it troubleſome to get the anchors up. At the head of this harbour there is a watering place.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſhoal lying off the eaſtern harbour, and a ſpit within the entrance, ſtretching from the ſouth-weſt ſhore, having only three fathoms water over it. To ſteer clear of the latter, a ſmall iſland, or rather a large detached rock, on the weſt ſhore of the enterance, muſt be ſhut in with the land to the ſouth of it. In order to ſteer clear of the former, the three needle-rocks, near the light-houſe head, on the eaſt ſhore of the entrance, muſt be kept open with the head-lands to the northward of the firſt ſmall bending on the eaſt ſide of the entrance. In entering the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030274_1397_0FE579B12B7CB4A8"/>
of St. Peter and St. Paul, and approaching the village, it is very neceſſary to keep near the eaſtern ſhore, to avoid a ſpit which ſtretches from the head-land, to the ſouth-weſt of the <hi>oſtrog.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The time-keeper on board the Reſolution, which was exactly copied from Mr. Harriſon's, by Mr. Kendal, ſtopped on the 27th of April, a few days before our firſt arrived in Awatſka Bay. During the voyage, it had always been carefully attended to, not having been truſted, even for a moment, into any other hands than thoſe of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cook and Captain King. No accident, therefore, could poſſibly have happened to it, to which its ſtopping could be attributed; nor could it proceed from the operation of intenſe cold, the thermometer being but very little below the freezing point.</p>
                     <p>When the failure of the time-piece was firſt diſcovered, the Captains Clerke and King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted what meaſures they ſhould purſue; whether they ſhould ſuffer it to remain in a uſeleſs ſtate, for the ſatisfaction of the curious at home, where it would certainly be examined by proper judges; or ſubmit it to the inſpection of a ſeaman on board, who had been regularly bred a watch-maker, in London, and who had given many ſatisfactory proofs of his ſkill in that profeſſion, in repairing ſeveral watches upon the voyage.</p>
                     <p>Having experienced the accuracy of this time-piece, we were extremely unwilling to be deprived
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030274_1398_0FE579A2DAA31B68"/>
of its advantages during the remaining part of the voyage; and that object appeared to us of more importance, than the ſmall degree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of deriving any material knowledge with regard to its mechaniſm, by deferring the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of it till our return. Beſides, it ſhould be conſidered, that the watch had already been ſufficiently tried to aſcertain its utility, as well in the former voyage, as during the three years we had now had it on board the Reſolution. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on the firſt clear day after we arrived in Awatſka bay, the time-piece was opened, in the preſence of Captain Clerke and Captain King. No part of the watch appeared to be broken; but, as the watch-maker was not able to make it go, he took off the cock and balance, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pivot-holes, which were extremely foul. The other parts of the work were alſo dirty. He then took off the dial-plate, and found a piece of dirt between two teeth of the wheel which carries the ſecond hand, and attributed its ſtopping principally to this cauſe. After putting the work together, and oiling it very ſparingly, the watch ſeemed to go with freedom and regularity.</p>
                     <p>Captain King having orders to go the next day to Bolcheretſk, the time-keeper was left with Mr. Baily, in order to get its rate by comparing it with his watch and clock; who informed him, on his return, that it had gone very regularly for ſome days, never loſing more than ſeventeen
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030274_1399_0FE57A34D39AB128"/>
ſeconds a day, and afterwards ſtopped again. Upon its being a ſecond time opened, its ſtopping ſeemed to be occaſioned by its having been badly put together on the firſt opening of it. When it was again abjuſted, it gained above a minute a day and the watch-maker broke the balance-ſpring in attempting to alter that and the regulator. He then made a new ſpring, but the watch went ſo irregularly afterwards, that we could make no farther uſe of it. The honeſt man was as much ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At the full and change of the moon, it was high water at thirty-ſix minutes after four; and five feet eight inches was the greateſt riſe. The tides were regular every twelve hours.</p>

                     <p>THE peninſula of Kamtſchatka, is ſituated on the eaſtern coaſt of Aſia, and extends from 52° to 61° north latitude; the longitude of its extremity to the ſouth being 156° 45′ eaſt. The iſthmus, joining it to the continent on the north, lies between the gulphs of Olutorſk and Penſhinſk. Its extremity to the ſouth, is Cape Lopatka; ſo called from its reſembling the blade-bone of a man, which is the ſignification of that word. The whole peninſula is ſomewhat in the form of a ſhoe; and its greateſt breadth is two hundred and thirty-ſix computed miles, being from the mouth of a river Tigil to that of the river Kamtſchatka; and, towards each extremity, it gradually becomes narrower.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:030274_1401_0FE57959D2108EB8"/>On the north, it is bounded by the country of the Koriacks; by the north Pacific Ocean to the ſouth and eaſt; and by the ſea of Okotſk to the weſt. A chain of high mountains, from north to ſouth, extend the whole length of the peninſula, and almoſt equally divide it; whence ſeveral rivers take their riſe, and make their courſe into the Pacific Ocean, and the ſea of Okotſk.</p>
                     <p>The three principal rivers, are the Bolchoireka, or great river; the river Kamtſchatka; and the river Awatſka. The firſt diſcharges itſelf into the ſea of Okotſk, and is navigable for the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian galliots, five leagues from its mouth, or within three leagues of Bolcheretſk, which is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at the conflux of the two rivers, Goltſoffka and the Biſtraia, which are here loſt in the Bolcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ireka. The ſource of the Biſtraia, which is no inconſiderable river, is derived from the ſame mountain as the river Kamtſchatka, but takes quite a contrary courſe; by which means, the Kamtſchadales are enabled to tranſport their goods by water, almoſt acroſs the peninſula.— The river Kamtſchatka continues about three hundred miles, in the direction of ſouth to north; and, after winding round to the eaſtward, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ocean, a little to the ſouthward of Kamtſchatkoi Noſs. To the north-weſt of the mouth of the Kamtſchatka, lies the great lake Nerpitſch; from <hi>nerpi,</hi> a ſeal; that lake abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe animals. A fort, called Niſhnei
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030274_1402_0FE57984A46ACCB8"/>
Kamtſchatka <hi>oſtrog,</hi> is ſituated about twenty miles up the river, where an hoſpital and barracks have been built by the Ruſſians; and this place, we underſtood, is now become the principal mart in the country.</p>
                     <p>The ſource of the Awatſka river, is from the mountains between the Bolchoireka and the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traia. After running two hundred miles, from north-weſt to the ſouth-eaſt, it falls into Awatſka bay. The Tigil is likewiſe a conſiderable river; it riſes amidſt ſome high mountains, parallel with Kamtſchatkoi Noſs, and empties itſelf into the ſea of Okotſk. The other rivers of this peninſula, which are very numerous, are too inconſiderable to be particularly mentioned.</p>
                     <p>If we may judge of its ſoil form its vegetable productions, it appears to be barren in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. Neither about the bay, nor in our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Bolcheretſk, nor in any of our hunting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, did we ever perceive the ſmalleſt ſpot of ground, that had the appearance of a good green turf, or that ſeemed capable of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by cultivation. Stunted trees were thinly ſcattered over the whole face of the country, whoſe bottoms were moffy, with a mixture of low heath, the whole reſembling Newfoundland in a moſt ſtriking degree.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be admitted, however, that we ſaw at Paratounca, three or four ſtacks of moſt excellent hay; and Major Behm aſſured us, that the banks
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030274_1403_0FE57961C3033D80"/>
of the Kamtſchatka, and the Biſtraia, as well as many other parts of the peninſula, produce a quantity of graſs of great ſtrength and height, which is mowed twice in every ſummer; and that the hay is particularly adapted to the fattening of cattle, being of a very ſucculent quality. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, indeed, from the ſize and fatneſs of the thirty-ſix which we received from the Verchnei <hi>oſtrog,</hi> that they muſt have had the advantage of good graſs and hay; for when we were ſupplied with the firſt twenty, it was juſt the cloſe of the winter, the ſnow ſtill remaining on the ground; and probably they had fed only on hay for the ſeven preceding months. This agrees with Kraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheninicoff's account, who relates, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which borders on the river Kamtſchatka, is much ſuperior, in point of fertility, to that of either the north or ſouth. Repeated experiments, he ſays, have been made, in different quarters near this river, in the culture of barley, rye, and oats, which ſeldom failed of ſucceſs; and he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that wheat would grow in many parts, eſpecially near the ſource of the Biſtraia and Kamtſchatka, as well as in moſt countries ſituated in the ſame latitude. The fertility of this part of the country may, perhaps, be occaſioned by its lying in the wideſt part of the peninſula, and, conſequently, at the fartheſt diſtance from the ſea on each ſide: as chilling fogs and drizzling weather generally prevail along the coaſt, and
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030274_1404_0FE579C034DB8268"/>
cannot fail to render the parts adjacent incapable of improvement by agriculture.</p>
                     <p>The ſeverity of the climate, it may naturally be ſuppoſed, muſt be in proportion to the ſterility of the ſoil, of which it is perhaps the cauſe. We firſt ſaw this country in the beginning of May, 1779, when it was covered with ſnow, from ſix to eight feet in depth. On the 6th of May we had ſnow, with the wind from north-eaſt. At noon, on the 8th, the thermometer ſtood at 32°; and ſome of our men were on that day ordered on ſhore, to endeavour to cut wood; but their attempts were fruitleſs, the ſnow ſtill lying ſo deep upon the ground. Nor could they proceed in this neceſſary buſineſs, though tne party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſtout and able fellows, till the 12th; when the thaw gradually advanced. In ſome places, the ſides of the hills were now free from ſnow; and it was principally melted on the low land by the beginning of June. On the 15th of that month, we ſailed out of the harbour: during our ſtay, the winds generally blew from the eaſtward, and the ſouth-eaſt was the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</p>
                     <p>On this 24th of Auguſt, when we returned, the foliage of the trees, and vegatation in general, appeared to be in the height of profection. The weather, during the remainder of that month, and the whole of September, was very change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but not ſevere. At the beginning of the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030274_1405_0FE57A1C8A631A78"/>
month, the winds were, in general, eaſterly; but afterwards got round to the weſt. The thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter's greateſt height was 65°, the loweſt 40°. The greateſt height of the barometer 30°, the loweſt 29° 3′. So that all the month of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a moderate degree of temperature prevailed. But when October began, the new fallen ſnow again covered the tops of the hills, and the wind continued weſterly.</p>
                     <p>In computing the ſeaſons here, ſpring ſhould certainly be omitted. Summer may be ſaid to extend from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> middle of June, till the middle of September; October may be conſidered as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; from which period to the middle of June, it is all dreary winter.</p>
                     <p>The climate, in the country adjacent to the river Kamtſchatka, is ſaid to be as ſerene and temperate, as in many parts of Siberia under the ſame latitude. This, probably, originates from the ſame cauſes, to which the fertility of the ſoil in that part of the country, has been already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed. The ſterility of the ground, however, is not the only conſequence of the unfavourable temperature of the climate. The inhabitants are ſometimes prevented, by the uncertainty of the ſummer ſeaſon, from providing a ſufficient ſtock of dried fiſh, for their food in the winter; and the moiſture of the air occaſions worms to breed in them, which frequently deſtroy, or ſpoil, the greateſt part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="unknown:030274_1406_0FE57A1E0F9E8900"/>We had neither thunder nor lightning during our ſtay at Kamtſchatka, excepting on the night of the eruption of the volcano; and we were told by the inhabitants, that they were not often troubled with either, and never but in a ſlight degree. The ſeverity of winter, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hurricanes of wind and ſnow which attend it, oblige the natives to retire to their ſubteraneous habitations, both for their ſecurity and warmth. We were informed by Major Behm, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency of the winter of 1779, was ſo great, that all intercourſe was ſtopped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>tween the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants for ſeveral weeks, no one daring to ſtir from one habitation to another, ſo fearful were they of being froſt-bitten. The extreme rigour of climate, in ſo low a latitude, may be attributed to its being ſituated to the eaſt of an immenſe uncultivated country, and to the prevalence of the weſterly winds over ſo extenſive and cold a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. The impetuoſity of the winds, may be attributed to the ſubteraneous fires, and ſulphur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous exhalations.</p>
                     <p>Volcanos are numerous in this peninſula; only three of which have lately been ſubject to erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That in the neighbourhood or Awatſka we have already mentioned; and there are others equally remarkable, according to Kraſcheninicoff.</p>
                     <p>The volcano of Tolbatchick is ſituated between the river Kamtſchatka and Tolbatchick, on a neck of land. The eruptions proceed from the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030274_1407_0FE57A200FF0EEC0"/>
ſummit of a high mountain, which terminates in pointed rocks. A whirlwind of flames iſſued from it in the beginning of 1739, which reduced the foreſts of the neighbouring mountains to aſhes. A cloud of ſmoke ſucceeded this, which ſpread darkneſs over the whole country, but was diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by a ſhower of cinders, which covered the earth to the extent of thirty miles. Mr. Kraſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>icoff, who was then travelling from Bolchoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reka to the Kamtſchatka <hi>oſtrog,</hi> and not far from the mountain, ſays, the eruption was preceded by an alarming ſound in the woods, which, he thought, portended ſome dreadful ſtorm or hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane; till three ſucceſſive ſhocks of an earthquake, with only a minute's interval between each, fully convinced him of its real cauſe; but that he was hindered, by the falling of the cinders, from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer the mountain, or from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his journey.</p>
                     <p>On the top of the mountain, of Kamtſchatka, ſuppoſed to be by far the higheſt in the peninſula, is the third volcano. A thick ſmoke inceſſantly aſcends from its ſummit, and it often has erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the moſt dreadful kind; ſome of which were freſh in the memories of the natives, and were frequently ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>Springs of hot water are ſaid to abound in this country. We have ſeen only that at Natcheekin <hi>oſtrog,</hi> which has already been deſcribed. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others are mentioned by Kraſcheninicoff, who
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030274_1408_0FE579C2072010F0"/>
alſo taken notice of two pits or wells, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of which, the water boils with great impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity; a dreadful noiſe iſſuing from them at the ſame time, and ſo thick a vapour, that objects can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcerned through it.</p>
                     <p>Among the principal trees which fell under our notice, are the birch, the poplar, the alder, ſeveral ſmall pieces of the willow, and two ſorts of dwarfiſh cedars. One of theſe ſorts grows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coaſt, ſeldom exceeding two feet in height, and creeping upon the ground. Of this our eſſence for beer was made, and proved to be very proper for the purpoſe: the other, which grows much higher, is found on the mountains, and bears a kind of nut or apple. The old <hi>Toion</hi> at St. Peter and St. Paul informed us, that when Beering lay in that harbour, he taught them the uſe of the decoction of theſe cedars; which proved an admirable remedy for the ſcurvy; but, either from the ſcarcity of ſugar, or ſome other cauſe it is no longer uſed amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Of the birch, which appears to be the moſt common tree, we remarked three ſorts. Two of them were large, and fit for timber, and differed from each other only in the colour and texture of the bark. The third is of a dwarfiſh kind. The natives apply this tree to a variety of uſes. When tapped, it yields a liquor in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, which they drink without mixture, or any kind of preparation, as we frequently obſerved
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030274_1409_0FE5794FB3404510"/>
in our journey to Bolcheretſk. We drank ſome of it ourſelves, and found it pleaſant and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though ſomewhat purgative. They convert the bark into veſſels for their domeſtic purpoſes; and, and from the wood of this tree, are made their ſledges and canoes. Not only the birch, but every other kind of tree in the neighbourhood of the bay, were ſtunted and very ſmall; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are therefore obliged to go to a conſiderable diſtance up the country, to get wood of a proper ſize for their canoes, their <hi>balagans,</hi> and many other purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>Kraſcheninicoff alſo mentions the larch, a tree which grows only on the banks of the river Kamtſchatka; and thoſe which it receives. He alſo ſays, there are firs near the river Berezowa. Likewiſe the ſervice-tree, and two ſpecies of the white thorn.</p>
                     <p>This peninſula produces great abundance of the ſhrub kind, as mountain aſh, junipers, raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry buſhes, and wild roſe-trees. Alſo a variety of berries, as partridge-berries, blew-berries. Theſe are gathered at proper ſeaſons, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by maſhing them into a thick jam. They conſtitute a conſiderable part of their winter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, ſerving as a general ſauce to their dried fiſh. They alſo eat them in puddings, and in various other modes; and make decoctions of them for their common beverage.</p>

                        <pb n="122" facs="unknown:030274_1410_0FE579F61776A720"/>We found great quantities of wholeſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables in a wild ſtate, ſuch as chervil, garlic, onions, angelica, and wild celery. We alſo met with ſome excellent turnips, and turnip-radiſhes, upon a few ſpots of ground in the vallies. This was the utmoſt extent of their garden cultivation; but, it is probable, that many of the hardy ſorts of vegetables will thrive here (particularly thoſe whoſe roots deſcend as carrots, parſnips, &amp;c. Major Behm told us, that many other ſorts of kitchen vegetables had been tried, but without effect; that thoſe of the cabbage or lettuce kind would not head; and that, though beans and peas would grow vigorouſly, and flower and pod, yet the pods would never fill. He alſo told us, that in experiments he made in different ſorts of farinaceous grain, a ſtrong high blade ſprung up, and even produced ears; but the latter never yielded flour.</p>
                     <p>This account of vegetables only relates to ſuch parts of the country, as fell within our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; near the river Kamtſchatka, where, as we have already obſerved, both the ſoil and climate is the beſt in the peninſula, garden culture is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, and perhaps with ſucceſs; for, with the ſecond drove of cattle which we received from Verchnei, we alſo received a preſent of cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, celery, ſome very large turnips, and other garden vegetables.</p>

                           </gap>ium Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katienſe ſtore atro rubende,</hi> by botaniſts. The ſtem grows to the height of about five inches, and is not larger than that of a tulip; towards the bottom, it is of a purple colour, and green higher up. Two tier of leaves iſſue from it, of an oval figure; the lower conſiſting of three leaves, and the uppermoſt of four. A ſingle flower, of a dark red colour, which reſembles that of the narciſſus in ſhape, grows from the top of the ſtalk. It has a bulbous root, like that of garlic, and, like that, has ſeveral cloves hanging together. The plant grows wild, and in great quantities: about the beginning of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, many women are employed in collecting the roots; which, after being dryed in the ſun, are preſerved for uſe. When we arrived the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, it was at the concluſion of this harveſt, which we underſtood had fallen ſhort of its uſual produce. It is a maxim with the Kamtſchadales, that providence never deſerts them, for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are prejudicial to the <hi>ſarana,</hi> are always favourable for fiſhing; and, on the contrary, an unſucceſsful fiſhing month is always amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated by an exuberant <hi>ſarana</hi> harveſt. This article is variouſly employed in cookery. When roaſted in embers, it is a better ſubſtitute for bread than any thing the country produces.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030274_1412_0FE5797518AD5648"/>
When baked in an oven, and pounded, it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the place of flour and meal, and is mixed in all their ſoups, and many of their other diſhes. It is extremely nouriſhing, has a pleaſant bitter flavour, and may be eaten daily without cloying. We partook of theſe roots, boiled in the manner of potatoes, and found them very wholeſome and agreeable. This plant is alſo produced at Oona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſhka, where the roots of it, in like manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a conſiderable part of their food.</p>

                        <hi>Sweet graſs</hi> is the name of the other plant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to; the botanical deſcription of which is, <hi>Heracleum Sibericum foliis pinnatis, foliolis quinis, intermediis ſenſſilibus, corollulis uniformibus.</hi> HORT. UPSAL. 65. It was in the month of May that we took particular notice of it, when it was about eighteen inches in height, ſtrongly reſembled ſedge, and was covered with a kind of white down not unlike the hoar-froſt hanging upon it, and which might eaſily be rubbed off. The taſte of it is as ſweet as that of ſugar, though very hot and pungent. It has a hollow ſtalk, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of three or four joints, with large leaves, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from each. When this plant attains its full growth, it is about ſix feet in height. This plant was formerly a principal ingredient in cookery, amongſt the Kamtſchadales; but, ſince the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has been in the poſſeſſion of the Ruſſians, it has been chiefly appropriated to the purpoſe of diſtilation. It is gathered, prepared, and diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030274_1413_0FE57963A50E9A50"/>
in the following manner. Having cut the ſtalk which have leaves growing on them, and ſcraped the downy ſubſtance from their ſurface, they are placed in ſmall heaps till they begin to heat and ſmell. When dry, they are put into ſacks of matting, where they remain a few days, and are then gradually covered with a ſweet ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charine powder, which exfudes from the hollow of the ſtalk. Only a quarter of a pound of powder is obtained from thirty-ſix pounds of the plant, in this ſtate. The women who conduct this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, find it neceſſary to defend their hands, with gloves, whilſt they are ſcraping the ſtalks, the rind being of ſo acrid a quality, as even to ulcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the part it touches.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate, the ſpirit is drawn from the plant, by the following proceſs. Bundles of it are ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hot water, and its fermentation promoted in a ſmall veſſel, with berries of the <hi>gimoloſt,</hi> or of the <hi>golubitſa;</hi> care being taken to cloſe the mouth of the veſſel, and to keep it in a warm place whilſt it continues to ferment; which is often to ſo violent a degree, as to agitate the veſſel which contains it, and occaſion a conſiderable noiſe. When this firſt liquor is drawn off, more hot water is poured on, and a ſecond made in the ſame manner. Both liquor and herbs are then put into a copper ſtill, and the ſpirit is drawn off in the uſual method. The liquor, thus prepared, is called by the natives <hi>raka,</hi> and has the ſtrength
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030274_1414_0FE579D9C86DDA28"/>
of brandy. Seventy-two pounds of the plant, generally produce twenty-five pints of <hi>raka.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Steller, the ſpirit diſtilled from this plant <hi>unſcraped,</hi> is very pernicious to health, and produces ſudden nervous diſorders.</p>
                     <p>Kraſcheninicoff mentions ſeveral other plants, from which decoctions are prepared; and which, when properly intermingled with their fiſh, make palatable diſhes. Such is the <hi>kipri,</hi> with which a pleaſant beverage is brewed; and, when this plant and the <hi>ſweet-herb</hi> are boiled together, in the proportion of one to five of the latter, and properly fermented, a ſtrong and excellent vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is obtained. The leaves are ſubſtituted for tea; and the pith, when dried, is introduced in many of their diſhes. He alſo mentions the <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovai,</hi> which is not unlike angelica; the <hi>kotkorica,</hi> the root of which is eaten green or dried; the <hi>ikoum,</hi> the <hi>utchichlei,</hi> and ſeveral others.</p>
                     <p>Before the Kamtſchadales were acquainted with fire arms, it is ſaid, they poiſoned their ſpears and arrows with a juice extracted from the root of the zgate; and that death was inevitable to every animal who had received a wound from them. The Tſchutſki are now reported to uſe the ſame drug, and for the very ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The materials of all the manufactures of Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka, according to Kraſcheninicoff, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by three plants. One of them is the <hi>triticum, radice perenni ſpiculis binis lanuginoſis,</hi>

which is exceedingly plentiful along the coaſt. A ſtrong kind of matting is fabricated from the ſtraw of this graſs; which is uſed to cover their floors, as well as for bed-clothes, curtains, ſacks, and many other domeſtic purpoſes. Little bags and baſkets are alſo made of the ſame materials, and are applied to various uſes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>bolotnaia</hi> grows in the marſhes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles <hi>cyperoides.</hi> It is gathered in the autumn, and is carded in the ſame manner as wool, with an inſtrument made of the bones of the ſea-ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. With this manufacture their new-born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are ſwathed, and it is uſed for a covering next the ſkin, after they ceaſe to be infants. A kind of wadding is alſo formed of it, which is uſed to give additional warmth to different parts of their clothing.</p>
                     <p>A vulgar well-known plant remains to be taken notice of, as being more eſſential to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence than all which have been mentioned. It is the nettle; which, as neither hemp nor flax are produced in Kamtſchatka, ſupplies materials for their fiſhing nets; and on which their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence principally depends. For this purpoſe, nettles are uſually cut down in Auguſt, and, after being hung in bundles under their balagans the remainder of the ſummer, they are manufactured like hemp. It is then ſpun into thread with their fingers, and twiſted round a ſpindle; after which
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030274_1416_0FE579D60AF413C0"/>
ſeveral threads may be twined together, if the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which it is deſigned requires it.</p>
                     <p>Many parts of this peninſula would probably admit of ſuch cultivation, as might contribute to the comfort and convenience of the inhabitants; yet, the number of wild animals it produces, muſt always be conſidered as its real riches; and no labour can be ſo productive of advantage, as what is employed upon their furrieries. And next to theſe, the animals that ſupply them are to be conſidered. Theſe are the fox, the <hi>zibeline,</hi> or ſable; the ſtoat, or <hi>ermine</hi>; the <hi>iſatis,</hi> or arctic fox; the earleſs marmot; the varying hare; the weaſel; the glutton or <hi>wolverene;</hi> the wild ſheep; rein-deer; bears; wolves; dogs.</p>
                     <p>The moſt general object of the chace are foxes, with which this country abounds, and among which are a variety of colours. The moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpecies is the ſame as the European, but their colours are more vivid and ſhining. Some are of a dark, cheſnut, others have dark-coloured ſtripes; the bellies of ſome are black, when the other part of the body is of a light cheſnut. Some are a black; others of a dark brown; others of a ſtone-colour; and ſome few are entirely white; the laſt, however, are very ſcarce. The quality of their fur is much ſuperior to that of the ſame animals in Siberia or America. Many artifices are put in practice by the hunters to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. Traps of various kinds are prepared;
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030274_1417_0FE579DE5F3EEAA8"/>
ſome to fall upon them, others to ſecure them by the feet, and others to catch them by the head. Theſe are the moſt common methods of taking them; but they have many ingenious contrivances for catching them in nets. Poiſoned baits are alſo uſed, the <hi>nux vomica</hi> being generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for that purpoſe. Still, however, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal preſerves his character for craftineſs and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in all climates, and upon all occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Before the Kamtſchadales had any knowledge of the Ruſſians, who inſtructed them in the uſe of fire-arms, they carried bows and arrows to the chace; but, ſince that period, almoſt every man amongſt them is provided with a rifle-barrel gun; and, though he cannot uſe it with any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dexterity, he readily acknowledges its ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the former inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>The Kamtſchatka ſables are much larger than thoſe of Siberia, and their fur is thicker and brighter; but thoſe in the neighbourhood of the rivers Olekma and Vitime, are of a finer black. The ſables of the Tigil and Ouka, are ſaid to be the beſt in Kamtſchatka, a pair of theſe being frequently ſold for five pounds ſterling. The worſt are found in the ſouthern extremity.</p>
                     <p>A rifle-barrel gun, of a very ſmall bore, a net and a few bricks, are the whole apparatus of the ſable hunters. With the firſt, they ſometimes ſhoot them, when they are ſeen on the trees; the net is uſed in ſurrounding the hollow trees; in
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030274_1418_0FE57A25D662F500"/>
which they uſually take refuge when purſued; and the bricks are put hot into the cavaties, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to drive them out with the ſmoke.</p>
                     <p>For an account of the <hi>iſatis,</hi> or arctic fox, we muſt refer the reader to Mr. Pennant's Arctic Zoology; the ſkin of this animal is of little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. The varying hare is neglected on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. They are very numerous, and always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfectly white during the winter. In the beginning of May, we obſerved ſeveral of this colour, but they were ſo extremely ſhy, as not to ſuffer us to come within gun-ſhot.</p>
                     <p>The earleſs marmot, or mountain rat, is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful creature, much ſmaller than a ſquirrel; and, like that animal, feeds upon roots and berries; ſitting upon its hind legs whilſt it eats, and holding the food to its mouth with the paws. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſkin is in high eſtimation among the Kamtſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales; being warm, light, and of a bright ſhining hue. Like the plumage of ſome birds, when it is viewed in different lights, it appears to be of various colours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ermine,</hi> or ſtoat, is little regarded here, and conſequently not much attended to by the hunters, its fur being of a very ordinary kind. We obſerved ſeveral of theſe little creatures run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about, and we purchaſed ſome of their ſkins which were of a dirty yellow towards the belly, and the other parts were of a cloudy white. The weaſel is alſo neglected, and on the ſame account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:030274_1419_0FE579E910F9B7E8"/>The ſkin of the <hi>wolverene,</hi> or glutton, on the contrary, is in the higheſt repute; a Kamtſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale looking upon himſelf as moſt ſplendidly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, when a ſmall quantity of this fur appears upon his garment. The women embelliſh their hair with its white pats, which is conſidered as the moſt ſuperlative piece of finery. In ſhort, a ſuperſtitious opinion obtains amongſt them, that the angels are clad with the ſkins of thoſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. This creature, it is ſaid, may be eaſily tamed, and inſtructed in a variety of entertaining tricks.</p>
                     <p>All the bears which we had an opportunity of ſeeing, were of a dun brown colour; they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally appear in a company of four or five together, and are frequently ſeen in the ſeaſon when the fiſh quit the ſea, and puſh, in great quantities, up the rivers. Fiſh is indeed their principal food. In the winter months they are ſeldom viſible. Of the ſkins of bears, warm mattreſſes and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for beds are made; together with comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bonnets, and gloves, and harneſs for the ſledges. The fleſh, eſpecially the fat, is held in great eſtimation.</p>
                     <p>The wolves appear only in the winter, when they are ſaid to prowl about in large companies, in purſuit of prey</p>
                     <p>Rein-deer, both wild and tame, are found in many parts of the peninſula, but none in the neighbourhood of Awatſka. It is remarkable,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030274_1420_0FE57A3B405A1298"/>
that the rein-deer have not been uſed, in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the purpoſes of carriage, as they are by their neighbours to the north and eaſt. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the natives, in their preſent ſtate, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſufficiently ſupplied by their dogs; and the breed of Ruſſian horſes will probably ſupply any future neceſſaries of the country. But as the uſe of dogs, in a great degree, precludes them from the advantage of rearing other domeſtic animals, it appears very extraordinary that they ſhould not have preferred an animal ſo much more powerful and gentle.</p>
                     <p>The wild mountain ſheep, or <hi>argali,</hi> is in great plenty here; an animal unknown in Europe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Corſica and Sardinia. Its ſkin reſembles that of the deer's, but it nearer approaches the goat, in its gait and general appearance. Its head is adorned with two large twiſted horns, which, when the animal is at full growth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times weigh from twenty-five to thirty pounds; and are reſted on the creature's back when it is running. Theſe animals are remarkably ſwift and active, frequent only the moſt craggy and mountainous parts, and traverſe the ſteepeſt rocks with an aſtoniſhing agility. Of their horns, ſpoons, cups, and platters, are fabricated by the natives, who often have one of the latter hanging to a be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030274_1421_0FE579ABE5A632E8"/>
It is extremely beautiful, and its fleſh is ſweet and delicately flavoured.</p>
                     <p>The dogs of this country, as already obſerved, reſemble the Pomeranian in mien and figure; but they are larger, and the hair is conſiderably coarſer. Their colours are various but that which moſt prevails is a light dun, or a pale dirty yellow. The poor animals are all turned looſe, about the latter end of May and are obliged to ſhift for themſelves till the enſuing winter; but never fail to return to their reſpective homes, when the ſnow begins to make its appearance. In the winter, their food conſiſts wholly of the head, back-bones, and entrails of ſalmon; which are preſerved and dried for that purpoſe; and, even with this food, they are very ſcantily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. The dogs muſt certainly be very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, no leſs than five being yoked to a ſingle ſledge, and only one perſon carried in each ſledge. In our journey to Bolcheretſk, we had occaſion for one hundred and thirty-nine, at the two ſtages of Karatchin and Natcheekin. It is obſervable too, that bitches are never employed in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, nor dogs that have been caſtrated. The whelps are trained to the draft, by being faſtened to ſtakes with leathern thongs, which are elaſtic, and having their food placed beyond their reach; and thus, by continually pulling and labouring to obtain a repaſt, they acquire ſtrength, and a
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030274_1422_0FE57A1440229F48"/>
habit of drawing, both of which are eſſentially neceſſary for their deſtined occupation.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt every kind of northern ſea-fowl, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the coaſt and bays of Kamtſchatka: and, among others, the ſea-eagles, but not in great plenty, as at Oonalaſhka. The inland rivers are plentifully ſtored with various ſpecies of wild ducks; one of which, called by the natives <hi>aan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitche,</hi> has a moſt beautiful plumage. Its cry is equally ſingular and agreeable.</p>
                     <p>Another ſpecies is called the mountain-duck, which according to Steller, is peculiar to Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka. The plumage of the drake is ſingularly beautiful. A variety of other water fowl were ſeen, which, from their magnitude, appeared to be of the wild gooſe kind.</p>
                     <p>We obſerved, in paſſing through the woods, ſome eagles of a prodigious ſize, but of what ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we could not poſſibly determine. There are ſaid to be three different kinds. The firſt is the black eagle, with a white head, tail, and legs; the eaglets of which are perfectly white. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is improperly called the white eagle, though in reality, it is of a light grey. The third is the ſtone-coloured eagle, which is a very common ſort. There are great numbers of the hawk, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and buſtard kind, in this peninſula.</p>
                     <p>Woodcocks, ſnipes, and grouſe, are alſo found here. Swans are very numerous, and generally make a part of the repaſt at all public entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030274_1423_0FE5798C8D9D9498"/>
The vaſt abundence of wild fowl, in this country, was ſufficiently manifeſt from the many preſents we received, conſiſting frequently of twenty brace at a time.</p>
                     <p>We ſaw no amphibious animals on the coaſt, except ſeals, which were in extreme plenty about the bay of Awatſka. The others were, at that time, purſuing the ſalmon, that were aſcending the rivers in large ſhoals. Some of them, it is ſaid, follow the fiſh into freſh water, and frequent all the lakes which have a communication with the ſea.</p>
                     <p>The ſea-otters found here and thoſe which we met with at Nootka Sound, are exactly the ſame, and have already been particularly deſcribed. They were formerly in great abundance here; but ſince the Ruſſians have opened a trade with the Chineſe for their ſkins, where they bear a price ſuperior to any other kind of fur, the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been induced to be ſo indefatigable in the purſuit of them, that very few remain in the country. They are ſtill found amongſt the Ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile Iſlands, though the number is inconſiderable; but they are ſuperior in quality to thoſe of Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaka or Nootka Sound. It is ſaid, that hardly a ſea otter is now to be found on Mednoi and Beering's Iſland; though Muller informs us that they were exceedingly plentiful in his time.</p>
                     <p>A great variety of amphibious ſea-animals, are mentioned by the Ruſſian voyages as frequenters
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030274_1424_0FE579904E5ABE60"/>
of theſe coaſts; but as we ſaw no other kinds, this was probably the ſeaſon of their migration.</p>
                     <p>Fiſh is certainly the ſtaple article of food among the inhabitants of this peninſula; who cannot poſſibly derive any conſiderable part of their ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance either from agriculture or cattle. The ſoil, indeed, affords ſome wholeſome roots, and every part of the country produces great quantities of berries; but theſe alone could not poſſibly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the inhabitants; though they are extremely ſalutary, as being proper correctives of the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent quality of their principal diet, dried fiſh. In ſhort, fiſh may here be called the ſtaff of life, with more propriety than bread in any other country; for neither the inhabitants, nor their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic animals of the canine ſpecies, could poſſibly exiſt without it.</p>
                     <p>Whales are frequently ſeen in this country, and, when taken, ſerve for a variety of uſes. Of the ſkins, the inhabitants make the ſoles of their ſhoes, and belts and ſtraps for many other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. The fleſh is eaten, and the fat is preſerved for culinary uſes, and feeding their lamps. The whiſkers are highly ſerviceable for ſewing the ſeams of their canoes; nets are alſo made of them for the larger kind of fiſh, and they ſhoe their ſledges with the under jaw-bones. Knives are formed from many of their bones; and the chains, which faſten the dogs together, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made of the ſame materials, though iron
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030274_1425_0FE5796038DF6320"/>
ones are now generally uſed. After cleaning their inteſtines, drying them, and blowing them like bladders, they depoſit their oil and greaſe in them; and they make excellent ſnares of their nerves and veins; in ſhort, there is no part of the whale that is not uſed in this peninſula.</p>
                     <p>We caught abundance of fine flat fiſh, trout, and herrings, from about the middle of May, till the 24th of June, the time of our departure. At one hawl, on the 15th of May, we dragged out upwards of three hundred flat fiſh, beſides a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of ſea-trout. The former are firm and well-flavoured, ſtudded with prickly knobs upon the back, like turbot, with dark brown ſtreaks, extending from the head towards the tail. The firſt herring ſeaſon commences about the latter end of May. They viſit the coaſt in large ſhoals, but continue there no conſiderable time. They quitted the bay before we ſailed out of it the firſt time, but were returning in October. It has already been remarked, that the herrings here were excellent, and that many of our empty caſks were filled with them. Large quantities of extremely fine cod were taken, ſome of which were alſo ſalted: and we caught, at different times, conſiderable quantities of ſmall fiſh, which had the appearance of ſmelts.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding this abundance of fiſh above-mentioned, it is on the ſalmon fiſhery alone that the inhabitants depend for their winter ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030274_1426_0FE579FE3A2FCC38"/>
On this coaſt, all the ſpecies of theſe that are known to exiſt, are ſaid to be found; and which were formerly characterized by the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times of their aſcending the rivers. It is alſo reported that, though ſhoals of different ſorts are ſeen floating up the rivers at the ſame time, they avoid mixing with each other; that they never fail to return to the river in which they were bred, but not till the third ſummer; that they never live to regain the ſea; that particular ſpecies frequent certain rivers, and are not to be found in others, though the ſea receives them nearly at the ſame place.</p>
                     <p>About the middle of May, the firſt ſhoals of ſalmon enter the mouth of the Awatſka. This kind is called <hi>tchavitſi,</hi> by the Kamtſchadales, and is the largeſt and moſt eſteemed. Three feet and a half is their uſual length; and they are more than proportionally deep; their average weight being from thirty to forty pounds. The back is of a dark blue colour, with black ſpots, and the tail is perfectly ſtraight. In all other reſpects, they reſemble our common ſalmon. They ſwim with ſuch velocity along the river, that the water is greatly agitated by their motion; and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who are ever on the watch for them at their accuſtomed time, are convinced of their approach by this circumſtance, and drop their nets imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before them. One of the firſt that was taken was preſented to us, but not without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030274_1427_0FE579E35A133B60"/>
us that it was the higheſt compliment they could poſſibly confer upon us. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by Kraſcheninicoff, that it was formerly the cuſtom, among the Kamtſchadales, to eat the firſt fiſh they caught, in the midſt of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicings, accompanied with many ſuperſtitious ceremonies; and that, after they became ſubjects of Ruſſia, it was long a matter of contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them who ſhould be entitled to the firſt. Their fiſhing ſeaſon, for this ſpecies, begins about the middle of May, and continues till the end of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>une.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſmaller ſort of ſalmon, weighing from about eight to fifteen pounds, known by the name of the red fiſh, which aſſemble in the bays, and at the mouths of the rivers, early in the month of June. From this time till towards the end of September, vaſt quantities of them are taken upon the eaſtern and weſtern coaſts, where the ſea receives any freſh water; and alſo up the rivers, almoſt to their very ſource. Their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of catching them in the bay of Awatſka, is as follows: One end of the net is faſtened to a large ſtone at the ſide of the water, after which they puſh off about twenty yards in a canoe, dropping their net as they proceed; then they turn, and extend the other part of the net in a line parallel on the ſhore. Thus prepared, they carefully conceal themſelves in the boat, looking earneſtly for the fiſh, which uſually hover ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030274_1428_0FE579941CA11230"/>
the ſhore, and whoſe approach is known by a rippling in the water, till they have proceeded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the boat. At that inſtant, they ſhoot the canoe to ſhore, and are almoſt certain of incloſing their prey. One of theſe nets is generally hawled by two men, with as much facility as our ſeines are managed by a dozen, though our's are much ſmaller. We had very indifferent ſucceſs with our own method of hawling; but after receiving ſome friendly inſtructions from the Kamtſchadales, we were as ſucceſsful as they were. Their mode of fiſhing in the rivers, is to ſhoot one net acroſs and haul another to it down the current.</p>
                     <p>All the lakes which communicate with the ſea, abound with fiſh which have much the appearance of ſalmon, and uſually weigh about five or ſix pounds. The natives, we underſtand, did not think it worth their labour to catch them. Theſe lakes being generally ſhallow, the fiſh become an eaſy prey to the bears and dogs, in the ſummer ſeaſon; and, from the quantities of bones appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the banks, vaſt numbers of them ſeem to have been devoured.</p>
                     <p>The natives dry the principal part of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſalt but very little of it. They cut a fiſh into three pieces; they take off the belly-piece firſt, and then a ſlice along each ſide of the back-bone. The belly-piece, which is eſteemed the beſt, is dried and ſmoked; the other ſlices are dried in the air, and either eaten whole as a

ſubſtitute for bread, or pulverized for paſte and cakes. The head, tail, and bones, are dried and preſerved for their dogs.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Continuation of the general Account of Kamtſchatka —Its Inhabitants conſiſt of three Sorts—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures on their Origin and Deſcent—Kamtſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales diſcovered by the Ruſſians—Atlaſſoff makes the inhabitants tributary—He is diſgraced, and afterwards reſtored—The Kamtſchadales revolt— Great Havock made among them by the Small-Pox —The Ruſſian Government eſtabliſhed in this Country mild and equitable—No Offence puniſhable with death—The Ruſſian Commerce in Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka—Habitations—Dreſs—Account of the Kurile Iſlands, &amp;c.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE inhabitants of Kamtſchatka may be ſaid to conſiſt of three ſorts. The Kamtſcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales; the Ruſſians, and Coſſacks; and a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture produced by their intermarriages. We are informed by Mr. Steller, who was long reſident in this country, and who was indefatigable in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to acquire knowledge on this ſubject, that the Kamtſchadales are people of remote an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and have inhabited this peninſula for many ages; and that they doubtleſs deſcended from the Mungalians: though ſome have imagined they ſprang from the Tonguſian Tartars, and others from the Japaneſe.</p>
                     <p>He endeavours to ſupport theſe opinions by the following arguments: That they have no tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030274_1432_0FE579CD994B2C88"/>
among them of their having migrated from any other country; that they believe they were created on this particular ſpot, by their great god Koutkou, who prefers them to all his other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: that they are the happieſt of beings; and that their country far ſurpaſſes any other; afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means of gratification which cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in other regions. Further to ſupport his opinions, he ſays that they are perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the plants which the peninſula pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, their qualities and their ſeveral uſes; a ſpecies of knowledge of too extenſive a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be acquired in a ſhort time: that their inſtruments and utenſils are totally different from thoſe of any other nation; and are made ſo ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitably neat and dexterous, as to be a ſatisfactory demonſtration that they were invented by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and muſt have been long in arriving at ſuch a pitch of perfection: that before the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians and Coſſacks came amongſt them they had not the moſt diſtant knowledge of any people, except the Koreki: that till very lately, they had not the ſmalleſt intercourſe with the Kuriles, and ſtill later that they had any knowledge of the Japaneſe; that being acquired by means of a veſſel which was ſhipwrecked on their coaſt: and he further adds, that when the Ruſſians firſt got a footing in the country, they found it extremely populous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="145" facs="unknown:030274_1433_0FE5796C8E22FCF0"/>He ſuppoſes them to be deſcended from the Mungalians, from the words in their language having ſimilar terminations to thoſe of the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galian Chineſe; and that, in both languages, the ſame principle of derivation is preſerved: that they are generally ſhort, their complexions ſwarthy, the face broad, the noſe ſhort and flat, the eyes ſmall and ſunk, the legs ſmall, and they have many other peculiarities which are to be obſerved among the Munlgalians. He therefore concludes, that they fled to this peninſula for ſafety from the rapacity of the eaſtern conquerors, as the Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers and others retreated to the extremities of the north, from the advances of the Europeans.</p>
                     <p>The Ruſſians, having made themſelves maſters of that vaſt extent of coaſt of the frozen ſea, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed poſts and colonies, and appointed commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to explore and ſubject the countries ſtill farther to the eaſt. They ſoon diſcovered that the wandering Koriacs inhabited part of the coaſt of the ſea of Okotſk, and they found no difficulty in making them tributary. Theſe being at no great diſtance from the Kamtſchadales, with whom they had frequent intercourſe, a knowledge of Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka muſt naturally follow.</p>
                     <p>To Feodot Alexeieff, a merchant, the honour of the firſt diſcovery is attributed, about the year 1648. That, being ſeparated from ſeven other veſſels by a ſtorm, he was driven upon the coaſt of Kamtſchatka, where he and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030274_1434_0FE579782A236638"/>
remained a whole winter, but they were afterwards cut off by the Koriacs. This was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated, in ſome degree, by Simeon Deſhneff, who was commander of one of the ſeven veſſels, and was driven on ſhore near the mouth of the Anidir. But, as theſe diſcoverers (if they really were ſo) did not live to relate what they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, a coſſac, named Volodimir Atlaſſoff, is the firſt acknowledged diſcoverer of Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka.</p>
                     <p>He was ſent, in 1697, in the capacity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, from fort Jakutſk to the Anadirſk, with directions to call in the Koriacs to his aſſiſtance, in order to diſcover, and make tributary, the countries beyond theirs. With ſixty Ruſſian ſoldiers, and as many coſſacks, he penetrated, in the year 1699, into the heart of the peninſula, and gained the Tigil. In his progreſs he levied a tribute upon furs, and proceeded to the river Kamtſchatka on which he built an <hi>oſtrog,</hi> now called Verchnei; and, leaving a garriſon of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen coſſacks, returned, in the year 1700, to Jakutſk with vaſt quantities of valuable tributary furs. Theſe he very judiciouſly accompanied to Moſcow, and was rewarded for his ſervices by the appointment of commander of the fort of Jakutſk; at the ſame time, received orders to return to Kamtſchatka, with a reinforcement of a hundred coſſacks, ammunition, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might conduce to the completion and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030274_1435_0FE5799608F70370"/>
of his new diſcoveries. Proceeding with his force towards the Anadirſk, he perceived a bark on the river Tunguſka, which proved to be laden with Chineſe merchandize. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately pillaged the veſſel, in conſequence of which the owners remonſtrated to the Ruſſian court; he was ſeized on at Jakutſk, and conducted to a priſon.</p>
                     <p>All this time Potop Serioukoff, whom Atlaſſoff had left, enjoyed the quiet poſſeſſion of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Verchnei; and, though his corps was too inconſiderable to enforce the payment of a tribute from the inhabitants, yet he had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and management to traffic with them as a merchant, on very advantageous terms. His conciliating diſpoſition ſo far gained him the eſteem of the natives of Kamtſchatka, that they lamented his departure, when he ſet off to return to the Anadirſk. He and his party were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, attacked by the Koriacs, and unfortunately cut off in the year 1703. Several other commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries were ſucceſſively ſent in to Kamtſchatka, during the diſgrace and trial of Atlaſſoff.</p>
                     <p>Atlaſſoff was reſtored to his command in 1706, and entruſted with the management of a ſecond expedition into Kamtſchatka, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived inſtructions to ingratiate himſelf into the favour of the natives by all peaceable and amicable means; but, on no conſideration, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to compulſive meaſures; but, ſo far from
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030274_1436_0FE57A163245FAD8"/>
paying any attention to theſe inſtructions, he rendered the natives extremely hoſtile to their new governors, by repeated acts of cruelty and injuſtice; and even alienated the affections of his, own people, inſomuch that it created a mutiny of the coſſacks, who demanded a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</p>
                     <p>The coſſacks, having ſucceeded in diſplacing Atlaſſoff, took poſſeſſion of his effects; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taſted the ſweets of plunder, and living with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcipline or controul, his ſucceſſors were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reduce them to order and ſubjection. No leſs than three ſucceſſive commanders were aſſaſſinated. From that period, to the grand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the Kamtſchadales in 1731, the hiſtory of this country preſents an unvaried detail of revolts, maſſacres, and murders, in every part of the peninſula.</p>
                     <p>This revolt was principally occaſioned by the diſcovery of a paſſage from Okotſk, to the river Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>choireka, made by Coſmo So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oloff. The Ruſſians, before this period, could enter this country only on the ſide of the Anadirſk; which afforded frequent opportunities to the natives of plundering the tribute, as it was conveyed out of the peninſula by ſo long a journey. But, when this communication was diſcovered, the tribute could be exported with ſpeed and ſafety; and troops and military ſtores might now be imported into the very heart of the country. The natives
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030274_1437_0FE57A3EA551E8C8"/>
were convinced that this circumſtance would give the Ruſſians ſo great an advantage over them, as muſt very ſhortly confirm their dominion; and therefore they immediately reſolved to make one grand effort for their liberty.</p>
                     <p>Beering had, at this time, a ſmall ſquadron on the coaſt, and had diſpatched what troops could be ſpared from the country, to join Powlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tſki, in an expedition againſt the Tſchutſki. The time determined on, therefore, for carrying their plan into execution, was when Beering ſhould have ſet ſail. This was certainly a well-choſen opportunity; and it is matter of aſtoniſhment, that, notwithſtaning this conſpiracy was ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that every native is ſaid to have had his ſhare in it, the whole was conducted with ſuch ſecrecy, that the Ruſſians had no ſuſpicion that any hoſtile meaſures were meditating againſt them.</p>
                     <p>They were equally judicious in planning their other operations. A ſtrong body was in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prevent any communication with the fort Anadirſk, and detached parties were ſcattered on the eaſtein coaſt, in order to ſeize any Ruſſians that might accidentally arrive from Okotſk. Things were thus ſituated, when Cheekhaerdin, (who was then commiſſary) was eſcorted by the troops of the fort, with his tribute, from Verchnei to the mouth of the river Kamtſcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ka, where a
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030274_1438_0FE579FCB4069698"/>
veſſel was to remove it, and convey it to the Anadir.</p>
                     <p>It was further reſoved on, that the revolt ſhould not commence, till this veſſel ſhould be out at ſea; and ſuch reſolution was communicated to the different chiefs. In conſequence of which the moment ſhe diſappeared, a moſt dreadful maſſacre began. Every Ruſſian and Coſſack that could be found, was immediately put to death, and their habitations were reduced to aſhes. A large party of them aſcended the river Kamtſchatka, took poſſeſſion of the fort and <hi>oſtrog,</hi> which had juſt been quitted by the commiſſary, and ſlew all that were in it; and all the buildings were conſumed by fire, the fort and church only excepted. Here they received information that the Ruſſian veſſel which had got the commiſſary on board, was ſtill remaining on the coaſt, and therefore reſolved to defend themſelves in the fort.</p>
                     <p>Fortunately the veſſel was drived back to the harbour; for, had ſhe proſecuted her voyage, the utter extirpation of the Ruſſians muſt have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. The Coſſacks, on their landing, finding that their wives and children had been murdered, and their habitations conſumed by fire, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged almoſt to madneſs. They proceeded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the fort, and attacked it moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; the natives defending it with equal reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. The powder magazins at length took
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030274_1439_0FE579EB214FE888"/>
fire, the fort was blown up, and, with it, almoſt every man that was in it. Various rencounters and aſſaſſinations ſucceeded this event; till, at length, two of the leaders being ſlain, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (firſt diſpatching his wife and children) hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put a period to his own exiſtence, peace was again eſtabliſhed. From that period, no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſturbances happened till 1740, when a few Ruſſians were ſlain in a tumult, but no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſequences enſued; and every thing has ſince gone on very peaceably, excepting the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at Bolceretſk, which has been already mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Though a great many of the inhabitants were loſt, in quelling the rebellion of 1731, the country had afterwards recovered itſelf, and was become as populous as ever in 1767; when the ſmall-pox was, for the firſt time, introduced among them, by a ſoldier from Okotſk. It broke out with much fury, and was as dreadful in its progreſs as the plague; ſeeming almoſt to threaten their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire extirpation. Twenty thouſand were ſuppoſed to have died by this filthy diſorder in Kamtſchat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka, the Kurile iſlands, and the Koreki country. The inhabitants of whole villages were ſometimes ſwept away; of which ſufficient proof rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ins. There are eight <hi>oſtrogs</hi> about the bay of Awatſka, which we were told had been completely inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but now they are all become deſolate, except St. Peter and St. Paul; and only ſeven Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadales,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030274_1440_0FE5798691992850"/>
who are tributary, reſide in that. At the <hi>oſtrog</hi> of Paratounca, no more than thirty-ſix native inhabitants remain, including men, women, and children; though it contained three hundred and ſixty before it was viſited by the ſmall-pox. We paſſed no leſs than four extenſive <hi>oſtrogs,</hi> in our journey to Bolcheretſk, which had not a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant in either of them. The number of the natives is now ſo much diminiſhed, and ſo many Ruſſians and Coſſacks are continually pouring in upon them, and intermixing with them by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that, it is probable, very few of them will be left in leſs than half a century. We were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Major Behm, that thoſe who at this time pay tribute, do not exceed three thouſand, including the Kurile iſlanders.</p>
                     <p>The number of military in the five forts of Nichnei, Verchnei, Tigil, Bolcheretſk, and St. Peter and St. Paul, are about four hundred, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Ruſſians and Coſſacks. Nearly the ſame number are ſaid to be at Ingiga; which, though in the north of the peninſula, is under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of Kamtſchatka. The Ruſſian traders and emigrants are not very conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>The government eſtabliſhed over this country by the Ruſſians, conſidered as a military one, is remarkably mild and equitable. The natives are ſuffered to elect their own magiſtrates in their own mode, who exerciſe the ſame powers they have ever been accuſtomed to. One of theſe,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030274_1441_0FE5797A714D2B88"/>
called a <hi>Toion,</hi> preſides over each <hi>oſtrog,</hi> to whom all differences are referred; and who awards fines and puniſhments for all offences and miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; referring to the governor of Kamtſchatka, thoſe who are the moſt intricate and enormous, not chooſing to decide upon them himſelf. The <hi>Toion</hi> alſo appoints a civil officer under him, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a corporal, who aſſiſts him in his duty, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates for him in his abſence.</p>
                     <p>An edict has been iſſued by the empreſs of Ruſſia, that no offence ſhall be puniſhable with death. But we were told, that, in caſes of murder (which rarely happens here) the <hi>knout</hi> is inflicted with ſuch ſeverity, that the offender ſeldom ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>In ſome diſtricts, the only tribute that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, is a fox's ſkin; in others, a ſable's; and, in the Kurile iſles, a ſea otter's; but, as the latter is conſiderably more valuable, the tribute of ſeveral perſons is paid with a ſingle ſkin. The tribute is collected by the <hi>Toions,</hi> in the different diſtricts, and is ſo inconſiderable, as hardly to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any other light, than as an acknowledgment of the Ruſſian dominion over them.</p>
                     <p>The Ruſſians are not only to be commended for the mildneſs of their government, but are alſo entitled to applauſe for their ſucceſsful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in converting the natives to Chriſtianity; there being now but very few idolaters remaining among them. If we form a judgment of the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030274_1442_0FE579BAE974C718"/>
other miſſionaries, from the benevolent paſtor of Paratounca, more ſuitable perſons could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be engaged in this buſineſs. It may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that the religion inculcated here, is that of the Greek Church. In many of the <hi>oſtrogs,</hi> free-ſchools are eſtabliſhed, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the natives and Coſſacks in the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian language.</p>
                     <p>The articles exported from this country, conſiſt entirely of furs, and this buſineſs is principally conducted by a company of merchants, appointed by the empreſs. Twelve was the number of them originally, but three have ſince been added to them. Beſides certain privileges allowed them, they are diſtinguiſhed by wearing a gold medal, expreſſive of the empreſs's protection of the fur trade. There are other inferior traders, chiefly Coſſacks, in different parts of the country. Whilſt the principal merchants remain here, they reſide either at Bolcheretſk, or the Niſhnei <hi>oſtrog;</hi> the trade centering entirely in thoſe two places. This buſineſs was formerly carried on wholly in the way of barter, but every article is at preſent purchaſed with ready money, no inconſiderable quantity of ſpecie being circulated in that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed country. The furs produce a high price; and the natives, from their mode of life, require few articles in return. Our ſailors brought a quantity of furs from the coaſt of America, and were both pleaſed and aſtoniſhed on receiving
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030274_1443_0FE579ECA602BA68"/>
ſuch a quantity of ſilver for them from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; but as they could not purchaſe gin or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco with it, or any thing elſe that would afford them any degree of entertainment, the roubles were ſoon conſidered as troubleſome companions, and they were frequently employed in kicking them about the deck. Our men received thirty roubles of a merchant, for a ſea-otter's ſkin, and in the ſame proportion for others; but, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they had great quantities to diſpoſe of, and perceiving that they were unacquainted with traffic, he afterwards procured them at a much cheaper rate.</p>
                     <p>European articles are the principal that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, but they are not ſolely confined to Ruſſian manufactures. They come from England, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Siberia, Bucharia, the Calmucks, and China. They chiefly conſiſt of coarſe woollen and linen cloths, ſtockings, bonnets, and gloves; thin Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian ſilks, pieces of nankeen, cottons, hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, both of ſilk and cotton; iron ſtoves, braſs and copper pans, files, guns, powder and ſhot; hatchets, knives, looking-glaſſes, ſugar, flour, boots, &amp;c. We ſaw many of theſe articles in the poſſeſſion of one of the merchants, who came from Okotſk in the empreſs's galliot. Theſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, we obſerved, ſold for three times the ſum- they might have been purchaſed for in England. And, notwithſtanding the merchants have ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant a profit upon theſe imported goods,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030274_1444_0FE57A090932EF48"/>
they receive ſtill a greater advantage from the ſale of the furs at Kiachta, a conſiderable market for them on the frontiers of China. In Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka, the beſt ſea-otter ſkins uſually produce about thirty roubles a-piece; at Kiachta, the Chineſe merchant gives more than double that price, and diſpoſes of them again at Pekin, for a much greater ſum; after which, an aditional profit is made of many of them at Japan. If, then, the original value of a ſkin at Kamtſchatka is thirty roubles, and it is afterwards traſported to Okotſk, thence by land thirteen hundred and ſixty-four miles to Kiachta, thence ſeven hundred and ſixty miles to Pekin, and after that to be tranſported to Japan, what a lucrative trade might be eſtabliſhed between Kamtſchatka and Japan, which is not above three weeks ſail from it, at the utmoſt?</p>
                     <p>Furs of all kinds, exported from Kamtſchatka acroſs the ſea of Okotſk, pay ten <hi>per cent.</hi> duty, and ſables twelve. And merchandiſe of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, imported from Okotſk, pay a duty of half a rouble for every pood, which is thirty-ſix Fngliſh pounds.</p>
                     <p>The export and import duties are paid at Okotſk; but the tribute which is collected at Bolcheretſk, amounts to the annual ſum of ten thouſand roubles, as we were informed by Major Behm.</p>

About four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen veſſels are alſo employed by the merchants in the fur trade, among the iſlands to the eaſt. In the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul, we ſaw one of theſe froxen up, which was to ſail to Oona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſhka when the ſeaſon would permit.</p>
                     <p>It may be neceſſary to obſerve, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and moſt valuable part the fur trade, lies among the iſlands between Kamſchatka and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Beering firſt diſcovered theſe in 1741, and as they were found to abound with ſea-otters, the Ruſſian merchants ſought anxiouſly for the other iſlands ſeen by that navigator, ſouth-eaſt of Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka, named in Muller's map, the iſlands of St. Abraham, Seduction, &amp;c. They fell in with no leſs than three groups of iſlands, in theſe expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The firſt, about fifteen degrees eaſt of Kamtſchatka; another, twelve degrees eaſt of the former; and a third, Oonalaſhka, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring iſlands.</p>
                     <p>Theſe mercantile adventurers alſo proceeded as far as Shumagin's Iſlands, of which Kodiak is the
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030274_1446_0FE579F28E8E6120"/>
largeſt. But here they met with ſo warm a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for attempting to compel the payment of a tribute, that they never ventured ſo far again. The three groups before-mentioned, however, were made tributary. The whole ſea between Kamtſchatka and America is, according to the Ruſſian charts, covered with iſlands; for, as thoſe who were engaged in theſe expeditions, frequently fell in with land, which they ſuppoſed did not tally with the ſituation laid down by preceding adventurers, they immediately ſuppoſed it to be a new diſcovery, and reported it accordingly on their return; and, as theſe veſſels were uſually out three or four years, and ſometimes longer, ſuch miſtakes could not immediately be rectified. It is pretty certain, however, that only thoſe iſlands which have been enumerated, have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in that ſea, by the Ruſſians, ſouth of 6° latitude.</p>
                     <p>The ſea-otter skins which are certainly the moſt valuable article in the fur trade, are principally drawn from theſe iſlands; which being now under the Ruſſian dominion, the merchants have factors reſiding in ſettlements there, for the ſole purpoſe of bartering with the natives. To extend this trade, an expedition was fitted out by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty of Okotſk, to make diſcoveries to the north and north-eaſt of the above mentioned iſlands, and the command of it given to Lieutenant Synd.

The Ruſſians have not ſince undertaken any expedition for making diſcoveries to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but they will, probably, make an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous uſe of our diſcovery of Cook's river. Notwithſtanding the general intercourſe between the natives, the Ruſſians, and Coſſacks, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are as much diſtinguiſhed from the latter by their habits and diſpoſition, as by their features and general figure.</p>
                     <p>The perſons of the natives having already been deſcribed, we ſhall only add, that, in their ſtature, they are below the common height, which Major Behm attributes to their marrying ſo very early; both ſexes uſually engage in the conjugal ſtate, at thirteen or fourteen years of age. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly induſtrious, and may he properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted with the Ruſſians and Coſſacks, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently intermarry with them, apparently for no other reaſon, but that they may be ſupported in lazineſs and ſloth. To this inactivity, may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed thoſe ſcorbutic complaints, which moſt of them are dreadfully afflicted with; whilſt the natives, who exerciſe in the open air, entirely eſcape them.</p>
                     <p>Their habitations conſiſt of three diſtinct ſorts; their <hi>jourts, balagons,</hi> and <hi>log-houſes,</hi> which are
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030274_1449_0FE579D7906BD3B0"/>
here called iſbas; they inhabit the firſt in the winter, and the ſecond in the ſummer; the third are introduced by the Ruſſians, wherein only the wealthier people reſide. The <hi>jourts</hi> are thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. A kind of oblong ſquare is dug about ſix feet deep in the earth; the dimenſions muſt be proportioned to the numbers who are to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit it, for it is uſual for ſeveral to live together in the ſame <hi>jourt.</hi> Strong wooden poſts, or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, are faſtened in the ground, at equal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances from each other, on which the beams in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſupport the roof, are extended; which is formed by joiſts, one end of which reſt upon the ground, and the other on the beams.

A hole, ſerving for a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, window, and door, is left in the center, and the inhabitants go in and out by the aſſiſtance of a long pole, having notches deep enough to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a little ſecurity for the toe. On the ſide, and even with the ground, there is another entrance, appropriated to the uſe of the women; but if a man paſſes in or out of this door, he becomes as much an object of ridicule, as a ſailor who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends through lubber's hole.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>jourt</hi> conſiſts of one apartment, forming an oblong ſquare. Broad platforms, made of boards are extended along the ſides, at the height of

about ſix inches from the ground; which ſerve them for ſitting on, and on which they repoſed; firſt taking care to cover them with mats and ſkins. The fire-place is on one ſide, and, on the other, their proviſions and culinary utenſils ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They generally retire to their <hi>jourts</hi> about the middle of October, and continue in them till the month of May is more than half expired.</p>
                     <p>To erect a <hi>balagan,</hi> nine poſts are fixed into the earth, in three regular rows, at equal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances from each other, to the height of about twelve or thirteen feet from the ſurface. About ten feet from the ground, rafters are laid from poſt to poſt, and ſecurely faſtened by ſtrong ropes. The joiſts are laid upon theſe rafters, and a turf covering completes the platform or floor of the balagan. A roof of a conical figure is raiſed upon this, by means of long poles, which are faſtened to the rafters at one end, and meet together in a point at the top. The whole is covered, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thatched, with a coarſe kind of graſs. Theſe ſummer habitations have two doors, placed directly oppoſite to each other, to which they aſcend by the ſame kind of ladders that are uſed

in the <hi>jourts.</hi> In the lower parts, which is left entirely open, they dry their fiſh, vegetables, and other articles intended for the conſumption of the winter. Though ſix families uſually live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one jourt, a <hi>balagan</hi> is ſeldom occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by more than one at a time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>iſbas,</hi> or log-houſes, are thus erected: Long timbers are piled horizontally, with the ends let into each other, and the ſeams are filled up or caulked with moſs. Like thoſe of our common cottages, the roof is ſlooping, and thatched either with graſs or ruſhes. Each log-houſe has three apartments in the inſide. One end may be ſaid to be a kind of entry, which extends the whole width and height of the houſe, and ſeems to be a kind of receptacle for their bulky articles, as ſledges, harneſs, &amp;c. This has a communication with their beſt apartment, which is in the middle, and is furniſhed with broad benches, calculated both for eating and ſleeping upon. A door leads from this into the kitchen, almoſt half of which is taken up with an oven, or fire-place; which is let into the wall that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the middle apartment and the kitchen, and is ſo conſtructed as to communicate the heat to both rooms at the ſame time. There are two lofts over the kitchen and middle apartment, to which the inhabitants aſcend by a ladder placed in the entry for that purpoſe. Each apartment has two ſmall windows made of <hi>talc,</hi> and, among
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030274_1452_0FE5796E13FAFD80"/>
the inferior people, of fiſh-ſkin. The boards and beams of their habitations, are ſmoothed only with a hatchet, for they are ſtrangers to the plane; and the ſmoke has rendered them of a deep ſhining black.</p>
                     <p>A town is called an <hi>oſtrong</hi> in Kamtſchatka, and conſiſts of ſeveral houſes or habitations of the various kinds above-mentioned. <hi>Balagans</hi> are conſiderably the moſt numerous; and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that we never ſaw a houſe of any kind that was detached from an <hi>oſtrong.</hi> There are, in St. Peter and St. Paul, ſeven log houſes, nineteen <hi>balagans,</hi> and three jourts; Paratounca is nearly of the ſame ſize, Karatchin and Natcheedin have not ſo many log-houſes as the former, but rather more <hi>balagans</hi> and <hi>jourts</hi>; whence may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that ſuch is the moſt general ſize of an <hi>oſtrong.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The dreſs of the Kamtſchadale women having already been deſcribed, we ſhall proceed to that of the men. The upper garment reſembles that of a waggoner's frock. If for ſummer wear, it is made of nankeen; if intended for winter, it is made of a ſkin, (generally that of a deer or dog) having one ſide tanned, and the hair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on the other, which is worn innermoſt. A cloſe jacket of nankeen, or ſome other cotton ſtuff, is the next under this; and beneath that, a ſhirt made of a thin Perſian ſilk, of a red, blue, or yellow colour. They wear alſo a pair of long
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030274_1453_0FE579D4593F8040"/>
breeches, or tight trowſers, of leather, reaching below the calf of the leg. They have likewiſe a pair of boots, made of dog or deer ſkin, with the hair innermoſt. They have a fur cap, having two flaps that are uſually tied up cloſe to the head, but are permitted to fall round the ſhoulders in bad weather.</p>
                     <p>The fur dreſs, which was preſented by Major Behm's ſon to Captain King, is one of thoſe worn on ceremonious occaſions by the <hi>Toions.</hi> It is ſhaped like the exterior garment we have juſt deſcribed, and conſiſts of ſmall triangular pieces of fur, chequered brown and white, and ſo ingeniouſly joined as to appear to be of the ſame ſkin. A border, of the breadth of ſix inches, curiouſly wrought with different coloured threads of lerther, ſurrounds the bottom, and produces a rich effect. A broad edging of the ſea otter's ſkin is ſuſpended to this. The ſleeves are ornamented with the ſame materials. An edging of it alſo encircles the neck, and ſurrounds the opening at the breaſt. It is lined with a beautiful white ſkin. And the preſent was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a pair of gloves, a cap, and a pair of boots, executed with the utmoſt neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and compoſed of the ſame materials. The Ruſſians who reſide in Kamtſchatka, wear the European dreſs; and the uniform worn by the troops here, is of a dark green turned up with red. The people, ſituated to the north and ſouth
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:030274_1454_0FE57989E38EEF90"/>
of this country, being but imperfectly known, we ſhall give ſuch information as we have been able to acquire, reſpecting the Kurile iſlands, and the Koreki and Tſchutſki.</p>
                     <p>The Kuriles are a chain of iſlands, extending from latitude 51° to 45°, running from the ſouthern promontory of Kamtſchatka to Japan, in a ſouth-weſt direction. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood of Lopatka, who were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves called Kuriles, gave theſe iſlands the ſame name, as ſoon as they became acquainted with them. Spanberg ſays they are twenty-two in number, excluſive of the very ſmall ones. The northernmoſt iſland, which is called Shoomſka, is about three leagues diſtant from the promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Lopatka, its inhabitants conſiſting of a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of natives and Kamtſchadales. The next which is named Paramouſir, is conſiderably larger than Shoomſka, and is inhabited by the real na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; whoſe anceſtors, they ſay, came from an iſland, called Onecutan, a little farther to the ſouth. The Ruſſians paid their firſt viſit to theſe two iſlands in 1713, and added it to the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Empreſs. The others, as far as Ooſheſheer incluſive, are now made tributary, if we may rely upon the information of the worthy paſtor of Paratounca, their miſſionary; who pays them a viſit once in three years, and mentions the iſlanders in the moſt reſpectable terms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling them for their generoſity, hoſpitality, and
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:030274_1455_0FE579ADC047E258"/>
humanity; and that they excel their Kamtſchadale neighbours as much in the gracefulneſs of their perſons, as in their docility and underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Though the iſland of Ooſheſheer is the fartheſt to the ſouth, of any under the dominion of Ruſſia, yet they are ſaid to trade to Ooroop, which is the eighteenth in order; and is the only one that has a good harbour for veſſels of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Nadeegſda lies to the ſouth of this, and is ſaid to be inhabited by a race of men who are remarkably hairy, and who live in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect independence, like thoſe of Ooroop<note n="*" place="bottom">Spanberg, ſpeaking of theſe people, ſays, their bodies are covered all over with hair, that they wear a looſe ſtriped ſilk gown, and many of them have ſilver rings pendant from the ears. Their being hairy all over the body, is alſo mentioned in the journal of the ſhip C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Nearly in the ſame direction, lie a group of iſlands, called J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſo, by the Japaneſe; a name alſo given by them to the chain of iſlands between Kamtſchatka and Japan. That called Matmai, which is the furtheſt to the ſouth, belongs to the Japaneſe, and has a garriſon and fortifications on the ſide towards the continent. The iſlanders of Kunachir, and Zellany, to the north-eaſt of Matmai, and three others, called the Three Siſters, ſtill farther to the north-eaſt, are entirely independent. The inhabitants of Matmai barter with thoſe of the iſlands laſt mentioned, as well as with thoſe of the Kuriles to the northward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="unknown:030274_1456_0FE57A32D9C824B8"/>Many of the inhabitants of thoſe iſlands that are under the dominion of Ruſſia are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to chriſtianity. And perhaps the time is not far diſtant, when all advantageous commerce will be carried on between Kamtſchatka and this extenſive chain of iſlands, which may afterwards produce a communication with Japan itſelf. This intercourſe may probably be facilitated by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which Major Behm related, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ruſſians, having been taught the Japaneſe language, by two natives of that country, who had been ſhipwrecked on the coaſt of Kampt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatka, had been ſent among thoſe iſlands. The advantages that muſt infallibly accrue to the Ruſſians, by eſtabliſhing a commerce, with the Japaneſe have been already adverted to, and are ſufficiently obvious.</p>
                     <p>The Koreki country conſiſts of two diſtinct nations, which are called the wandering and fixed Koriacs. Part of the iſthmus of Kamtſchtka is inhabited by the former, as well as all the coaſt of the Eaſtern Ocean, from thence to the Anadir. The nation of the wandering Koriacs extends weſtwards towards the river Kovyma, and along the north-eaſt of the ſea of Okotſk, as far as the river Penſkina.</p>
                     <p>The reſemblance between the fixed Koriacs and the Kamtſchadales, is very ſtriking; both countries too depend alike on fiſhing for ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030274_1457_0FE57A1083AFD518"/>
Their clothing and habitations are equally ſimilar. The fixed Koriacs are under the diſtrict of the Ingiga, and are tributary to Ruſſia.</p>
                     <p>The wandering Koriacs are wholly employed in breeding and paſturing deer, and are ſaid to have immenſe numbers in their poſſeſſion; it being common for a ſingle chief to have a herd of four or five thouſand. Deer is the food they ſubſiſt upon, and have an averſion to every kind of fiſh. They erect no <hi>balagans;</hi> their only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations being ſomewhat like the Kamtſchadale <hi>jourts,</hi> except that, in winter, they are covered with raw deer-ſkins; and, in ſummer, with ſuch as have been tanned. Their ſledges are drawn only by deer, and thoſe which are uſed in drawing them feed in the ſame paſture with the others. If they are wanted, the herdſman makes uſe of a certain cry which is familiar to them, which they obey quitting the herd immediately. The two nations of the Koriacs, (as we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the prieſt of Paratounca) and the Tſchutſki, make uſe of different dialects of the ſame language; but it has not the ſmalleſt affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to that of the Kamtſchadale.</p>
                     <p>The country inhabited by the Tſchutſki, is bounded by the Anadir on the ſouth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the Tſchutſkoi Noſs. Their attention, like that of the wandering Koriacs, confined chiefly to their deer, with which their country
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:030274_1458_0FE57A4473E6A6D0"/>
abounds. They are a courageous, well-made, warlike race of people; and are formidable neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to the Koriacs of both nations who often experience their depredations. The Ruſſians have long endeavoured to bring them under their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and though they have loſt a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men in their different expeditions to; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this purpoſe, they have never yet been able to effect it.</p>

                     <p>AS the Lords of the Admiralty, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which they had given for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the preſent voyage, had entruſted the
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:030274_1460_0FE548E7D5592620"/>
commanding officer of the expedition with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary power, in caſe of not ſucceeding in the diſcovery of a paſſage from the Pacific Ocean into the Atlantic, to make choice, in his return to England, of whatever route he ſhould judge beſt adapted for the improvement of geography; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gore deſired, that the principal officers would deliver their ſentiments, in writing, relative to the mode in which theſe inſtructions might moſt effectually be carried into execution. The reſult of their opinions, which, to his great ſatisfaction, he found unanimous, and perfectly agreeing with his own, was, that the condition of our veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, of the ſails, cordage, &amp;c. rendered it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous and unſafe to make any attempt, as the winter was now approaching, to navigate the ſea between Aſia and Japan, which would otherwiſe have opened to us the moſt copious field for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: that it was therefore moſt prudent to ſteer to the eaſtward of that iſland; and, in our way thither, to ſail along Kuriles, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, in a moſt particular manner, thoſe iſlands that are ſituated neareſt to the northern coaſt of Japan, which are ſaid to be of conſiderable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and not ſubject to the Ruſſians or Japaneſe. Should we have the good fortune to meet with ſome ſecure and commodious harbours in any of theſe iſlands, we ſuppoſed they might prove of conſiderable importance, as convenient places of ſhelter for ſubſequent navigators, who might be
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:030274_1461_0FE57A12B7737EE0"/>
employed in exploring the ſeas, or as the means of producing a commercial intercourſe among the adjacent dominions of the two above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned empires. Our next object was to take a ſurvey of the coaſts of the Japaneſe iſles; after which we deſigned to make the coaſt of China as far to the north as was in our power, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed along it to Macao.</p>
                     <p>This plan of operations being adopted, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain King was ordered by Captain Gore, in caſe the two ſhips ſhould ſeparate, to repair without delay to Macao; and on the 9th of October, about ſix o'clock in the afternoon, having cleared the entrance of the bay of Awatſka, we made ſail to the ſouth-eaſtward, the wind blowing from the north-weſt and by weſt. A perfect calm en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued at midnight, and continued till the noon of the following day; at which time the light-houſe was at the diſtance of fourteen or fifteen miles, bearing north half weſt; and Cape Gavareea bore ſouth by weſt half weſt. Our preſent depth of water being ſixty and ſeventy fathoms, our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were very profitably engaged in catching cod, which were extremely fine, and in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. A breeze ſpringing up from the weſt about three o'clock in the afternoon, we ſteered to the ſouth along the coaſt.</p>
                     <p>A head-land now opened with Cape Gavareea, in the direction of ſouth by weſt, ſituated about twenty-one miles beyond it. Betwixt them are
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:030274_1462_0FE579B5F5E3F1B8"/>
two narrow, though deep inlets, which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unite behind what has the appearance of an elevated iſland. The coaſts of theſe inlets are rather ſteep and cliffy. The hills, which break with abruptneſs, form chaſms and vallies, that are plentifully furniſhed with wood.</p>
                     <p>Between Awatſka Bay, and Cape Gavareea, which lies in the longitude of 158° 38′, and in the latitude of 52° 21′, there appear to be ſeveral inlets, which may, at firſt ſight, flatter the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator with hopes of procuring ſhelter and good anchorage: but we were aſſured by the Ruſſian pilots, that there are none that will admit veſſels even of the ſmalleſt ſize, as the ſpaces which ſeem vacant, between the lofty projecting head-lands, are filled up with low land.</p>
                     <p>We again, had a calm towards the evening: but, about midnight, a light breeze ſprung up from the north, which gradually augmented to a ſtrong gale. On monday the 11th, at noon, we were in the latitude of 52° 4′, and in the longitude of 158° 31′; Cape Gavareea bearing north by weſt a quarter weſt, and the ſouthern extremity ſouth-weſt half weſt. We were now at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of nine or ten miles from the neareſt part of the coaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perceived the whole inland coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try covered with ſnow. A point of land towards the ſouth, which we judged to be in the latitude of 51° 54′, conſtituted the northern ſide of a deep bay, diſtinguiſhed by the name of Achachinſkoi,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030274_1463_0FE579C399008728"/>
in whoſe diſtant bottom we imagined that a large river diſcharged itſelf, as the land behind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared remarkably low. To the ſouthward of Achachinſkoi Bay, the land did not exhibit ſuch a rugged and barren aſpect, as was obſervable in that part of the country which we had before paſſed.</p>
                     <p>We had variable winds during the night, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with rain; but, the next morning, at four o'clock, the wind began to blow with ſuch violence from the north-eaſt quarter, that we were obliged to double-reef the top-ſails, and thought proper to ſtand to a greater diſtance from the ſhore. About ſix o'clock, the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more moderate and fair; in conſequence of which we again ſtood in for the land. Our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, at twelve, was 51°, and our longitude 157° 25′. The moſt northerly land in view, being the point which we have already mentioned as firſt opening with Cape Gavareea, was in the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of north-north-eaſt. A head-land, having a flat ſummit, which is ſituated in the latitude of 51° 27′, and forms the ſouthern point of an inlet, named Girowara, bore north a quarter eaſt, and the moſt ſoutherly land in ſight was about eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles diſtant, bearing weſt three quarters north. We could, at this time, faintly perceive low land extending from the ſouthern extremity; but as the wind ſhifted to the north-weſt, we were unable to obtain a nearer view of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="unknown:030274_1464_0FE579C582F15778"/>At ſix o'clock in the afternoon, we diſcerned, from the maſt-head, Cape Lopatka, which is the moſt ſouthern extreme of Kamtſchatka. This cape, which is very low and flat, and gradually ſlopes from the elevated level land that we had ſight of at noon, bore weſt half north, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of fifteen or ſixteen miles; and the high land, at the ſame time, bore north-weſt by weſt half weſt. This point of land forming ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed an object in the geography of the eaſtern coaſt of Aſia, we were glad of an opportunity of aſcertaining, by accurate obſervations, its exact poſition, which is in the longitude of 156° 45′, and in the latitude of 51°. We perceived, to the north-weſt of it, a very lofty mountain, whoſe ſummit was loſt in the clouds. At the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, the firſt of the Kurile iſlands, named Shoom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſka, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>de its appearance, in the direction of weſt half ſouth.</p>
                     <p>The paſſage between Shoomſka and Cape Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patka, is repreſented by the Ruſſians as being one league in breadth, and extremely dangerous, as well on account of the rapidity of the tides, as of the ſunken rocks which lie off the Cape. The coaſt, from Cape Gavareea to Lopatka, trends to the ſouth-eaſtward. The land, to the ſouth of Achachinſkoi, is not ſo elevated and broken as betwixt that bay and the entrance of the bay of Awatſka, being only of a moderate height towards the ſea, with hills riſing gradually
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030274_1465_0FE579F4924B6538"/>
further inland. The coaſt is of conſiderable ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and abounds with white chalky patches.</p>
                     <p>Having a calm at noon, we had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of catching ſome excellent cod. Our depth of water, at this time, was forty fathoms; and our diſtance from Cape Lopatka was between five and ſix leagues. During the night we ſtood to the ſouth-ſouth-weſt under an eaſy ſail, with a weſterly wind. We ſounded at midnight, and found ourſelves in ſixty fathoms water.</p>
                     <p>On the 13th, at break of day, we deſcried the ſecond of the Kurile Iſlands, named Paramouſir by the Ruſſians, extending from weſt half ſouth to north-weſt by weſt. This land was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly high, and almoſt wholly covered with ſnow. At twelve o'clock, its extremes bore from weſt-north-weſt half weſt, to north-north-weſt half weſt; and a lofty peaked mountain, from which ſome of our people imagined they beheld ſmoke iſſuing, was at the diſtance of twelve or thirteen leagues bearing north-weſt by weſt half weſt. Our latitude, at this time, was 49° 49′ and our longitude 157°. We obſerved in the courſe of the day, ſeveral whales, and a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of albatroſſes and gulls.</p>
                     <p>The iſland of Paramouſir is the largeſt of the Kuriles that are ſubject to the dominion of the Ruſſians; and is worthy of a more accurate ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, than we were, on this occaſion, enabled to take. For, in the afternoon, the weſterly wind
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:030274_1466_0FE579704CD51860"/>
increaſing to a briſk gale, it was not in our power to make a nearer approach to it than we had made at noon; we were, therefore, obliged to content ourſelves with endeavouring to determine its poſition at that diſtance. The ſouthern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of the iſland ſtands, according to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, in the latitude of 49° 58′; the northern extremity we place in the latitude of 50° 46′, and in the longitude of 10′ weſt of Cape Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patka; and as this ſituation does not metarially differ from that which the Ruſſians have aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is in all probability, very near the truth.</p>
                     <p>While we were abreaſt of Paramouſir, we had a very violent ſwell from the north-eaſt-ward, though the wind had continued, for ſome time, in the weſtern quarter; a circumſtance which more than once occurred to our obſervation dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe of the voyage. In the night we ſounded, but did not reach the bottom with fifty fathoms of line. The two following days, the wind blowing freſh from the weſt, obliged us to ſteer to the ſouthward, and conſequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented us from ſeeing any more of the Kuriles.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the 16th, at noon, our latitude was 45° 27′; our longitude, deduced from many lunar obſervations taken during the three preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days, was 155° 30′ and the variation was 4° 30′ eaſt. In this ſituation, we were almoſt encompaſſed by the real or pretended diſcoveries of prior navigators, and could not readily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030274_1467_0FE579B77A3A1508"/>
to which we ſhould direct our courſe. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſouth and the ſouth-weſt, a group con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of five iſlands, named Kunaſhir, Zellany, and the Three Siſters, were placed in the French charts. According to the ſame charts, we were now about ten leagues to the weſt of De Gama's Land, which, in April laſt, we had paſſed to the eaſtward, at a diſtance ſomewhat leſs than the preſent, without obſerving the leaſt appearance of it; from which circumſtance it may reaſonably be inferred, that, if ſuch land has any exiſtence, it muſt be an iſland of very ſmall extent. If, on the other hand, we adopt the original poſition of this land, as fixed by Texeira, it was ſituated to the weſt by ſouth; and the Company's Land<note n="*" place="bottom">The Dutchman who ſailed in the Caſtricom and Breſkes, had ſight of this land, which they ſuppoſed was a part of the American <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Staten Iſland <note n="†" place="bottom">This land, which was alſo diſcovered by the Caſtricorn, ſeems, from the ſituation aſſigned to it in the journal of that veſſel, to be the iſlands called the Three Siſters.</note>, and the land of Jeſo, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe imagined to lie nearly in the ſame direction.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the famous land of Jeſo, which has, for ſo long a time, proved a ſtumbling-block to modern geographers, it may be obſerved, that it was firſt brought to the knowledge of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans by the Caſtricom and Breſkes. The name, from the earlieſt accounts, appears to have been
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:030274_1468_0FE57A2AD2744DE0"/>
well known to the Kamtſchadales and Japaneſe, and indiſcriminately uſed by them for all the iſlands that are ſituate between Japan and Kamtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka. It has been ſince affixed to an extenſive imaginary iſland, or continent, pretended to have been diſcovered by the two Dutch ſhips above-mentioned; and, therefore, it may not perhaps, be deemed improper to take the grounds of this error into our conſideration. The expedition, in which thoſe veſſels were engaged, was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with a view of exploring the eaſtern coaſt of Tartary; but, a ſtorm ſeparating the two ſhips, off the ſouth-eaſt point of Japan, they ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſtern ſide of that iſland in different tracks; and, paſſing its northern extreme, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſingly on their voyage. De Vries, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Caſtricom, ſteering a northerly courſe, fell in with land on the third day, in the 42d degree of latitude. He ſailed (according to the journal of the expedition) along the ſouth-eaſtern coaſt, in a continual fog, for the ſpace of about ſixty leagues; and having brought his ſhip to anchor in ſeveral places, had a friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the natives. Now, as the iſlands of Zellany, Kunaſhir, and Matimai, appear, from the diſcoveries of Captain Spanberg, to ſtand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in this ſituation, it is more than probable that they are the ſame land; and the error of De Vries, in ſuppoſing them to be one continent ſeems to be ſufficiently accounted for from this
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:030274_1469_0FE57A2F864750A8"/>
circumſtance of the fog, without our adopting the ſuppoſition of an earthquake, by which Mr. Muller, deſirous of reconciling the general opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the later diſcoveries of the Ruſſians, imagines the ſeveral parts to have been ſeperated. The journal afterwards mentions the diſcovery of Staten Iſland and the company's Land reſpecting which we have already declared our ſentiments. When they had paſſed through the Straits of De Vries, (continues the journal) they entered an extenſive, wild, and tempeſtuous ſea, in which they proceeded, with dark miſty weather, to the 48th degree of northern latitude; after which being driven to the ſouth by adverſe winds, they again fell in with land, towards the weſt, in the latitude of 45°, which they ſtill ſuppoſed was a part of the continent of Jeſo; whereas, if any perſon will examine Janſen's map of their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, which appears to be very accurate, he will not, we think, entertain a doubt of their being, at this time, on the coaſt of Tartary. After they had traced this land four degrees to the northward, they returned towards the ſouth through the ſame ſtarits they had before paſſed.</p>
                     <p>But, to return to the narrative of our voyage; the having veered, in the afternoon of the 16th, to the northward, we hauled round to the weſt. In th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> courſe of this day we obſerved ſeveral albitroſſes, fulmars, and numerous flocks of birds, we alſo ſaw a number of fiſh, which were
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030274_1470_0FE579C9F16AC990"/>
called grampuſes by our ſailors; but we were rather inclined to judge, from the appearance of thoſe which paſſed cloſe by our veſſels, that they were the <hi>kaſatka,</hi> or ſword-fiſh, mentioned by Kraſcheninicoff, who has given a curious account of their mode of attacking the whales. In the evening, being viſited by a ſmall land bird, about the ſize of a gold-finch, and not unlike that bird in plumage and ſhape, we thought proper to keep a careful look out for land. However, upon our trying for ſoundings at midnight, we did not ſtrike ground with forty-five fathoms of line.</p>
                     <p>The next day, at noon, our longitude was 154°, and our latitude 45° 7′. The wind again becoming weſterly, we were under the neceſſity of ſteering a more ſoutherly courſe; and, about midnight, we had a freſh gale from the ſame quarter, attended with heavy rain. In the courſe of the morning, we ſaw another land-bird, and ſeveral flocks of petrels and gulls directing their courſe to the ſouth-weſtward.</p>
                     <p>The heavy north-eaſt ſwell, which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly been obſerved by us ſince we had paſſed Lopatka, now ceaſed, and ſuddenly changed to the ſouth eaſt. On the 18th, in the forenoon, we ſaw conſiderable quantities of rock-weed, from which, as well as from the flights of birds already mentioned, we imagined that the ſouthernmoſt of the Kurile Iſlands was at no great diſtance
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030274_1471_0FE579FFE96A8230"/>
from us; and, about the ſame time, the wind ſhifting to the ſouthward, we were enabled to ſteer for it. At two o'clock, we ſet ſtudding-ſails, and ſtood to the weſtward; but, the wind augmenting to a gale, we were quickly obliged to double-reef the top-ſails; and, at midnight, we deemed it neceſſary to examine our depth of water. We accordingly ſounded; but, meeting with no ground at the depth of ſeventy-five fathoms, we again bore away to the weſt, with the wind in the ſouth-eaſt point.</p>
                     <p>This courſe we continued till two in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 19th, when the weather becoming thick and gloomy, we hauled our wind, and ſtood to the ſouth-weſtward till five o'clock, at which time a violent ſtorm reduced us to our courſers. Though, from the unfavourable ſtate of the weather, there was but little probability of our making the land, our attention was ſtill anxiouſly directed to this object; and, on the appearance of day-light, we ventured to ſteer weſt by ſouth. We proceeded on the ſame courſe till ten o'clock in the forenoon, when the wind ſuddenly veered round to the ſouth-weſt, and was accompanied with clear weather. Scarce had we availed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lves of this, by letting out the reefs, and ſetting the top-ſails, when it began to blow with ſuch vehemence, that we were under the neceſſity of cloſe-reefing again; and, about noon, the wind ſhifting more to the weſt, we were prevented from
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030274_1472_0FE57A016F210488"/>
continuing any longer on this tack: we therefore put about, and ſtood towards the ſouth.</p>
                     <p>Our latitude, at this time, was 44° 12′, and our longitude 150° 40′; ſo that, after all our exertions, we had the mortification of finding ourſelves, according to the Ruſſian charts, upon the ſame meridian with Nadeegſda, which they repreſent as the moſt ſoutherly of all the Kurile Iſlands, and about ſixty miles to the ſouthward.</p>
                     <p>Though the violent and adverſe winds that we had met with for the laſt ſix days, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived us of an opportunity of getting in with theſe iſlands, yet the courſe on which we had been obliged to proceed, did not prove alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtitute of geographical advantages. For the groupe of iſlands, comprehending Zellany, Kunaſhir, and the Three Siſters, which, in the maps of Monſieur D'Anville, are laid down in the track we had juſt croſſed, are, by this means, demonſtrably removed from that poſition; and thus an additional proof is obtained of their being ſituated to the weſt, where Captain Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg has placed them, between the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of 142° and 147°. But this ſpace being occupied, in the French charts, by Staten Iſland, and part of the land of Jeſo, the opinion of Muller becomes highly probable, that they are all the ſame lands; and, as we have no reaſon to call in queſtion the accuracy of Spanberg, we have, in our general map, re-inſtated Kunaſhir
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030274_1473_0FE579A4D259FB98"/>
Zellany, and the Three Siſters, in their proper ſituation, and have totally omitted the reſt.</p>
                     <p>When we reflect on the manner in which the Ruſſians have multiplied the Iſlands of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Archipelago, not only from the want of accuracy in aſcertaining their real poſition, but likewiſe from the deſire natural to mankind of propagating new diſcoveries, we ſhall not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized that the ſame cauſes ſhould produce ſimilar effects. It is thus that the lands of Jeſo, which appear, as well from the earlieſt traditions among the Ruſſians, as from the accounts of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paneſe, to be no other than the ſouthern Kurile Iſlands, have been imagined to be diſtinct from the latter. De Gama's land is next on record; and this was originally repreſented as being nearly in the ſame ſituation with thoſe we have juſt mentioned; but it was afterwards removed, in order to make room for Staten Iſland and the Company's Land; and, as Jeſo, and the moſt ſoutherly of the Kuriles, and likewiſe poſſeſſion of this ſpace, that nothing might be loſt, the former had a place provided for it to the weſtward, and the letter towards the eaſt.</p>
                     <p>As according to the Ruſſian charts, the iſles of Kunaſhir and Zellany, were ſtill to the ſouth, we entertained ſome hopes of being able to make them, and, with this view, kept our head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the weſt as much as the wind would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. At twelve o'clock, on the 20th, our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

was 43° 47′, and our longitude 150° 30′; and we were then ſtanding to the weſt by ſouth, with a gentle breeze from the ſouth-eaſt, and, ſoon after, were, in all probability, not more than four and twenty leagues to the eaſt of Zellany; but this good fortune was not of long duration: for, about three in the afternoon, the wind ſhifting to the north-weſt point, began to blow with ſuch violence, that we were brought under our mizen ſtay-ſail and fore-ſail.</p>
                     <p>For the next twenty-four hours, we had heavy rain and vehement ſqualls; after which, the weather becoming moderate, and the horizon being in ſome meaſure clear we were enabled to ſet our top-ſails; but as the wind continued to blow from the north weſt, all out attempts to make the land were rendered abortive, and we were at length obliged to relinquiſh all further thoughts of diſcovery to the northward of Japan. To this diſappointment we ſubmitted with the greater reluctance, as our curioſity had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably excited by the accounts that are given of the natives of theſe iſlands.</p>
                     <p>An accident befel the Reſolution in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon of the 21ſt; for the leach-rope of her fore-top-ſail gave way, and ſplit the ſail. As this had frequently happened during the life of Captain Cook, he had, on ſuch occaſions, ordered the foot and leach-ropes of the top-ſails to be taken out, and larger ones to be fixed in their room;
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030274_1475_0FE579998E972738"/>
and theſe likewiſe proving incapable of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrain that was on them, it manifeſtly appears, that the juſt proportion of ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſail and thoſe ropes is extremely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calculated in our ſervice.</p>
                     <p>This day a land-bird, ſomewhat larger than a ſparrow, but greatly reſembling one in other reſpects, perched on our rigging, and was caught. The gale now gradually abated; ſo that, on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 22d, in the morning, we let out the reefs of our top-ſails, and carried more ſail. Our latitude, at twelve o'clock, was 40° 58′. and our longitude 148° 17′; the variation 3° eaſt.</p>
                     <p>During the afternoon, another land-bird pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on one of our ſhips, and was ſo exhauſted with fatigue, that it ſuffered itſelf to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly, and expired a few hours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Its ſize did not exceed that of a wren; it had on its head a tuft of yellow feathers, and the reſt of its plumage was ſimilar to that of a linnet. The bird that we mentioned before as bearing a great reſemblance to a ſparrow, lived a long time after it was taken.</p>
                     <p>Theſe birds afforded clear indications, that we were not at any very conſiderable diſtance from the land, and the wind, after varying for a little time, ſettling at the north point in the evening, our hopes of falling in with the land again revived, and we ſteered to the weſt-north-weſt; in which direction were ſituated, at the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030274_1476_0FE57A0783B8FCD8"/>
diſtance of about fifty leagues, the ſouthernmoſt iſlands, ſeen by Captain Spanberg, and ſaid to be inhabited by hairy men. The wind, however, did not keep pace with our wiſhes, but blew in ſuch light airs, that we made little progreſs, till about eight o'clock the following morning, when a freſh breeze ſprung up from the ſouth-ſouth-weſt, with which we continterd our courſe to the weſt-north-weſt till the evening. The latitude, at noon, was 40° 35′; and the longitude deduced from ſeveral lunar obſervations, was 146° 45′. The variation of the needle was 17′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, we had violent ſqually gales, accompanied with rain; and, as we had, in the courſe of this day, paſſed ſome patches of green graſs, and obſerved a number of ſmall land birds, a ſhag, and many flocks of gulls, we did not think it conſiſtent with prudence, having all theſe ſigns of the vicinity of land, to ſtand on for the whole night. We, therefore, about midnight, tacked, and for the ſpace of a few hours, ſteered to the ſouth-eaſtward.</p>
                     <p>On the 24th, at four in the morning, we again bore away to the weſt-north-weſt, and carried a preſs of ſail till about ſeven o'clock in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the wind veered round from ſouth-ſouth-weſt to the north, and blew a freſh gale. Our longitude, at this time, was 145° 20′, and our latitude 40° 57′.</p>

                        </gap>, and to direct his courſe to the weſt-ſouth-weſt, for the northern part of that iſland.</p>
                     <p>The wind, during the night, ſhifted to the north-eaſt, and blew a briſk gale; and, at the ſame time, we had heavy rain, and hazy weather. On the 25th, at noon, we were in the latitude of 49° 18′, and in the longitude of 144°. Flights, of wild ducks were this day obſerved by us; a pigeon lighted upon our rigging; and many birds, reſembling linnets, flew about the ſhips, with a degree of vigour, that gave us reaſon to imagine they had not been long on the wing. We alſo paſſed a piece either of bamboo or ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, and ſeveral patches of long graſs. Theſe indications of our being at no great diſtance from land, determined us to try for ſoundings; but we could not reach the bottom with, ninety fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms of line. On the approach of evening, the wind gradually veered round to the ſouth, with which we continued our courſe to the weſt-ſouth-weſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="189" facs="unknown:030274_1478_0FE57B422F33DCC0"/>On Tuesday the 26th at break of day, we had the ſatisfaction of perceiving high land towards the weſt, which proved to be Japan. At eight o'clock, it was at the diſtance of ten or twelve miles, and extended from ſouth by weſt to north-weſt. A low flat cape, which apparently conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the ſouthern part of the entrance of a bay, bore north-weſt three quarters weſt. Near the ſouth extremity, a hill of a conic figure appeared, bearing ſouth by weſt three quarters weſt. To the north of this hill, there ſeemed to be an inlet of very conſiderable depth, the northern ſide of whoſe entrance is formed by a low point of land; and, as well as we were enabled to judge by the aſſiſtance of our glaſſes, has a ſmall iſland near it towards the ſouth.</p>
                     <p>Having ſtood on till nine o'clock, we had by that time approached within five or ſix miles of the land, which bore weſt three quarters ſouth. Our depth of water was fifty-eight fathoms, with a bottom compoſed of very fine ſand. We now tacked, and ſtood off; but, as the wind failed us, we had proceeded, at noon, to no greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the ſhore than three leagues. This part of the coaſt extended from north-weſt by north to ſouth half eaſt, and was principally bold and cliffy. The low cape above-mentioned was about ſix leagues diſtant, bearing north-weſt by weſt; and the northern point of the inlet was in the direction of ſouth three quarters weſt. Our
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030274_1479_0FE57B2A51D45C90"/>
latitude, by obſervation, was 40° 5′, and our longitude 142° 28′. The moſt northerly land in view, was ſuppoſed by us to be the northern extreme of Japan<note n="*" place="bottom">The moſt accurate ſurvey of the eaſtern coaſt of Japan, appears to be that which was publiſhed by Janſen in his Atlas, and compiled with a great degree of exactneſs from the Journals and Charts of the Caſtricom and Breſkes. We have, therefore, thought proper to adopt wherever we could nearly aſcertain the identity of the ſituations, the names affixed in Janſen's map, to the correſponding head-lands and points, obſerved by us along the coaſt.</note>. It is ſomewhat lower than the other parts; and, from the range of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated lands, that were diſcerned over it from the maſt-head, the coaſt manifeſtly appeared to trend to the weſtward. The northern point of the inlet, was imagined by us to be Cape Nambu; and we conjectured, that the town <note n="†" place="bottom">Janſen calls the town Nabo.</note> ſtood in a break or the high land, towards which the inlet apparently directed itſelf. The neighbouring country is of a moderate elevation, and has a double range of mountains. It is well furniſhed with wood, and exhibits a pleaſing variety of hills and dales. We perceived the ſmoke ariſing from ſeveral villages or towns, and ſaw many houſes in delightful and cultivated ſituations, at a ſmall diſtance from the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>While the calm continued, that we might loſe no time, we put our fiſhing-lines overboard, in ten fathoms water, but met with no ſucceſs.
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030274_1480_0FE548F012C1E528"/>
This being the only diverſion which our preſent circumſtances permitted us to enjoy, we very ſenſibly felt the diſappointment; and looked back with regret to the cod-banks of the diſmal regions we had lately quitted, which had furniſhed us with ſo many ſalutary meals, and, by the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they afforded, had given a variety to the tedious recurrence of the ſame nautical and aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical obſervations, and the weariſome ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of calms and gales.</p>
                     <p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, the wind blow freſh from the ſouth, and, by four, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us to cloſe reefed topſails, and obliged us to ſtand off to the ſouth-eaſtward; in conſequence of which courſe, and the gloomineſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſoon loſt ſight of land. We kept on during the whole night, and till eight o'clock the following morning, when the wind ſhifting to the north, and becoming moderate, we made, ſail, and ſteered a weſt-ſouth-weſt courſe, towards the land, which, however, we did not make before three in the afternoon; at which time it was ſeen to extend from north-weſt half weſt to weſt. The moſt northerly extremity was a continuation of the elevated land, which was the ſouthernmoſt we had obſerved the preceding day. The land to the weſtward, we conjectured to be the <hi>Hoſe Tafel Berg</hi> (or High Table Hill) of Janſen. The coaſt, betwixt the two extremes, was low, and
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030274_1481_0FE5E9FC8CDC30C8"/>
could ſcarcely be perceived, except from the maſt-head.</p>
                     <p>We proceeded towards the coaſt till eight in the evening, when our diſtance from it was about five leagues; and having ſhortened ſail for the night, we ſteered in a ſoutherly direction, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every four hours; but our depth of water was ſo great, that we did not find ground with a hundred and ſixty fathoms of line.</p>
                     <p>We again ſaw land on the 28th, about ſix o'clock in the morning. It lay twelve leagues to the ſouthward of that which we had ſeen the day before, and extended from weſt by north to weſt-ſouth-weſt. Steering ſouth-weſt obliquely with the ſhore, we ſaw, at ten o'clock, more land in that direction. To the weſt of this land, which is low and level, were two iſlands, as we ſuppoſed, though ſome doubts were entertained, whether they were not united with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring low ground. The hazineſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as our diſtance, rendered it likewiſe impoſſible for us to aſcertain, whether there were not ſome inlets or harbours between the project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing points, which here ſeemed to promiſe tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhelter.</p>
                     <p>At noon, the northern extremity of the land in view bore north-weſt by north, and a lofty peaked hill, over a ſteep head-land, was fifteen or ſixteen miles diſtance, bearing weſt by north. Our preſent latitude, by obſervation, was 30° 16′
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030274_1482_0FE57AA75DDDEF60"/>
and our longitude 142° 9′. The mean of the variation was found to be 1° 20′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The land diſappeared from our view between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and, from its breaking off ſo ſuddenly, we imagined, that what we had this day ſeen was an iſland, or, perhaps, a group of iſland, ſituated off the main land of Japan; but, as the iſlands called by D'Anville Matſima, and by Janſen the Schildpads, though repreſented as being nearly in the ſame ſituation, are unequal in extent to the land ſeen by us, we muſt leave this point undetermined.</p>
                     <p>We continued our courſe to the ſouth-weſt during the remainder of the day, and, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, found our depth of water to be ſeventy fathoms, over a bottom of fine brown ſand. We therefore hauled up towards the eaſt, till the next morning, when we again had ſight of land, about eleven leagues to the ſouth of that which we had ſeen the preceeding day. At eight o'clock, we were within the diſtance of about two leagues from the ſhore, having had regular ſoundings from ſixty-five to twenty fathoms over gravel and coarſe ſand.</p>
                     <p>It unfortunately happened, that there was a haze over the land, which prevented us from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing ſmall objects on it. The coaſt was ſtraight and unbroken, running nearly in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of north and ſouth. The ground was low towards the ſea, but gradually ſwelled into
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030274_1483_0FE57AC500159F28"/>
hills of a moderate elevation, whoſe ſummits were pretty even, and covered with wood.</p>
                     <p>About nine o'clock, the ſky being in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree overcaſt, and the wind veering to the ſouth, we tacked, and ſtood off to the eaſtward. Not long after, we obſerved a veſſel, cloſe in with the land, ſtanding to the north along the ſhore; and we alſo ſaw another in the offing, coming down on us before the wind. The reader will eaſily conceive, that objects of any kind, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a country ſo celebrated, and yet ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known, muſt have excited a general eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of curioſity; in conſequence of which, every perſon on board came inſtantaneouſly upon deck, to gaze at them. As the veſſel to windward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached us, ſhe hauled off to a greater diſtance from the ſhore; upon which, being apprehenſive of alarming thoſe who were on board of her by the appearance of a purſuit, we brought our ſhips too, and ſhe ſailed a-head of us, at the diſtance of four or five furlongs. We might have ſpoken to them with great facility; but Captain Gore, perceiving, by their manoeuvres, that they were highly terrified, was unwilling to increaſe their apprehenſions; and, imagining that we ſhould have many better opportunities of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Japaneſe, ſuffered them to retire without interruption.</p>
                     <p>We were not ſufficiently near this veſſel, to remark any particulars reſpecting the men on
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:030274_1484_0FE57B3402D284D8"/>
board of her, who ſeemed to be ſix or ſeven in number, eſpecially as the uſe of our glaſſes was precluded by the thickneſs of the weather. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt probable conjectures we were enabled to form, the veſſel was of the burthen of about forty tons. She had only one maſt, on which was hoiſted a quadrangular ſail, extended aloft by a yard, the braces of which worked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Three pieces of black cloth came half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way down the ſail, at an equal diſtance from each other. The veſſel was lower in the middle than at each end; and from her figure and appearance, we ſuppoſed, that ſhe could not ſail otherwiſe than large.</p>
                     <p>The wind blew freſh at noon, and was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with much rain. By three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, it had increaſed in ſo great a degree, that we were reduced to our courſes. The ſea, at the ſame time, ran as high as any of our people ever remembered to have ſeen it.</p>
                     <p>If the veſſels of the Japaneſe are, as Koempfer has deſcribed them, open in the ſtern, it would have been impoſſible for thoſe which we ſaw, to have endured the violence of this ſtorm; but, as the appearance of the weather, during all the former part of the day, had prognoſticated its approach, and one of the ſloops had, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſtood a conſiderable way out to ſea, it may ſafely be inferred, that they are very capable of ſuſtaining the fury of a gale of wind. Spanberg
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030274_1485_0FE57B43B4750FD8"/>
has, indeed, mentioned two ſorts of Japaneſe veſſels; one correſponding with Koempfer's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, while the other, which he denominates buſſes, and in which, he ſays, the natives make voyages to the adjacent iſlands, perfectly agrees with thoſe that were ſeen by us.</p>
                     <p>About eight o'clock in the evening, the gale, without the ſmalleſt diminution of its violence, ſhifted to the weſt, and, by producing a ſudden ſwell, in a direction contrary to that which had before prevailed, cauſed our ſhips to ſtrain and labour extremely. During the continuance of the ſtorm, the Reſolution had ſeveral of her ſails ſplit. They had, indeed, been bent for ſuch a conſiderable time, and were worn ſo thin, that this accident had lately happened in both our veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels almoſt daily; particularly when the ſails were ſtiff and heavy with rain, in which caſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs capable of bearing the ſhocks of the boiſterous and variable winds we occaſionally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.</p>
                     <p>The gale at length abating, and ſettling in the weſtern quarter, we ſteered a ſouthward courſe; and on Saturday the 30th, at nine o'clock in the morning, we ſaw the land, extending from weſt by north to north-weſt a quarter weſt, at the diſtance of fifteen or ſixteen leagues. It ſhewed itſelf in detached parts; but we were not near enough to aſcertain, whether they were ſmall iſlands, or parts of Japan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="unknown:030274_1486_0FE57AFCEE7F4648"/>At noon, the land extended from weſt to north-weſt; and the neareſt part of it was twelve or thirteen leagues diſtant, beyond which, the coaſt appeared to run in a weſtern direction. Our preſent latitude, by obſervation, was 36° 41′, and our longitude 142° 6′. The point to the north, which we imagined was near the ſouthern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt land ſeen the preceding day, was ſuppoſed by us to be Cape de Kennis; and the break to the ſouth of this point, was thought to be the mouth of the river, on which the town named Giſſima is ſaid to ſtand. The next cape is, in all probability, that which is called Boomtje's Point in the Dutch charts; and the moſt ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly one, off which we were abreaſt at noon, we conjectured to be near Low Point (termed by Janſen <hi>Lage Hoeck,</hi> and placed by him in the latitude of 36° 40°), and that our diſtance was too great to admit of our ſeeing the low land, in which it probably terminates, toward the eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The wind, in the afternoon, ſhifting to the north-eaſt, we ſtood to the ſouth, at the diſtance of ſeventeen or eighteen leagues from the coaſt. As we paſſed along, we tried for ſoundings, but did not find any ground with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line.</p>
                     <p>On the 31ſt, at two o'clock in the morning, the wind veered round to the weſt, and blew in violent ſqualls, accompanied with lightning and rain. In the courſe of this day, ſeveral little
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030274_1487_0FE57AE9867D7408"/>
birds of a brown plumage, reſembling linnets, which had been driven off the land by the ſtrong weſterly gales, flew about our ſhips. On the approach of evening, the wind coming to the north-weſt point, we directed our courſe, with the birds, to the weſt ſouth-weſt, with a view of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining the coaſt.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, which was the 1ſt of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, the wind ſhifted to the ſouth-eaſt, and was attended with fair weather; in conſequence of which, we obtained, with four different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants, forty-two ſets of diſtances of the moon from the ſun and ſtars, each ſet comprehending ſix obſervations. Theſe nearly coinciding with each other, fix, with great accuracy, our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at twelve o'clock this day, in the longitude of 141° 32′; the latitude, by obſervation, being 35° 17′. In our reckonings of the 31ſt of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we found an error, with reſpect to latitude, of eight miles, and of ſeventeen in this day's computations; from which circumſtance, as well as from our being much more to the eaſt than we expected, we inferred, that there had been a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent current from the ſouth weſtward.</p>
                     <p>We again made the land towards the weſt, at two o'clock in the afternoon, at the diſtance of twelve or thirteen leagues. The moſt ſoutherly land in view, which we imagined was White Point (or <hi>Witte Hoeck,</hi> placed by Janſen in the latitude of 35° 42′), bore weſt-ſouth-weſt half
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030274_1488_0FE57B1C81B52A10"/>
weſt. A hummock to the northward, which had an inſular appearance, bore north-north-weſt half weſt; and within this we diſcerned from the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſt-head ſome low land, which we ſuppoſed to be Sanddown Point, called <hi>Sanduynege Hoeck</hi> by Janſen, who has placed it in the latitude of 35° 55′</p>
                     <p>We ſteered for the land till between five and ſix, when we hauled our wind to the ſouth. We obſerved, at this time, many Japaneſe veſſels, cloſe in with the land, ſome ſtanding along the ſhore, and others apparently occupied in fiſhing. We now deſcried to the weſtward a mountain of extraordinary height, with a round ſummit, riſing far inland. There is no high ground in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of it, the coaſt being of a moderate elevation, and, as far as the hazineſs of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon permitted us to judge, much broken and indented by ſmall inlets. But, to the ſouth of the hummock iſland above-mentioned, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, at a conſiderable diſtance up the, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a ridge of hills, which extended towards the mountain, and might perhaps join with it.</p>
                     <p>This being the moſt remarkable hill ſeen by us near the coaſt, we were deſirous of aſcertaining its preciſe ſituation; but as we had only gained this ſingle view of it, we were obliged to content ourſelves with ſuch accuracy as our circumſtances would admit of. Its latitude we judged to be 35° 20′, and is longitude 140° 26′<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the latter
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030274_1489_0FE57AB28BF1FBC0"/>
being eſtimated by its diſtance from our ſhips, at this time fifteen leagues.</p>
                     <p>As the coaſt of Japan, is repreſented, in the Dutch charts, as extending nine or ten leagues to the ſouth-weſt of White Point, we tacked at eight o'clock in the evening, and ſtood off to the eaſtward, with a view of weathering that point. We again tacked, at midnight, to the ſouth-weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, under the expectation of falling in with the coaſt to the ſouth, but were ſurprized, at eight the next morning, to ſee the hummock at no greater diſtance than three leagues, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of weſt-north-weſt. We were, at firſt, almoſt inclined to doubt the evidence of our ſenſes, and afterwards began to ſuſpect ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from a reſemblance of land; but, at noon, we found, by obſervation, that we were actually in the latitude of 35° 43′, at a time when, according to our reckonings, it was 34° 48′. It therefore appeared, that during the eight hours in which we imagined we had proceeded nine leagues to the ſouth-weſtward, we had really been carried eight leagues from the ſituation we left, in a totally oppoſite direction; which occaſioned, upon the whole, a difference of ſeventeen leagues in our computation, in that inconſiderable ſpace of time. From this error, we eſtimated, that the current had ſet, at the rate of at leaſt five knots an hour, to the north-eaſt by north. Our preſent longitude was 141° 16′</p>

                     <p>On Wedneſday the 3d, in the morning, we found ourſelves, by our reckoning, at the diſtance of upwards of fifty leagues from the coaſt; which circumſtance, united to the conſideratian of the very uncommon effect of currents we had already experienced, the advanced period of the year, the variable and uncertain ſtate of the weather, and the ſmall proſpect we had of any alteration for the better, induced Captain Gore to form the reſolution of leaving Japan, and proſecuting our voyage to China; particularly as he entertained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>If any of our readers ſhould be inclined to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we relinguiſhed this object too haſtily, it may be obſerved, in addition to the facts before ſtated, that the coaſt of Japan, according to
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030274_1491_0FE57A6BCDFC6220"/>
Koempfer's deſcription of it, is the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in all the known world <note place="bottom">Koempfer's Hiſtory of Japan, vol. i. p. 92, 93, 94, and 102.</note>; that it would have been exceedingly hazardous, in caſe of diſtreſs, to have run into any of the harbours of that country; where, if we may credit the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic writers, the averſion of the natives to a communication with ſtrangers, has prompted them to the commiſſion of the moſt flagrant acts of barbarity; that our veſſels were in a leaky con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; that the rigging was ſo rotten as to require continual repairs; and that the ſails were almoſt entirely worn out, and incapable of withſtanding the vehemence of a gale of wind.</p>
                     <p>As the violent currents, which ſet along the eaſtern ſhore of Japan, may perhaps be attended with dangerous conſequences to thoſe navigators, who are not acquainted with their extreme rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, we will here ſubjoin a ſummary account of their direction and force, as remarked by us from the 1ſt day of November to the 8th of the ſame month. On the 1ſt, at a time when we were about eighteen leagues to the eaſt of White Point, the current ſet, at the rate of three miles in an hour, to the north-eaſt and by north. On the 2d, as we made a nearer approach to the ſhore, we obſerved that it continued in a ſimilar direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but was augmented in its rapidity to five miles an hour. As we receded from the coaſt,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:030274_1492_0FE57A740A164A68"/>
it again became more moderate, and inclined towards the eaſt. On the 3d, at the diſtance of ſixty leagues from the ſhore, it ſet, at the rate of three miles an hour, to the eaſt-north-eaſt. On the two following days, it turned to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and, at a hundred and twenty leagues from the coaſt, its direction was ſouth-eaſt, and its rate did not exceed one mile and a half in an hour. It again, on the 6th and 7th, ſhifted to the north-eaſt, and its force diminiſhed gradually till the 8th, at which time we could no longer perceive any current.</p>
                     <p>We proceeded to the ſouth-eaſtward during the 4th and 5th of November, with very unſettled weather, and much lightning and rain. On each of thoſe days we paſſed conſiderable quantities of pumice-ſtone, ſome pieces of which were taken up by our people, and found to weigh from an ounce to three pounds. We imagined that theſe ſtones had been thrown into the water, by eruptions at different periods, as many of them were entirely bare, and others covered with barnaeles. At the ſame time, we had a number of porpoiſes playing round our ſhips; and ſaw ſeveral ſmall land-birds, and two wild ducks.</p>
                     <p>At break of day, on Saturday the 6th, we changed our courſe to the ſouth-ſouth-weſt; but, about eight o'clock in the evening, we were taken back, and obliged to ſtand towards the ſouth-eaſt. The next day, at noon, we ſaw a
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030274_1493_0FE57B0299261088"/>
ſmall land-bird. At this time our latitude, by obſervation, was 33° 52′, and our longitude 140° 42′.</p>
                     <p>On the 9th, we had a great ſwell from the eaſt-ſouth-eaſt; and our longitude was 146° 20′, and latitude 31° 46′. In the courſe of this day, we obſerved another little land-bird, a tropic bird, ſome flying-fiſh and porpoiſes. The wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the northward, we continued to ſteer a ſouth-weſt courſe, without any memorable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, till Friday the 12th, when, from the ſame quarter, a moſt violent gale aroſe, which reduced us to the mizen ſtay-ſail and fore-ſail. The weather being, at the ſame time, ſo hazy, that we could, not ſee a cable's length before us, and a number of ſhoals and ſmall iſlands being repreſented, in our charts, as lying in this part of the ocean, we brought to, with our heads turned to the ſouth-weſt. This day, at noon our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by account, was 27° 36′, and our longitude I44° 25′.</p>
                     <p>On the 13th, in the morning, the wind veered, to the north-weſt point, and was accompanied with fair weather; but though we were at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nearly in the ſituation attributed to the iſland of St. Juan, we perceived no appearance of land. We now bore away towards the ſouth-weſt, and ſet our top-ſail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

143° 40′, and the variation 3° 50′ eaſt. In the afternoon we ſaw ſome albatroſſes and tropic birds; alſo ſeveral dolphins and fly-fiſh.</p>
                     <p>We continued to paſs much pumice-ſtone; the amazing quantities of which ſubſtance, floating in the ſea betwixt Japan and the Baſhee Iſles, give reaſon to ſuppoſe, that in this, quarter of the Pacific Ocean, ſome great volcanic convulſion muſt have happened; and, conſequently, afford ſome degree of probability to the opinion of Mr. Muller, (which we have mentioned in a former part of this chapter) relative to the ſeparation of the continent of Jeſo, and the diſappearance of Staten Iſland, and the Company's Land.</p>
                     <p>About ſix o'clock in the afternoon, we ſteered to the weſt-ſouth-weſt, Captain Gore deeming it uſeleſs to ſtand any longer towards the ſouth-ſouth-weſt, as we were nearly in the ſame meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian with the Ladrones, or Marianne Iſlands, and at no very conſiderable diſtance from the track of the Manilla galleons.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of Saturday the 14th, we had fine weather, and the wind, which blew mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, ſhifted by degrees to the north-eaſt point, and proved to be the trade-wind. At ten o'clock Mr. Trevenen, one of the young gentlemen who accompanied Captain King in the Diſcovery, after the death of Captain Clerke, ſaw land in the direction of ſouth-weſt, which had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030274_1495_0FE57B4851D7A850"/>
of a peaked mountain. At noon, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude was 142° 2′, and the latitude 24° 37′.</p>
                     <p>The land in view, which we now diſcovered to be an iſland, was nine or ten leagues diſtant, bearing ſouth-weſt half weſt; and, at two o'clock in the afternoon, we deſcried another to the weſt-north-weſtward. This ſecond iſland, when viewed at a diſtance, appears like two; the ſouthern point conſiſting of a lofty hill of a conic figure, united by a narrow neck to the northern land, which is of a moderate elevation. This iſland being manifeſtly of greater extent than that to the ſouthward, we directed our courſe towards it. At four o'clock, it bore north-weſt by weſt; but, as we had not ſufficient day-light to examine its coaſt, we ſtood, during the night, upon our tacks.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, at ſix, we made ſail for the ſouthern point of the larger iſland; and, about this time, diſcovered another high iſland, in the direction of north three quarters weſt; the iſland to the ſouthward being on the ſame rhomb line, and the ſouth extreme of the iſland a-head bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weſt by north. At nine o'clock, we were abreaſt of the middle iſland, and within the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a mile from it; but Captain Gore, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a boat could not land without running ſome riſque from the heavy ſurf that broke againſt the ſhore, continued his courſe to the weſtward.
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030274_1496_0FE57A8E6DA02148"/>
The latitude at noon, by obſervation, was 24° 50′, and the longitude 140° 56′</p>
                     <p>The length of this iſland, in the direction of ſouth-ſouth-weſt and north-north-eaſt, is about five miles. Its ſouth point is an elevated barren hill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather ſlat at the ſummit, and when ſeen from the weſt-ſouth-weſt, exhibits an evident volcanic crater. The ſand, ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> or rock, (for it was difficult to diſtinguiſh of which of theſe ſubſtances its ſurface was compoſed) diſplayed various colours; and we imagined that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part was ſulphur, not only from its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the eye, but from the ſtrong ſulphureous ſmell perceived by us in our approach to the point. The Reſolution having paſſed nearer the land, ſeveral of the officers of that ſhip thought they diſcerned ſteams proceeding from the top of the hill. Theſe circumſtances induced Captain Gore to beſtow on this diſcovery the appellation of Sulphur Iſland.</p>
                     <p>A low and narrow neck of land unites the hill we have juſt deſcribed, with the ſouth end of the iſland, which extends itſelf into a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of between three and four leagues. The part bordering on the iſthmus has ſome buſhes upon it, and preſents an aſpect of verdure; but thoſe parts that are ſituate to the north-eaſt are extremely barren, and abound with large detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rocks, many of which are of great whiteneſs. Some very dangerous breakers extend about two
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030274_1497_0FE57A852BF74F60"/>
miles and a half to the eaſtward, and two miles to the weſtward, off the middle part of the iſland, againſt which the ſea breaks with a great degree of violence.</p>
                     <p>The north and ſouth iſlands had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſingle mountains, of a conſiderable ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; the former was peaked, and of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Sulphur Iſland we judge to be in the latitude of 24° 48′, and the longitude of 141° 12′. The north iſland we place in the latitude of 25° 14′, and in the longitude of 141° 10′; and the ſouth iſland in the latitude of 24° 22′, and the longitude of 141° 20′.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore now thought proper to direct his courſe to the weſt-ſouth-weſt, for the Baſhee Iſles, with the hopes of procuring, at them, ſuch a ſupply of refreſhments as might render it leſs neceſſary to continue long at Macao, Theſe iſlands received a viſit from Captain Dampier, who has given a very favourable account, as well of the civility of the natives, as of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of hogs and vegetables, with which the country is furniſhed. They were afterwards ſeen by Commodore Byron and Captain Wallis, who paſſed them without landing.</p>
                     <p>For the purpoſe of extending our view in the day-time, our ſhips ſailed at the diſtance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three leagues from each other;
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030274_1498_0FE57A949FDEE7B0"/>
and, during the night, we proceeded under an eaſy ſail; ſo that it was ſcarcely poſſible to avoid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving any land that lay in the vicinity of our courſe. In this manner we continued our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, without any intereſting occurrence, having a freſh breeze from the north eaſt, till Monday the 22d, when it augmented to a ſtrong gale, with vehement ſqualls of wind and rain, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us to cloſe-reefed top-ſails.</p>
                     <p>The following day, at twelve o'clock, our latitude, by account, was 21° 5′, and our longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 123° 20′. About ſix in the afternoon, being at the diſtance of only one and twenty leagues from the Baſhee Iſlands, according to their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Mr. Dalrymple's map, and the weather being ſqually, with a thick haze, we handed the fore-top-ſail, and hauled our wind towards the north-north-weſt.</p>
                     <p>On the 24th, we had conſtant rain during the whole day, and the weather was ſtill very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous; a heavy ſea rolled down upon us from the northward, and, in the courſe of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, we had vivid flaſhes of lightning from the ſame quarter. We continued to ſtand to the north-north-weſt till nine, when we tacked, and ſteered to the ſouth-ſouth-eaſtward, till four o'clock in the morning of Thursday the 25th, at which time we wore. In the night there was an eclipſe of the moon; but we were prevented by the rain from making any obſervation. It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030274_1499_0FE57A7B29634E70"/>
happened, that one of the Diſcovery's people, being occupied, at the time of the greateſt darkneſs, in ſtowing the main top-maſt ſtay-ſail, fell overboar, but immediately catching hold of a rope, which was providentally hanging out of the fore-chains into the ſea, and the ſhip being brought into the wind without delay, he was got on board with no other hurt than a trifling bruiſe on one of his ſhoulders.</p>
                     <p>The weather becoming clear at eight o'clock we bore away, but the wind ſtill blew with ſuch violence, that we did not carry any other ſail than the fore-ſail, and the main-top-ſail cloſe reefed. We obſerved, about this time, a ſugar-cane, and a land-bird that reſembled a thruſh. At noon, our longitude was 121° 35′, and our latitude 21° 35′.</p>
                     <p>Our preſent ſituation, with reſpect to longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, being to the weſt of the Baſhee Iſles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. Dalrymple's charts, we perceived that Captain Gore was influenced, in the courſe he was now ſteering, by the ſentiments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Byron and Captain Wallis, with whom he had ſailed when they paſſed theſe iſlands, which are placed by the former near four degrees to the weſtward, or in the longitude of 118° 14′. In conſequence of this opinion, we ſtood towards the ſouth at two o'clock in the afternoon, with an intention of getting into the ſame parallel of latitude with the Baſhees, before we ſhould r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030274_1500_0FE57A45FB3F1570"/>
down our longitude. We had nearly arrived in that ſituation by ſix o'clock, and ought, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to have been within ſight of the land, according to the account of Captain Wallis, who places theſe iſlands near three degrees more to the eaſt than Commodore Byron.</p>
                     <p>The fury of the gale had not, at this time, received the leaſt diminution; and Captain Gore, being ſtill of opinion that the Baſhees were ſituated to the weſtward, brought the ſhips too, with their heads turned towards the north-weſt, under the fore-ſail and balanced mizen.</p>
                     <p>On the 26th, about ſix in the morning, the wind having, in a great meaſure, abated, we ſet our top-ſails, let out the reefs, and bore away to the weſtward. At twelve o'clock, our latitude, by obſervation, was 21° 12′, and our longitude 120° 25′. In the courſe of this day, we ſaw many tropic birds, and a flock of ducks; alſo porpoiſes and dolphins; and continued to paſs ſeveral pumice-ſtones. We ſpent the night on our tacks; and the following morning, at ſix o'clock, we again made ſail to the weſt, in ſearch of the Baſhee Iſles.</p>
                     <p>Captain King began now to entertain appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, leſt, in the proſecution of our ſearch for thoſe iſlands, we ſhould get ſo far to the ſouth as to be under the neceſſity of paſſing to leeward of the Pratas; in which caſe, it might have proved extremely difficult for ſuch bad-ſailing

veſſels as ours to fetch Macao, eſpecially if the wind ſhould continue to blow (as it now did) from the north-north-eaſt and north. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain having ſome doubts whether Mr. Dalrymple's maps were on board the Reſolution, made ſail and hailed her; and having informed Captain Gore of the ſituation of theſe ſhoals, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of being driven too much to the ſouthward, the latter gave him to underſtand, that he ſhould continue his courſe during that day, being ſtill not without hopes of finding Mr. Byron's longitude right; and therefore ordered Captain King to ſpread a few miles to the ſouth.</p>
                     <p>The weather, at twelve o'clock, became hazy: the latitude, at that time, was 21° 2′, and the longitude 118° 30′. At ſix in the afternoon, having got to the weſt of the Baſhee Iſlands, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Admiral Byron's account, Captain Gore hauled his wind to the north-weſtward, under an eaſy ſail, the wind blowing with great vehemence, and there being every proſpect of a tempeſtuous night.</p>
                     <p>On the 28th, at four o'clock in the morning, the Reſolution, which was then a half a mile a-head of the Diſcovery, wore, and the crew of the latter ſhip at the ſame time, perceived breakers cloſe under their lee. On the approach of day-light, we had ſight of the iſland of Prata; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hours of ſix and ſeven, we ſtood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhoal, but finding ourſelves unable to
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030274_1502_0FE57A53F94D2C98"/>
weather it, we bore away, and ran to leeward. As we paſſed along the ſouth ſide, within the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a mile from the reef, we ſaw two remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able patches on the edge of the breakers, that had the appearance of wrecks.</p>
                     <p>At noon, the latitude diſcovered by double altitudes, was 20° 39′; and the longitude was 116° 45′. The iſland of Prata was now three or four leagues diſtant, bearing north three quarters eaſt. Near the ſouthern extremity of the iſland, and on the ſouth-weſtern ſide of the reef, we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that we ſaw, from the maſt-head, ſeveral openings in the reef, which ſeemed to promiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure anchorage.</p>
                     <p>The extent of the Prata ſhoal is conſiderable; for it is about ſix leagues from north to ſouth, and extends three or four leagues to the eaſt of the iſland; its limits to the weſtward we had not an opportunity of aſcertaining. We judge its north-eaſtern extremity to be in the latitude of 20° 58′, and the longitude of 117°; and its ſouth-weſt end we place in the latitude of 20° 45′, and the longitude of 116° 44′.</p>
                     <p>We carried a preſs of ſail during the remainder of the day, and kept the wind, which now blew from the north-eaſt by north, in order to ſecure our paſſage to Macao. It was a fortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that the wind favoured us towards the evening, by veering two points more to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for, if the wind and weather had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030274_1503_0FE57A9ACE9CB518"/>
the ſame as they had been in the preceding week, we think we ſhould ſcarcely have been able to have fetched that port, in which caſe we muſt have repaired to Batavia; a place we had good reaſon to dread, from the terrible havock which the unhealthineſs of the climate had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned among the crews of the former veſſels that had been employed in voyages of diſcovery, and had touched there.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of Monday the 29th, we paſſed ſome Chineſe fiſhing-boats, the crews of which eyed us with marks of great indifference. In fiſhing, they make uſe of a large dredge-net, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a hollow cone in ſhape, with a ſtat iron rim fixed to the lower part of its mouth. The net is faſtened with cords to the head and ſtern of the boat, which being left to follow the impulſe of the wind, draws the net after it, with the iron rim dragging along the bottom. We found the ſea, to to our great regret, covered with the wrecks of boats which had been loſt, as we ſuppoſed, in the late ſtormy weather.</p>
                     <p>Our latitude at twelve o'clock, by obſervation, was 22° 1′; and, ſince the preceding noon, we had run a hundred and ten miles upon a north-weſt courſe. As we were now nearly in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Lema Iſlands, we made ſail to the weſt by north, and, after we had proceeded two and twenty miles, deſcried one of them nine or ten leagues to the weſt.</p>

                        <pb n="215" facs="unknown:030274_1504_0FE57A92AD00A140"/>At ſix in the afternoon, the extremes of the iſlands in view were in the direction of north-north-weſt, half weſt, and weſt-north-weſt half weſt; and we were four or five leagues diſtant from the neareſt; our ſoundings being twenty-two fathoms, over a muddy bottom. We now ſlackened ſail, and kept upon our tacks for the night. The Grand Lema, according to Mr. Bayly's time-keeper, bore, from the iſland of Prata, north 60° weſt, a hundred and fifty-three miles; and, by our run, north 57° weſt, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty-ſix miles.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, we ran along the Lema Iſles, which, like the other iſlands ſituated on this coaſt, are deſtitute of wood, and, as far as we had an opportunity of obſerving, devoid of cultivation. About nine o'clock, a Chineſe boat, which had before been with the Reſolution, came along-ſide the Diſcovery, with offers of a pilot, which, however, Captain King declined, as it was incumbent upon him to follow his conſort. Not long afterwards, we paſſed the weſternmoſt of the Lema rocks; but, inſtead of hauling up to the north of the Grand Ladrone Iſland, as was done by Lord Anſon in the Centurion, we ſailed to leeward.</p>
                     <p>We ſcarcely think it neceſſary to caution the navigator againſt taken this courſe, as the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſufficiently manifeſt; for, if the wind
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030274_1505_0FE57AB106B7C9A0"/>
ſhould blow violently, and the current ſet with it, it will be highly difficult to fetch Macao. We might, indeed, by the direction of Mr. Dalrym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's chart, have ſafely gone either between the Lema Iſlands, or entirely to the northward of them, and have had the wind ſavourable for our reaching Macao. From our apprehenſions of miſſing that port, and being obliged to repair to Batavia, added to the ſtrong and ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of hearing intelligence from Europe, we were the more inclined to rejoice on obſerving the Reſolution ſoon after fire a gun, and diſplay her colours as a ſignal, for a pilot. On the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the ſignal, there was an excellent race between four Chineſe boats; and Captain Gore engaged with the perſon who arrived firſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the ſhip to the Typa, for the ſum of thirty dollars, ſending word, at the ſame time, to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain King, that, as he could eaſily follow him with the Diſcovery, that expence might be ſaved to him.</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time afterwards, a ſecond pilot getting on board the Reſolution, inſiſted on guiding the ſhip; and immediately laying hold of the wheel, began to order the ſails to be trimmed. This gave riſe to a violent altercation, which was at length compromiſed, by their agreeing to divide the money between them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="unknown:030274_1506_0FE57A47E257E2A8"/>At twelve o'clock, our latitude, by obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was 21° 57′ north, and our longitude 114° 2′ eaſt. The Grand Ladrone iſland was, at this time, four miles diſtant, extending from north-weſt half north to north half weſt. The land, whoſe bearings we have here mentioned, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by us to be one iſland; but we afterwards found that the weſtern part was an iſland laid down in Mr. Dalrymple's chart of part of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe coaſt, &amp;c. which we had not at preſent on board.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of the inſtructions which had been given to Captain Cook by the Lords of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, it now became neceſſary to deſire the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and men to deliver up their journals, and all other papers they might have in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, relative to the hiſtory of the voyage. Some degree of delicacy, as well as firmneſs, ſeemed to be requiſite in the execution of theſe orders. Our commanders could not be ignorant, that moſt of the officers, and ſeveral of the ſeamen, had amuſed themſelves, in their leiſure hours, with writing accounts of our proceedings, for the purpoſe of gratifying their friends, or for their own private ſatisfaction; which they might not wiſh to have ſubmitted, in their preſent form, to the inſpection of ſtrangers. On the other hand, the Captains could not, conſiſtently with the inſtructions they had received, leave papers
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:030274_1507_0FE57AA59B706DE8"/>
in their cuſtody, which, either by accident or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, might fall into the hands of printers and thus give riſe to ſuch ſpurious and imperfect nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives of our voyage, as might tend to the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of our labours, and perhaps, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of officers, who might, though injuſtly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the ſuſpicion of having been the authors of ſuch publications.</p>
                     <p>Captain King, therefore, aſſembled the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery's people on deck, and informed them of the orders that had been received, and the reaſons which, in his opinion, ought to induce them to yield a perfect obedience. He, at the ſame time, gave them to underſtand, that whatever papers they wiſhed not to have ſent to the Lords of the Admiralty, ſhould be ſealed up in their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and preſerved in his cuſtody, till the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Lordſhips, reſpecting the publication of the hiſtory of the voyage, were accompliſhed; after which, he ſaid, they ſhould be faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them.</p>
                     <p>Captain King had the ſatisfaction to find, that his propoſals met with the approbation, and the ready compliance, not only of the officers, but alſo of the reſt of the ſhip's company; and every ſcrap of paper, that contained an account of any tranſactions relating to the preſent voyage, was immediately given up. The Captain obſerves upon this occaſion, that it is but doing juſtice to
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030274_1508_0FE57B4B39BE7498"/>
the ſeamen of this ſhip to declare, that they were the beſt diſpoſed, and the moſt obedient men he ever knew, though the greateſt part of them were very young, and had never ſerved before in a ſhip of war.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore made the ſame propoſals to the people of the Reſolution, who inſtantly complied with them, and delivered up all their papers which had any reference to the voyage.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE continued working to windward till about ſix o'clock in the afternoon, when we let go our anchors, by the direction of the Chineſe pilot on board the Reſolution, who was
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:030274_1510_0FE57AE67B1E75E0"/>
of opinion, that the tide was now ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ting againſt us. In this particular, however, he was greatly deceived; for, upon our making the experiment, we diſcovered, that it ſet towards the north till ten o'clock. The next morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (Wedneſday the 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t of December) he fell into an error of a ſimilar kind; for, at five, on the appearance of ſlack water, he directed that we ſhould get under way; but the ignorance he had before manifeſted had put us upon our guard. We were therefore willing to be convinced, by our own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before we weighed anchor; and, on exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the tide, we found a ſtrong under-tow, in conſequence of which we were obliged to keep faſt till eleven o'clock. It appears from theſe circumſtances, that the tide had run down for the ſpace of twelve hours.</p>
                     <p>We ſtood on our tacks, during the afternoon, between the Grand Ladrone and the iſland of Potoe, having paſſed to the eaſt of the latter. The tide beginning to ebb at nine o'clock, we again caſt anchor in ſix fathoms water; the town of Macao being at the diſtance of nine or ten miles, in a north-weſt direction; and the iſle of Potoe bearing ſouth half weſt, ſix or ſeven miles diſtant.</p>
                     <p>Potoe is ſituated about two leagues to the north-north-weſt of that iſland, which, as we have already mentioned, we at firſt conſidered as a part of the Grand Ladrone. It is rocky, and
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:030274_1511_0FE57B3592B60A00"/>
of ſmall extent; and off its weſtern extremity there is ſaid to be foul ground, though, when we paſſed near it, we did not perceive any.</p>
                     <p>On the 2d of December, in the morning, one of the Chineſe contractors, who are known by the appellation of <hi>Compradors,</hi> came on board the Reſolution, and ſold to Captain Gore as much beef as weighed two hundred pounds, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a conſiderable quantity of eggs, oranges, and greens. The Diſcovery received a proportional ſhare of theſe articles; and an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made with the <hi>comprador</hi> to provide us a daily ſupply, for which, however, he inſiſted on our paying him before-hand.</p>
                     <p>As our pilot now pretended that he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the ſhips no further, Captain Gore was under the neceſſity of diſcharging him; and we were left to our own guidance and direction. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the tide flowing, we took up our anchors, and worked to windward; and, at ſeven, anchored again in three fathoms and a half of water; at which time Macao bore weſt, at the diſtance of one league. This was, indeed, a very ineligible ſituation; for it was expoſed to the north-eaſt, and had ſhoal water, not exceeding two fathoms and a half in depth, to leeward; but as, in the narrative of Lord Anſon's voyage, no nautical deſcription is given of the harbour wherein the Centurian anchored, and Mr. Dalrymple's general map was on too
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030274_1512_0FE57ADC0FCC1528"/>
ſmall a ſcale to be of much ſervice in directing us, our ſhips were obliged to continue there during the whole night.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore, in the evening, diſpatched Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain King to Macao, to pay a viſit to the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe Governor, and to requeſt the favour of his aſſiſtance in ſupplying our people with proviſions, which he imagined might be done on more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate terms than the <hi>Comprador</hi> would undertake to furniſh them. Captain King, at the ſame time, took an account of the naval ſtores, of which both our ſhips were in great want, with an intention of repairing immediately to Canton, and making application to the ſervants of our Eaſt-India company, who reſided there at that time.</p>
                     <p>Upon Mr. King's arrival at the citadel, he was informed by the fort-major, that the governor was indiſpoſed, and was therefore unwilling to receive viſitors, but that we might depend on meeting with every aſſiſtance in their power. This, however, Mr. King underſtood would be very inconſiderable, ſince they were perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the Chineſe even for their deily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Indeed, the anſwer that was returned to Mr. King's firſt requeſt, furniſhed a ſufficient proof of the reduced ſtate of the Portugueſe power; for, on his ſignifying to the Major his deſire of proceeding to Canton as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the latter acquainted him, that they could
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030274_1513_0FE57AB597F8BBE8"/>
not preſume to provide a boat for him, till per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion had been obtained from the <hi>Hoppo,</hi> or officer of the cuſtoms; and that it was neceſſary to apply, for this purpoſe, to the Chineſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Canton.</p>
                     <p>Captain King's mortification at ſo unexpected a delay, could be equalled only by the eager im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience with which we had ſo long waited for an opportunity of gaining information with regard to European affairs. It not unfrequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that amidſt the ardent purſuit of an object, we neglect the moſt obvious means of attaining it. This was, indeed, Mr. King's caſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for he was returning to the ſhip in a ſtate of great dejection, when the Portugueſe officer, who accompanied him, aſked him whether he did not intend to viſit the Engliſh gentlemen at Macao. It is unneceſſary to add with what tranſport Mr. King received the intelligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to him by this queſtion; as well as with what anxious hopes and fears, what a conflict between curioſity and apprehenſion, his mind was agitated, as he and his companions walked towards the houſe of one of their countrymen. The reception they met with was by no means deficient in civility or kindneſs, though, from the ſtate of agitation they were in, it appeared to them rather cold and formal. In their inquiries as far as regarded objects of private concern, they obtained, as was indeed to be expected,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:030274_1514_0FE57A614060DCE0"/>
little or no ſatisfaction; but the occurrences of a public nature, which had happened ſince the period of our departure from England, and which now, for the firſt time, burſt all at once upon them, overwhelmed all other feelings, and almoſt deprived them, for ſome time, of the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
                     <p>The information now received by Mr. King and his attendants, being communicated to thoſe who remained on board, we continued, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, to queſtion each other with reſpect to the truth of it, as if deſirous of ſeeking, in doubt and ſuſpence, for that conſolation, which the reality of our miſfortunes ſeemed entirely to exclude. To theſe ſenſations the moſt poignant regret ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, on finding ourſelves cut off, at ſo great a a diſtance, from the ſcene, where, we ſuppoſed, the fate of contending fleets and armies was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually deciding.</p>
                     <p>The intelligence we had gained concerning the ſtate of affairs in Europe, rendered us the more anxious to accelerate our departure as much as we poſſibly could. Captain King, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his endeavours to procure a paſſage to Canton, but did not meet with ſucceſs at preſent. He was now informed, that the difficulty ariſing from the ſettled policy of the country, would, in all probability, be greatly augmented by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which had occurred a few weeks before our arrival. Captain Panton had been ſent from
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030274_1515_0FE57AB412B66BA8"/>
Madras, in a ſhip of war of twenty-five guns, called the Sea-horſe, for the purpoſe of urging the payment of a debt which the Chineſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Canton owed to private Britiſh ſubjects in Europe and India, and which amounted, as we underſtood, to almoſt a million ſterling, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the principal and compound intereſt. With this view, he was directed to make a peremptory demand of an audience of the viceroy of Canton, which after ſome delay, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recourſe had been had to menaces, was at length granted. The anſwer he received, with regard to the ſubject of his miſſion, was fair and ſatisfactory: but he had no ſooner departed, than an edict was ſtuck up in the public places of the city, and on the houſes of the Europeans, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting all foreigners from lending money, on any pretence whatever, to the ſubjects of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of China.</p>
                     <p>This procedure had given occaſion for very ſerious alarms at Canton. The Chineſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who had contracted the debt, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the commercial laws of their country, and partly denied the juſtice of the demand, were apprehenſive leſt ſome intelligence of this ſhould be conveyed to Pekin; in which caſe the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who is repreſented as a juſt and rigid prince, might perhaps puniſh them with the confiſcation of their property, if not with the loſs of their lives. On the other hand, the Select Committee
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030274_1516_0FE57AF300EFDE40"/>
at the Engliſh factory, to whom the Preſidency of Madras had recommended, in ſtrong terms, the cauſe of the claimants, entertained violent apprehenſions of embroiling themſelves with the Chineſe government at Canton, and of occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by that means, great and perhaps irreparable detriment to the Eaſt-India Company's affairs in China. For the Mandarines, as Captain King was further informed, were conſtantly prepared to take occaſion, even on the moſt trivial grounds, to obſtruct their commerce; and it was frequently a very difficult matter, and always attended with expence, to get ſuch reſtraints taken off. Theſe impoſitions were continually augmenting; and, indeed, Mr. King found it the general opinion, in all the European factories, that they ſhould, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, in a ſhort time, be reduced to the mortifying alternative, either of quitting their commercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with China, or enduring the ſame indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to which the Dutch are ſubjected in the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paneſe dominions.</p>
                     <p>The arrival of our two ſhips, at ſuch a time, could not fail of giving riſe to freſh alarms. Captain King, therefore, finding there was no proſpect of his proceeding to Canton, diſpatched a letter to the Committee of the Engliſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cargoes, to inform them of the reaſon of our putting into the Tygris, and to requeſt their aſſiſtance in procuring him a paſſport, as well as in forwarding the ſtores we had occaſion for (of
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030274_1517_0FE57AC6FAC31358"/>
which Mr. King ſent them a liſt) with all poſſible expedition.</p>
                     <p>The following morning, Captain King was accompanied on board by our countrymen; who acquainting us with the ſituation of the Typa, we weighed anchor between ſix and ſeven o'clock, and ſteered towards it; but the wind ſailing, we again came too, at eight, in three fathoms and a half; the Grand Ladrone bearing ſouth-eaſt by ſouth, and Macao weſt-north-weſt, at the diſtance of three miles.</p>
                     <p>The Portugueſe ſort was here ſaluted by the Reſolution with eleven guns, and the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was returned by an equal number. Early in the morning of the 4th, we weighed again, and ſtood into the Typa, where we moored with the ſtream anchor and cable to the weſt.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Comprador,</hi> with whom we at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, had taken the liberty of going off with a ſmall ſum of money, which he had received from us before-hand for the purchaſe of proviſions, we entered into an agreement with another, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied both our veſſels during the whole time of our continuance here. This was done with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, and in the night, on pretence of its being contrary to the eſtabliſhed regulations of the port; but we were inclined to ſuſpect, that all this caution was practiſed either with a view of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancing the price of the articles provided by him, or of ſecuring to himſelf the emoluments of his
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030274_1518_0FE57A86B2850778"/>
contract, without being under the neceſſity of ſharing them with the Mandarines.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday the 9th, Captain Gore received an anſwer from the Engliſh Supercargoes at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in which they promiſed to exert their moſt ſtrenuous endeavours in procuring the ſupplies of which we were in want, with all poſſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, and aſſured him, that a paſſport ſhould be ſent for one of our officers; expreſſing their hopes, at the ſame time, that we were ſufficiently acquainted with the character of the Chineſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, to impute any delays, that might unavoidably occur, to their true cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The next day, an Engliſh merchant, from one of our Eaſt-Indian ſettlements, made application to Captain Gore for the aſſiſtance of a few of his people, to navigate as far as Canton a veſſel which he had purchaſed at Macao. Captain Gore, conſidering this as a good opportunity for Mr. King to repair to that city, gave orders, that he ſhould take with him his ſecond lieutenant, the lieutenant of marines, and ten ſailors.</p>
                     <p>Though this was not the exact mode in which Captain King could have wiſhed to viſit Canton, yet as it was highly uncertain when the paſſport would arrive, and his preſence might be of great ſervice in expediting the requiſite ſupplies; he did not ſcruple to go on board the veſſel, having left orders with Mr. Williamſon to prepare the Diſcovery for ſea with all convenient ſpee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030274_1519_0FE57A4967C64428"/>
make ſuch additions and improvements in her upper works, as might contribute to render her more defenſible. That the ſeries of our aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical obſervations might not be interrupted by his abſence, he entruſted Mr. Trevenen with the care of continuing them; as he repoſed a perfect confidence in the abilities and aſſiduity of that gentleman.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King and his attendants quitted the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Macao on Saturday the 11th; and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round the ſouth-eaſtern extreme of the iſland, ſteering a northerly courſe, leaving on their right-hand, as they paſſed along, Lantao Lintin, and ſeveral iſles of ſmaller extent. All theſe iſlands, as well as that of Macao, which is ſituated to the left, are totally deſtitute of wood: the land is high and unfertile, and is not inhabited, except occaſionally by fiſhermen.</p>
                     <p>As they approached the Bocca Tygris, which is near forty miles diſtant from Macao, the coaſt of China appeared to the eaſtward in ſteep white cliffs. The two forts, that command the mouth of the river, were, at this time, exactly in the ſame ſtate they were in when Lord Anſon was here. That which ſtands to the left is a fine old caſtle, environed by a grove of trees, and has a pleaſing and romantic aſpect.</p>
                     <p>The veſſel was here viſited by an officer of the cuſtoms; upon which occaſion, the perſon to whom it belonged, being apprehenſive that, if
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030274_1520_0FE57AE14D4D9FD8"/>
our party ſhould be diſcovered on board, it would produce ſome alarm, and might perhaps be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diſagreeable conſequences, requeſted them to retire into the cabin below.</p>
                     <p>Above theſe forts, the breadth of the river is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, the banks being flat and low, and ſubject to great inundations from the tide. The land on both ſides, is level, and laid out in fields of rice; but, as our party advanced, it was obſerved to riſe gradually into hills of conſiderable declivity, whoſe ſides were cut into terraces, and planted with ſugar-canes, yams, ſweet potatoes, the cotton tree, and plantains. They alſo perceived many lofty <hi>pagodas,</hi> diſperſed about the country, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral towns at a diſtance, ſome of which ſeemed to be of great magnitude.</p>
                     <p>Their progreſs being retarded by contrary winds, and the lightneſs of the veſſel, they did not arrive at Wampu, which is no more than nine leagues from the Bocca Tygris, till the 18th. Wampu is a ſmall town, off which the ſhips of the various nations, who trade with the Chineſe are ſtationed, in order to receive their reſpective ladings. It is aſſerted by Monſieur Sonnerat, that the river, higher up, is not ſufficiently deep for the admiſſion of veſſels that are heavily laden, even if the policy of the Chineſe had permitted Europeans to navigate them up to Canton. With reſpect to this circumſtance, however, we cannot pretend to decide, as no ſtranger, we believe,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030274_1521_0FE57AF609196438"/>
has been allowed to inform himſelf with certainty of the truth. The little iſlands, that are ſituated oppoſite the town, are appropriated to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral factories, who have erected werehouſes for the reception of the various articles of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize which are brought down from Canton.</p>
                     <p>At Wampu, Captain King embarked in a <hi>ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane,</hi> or Chineſe boat, and immediately proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Canton, which is eight or nine miles higher up the river. Theſe <hi>ſampanes</hi> are the neateſt and moſt commodious boats for paſſengers that Mr. King ever ſaw. They are of different ſizes, of great breadth upon the beam, nearly flat at the bottom, and narrow at the head and ſtern, which are elevated, and embelliſhed with ornaments. The middle part, where Mr. King ſat, was arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with a roof made of bamboo, which may, at pleaſure, be raiſed or lowered; in the ſides were ſmall windows which had ſhutters to them; and the apartment was furniſhed with tables, chairs, and handſome mats. A ſmall waxen idol was placed in the ſtern, in a caſe of gilt leather. Before this image ſtood a pot, that contained lighted tapers made of matches, or dry chips, and gum. The fare of this boat amounted to a Spaniſh dollar.</p>
                     <p>Captain King reached Canton in the evening, and diſembarked at the Engliſh factory, where though his arrival was wholly unexpected, he was received with every mark of civility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030274_1522_0FE57A5E31C6D410"/>
Meſſrs. Fitzhugh, Bevan, and Rapier, compoſed, at this time, the Select Committee; and the former of theſe gentlemen acted as Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. They immediately gave Mr. King an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of thoſe ſtores with which the Eaſt-India ſhips were able to ſupply us; and though he did not entertain the ſmalleſt doubt, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were willing to aſſiſt us with whatever they could ſpare, conſiſtently with a regard to the intereſt of their employers, as well as their own ſafety, yet it was a great diſappointment to him to obſerve in their liſt ſcarcely any canvaſs or cordage, of both which articles we were chiefly in want. It afforded him, however, ſome conſolation to find that the ſtores were ready to be ſhipped, and that the proviſions we had occaſion for might be had at a day's notice.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King being deſirous of making his ſtay here as ſhort as poſſible, requeſted that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen would endeavour to procure junks or boats for him the next day, as it was his intention to quit Canton the following one; but they gave him to underſtand, that a buſineſs of that nature was not to be tranſacted with ſuch quickneſs in the Chineſe dominions; that leave muſt previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be obtained from the Viceroy; that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt be made to the <hi>Hoppo,</hi> or principal officer of the cuſtoms, for <hi>chops,</hi> or permits; and that it was not cuſtomary to grant ſuch favours without mature deliberation: in ſhort, that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:030274_1523_0FE57A9DD947D8F8"/>
was a virtue eſſentially neceſſary in China; and that they hoped they ſhould have the pleaſure of rendering the factory agreeable to him, for a few days longer than he ſeemed inclined to favour them with his company.</p>
                     <p>Though Captain King was not much diſpoſed to be pleaſed with this compliment, he could not avoid being diverted with an incident which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred very ſeaſonably to convince him of the truth of their repreſentations, and of the ſuſpicious character that diſtinguiſhes the Chineſe. Our readers will doubtleſs recollect, that it was now upwards of a fortnight ſince Captain Gore had written to the gentlemen of the factory, to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, their aſſiſtance in gaining permiſſion for one of his officers to repair to Canton. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this application they had mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> the affair to one of the principal Chineſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of that city, who had promiſed to intereſt himſelf in our behalf, and to petition the Viceroy to grant our requeſt. This perſon came to viſit Mr. Fitzhugh, the Preſident, while he and his colleagues were converſing with Captain King on the ſubject, and informed him, with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and ſatisfaction in his countenance, that he had at length met with ſucceſs in his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that a paſſport would be iſſued in a few days for one of the officers of the Ladrone ſhip, or pirate. Mr. Fitzhugh immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him not to give himſelf any further trouble
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:030274_1524_0FE57AF7F19AB330"/>
in this buſineſs, as the officer (pointing to Captain King) was already arrived. The conſternation, with which the old Chineſe merchant was ſeized on hearing this intelligence, is almoſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable. His head ſunk inſtantaneoſly upon his breaſt, and the ſofa, on which he ſat, ſhook, from the violence of his emotion. Whether the Ladrone ſhip (as he called it) was the object of his apprehenſions, or his own government, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain King could not determine; but, after he had continued a few minutes in this ſtate of agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. Bevan begged him not to deſpair, and acquainted him with the manner in which the Captain had paſſed from Macao, the motives of his journey to Canton, and his wiſhes to quit that city as ſoon as poſſible. As this laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeemed to be particularly agreeable to the old man, Mr. King flattered himſelf that he ſhould find him diſpoſed to accelerate his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but he had no ſooner recovered from his conſternation, than he began to recount the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable delays that would occur in our buſineſs, the difficulty of obtaining an audience of the Viceroy, the jealouſies and ſuſpicions entertained by the Mandarines with regard to our real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which, he affirmed, had riſen to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common height, from the ſtrange account that we had given of ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>After Captain King had waited ſeveral days, with great impatience, for the iſſue of his negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:030274_1525_0FE57AD0DCEE18F0"/>
without finding that the affair was in the leaſt advanced towards a concluſion, he made application to the commander of an Engliſh country ſhip, who intended to ſail on the 25th, and who offered to take on board the men and ſtores, and to lie too, unleſs the weather ſhould prevent him, off Macao, till we could diſpatch boats to receive them out of his veſſel. He at the ſame time appriſed Captain King of the danger he might perhaps incur of being driven with them out to ſea.</p>
                     <p>While Mr. King was conſidering what ſteps he ſhould take, the commander of another country ſhip, preſented him with a letter from Captain Gore, importing that he had engaged this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to bring our party from Canton, and to deliver our ſupplies, at his own hazard, in the Typa. All difficulties being thus removed, Mr. King had leiſure to beſtow ſome attention on the purchaſe of our ſtores and proviſions, which he completed on the 26th; and on the ſucceeding day, the whole ſtock was conveyed on board.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore being of opinion, that Canton would be the moſt advantageous market for furs, had deſired Mr. King to take with him about twenty ſkins of ſea-otters; moſt of which had been the property of our deceaſed Commanders, and to diſpoſe of them at the beſt price he could obtain; a commiſſion which furniſhed him with an opportunity of becoming acquainted, in ſome
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:030274_1526_0FE57A4F176814A8"/>
degree, with the genius of the Chineſe for trade. Mr. King having informed ſome of the Engliſh ſupercargoes of theſe circumſtances, requeſted that they would recommend him to ſome reputable Chineſe merchant, who would at once offer him a reaſonable price for the ſkins. They accordingly directed him to a member of the <hi>Hong,</hi> (an appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation given to a ſociety of the principal merchants of the city) who being fully appriſed of the nature of the buſineſs, ſeemed to be ſenſible of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Mr. King's ſituation, and aſſured him that he might rely on his integrity, and that, in an affair of this kind, he ſhould conſider himſelf as a mere agent, without ſeeking to acquire any profit for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The ſkins being laid before this merchant, he examined them over and over again with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular attention, and at laſt informed Captain King, that he could not think of offering more than three hundred dollars for them. As the Captain was convinced, from the price at which our ſkins had been ſold in Kamtſchatka, that he had not offered one half of their value, he found himſelf obliged to drive a bargain. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his turn, demanded a thouſand dollars; the Chineſe merchant then advanced to five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; after which he offered Mr. King a private preſent of porcelain and tea, which amounted to a hundred more; then he propoſed to give the ſame ſum in money; and at length roſe to ſeven
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:030274_1527_0FE57AC883849E98"/>
hundred dollars, upon which the Captain lowered his demands to nine hundred. Here, each of them declaring that he would not recede, they parted; but the Chineſe ſpeedily returned with a liſt of Eaſt-Indian commodities, which he now deſired that Mr. King would taken in exchange, and which (as the Captain was afterwards inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) would have amounted in value, if faithfully delivered, to double the ſum the merchant had before offered. Finding the Captain unwilling to deal in this mode, he finally propoſed, that they ſhould divide the difference, which Mr. King, weary of the conteſt, agreed to, and received the eight hundred dollars.</p>
                     <p>Captain King, from the ill health under which he at preſent laboured, had but little reaſon to lament the very narrow bounds, within which every European at Canton is obliged, by the ſuſpicious policy of the Chineſe, to confine his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. He would otherwiſe, doubtleſs, have felt himſelf extremely tantalized with living under the walls of a city of ſuch magnitude, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with objects of novelty, without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter it.</p>
                     <p>The accounts of Canton, as well as of the other parts of China, by Le Comte and Du Halde, moſt of our readers have, in all probability, peruſed. Theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

remarks collected by Captain King from the intelligence which he received from ſeveral Engliſh gentlemen, who had reſided a long time at Canton, may not improperly be introduced.</p>
                     <p>The circumference of Canton, including the old and new town, and alſo the ſuburbs, is about ten miles. With regard to its population, Mr. King, judging of the whole from what he ſaw in the ſuburbs, is of opinion, that it falls conſiderably ſhort of an European town of equal magnitude. Le Comte has eſtimated the number of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants at one million five hundred thouſand; Du Halde at a million; and M. Sonnerat affirms he has aſcertained that their number does not exceed ſeventy-five thouſand <note n="*" place="bottom">"J'ai <hi>verifié</hi> moi-meme, avec pluſieurs Chinois, la population de Canton," &amp;c. <hi>Voyage aux Indes Grientales et à la Ck us, M. Sonnerat,</hi> vol ii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 14.</note>: but, as this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman has not thought proper to communicate to us the grounds on which he founded his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and, beſides, ſeems to be as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to depreciate whatever relates to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe nation, as the Jeſuits may be to magnify, his opinion does not lay claim to an implicit aſſent. The following particulars may perhaps enable our readers to form a judgment on this point with ſome degree of accuracy.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, that a Chineſe houſe, in general, occupies more ſpace than is commonly taken up by houſes in Europe; but the proportion of four
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:030274_1529_0FE57B1141509FC8"/>
or five to one, ſuggeſted by M. Sonnerat, muſt be acknowledged to go far beyond the truth. To this we may add, that a conſiderable number of houſes, in the ſuburbs of Canton, are kept only for the purpoſes of commerce, by merchants and opulent tradeſmen, whoſe families reſide entirely within the walls. On the other hand, a Chineſe family, upon an average is more numerous than an European. A Mandarine, in proportion to his rank and property, has from five to twenty wives. A merchant has from three to five. A perſon of the latter claſs at Canton, had, indeed, five and twenty wives, and ſix and thirty children; but this was mentioned to Captain King as a very uncommon circumſtance. A wealthy tradeſman has generally two wives; and people of an inferior ſtation very rarely have more than one. They have, at leaſt double the number of ſervants em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by Europeans of the ſame rank. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we ſuppoſe a Chineſe family to be larger by one third, and an European houſe leſs by two-thirds, than each other, a city of China will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend only half the number of people contained in a town of the ſame extent in Europe. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe <hi>poſtulata,</hi> the city and ſuburbs of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton may contain, in all probability, about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>Captain King found various opinions entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſpecting the number of inhabited <hi>ſampanes:</hi> but none computed them to be under forty
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:030274_1530_0FE57A55E1D6C7E0"/>
thouſand. They are moored in rows, cloſe to each other, a narrow paſſage being left, at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals for the boats to paſs and repaſs on the river. The Tygris, at Canton, being of greater width than the Thames at London, and the whole river, for the ſpace at leaſt of a mile, being covered in this manner, it does not appear that this eſtimate of their number is at all exaggerated; and if it be allowed, the inhabitants in the <hi>ſampanes</hi> alone, each of which contains one family, muſt amount to almoſt thrice the number affirmed by M. Sonnerat to be in the whole city.</p>
                     <p>Fifty thouſand men conſtitute the military force of the province of Quangtong; of which Canton is the capital. It is aſſerted, that twenty thouſand are ſtationed in the city and its environs; and Captain King was aſſured, that, on occaſion of ſome commotion which had happened at Canton, thirty thouſand troops had been drawn together in the courſe of a few hours.</p>
                     <p>The ſtreets of this city are long, and moſt of them are narrow and deſtitute of uniformity. They are well paved with large ſtones, and, in general, kept extremely clean. The houſes are built of brick, and are only one ſtory high. They have, for the moſt part, two or three courts backwards, in which are erected the warehouſes for the reception of merchandize, and, in the houſes within the city, the apartments for the females. Some of the meaner ſort of people,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:030274_1531_0FE57B132CFF7C48"/>
though very few have their habitations compoſed of wood.</p>
                     <p>The houſes of the European factors are built on a fine quay, having a regular facade of two ſtories towards the river. They are conſtructed, with reſpect to the inſide, partly after the Chineſe, and partly after the European mode. Adjoining to theſe are a conſiderable number of houſes which belong to the Chineſe, and are let out by them to the commanders of veſſels, and to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who make only an occaſional ſtay.</p>
                     <p>As no European is permitted to take his wife with him to Canton, the Engliſh ſupercargoes live together, at a common table, which is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the company; and each of them has alſo an apartment appropriated to himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of three or four rooms. The period of their reſidence rarely exceeds eight months in a year; and as, during that time, they are almoſt conſtantly occupied in the ſervice of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they may ſubmit, with the leſs uneaſineſs and regret, to the reſtrictions under which they live. They very ſeldom make any viſits within the walls of Canton, except on public occaſions. Indeed nothing contributed more to give Captain King an unfavourable opinion of the character of the Chineſe, than his finding, that, among ſo many perſons of ingenuous and liberal minds, as well as of amiable manners, ſeveral of whom had been reſident in that country for near fifteen ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:030274_1532_0FE57A6EDC10FF60"/>
years, they had never formed any ſocial connection or friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the laſt ſhip departs from Wampu, they are all under the neceſſity of retiring to Macao; but they leave behind them all the money they poſſeſs in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> which Mr. King was informed, ſometimes amounts to a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling, and for which they have no other ſecurity than the ſeals of the Viceroy, the Mandarines, and the merchants of the <hi>Hong:</hi> a ſtriking proof of the excellent police maintained in China.</p>
                     <p>Captain King, during his continuance at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, accompanied one of the Engliſh gentlemen on a viſit to a perſon of the firſt diſtinction in the place. They were received in a long room or gallery, at the further end of which a table was placed, with a large chair behind it, and a row of chairs extending from it, on both ſides, down the room. The captain having been previouſly inſtructed, that the point of politeneſs conſiſted in remaining unſeated as long as poſſible, readily ſubmitting to this piece of <hi>etiquette</hi>; after which he and his friend were treated with tea, and ſome freſh and preſerved fruits. Their entertainer was very corpulent, had a dull heavy countenance, and diſplayed great gravity in his deportment. He had learned to ſpeak a little broken Engliſh and Portugueze. After his two gueſts had taken their refreſhment, he conducted them about his
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:030274_1533_0FE57AA8E1B8FAF8"/>
houſe and garden; and when he had ſhewn them all the improvements he was making, they took their leave.</p>
                     <p>Captain King being deſirous of avoiding the trouble and delay that might attend an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for paſſports, as well as of ſaving the unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary expence of hiring a <hi>ſampane,</hi> which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed amounted at leaſt to twelve pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, had hitherto deſigned to go along with the ſupplies to Macoa, in the country merchant's ſhip we mentioned before: but receiving an invitation from two Engliſh gentlemen, who had found means to procure paſſports for four, he accepted, together with Mr. Philips, their offer of places in a Chineſe boat, and entruſted Mr. Lannyon with the ſuperintendance of the men and ſtores, which were to ſail the following day.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the 26th, in the evening, Captain King took his leave of the ſupercargoes, after having returned them thanks for their many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; among which muſt be mentioned a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a conſiderable quantity of tea, for the uſe of the companies of both ſhips, and a copious col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Engliſh periodical publications. The latter proved a valuable acquiſition to us, as they not only ſerved to beguile our impatience, in the proſecution of our tedious voyage homewards, but alſo enabled us to return not wholly unacquainted with what had been tranſacting in our native country during our abſence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="245" facs="unknown:030274_1534_0FE57B2DC09E0138"/>At one o'clock in the morning of the 27th, Meſſrs. King and Phillips, and the two Engliſh gentlemen, quitted Canton, and, about the ſame hour of the ſucceeding day, arrived at Macao, having paſſed down a channel ſituated to the weſt of that by which Mr. King had come up.</p>
                     <p>During the abſence of our party from Macao, a briſk traffic had been carrying on with the Chineſe for four ſea-otter ſkins, the value of which had augmented every day. One of our ſailors diſpoſed of his ſtock, alone, for eight hundred dollars; and a few of the beſt ſkins, which were clean, and had been carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, produced a hundred and twenty dollars each. The total amount of the value, in goods and caſh, that was obtained for the furs of both our veſſels, we are confident was not leſs than two thouſand pounds ſterling; and it was the general opinion, that at leaſt two-thirds of the quantity we had originally procured from the Americans, were by this time ſpoiled and worn out, or had been beſtowed as preſents, and otherwiſe diſpoſed of, in Kamtſchatka. If, in addition to theſe facts, we conſider, that we at firſt collected the furs without having juſt ideas of their real value; that moſt of them had been worn by the ſavages from whom we purchaſed them; that little regard was afterwards ſhewn to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; that they were frequently made uſe of as bed-clothes, and likewiſe for other purpoſes,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:030274_1535_0FE57B52A6C1D060"/>
during our cruize to the northward; and that, in all probability, we never received the full value for them in China; the benefits that might accrue from a voyage to that part of the American coaſt where we obtained them, undertaken with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial views, will certainly appear of ſufficient importance to claim the public attention.</p>
                     <p>So great was the rage with which our ſeamen were poſſeſſed to return to Cook's River, and there procure another cargo of ſkins, by which they might be enabled to make their fortunes, that, at one time, they were almoſt on the point of proceeding to a mutiny. And Captain King acknowledges, that he could not refrain from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging himſelf in a project, which was firſt ſuggeſted to him by the diſappointment we had met with in being compelled to leave the Japa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe Archipelago, as well as the northern coaſt of China, unexplored; and he is of opinion, that this object may ſtill be happily attained, by means of our Eaſt-India Company, not only with trifling expence, but even with the proſpect of very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial conſequences. The ſtate of affairs at home, or perhaps greater difficulties in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his plan that he had foreſeen, have hitherto prevented its being carried into execution; but, as the ſcheme ſeems to be well contrived, we hope the reader will not be diſpleaſed with inſerting it here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="247" facs="unknown:030274_1536_0FE57ABBF77261B8"/>In the firſt place, Captain King propoſes, that the Eaſt-India Company's China ſhips ſhould, each, carry an additional number of men, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one hundred in the whole. Two veſſels, one of two hundred tons, and the other of a hundred and fifty, might, with proper notice, (as Mr. King was informed) be purchaſed at Canton; and, as victualling is as cheap there as in Europe, he has calculated that they might be completely equipped for ſea, with one year's proviſions and pay, for the ſum of ſix thouſand pounds, including the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. The expence of the requiſite articles for barter is very inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King particularly recommends that each of the ſhips ſhould have a forge, five tons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought iron, and a ſkilful ſmith, with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice and journeyman, who might occaſionally make ſuch tools, as the Indians ſhould appear to have the greateſt inclination for poſſeſſing. For, though half a dozen of the fineſt ſkins, obtained by us, were purchaſed with twelve large green glaſs beads, yet it is very certain, that the fancy of theſe people, for ornamental articles, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely capricious and variable; and that the only ſure commodity for their market is iron. To this might be added ſeveral bales of coarſe woollen cloth, two or three barrels of glaſs and copper trinkets, and a few groſs of large pointed caſe-knives.</p>

                        <pb n="248" facs="unknown:030274_1537_0FE57B00AACD2F10"/>The Captain propoſes two veſſels, not only for the greater ſecurity of the voyage, but becauſe ſingle ſhips ought never, in his opinion, to be ſent out for the purpoſe of diſcovery. For where riſques are frequently to be run, and uncertain and dangerous experiments tried, it can by no means be expected that ſingle ſhips ſhould venture ſo far, as where ſome ſecurity is provided againſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate accident.</p>
                     <p>When the ſhips are prepared for ſea, they will ſail with the firſt ſouth-weſt monſoon, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſets in about the commencement of the month of April. They will ſteer a northward courſe, with this wind, along the Chineſe coaſt, beginning to make a more accurate ſurvey from the mouth of the Nankin river, or the river Kyana, in the 30th degree of latitude, which is ſuppoſed to be the remoteſt limit of this coaſt hitherto viſited by European veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The extent of the great gulph called <hi>Whang Hay,</hi> or the yellow Sea, being at preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, it may be left to the Commander's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to proceed up it as far as he may think proper: he muſt be cautious, however, not to entangle himſelf in it too far, leſt he ſhould not have ſufficient time left for the proſecution of the remainder of his voyage. The ſame diſcretion may be uſed, when he has reached the ſtraits of Teſſoi, with regard to the iſlands of Jeſo, which,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:030274_1538_0FE57A79A489FD18"/>
if the wind and weather ſhould be favourable, he muſt not neglect to explore.</p>
                     <p>Having arrived in the latitude of 51° 40′, where he will make the moſt ſoutherly point of the iſle of Sagaleen, beyond which we have a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able knowledge of the ſea of Okotſk he will ſteer towards the ſouth, probably about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of June, and exert his endeavours to fall in with the moſt ſouthern of the Kurile iſlands. If the accounts of the Ruſſians may be depended on, Ooroop, or Nadeſchda, will furniſh the ſhips with a commodious harbour, where they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit their wood and water, and provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch refreſhments as the place may afford.</p>
                     <p>About the end of June the commander will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his courſe to the Shummagins, whence he will proceed to Cook's River, purchaſing, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as many ſkins as poſſible, without loſing too much time, ſince he ought to ſail again to the ſouthward, and trace the coaſt with the utmoſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy between the 56th and 50th degrees of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the ſpace where contrary winds drove us out of ſight of land.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be here obſerved, that Captain King conſiders the purchaſe of ſkins, in this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a ſecondary concern, for defraying the expence; and from our experience in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent voyage, there is no reaſon to doubt that two hundred and fifty ſkins, each worth a hundred
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:030274_1539_0FE57B07A4F7F570"/>
dollars, may be obtained without low of time; particularly as they will, in all probability, be met with along the coaſt to the ſouth of Cook's River.</p>
                     <p>The Commander, after having continued about three months on the American coaſt, will ſet out on his return to China in the former part of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, taking care, in his route, to avoid as much as poſſible, the tracks of preceding navigators. All that remains to be added on this ſubject, is, that if the fur trade ſhould become an eſtabliſhed object of Indian commerce, many opportunities will occur of completing whatever may have been left unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, in the voyage of which the outlines are here delineated.</p>
                     <p>A very ludicrous alteration took place in the dreſs of all our crew, in conſequence of the barter which the Chineſe had carried on with us for our ſea-otter ſkins. On our arrival in the Typa, not only the ſailors, but likewiſe the young officers, were extremely ragged in their apparel; for, as the voyage had now exceeded, almoſt by a year, the time it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ot firſt ſuppoſed we ſhould continue at ſea, the far greater part of our original ſtock of European clothes had been long ago worn out, or repaired and patched up with ſkins, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manufactures we meet with in the courſe of the expedition. Theſe were now mixed and eked out with the gayeſt ſilks, and cottons that China could produce.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="251" facs="unknown:030274_1540_0FE57AF486371C38"/>Mr. Lannyon arrived on the 30th, with the ſtores and proviſions, which, without delay, were ſtowed in due proportion on board of our two veſſels. The following day, in compliance with an agreement made by Captain Gore, Mr. King ſent the Diſcovery's ſheet anchor to the country ſhip, and, in return, received the guns by which ſhe before rode.</p>
                     <p>While we remained in the Typa, Captain King was ſhewn in the garden of an Engliſh gentlemen at Macao, the rock, under which, according to the traditional accounts, Camoens, the celebrated Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe poet, was accuſtomed to ſit and compoſe his Luſiad. It is an arch of conſiderable height, conſiſting of one ſolid ſtone, and forming the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a grotto dug out of the elevated ground behind it. Large ſpreading trees overſhadow the rock, which commands a beautiful and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive proſpect of the ſea, and the iſlands diſperſed about it.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 11th of January, 1780, two ſailors belonging to the Reſolution went off with a ſix-oared cutter; and though the moſt diligent ſearch was made, both that and the ſucceeding day, we never could gain any intelligence of her. It was imagined, that theſe ſeamen had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by hopes of acquiring a fortune, if they ſhould return to the fur iſlands.</p>
                     <p>As, during our continuance in the Typa, we heard nothing with reſpect to the meaſurement
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:030274_1541_0FE57B549B2E5FC0"/>
of the ſhips, we may reaſonably conclude, that the point ſo ſtrongly conteſted, in Commodore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's times by the Chineſe, has, in conſequence of his courage and firmneſs, never ſince been inſiſted on.</p>
                     <p>According to the obſervations that were made while our veſſels lay here, the harbour of Macao is ſituated in the latitude of 22° 12′ north, and the longitude of 113° 47′ eaſt; our anchoring-place in the Typa, in the latitude of 22° 9′ 20″ north, and the longitude of 113° 48′ 34″ eaſt; and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of the compaſs was 19′ weſt. It was high water in the Typa, on the full and change days, at a quarter after five o'clock, and, in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Macao, at fifty minutes after five: the greateſt riſe was ſix feet one inch. The flood ſeemed to come from the ſouth-eaſt; but, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the numerous iſlands lying off the mouth of the river of Canton, we could not properly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain that point.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE unmoored on the 12th of January, at twelve o'clock, and ſcaled the guns, which, on board the Diſcovery, amounted at this time to ten; ſo that her people, by means of four additional ports, could fight ſeven on a ſide. In the Reſolution likewiſe, the number of guns had
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:030274_1543_0FE57ADF63717C80"/>
been augmented from twelve to ſixteen; and, in each of our veſſels, a ſtrong barricade had been carried round the upper works, and all other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions taken to give our inconſiderable force a reſpectable appearance.</p>
                     <p>We conſidered it as our duty to furniſh our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with theſe means of defence, though there was ſome reaſon to believe, that they had, in a great meaſure, been rendered ſuperfluous by the generoſity of our enemies. Captain King had been informed at Canton, that, in the public prints, which had laſt arrived from Great Britain, mention was made of inſtructions having been found on board all the French ſhips of war, that had been taken in Europe, importing, that their commanders, if they ſhould happen to fall in with the ſhips which had ſailed from England under the command of Captain Cook, ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to proceed unmoleſted on their voyage. It was alſo reported, that the American Congreſs had given ſimilar orders to the veſſels employed in their ſervice. This intelligence being further confirmed by the private letters of ſome of the ſupercargoes, Captain Gore deemed it incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on him, in return for the liberal exceptions which our enemies had made in our favour, to refrain from embracing any opportunities of capture, which theſe might afford, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſtricteſt neutrality during the whole of his voyage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="255" facs="unknown:030274_1544_0FE57B09AEFFA978"/>Having got under ſail, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the Reſolution ſaluted the fort of Macao with eleven guns, and the ſalutation was returned with an equal number. The wind fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at five, the ſhip miſſed ſtays, and drove into ſhallow water; but an anchor being quickly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out, ſhe was hauled off without ſuſtaining any damage.</p>
                     <p>The calm continuing, we were under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of warping out into the entrance of the Typa, which we gained by eight in the evening, and remained there till nine o'clock the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning; when, being aſſiſted by a freſh eaſterly breeze, we ſtood to the ſouth between Wungboo and Potoe. At twelve a Swediſh veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſaluted us as ſhe paſſed us on her way to Europe. At four in the afternoon, the Ladrone was about two leagues diſtant in an eaſtern di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                     <p>We now ſteered ſouth half eaſt, having a freſh breeze from the eaſt-north-eaſt point, without any remarkable occurrence, till the 15th at noon; at which time, our latitude being 18° 57′, and our longitude 114° 13′ and the wind ſhifting to the north, we directed our courſe rather more to the eaſtward, with a view of ſtriking ſoundings over the Macclesfield bank. This we accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed on the 16th, at eight o'clock in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and found that the depth of water was fifty fathoms, over a bottom conſiſting of white ſand
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:030274_1545_0FE57AD2667B8060"/>
and ſhells. We judge this part of the Maccles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field ſhoals to be in the latitude of 25° 51′, and the longitude of 114° 20′; which computation exactly coincides with the poſition aſſigned in Mr. Dalrymple's map, whoſe general accuracy was confirmed, in this inſtance, by many lunar obſervations. The variation was found, in the forenoon, to be 39′ weſt.</p>
                     <p>We had ſtrong gales from the eaſt by north, on the 17th, with a rough turbulent ſea, and gloomy weather. On the ſucceeding day, the ſea continuing to run high, and the wind to blow with violence, we changed our courſe to ſouth-weſt by ſouth; and, at twelve o'clock, being in the longitude 112°, and the latitude of 12° 34′, we began to ſteer mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to the weſtward for Pulo Sapata, of which we had ſight on the 19th, about four in the afternoon. It was, at that time, twelve or fourteen miles diſtant, bearing north-weſt by weſt.</p>
                     <p>This iſland, which is denominated <hi>Sapata,</hi> from its reſembling a ſhoe in figure, is ſmall, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and unfertile. According to our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is ſituated in the latitude of 10° 4′ north, and the longitude of 109° 10′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The fury of the gale was now ſo much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and the ſea ran ſo high, that we were obliged to cloſe-reef the top-ſails. Our ſhips during the three laſt days, had out-run their reckoning at the rate of twenty miles in a day;
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:030274_1546_0FE57A6D5555D678"/>
and, as this could not be wholly attributed to the effects of a following ſea, we partly aſcribed it to a current, which, according to Captain King's calculation, had ſet, between the noon of the 19th, and the noon of the 20th, forty-two miles to the ſouth ſouth-weſtward; and is taken into the account in fixing the poſition of Sapata.</p>
                     <p>Having paſſed this iſland, we ſtood to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and, at midnight, ſounded, and found a bottom of fine ſand at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> fathoms. The violence of the wind abating in the morning of the 20th, we let out the reefs, and directed our courſe to the weſt by ſouth for Pulo Condore. Our latitude at noon was 8° 46′ north, and our longitude 106° 45′ eaſt; and, between twelve and one, we had a view of that iſland, in a weſtern direction.</p>
                     <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon, the extremes of Pulo Condore and the iſlands that are ſituated off it, bore ſouth-eaſt and ſouth-weſt by weſt; and our diſtance from the neareſt iſlands was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two miles. We ſailed to the northward of the iſlands, and ſtood towards a harbour at the ſouth-weſt end of Condore, which, having its entrance from the north-weſt, affords the beſt ſhelter during the north-eaſt monſoon. At ſix o'clock we anchored in ſix fathoms water, with the beſt bower; and the Diſcovery was kept ſteady with a ſtream anchor and cable towards the ſouth-eaſt. When moored, the extremities of
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:030274_1547_0FE57B0B3A79F498"/>
the entrance of the harbour bore weſt-north-weſt a quarter weſt, and north by weſt; the opening at the upper end bore ſouth-eaſt by eaſt three quarters eaſt; and we were about two furlong diſtant from the neareſt part of the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>We had no ſooner let go our anchors, than Captain Gore fired a gun, with a view of giving the inhabitants notice of our arrival, and drawing them towards the ſhore; but it had no effect. Early the next morning parties were diſpatched to cut wood, as Captain Gore's principal motive for touching at this iſland was to ſupply the ſhips with that article. During the afternoon a ſudden guſt of wind broke the ſtream-cable, by which the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery rode, and obliged her people to moor with the bower anchors.</p>
                     <p>As none of the iſlanders had yet made their appearance, notwithſtanding the firing of a ſecond gun, Captain Gore thought it adviſeable to go aſhore in ſearch of them, that we might loſe no time in opening a traffic for ſuch proviſions as the place could furniſh us with. For this purpoſe, he deſired Captain King to accompany him in the morning of the 22d: and, as the wind, at that time blew violently from the eaſtward, they did not think it conſiſtent with prudence to coaſt in their boats to the town, which ſtands on the eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſide of the iſland, but rowed round the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern point of the harbour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="259" facs="unknown:030274_1548_0FE57AFF282A1AC0"/>They had proceeded along the ſhore for the ſpace of about two miles, when perceiving a road that led into a wood, they l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nded. Here Captain King left Captain Gore, and, attended by a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman, and four armed ſailors, purſued the path, which appeared to point directly acroſs the iſland. They paſſed through a thick wood, up a hill of conſiderable ſteepneſs, to the diſtance of a mile, when, after they had deſcended through a wood of equal extent, on the other ſide, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in an open, level, ſandy country, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with groves of cabbage-palm and cocoa-nut trees, and cultivated ſpots of tobacco and rice.</p>
                     <p>Here they deſcried two huts, ſituate on the extremity of the wood, to which they directed their march. Before they came up to theſe habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, they were obſerved by two men, who inſtantaneouſly ran away from them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the peaceable and ſupplicating geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures our party could deviſe. On reaching the huts, Captain King, apprehending that the fight of ſo many armed men might terrify the natives, commanded his attendants to remain without, while he entered and reconnoitred alone. In one of the huts he found an elderly man, who was in a great conſternation, and was preparing to retire with the moſt valuable of his effects that he was able to carry. Mr. King, however, found means, in a very ſhort time, ſo entirely to diſſipate his
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:030274_1549_0FE57ADDDF18AD98"/>
terrors, that he came out, and called to the two iſlanders, who were running away, to return.</p>
                     <p>Captain King and the old man now quickly came to a perfect underſtanding. A few ſigns, particularly that ſignificant one of ſhewing a handfull of dollars, and then pointing to a herd of buffa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oes, as well as to the fowls that were run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in conſiderable numbers about the huts, left him under no doubts with reſpect to the real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Captain's viſit. He immediately pointed to the ſpot where the town was ſituated and made Mr. King comprehend, that, by repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, all his neceſſities would be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>By this time the two fugitives had returned, and one of them was ordered by the old man to conduct our party to the town, as ſoon as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, of which they were not aware, ſhould be removed. On their firſt leaving the wood, a herd of buffaloes, conſiſting of at leaſt twenty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>an towards them, toſſing up their heads, ſnuffing the air, and making a hideous roaring. They had followed our people to the huts, and now remained at a ſmall diſtance drawn up in a body; and the old man ſignified to Captain King, that it would be extremely dangerous for our party to move, till the buffaloes had been driven into the woods: but theſe animals had become ſo enraged at the ſight of them, that this was not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed without ſome difficulty. The men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:030274_1550_0FE57A7D14DAAF20"/>
were unable to effect it; but, to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of Captain King and his companions, they called ſome little boys to their aſſiſtance, who ſpeedily drove the animals out of ſight. It after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appeared, that, in driving the buffaloes, and ſecuring them, which is done by putting a rope through a hole made in their noſtrils, it was cuſtomary to employ little boys, who, at times when the men would not venture to approach them, could ſtroke and handle them with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.</p>
                     <p>After the buffaloes had been driven off, our party were conducted to the town, which was about a mile diſtant; the road to it lying through a deep whitiſh ſand. It ſtands near the ſea-ſide, at the bottom of a retired bay, which affords good ſhelter during the prevalence of the ſouth-weſt monſoon.</p>
                     <p>This town is compoſed of between twenty and thirty houſes, which are built contiguous to each other. Beſides theſe, there are ſix or ſeven others diſperſed about the beach. The roof, the two ends, and the ſide that fronts the country, are conſtructed of reeds in a neat manner. The oppoſite ſide which faces the ſea, is perfectly open; but the inhabitants, by means of a kind of ſcreens made of bamboo, can exclude or admit as much of the air and ſun as they think proper. There are likewiſe other large ſcreens, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſerve to divide, as occaſion may
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:030274_1551_0FE57B1E8469FD58"/>
require, the ſingle room, of which the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, properly ſpeaking, conſiſts into ſeperate apartments.</p>
                     <p>The iſlander who acted as a guide to our party, conducted them to the largeſt houſe in the town, belonging to the chief, or (as the natives ſtyled him) the Captain. At each extremity of this houſe was a room, ſeparated by a partition of reeds from the middle ſpace, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encloſed on either ſide, and was furniſhed with partition ſcreens like the others. There was alſo a penthouſe, which projected to the diſtance of four or five feet from the roof, and ran the whole length on each ſide. Some Chineſe paintings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting perſons of both ſexes in ludicrous atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, were hung at each end of the middle room. In this apartment our people were requeſted to ſeat themſelves on mats, and <hi>betel</hi> was preſented to them.</p>
                     <p>Captain King, by producing money, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at different objects that were in ſight, met with no difficulty in making one of the company, who ſeemed to be the principal perſon among them, comprehend the chief deſign of his viſit; and as readily underſtood from him, that the Chief, or Captain, was, at this time, abſent, but would quickly return; and that no purchaſe of any kind could be made without his concurrence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>

                        <pb n="263" facs="unknown:030274_1552_0FE57B4CC457ADD8"/>Our party took advantage of the opportunity afforded them by this circumſtance, to walk about the town: and did not omit ſearching, though ineffectually, for the remains of a fort, which ſome of our countrymen had built in the year 1702, near the ſpot they were now upon <note n="*" place="bottom">The Engliſh ſettled on this iſland in 1702, and brought with them a party of Macaſſer ſoldiers, who were hired to contribute their aſſiſtance in erecting a fort; but the preſident of the factory not fulfilling his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with them, they were determined upon revenge, and one night, took an opportunity of murdering all the Engliſh in the fort. Thoſe who were without the fort, hearing a noiſe, were greatly alarmed, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their boats, narrowly eſcaped with their lives to the Johore do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, where they met with very humane treatment. Some of theſe afterwards repaired to Benjar-Maſſean, in the iſland of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rneo, for the purpoſe of forming a ſettlement.</note>. On their return to the houſe of the Captain, they were ſorry to find, that he had not yet arrived, particularly as the time which had been fixed by Captain Gore, for their return to the boat, was nearly expired. The inhabitants deſired them to protract their ſtay, and even propoſed their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the night there, offering to accommodate them in the beſt manner they were able.</p>
                     <p>Mr. King had obſerved, when he was in the houſe before, (and now remarked it the more) that the perſon above-mentioned frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into one of the end rooms, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a ſhort time, before he anſwered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:030274_1553_0FE57B27E01B4CA0"/>
that were put to him. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Mr. King to ſuſpect, that the Captain had been there the whole time, though for reaſons with which he himſelf was beſt acquainted, he did not think proper to make his appearance. He was confirmed in his opinion, by being ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as he attempted to enter the room. At length, it evidently appeared, that Mr. King's ſuſpicions were well founded; for, on his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to depart, the perſon who had paſſed in and out ſo many times, came from the room with a paper in his hand, and gave it to him for his peruſal; and he was not a little ſurpriſed at finding it to be a kind of certificate, written in the French language, of which the following is a tranſlation.</p>

                     <p>Captain King returned the paper, with many proteſtations of our people being the Mandarin's
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:030274_1554_0FE57A5FB6A8DBE0"/>
good friends, and requeſted he might be informed that they hoped he would do them the favour to pay them a viſit on board the ſhips, that they might convince him of it. They now took their leave, being, upon the whole, well ſatisfied with what had happened, but full of conjectures with regard to this extraordinary French paper. Three of the inhabitants propoſing to attend them back, they readily accepted the offer, and returned by the way they had come.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore was extremely pleaſed at ſeeing them again, for, as they had exceeded their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time by almoſt an hour, he began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain apprehenſions for their ſafety, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to march after them. He and his party had, during Mr. King's abſence, been uſefully oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, in loading the boat with the cabbage-palm, which is very beautiful in this bay. The three guides were each preſented with a dollar, as a compenſation for their trouble; and a bottle of rum for the mandarin was entruſted to their care. One of them thought proper to accompany our people on board.</p>
                     <p>The Captains Gore and King rejoined the ſhips at two o'clock in the afternoon; and ſeveral of our ſhooting parties returned from the woods about the ſame time, having met with no great ſucceſs, though they had ſeen a conſiderable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of birds and other animals, ſome of which
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:030274_1555_0FE57AD3EE068820"/>
will be noticed in the courſe of the preſent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Six men, in a proa, rowed up to the ſhips at five o'clock, from the upper end of the harbour; and one of them, who was a perſon of a decent appearance, introduced himſelf to Captain Gore with an eaſe and politeneſs, which indicated that he had been accuſtomed to paſs his time in other company than what Condore afforded. He brought with him the French certificate above tranſcribed, and gave us to underſtand, that he was the Mandarin mentioned in it. He could ſpeak a few Portugueſe words; but, as none of us had learned that language, we were under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of having recourſe to a black man on board, who was acquainted with the Malayan tongue, which is the general language of theſe iſlanders, and was underſtood by the Mandarin.</p>
                     <p>After ſome previous converſation, he informed us, that he profeſſed the Chriſtian faith, and had been baptized by the appellation of Luco; that he had been ſent to this iſland in the preceding Auguſt, from Sai-gon, the capital of Cochin-China, and had waited, ſince that time, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſome French veſſels, which he was to conduct to a ſafe harbour, on the coaſt of Cochin-China, not above one day's ſail from Condore. We told him that we were not of the French nation, but of the Engliſh; and aſked
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:030274_1556_0FE57A69E2340EC8"/>
him, whether he had not heard, that thoſe two kingdoms were now at war with each other. He replied in the affirmative; but intimated to us at the ſame time, that it was a matter of indifference to him to what nation the ſhips he was directed to wait for appertained, provided their object was to enter into traffic with the people of Cochin-China.</p>
                     <p>He now produced another paper, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted us to peruſe. This was a letter ſealed up, and addreſſed "To the Captains of any European ſhips that may touch at Condore:" Though we ſuppoſed, that this letter was particularly intended for French veſſels, yet, as the direction compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all European Captains, and at Luco was deſirous of our reading it, we broke the ſeal, and perceived that it was written by the ſame biſhop who wrote the certificate.</p>
                     <p>Its contents were to the following purport<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "That he had reaſon to expect, by ſome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence lately received from Europe, that a ſhip would, in a ſhort time, come to Cochin-China; in conſequence of which news, he had prevailed on the court to diſpatch a Mandarin (the bearer) to Pulo Condore, to wait its arrival: that if the veſſel ſhould touch there, the Captain might either ſend to him, by the bearer of this letter, an account of his having arrived or truſt himſelf to the direction of the Mandarin, who would pilot the ſhip into a commodious port in Cochin-China,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:030274_1557_0FE57B0D25C0FE48"/>
not exceeding a day's ſail from Pulo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore: that if he ſhould he inclined to continue at this iſland till the return of the meſſenger, proper interpreters ſhould be ſent back, and any other aſſiſtance, which might be pointed out in a letter, ſhould be furniſhed; that there was no occaſion for being more particular, of which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander himſelf muſt be ſenſible." This epiſtle had the ſame date with the certificate, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Luco, without our taking any copy of it.</p>
                     <p>From the whole of the Mandarin's conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as well as from this letter, we had little doubt that the veſſel he expected was a French one. We found, at the ſame time, that he was deſirous of not loſing his errand, and was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to become our pilot. We could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from him the preciſe buſineſs which the ſhip he was waiting for deſigned to proſecute in Cochin-China. The black, indeed, who acted as our interpreter on this occaſion, was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly dull and ſtupid: we ſhould, therefore, be ſorry, having ſuch imperfect means of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to run the hazard of miſleading our readers by any of our own conjectures, relative to the object of the Mandarin's viſit to Pulo Condore. We ſhall only add, that he acquainted us, that the French veſſels might perhaps have touched at Tirnon, and from thence ſail to Cochin-China; and, as no intelligence of them had reached him,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:030274_1558_0FE57ABD8068CC20"/>
he imagined that this was moſt likely to have been the caſe.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore afterwards inquired, what ſupplies could be procured from this iſland. Luco re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that there, were two buffaloes belonging to him, which were at our ſervice; and that there were conſiderable numbers of thoſe animals on the iſland, which might be purchaſed for four or five dollars each; but Captain Gore thinking that ſum very moderate, and appearing inclined to give a much greater for them, the price was ſpeedily aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to ſeven or eight dollars.</p>
                     <p>On the 23d, early in the morning, the launches of both our ſhips were diſpatched to the town, to bring away the buffaloes which we had given orders for the purchaſe of; but they were under the neceſſity of waiting till it was high water, not being able, at any other time to make their way through the opening at the head of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Upon their arrival at the town, the ſurf broke againſt the beach with ſuch fury, that it was not without the greateſt difficulty that each of the launches brought a buffaloe on board in the evening, and the officers employed in this ſervice declared it as their opinion, that, not only from the violence of the ſurf, but alſo from the feroſity of the buffaloes, it would be highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent to attempt to bring off any more this way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="270" facs="unknown:030274_1559_0FE57A8835EF4810"/>We had procured eight of theſe animals, and were now at a loſs, in what manner we ſhould get them on board. We could not conveniently kill more than juſt ſerved for one day's conſumption, as, in the climate in which we now were, meat would not keep till the next day. After conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Mandarin on this point, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that the remainder of the buffaloes ſhould be driven through the wood, and over the hill down to the bay, where out two Captains had landed the preceding day; which being ſheltered from the wind, was conſequently more free from ſurf.</p>
                     <p>This plan was accordingly executed; but the intractableneſs and amazing ſtrength of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals rendered it a ſlow and difficult operation. The mode of conducting them was, by putting ropes through their noſtrils, and round their horns; but when they were once enraged at the ſight of our people, they became ſo furious, that they ſometimes tore aſunder the cartilage of the noſtril, through which the ropes paſſed, and ſet themſelves at liberty; at other times, they broke the trees, to which it was frequently found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to faſten them. On ſuch occaſions, all the endeavours of our men, for the recovery of them, would have been unſucceſsful without the aid of ſome little boys, whom the buffaloes would ſuffer to approach them, and by whoſe puerile managements their rage was quickly appeaſed:
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:030274_1560_0FE57AD5DB9EF410"/>
and when, at length, they had been brought up to the beach, it was by their aſſiſtance, in twiſting ropes about their legs, in the manner they were directed, that our people were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>bled to throw them down, and, by that means, to get them into the boats.</p>
                     <p>A circumſtance relative to theſe animals, which we conſidered as no leſs ſingular than their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs towards children, and ſeeming affection for them, was, that they had not been a whole day on board, before they were as tame as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Captain King kept two of them, one of each ſex, for a conſiderable time, which became great favorites with the ſeamen. Thinking that a breed of animals of ſuch magnitude and ſtrength, ſome of which weighed, when dreſſed, ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, would be an acquiſition of ſome value, he intended to have brought them with him to England; but that deſign was fruſtrated by an incurable hurt which one of them received at ſea.</p>
                     <p>The buffaloes were not all brought on board before the 28th. We had no reaſon, however, to regret the time occupied in this ſervice, ſince in that interval, two wells of excellent water had been found, in conſequence of which diſcovery, part of the companies of both ſhips had been employed in providing a competent ſupply of it. We likewiſe procured a quantity of wood: ſo that a ſhorter ſtay would be requiſite, in the
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:030274_1561_0FE57ABF055D0818"/>
Straits of Sunda, for recruiting our ſtock of the neceſſary articles. A party had alſo been engaged in drawing the ſeine, at the head of the harbour, where they caught a great number of good fiſh; and another party had been buſied in cutting down the cabbage-palm, which was boiled and ſerved out with the meat. Beſides, as we obtained but an inconſiderable ſupply of cordage at Macao, the repairs of our rigging had become an object of conſtant attention, and demanded all the time we could conveniently ſpare.</p>
                     <p>Pulo Condore is elevated and mountainous, and is encompaſſed by ſeveral iſlands of inferior extent, ſome of which are about two miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and others leſs than one mile. Its name ſignifies the iſland of Calabaſhes, being derived from two Malay words, <hi>Pulo</hi> implying an iſland, and <hi>Condore</hi> a Calabaſh, great quantities of which fruit are here produced. It is of a ſemi-circular form, and extends ſeven or eight miles from the moſt ſoutherly point, in the direction of north-eaſt. Its breadth, in any part, does not exceed two miles.</p>
                     <p>From the weſternmoſt extreme, the land, for the ſpace of about four miles, trends to the ſouth-eaſtward; and oppoſite this part of the coaſt ſtands an iſland, called, by Monſieur D' Apres, in the <hi>Neptune Oriental,</hi> Little Condore, which extends two miles in a ſimilar direction. This ſituation of the two iſlands affords a ſecure and
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:030274_1562_0FE57A912959FBB8"/>
convenient harbour, the entrance into which is from the north-weſtward. The diſtance of the two oppoſite coaſts from each other is about three quarters of a mile, excluſive of a border of coral rock, running along each ſide, and ſtretching about a hundred yards from the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore.</p>
                     <p>The anchorage in this harbour is very good, the depth of water being from five to eleven fathoms; but the bottom is ſo ſoft and clayey, that we meet with conſiderable difficulty in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our anchors. There is ſhallow water towards the bottom of the harbour, for the extent of about half a mile, beyond which the two iſlands make ſo near an approach to each other, that they leave only a paſſage at high water for boats. The moſt commodious watering-place is at a beach on the eaſtern ſide, where we found a ſmall ſtream that ſupplied us with fourteen or fifteen tons of water in a day.</p>
                     <p>With regard both to animal and vegetable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, Pulo Condore is greatly improved ſince the time it was viſited by Dampier. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that navigator, nor the compiler of the Eaſt-India Directory, mention any other quadrupeds than hogs, (which are ſaid to be extremely ſcarce) lizards, and guanoes; and the latter aſſerts, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the authority of Monſieur Dedier, a French engineer, who ſurveyed this iſland about the year 1720, that none of thoſe fruits and eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ulent plants, which are ſo frequently met with in the
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:030274_1563_0FE57B169CAB3FA8"/>
other parts of India, are to be found here, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>chibbols</hi> (a ſmall ſort of onion) water-melons, little black beans, ſmall gourds, and a few pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes. At preſent, beſides the buffaloes, of which animals we were informed there were ſeveral large herds, we purchaſed from the inhabitants ſome remarkably fine hogs, of the Chineſe breed. They brought us three or four of a wild ſpecies; and our ſportſmen affirmed, that they perceived their tracks in many parts of the woods, which likewiſe abounded with monkies and ſquirrels; theſe, however, were ſo ſhy, that it was difficult to ſhoot them.</p>
                     <p>One ſpecies of the ſquirrel, here obſerved, was of a beautiful gloſſy black; and another ſort had brown and white ſtripes. This is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the flying ſquirrel, from its being furniſhed with a thin membrane, reſembling the wing of a bat, which extends on each ſide of the belly, from the neck to the thighs, and, on the animal's ſtretching out its legs, ſpreads, and enables it to fly from one tree to another at a conſiderable diſtance. Great numbers of lizards were ſeen; but we do not know that any of our people ſaw the guano, or another animal which Dampier <note n="*" place="bottom">Dampier's Voyages, Vol. I. p. 392.</note> has deſcribed as reſembling the guano, though far ſuperior in ſize.</p>
                     <p>Among the vegetable improvements of Pulo Condore, may be reckoned the fields of rice
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:030274_1564_0FE57ACA6AA19300"/>
that were obſerved: cocoa-nuts, pomegranates, oranges, ſhaddocks, plantains, and various ſorts of pompious, were alſo found here; though, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſhaddocks and plaintains, in no great quantities.</p>
                     <p>From what we have already mentioned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Biſhop of Adran<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is probable, that the iſland is indebted to the French for theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, which were introduced, perhaps, for the purpoſe of rendering it a more convenient place of refreſhment for any of their veſſels that may be deſtined for Cochin-China or Cambodia. Should they have formed, or intend to form any ſettlement in thoſe regions, it is undoubtedly well ſituated for that purpoſe, as well as for annoying the commerce of their enemies, in time of war.</p>
                     <p>Though the woods are plentifully ſtocked with the feathered game, our ſportſmen had very little ſucceſs in their purſuit of them. One of our gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen was ſo fortunate as to ſhoot a wild hen; and all our ſhooting parties were unanimous in declaring, that they heard the crowings of the cocks on every ſide, which they ſaid reſembled that of our common cock, but was more ſhrill. They obſerved ſeveral of them on the wing, which, however, were extremely ſhy. The hen that was ſhot was of a ſpeckled hue, and of the ſame ſhape with a full-grown pullet of this country, though ſomewhat inferior in magnitude. Monſieur Sonnerat has, in a long diſſertation,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:030274_1565_0FE57AAAE5C43298"/>
endeavoured to prove, that he was the firſt perſon who aſcertained the country to which this uſeful and beautiful bird belongs, and denies that Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier met with it at this iſland.</p>
                     <p>The land near the harbour is a continued lofty hill, richly adorned, from the ſummit to the edge of the water, with a great variety of fine high trees. Among others, we ſaw that which is called by Dampier the tar-tree; but perceived none that were tapped, in the manner deſcribed by him.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of Pulo Condore, who are fugitives from Cochin-China and Cambodia, are not numerous. They are very ſwarthy in their complexion, of a ſhort ſtature, and of a weak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy aſpect; and, as far as we had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of judging, of a gentle diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>We continued at this iſland till Friday the 28th of January; and, when the Mandarin took his leave of us, Captain Gore gave him, at his requeſt, a letter of recommendation to the commanders of any other veſſels that might put in here. He alſo beſtowed on him a handſome preſent, and gave him a letter for the Biſhop of Adran, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a teleſcope, which he deſired might be preſented to him as a compliment for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours we had received, through his means, at Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Condore.</p>
                     <p>The latitude of the harbour at Condore is 8° 40′ north; its longitude, deduced from many lunar

                     <p>WE weighed anchor on the 28th, and had no ſooner cleared the harbour, than we ſtood to the ſouth-ſouth-weſt for Pulo Timoan. On Sunday the 30th, at twelve o'clock, our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:030274_1568_0FE57AC0E89A4598"/>
by obſervation, being 5° north, and our lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 104° 45′ eaſt, we changed our courſe to ſouth three quarters weſt, having a gentle north-eaſterly breeze, attended with fair weather.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, at two o'clock, our depth of water was forty-five fathoms, over a bottom of fine white ſand. The latitude, at this time, was 4° 4′ north, the longitude 104° 29′ eaſt, and the variation of the compaſs 31′ eaſt. We had ſight of Pulo Timoan at one in the afternoon; and, at three, it was nine or ten miles diſtant, bearing ſouth-ſouth-weſt three quarters weſt. This iſland is high and well furniſhed with wood, and has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmall iſles lying off it to the weſt.</p>
                     <p>At five o'clock, Pulo Puiſſang was ſeen, in the direction of ſouth by eaſt three quarters eaſt; and, at nine, the weather being foggy, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the effect of ſome current, out-run our reckoning, we were cloſe upon Pulo Aor, in the latitude of 2° 46′ north, and the longitude of 104° 37′ eaſt, before we were perfectly aware of it; in conſequence of which we hauled the wind to the eaſt-ſouth-eaſtward. This courſe we proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted till midnight, and then ſteered ſouth-ſouth eaſt for the Straits of Banca.</p>
                     <p>At noon, on the firſt day of February, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was 1° 20′ north, and the longitude, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from a conſiderable number of lunar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, was 105° eaſt. We now ſtood to the ſouth by eaſt; and towards ſun-ſet, the weather
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:030274_1569_0FE57A9FCBF61A70"/>
being clear and fine, we had a view of Pulo-Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jang; the body of the iſland bearing weſt-north-weſt, and the little iſlands, ſituated to the ſouth-eaſt of it, weſt half ſouth, at the diſtance of ſeven leagues. Our latitude, at the ſame time, was 53′ north.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday the 2d, at eight o'clock in the morning, we tried for ſoundings, continuing the ſame practice every hour, till we had paſſed the Straits of Sunda, and ſtruck ground with twenty-three fathoms of line. At twelve, when our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by obſervation, was 22′ ſouth, our longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 105° 15′ eaſt, and our depth of water twenty fathoms, we arrived in ſight of the ſmall iſlands known by the name of Dominis, lying off the eaſtern part of Lingen, and bearing from north 62° weſt to north 800 weſt, at the diſtance of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſixteen miles.</p>
                     <p>At this time we paſſed a great quantity of wood, drifting on the water; and, at one o'clock in the afternoon, Pulo Taya made its appearance, in the direction of ſouth-weſt by weſt, ſeven leagues diſtant. It is a ſmall elevated iſland, with two round peaks, and two detached rocks to the northward of it. When we were abreaſt of this iſland, our ſoundings were fifteen fathoms. We obſerved, during this and the preceding day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantities of a ſcum or ſpawn of a reddiſh hue, floating on the ſea, in a ſouthern direction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="281" facs="unknown:030274_1570_0FE57AE803F25C58"/>We had ſight of the Three Iſlands at day-break on the 3d; and not long afterwards, ſaw Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopin Hill, in the iſland of Banca. At twelve o'clock, this hill, which forms the north-eaſtern point of the entrance of the Straits of Banca, was ſix leagues diſtant, bearing ſouth-eaſt half ſouth. Our depth of water, at that time, was ſeventeen fathoms; our latitude, by obſervation, 1° 48′ ſouth; our longitude 105° 3′ eaſt; and there was no perceptible variation in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. Having got to the weſt of the ſhoal, named Frederic Endric, we entered the ſtraits between two and three, and bore away towards the ſouth; and, in the courſe of the afternoon, Monopin Hill bearing due eaſt, we aſcertained its latitude to be 2° 3′ ſouth, and its longitude 105° 18′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>About nine in the evening, a boat came off from the Banca ſhore; but after the crew had rowed round the ſhips, they immediately went away. We hailed them, in the Malayan tongue, to come on board, but no anſwer was returned. At midnight, finding that there was ſtrong tide againſt us, we let go our anchors in twelve fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms water, Monopin Hill bearing north 29° weſt.</p>
                     <p>In the morning of the 4th, after meeting with ſome difficulty in weighing our anchors, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſtiff tenacious quality of the ground, we proceeded down the ſtraits with the tide, the
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:030274_1571_0FE57B389B6DC638"/>
inconſiderable wind we had from the north dying away as the day advanced. At twelve o'clock the tide beginning to make againſt us, and there being a perfect calm, we caſt anchor in thirteen fathoms water, at the diſtance of about one league from what is denominated the Third Point, on the Sumatra ſhore; Monopin Hill bearing north 54° weſt, and our latitude being 2° 22′ ſouth, longitude 105° 38′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>We weighed at three in the afternoon, and continued our courſe through the ſtraits with a gentle breeze. At eight o'clock, we were abreaſt of the Second Point, which we paſſed within two miles, in ſeventeen fathoms water; a ſufficient proof, that veſſels may border upon this point with ſafety. About midnight, we anchored again, on account of the tide, in thirteen fathoms; Mount Permiſſang, in the iſland of Banca, being in the direction of north 7° eaſt, and the firſt Point bearing ſouth 54° eaſt, at the diſtance of nine or ten miles.</p>
                     <p>The next morning we weighed anchor, and ſtood on to the ſouth-eaſtward, and at ten o'clock, we paſſed a ſmall ſhoal, ſituated in a line with the iſland of Luſepara and the Firſt Point, and five miles diſtant from the latter. At twelve, Luſepara bearing ſouth 57° ½ eaſt, at the diſtance of four miles, its latitude was determined by us to be 3° 10′ ½ ſouth, and its longitude 106° 15′ eaſt. The difference of longitude between the
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:030274_1572_0FE57B3717C18B00"/>
iſland of Luſepara, which ſtands in the ſouthern entrance of the Straits of Banca, and Monopin Hill, which forms one ſide of the northern en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, we found to be 55′.</p>
                     <p>In paſſing theſe ſtraits, ſhips may make a nearer approach to the coaſt of Sumatra than to that of Banca. There are ten, eleven, twelve, or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen fathoms, free from ſhoals and rocks, at the diſtance of two or three miles from the coaſt; the lead, however, is the moſt certain guide. The country, even to the edge of the water, is covered with wood; and the ſhores are ſo low, that the land is overflowed by the ſea, which waſhes the trunks of the trees. To this flat and marſhy ſituation of the Sumatra ſhore, may be aſcribed thoſe thick fogs and vapours, which were every morning perceived by us, not without ſome degree of dread and horror, to hang over the iſland, till they were diſſipated by the ſolar rays. The ſhores of Banca are much bolder, and the inland country riſes to a moderate elevation, and ſeems to abound with wood. We frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved fires on this iſland during the night; but none on the oppoſite coaſt. The tide runs at the rate of between two and three miles an hour through the ſtraits.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the 6th, in the morning, we paſſed to the weſt of Luſepara, at the diſtance of four or five miles; our ſoundings, in general, being five or ſix fathoms, and never leſs than four. We
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:030274_1573_0FE57B4049CDA4C0"/>
afterwards ſtood to the ſouth by eaſt; and having increaſed our depth of water to ſeven fathoms, and brought Luſepara to bear due north, we changed our courſe to ſouth by weſt, frequently making uſe of the lead, and hauling out a little, whenever we happened to ſhoal our water. We ſtill found the ſoundings on the ſide of Sumatra to be regular, and ſhoaling gradually, as we came nearer to the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>At five o'clock in the afternoon, we deſcried the Siſters, in the direction of ſouth by weſt half weſt; and, at ſeven, we caſt anchor in ten fathoms water, near three leagues to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of thoſe iſlands. The weather was cloſe and fultry, with light winds, blowing, for the moſt part, from the north-weſt, but occaſionally ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round to the north-eaſt; and in the courſe of the night, much lightning was obſerved over Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra.</p>
                     <p>The following morning, at five, we weighed and made ſail; and in three hours afterwards we were cloſe in with the Siſters. Theſe are two iſlands of very ſmall extent, plentifully ſtocked with wood, ſituated in the latitude of 5° ſouth, and the longitude of 106° 12′ eaſt, nearly ſouth and north from each other, and encompaſſed by a reef of coral rocks; the whole circuit of which is four or five miles. At twelve o'clock, we had ſight of the iſland of Java; the north-weſtern extreme of which (Cape St. Nicholas) bore ſouth;
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:030274_1574_0FE57B4EADB76650"/>
North Iſland, near the ſhore of Sumatra, ſouth 27° weſt; and the Siſters north 27° eaſt, at the diſtance of twelve or thirteen miles. Our latitude, at the ſame time, was 5° 21′ ſouth, and our longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 105° 57′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>About four in the afternoon we perceived two veſſels in the Straits of Sunda; one of which lay at anchor near the Mid-channel Iſland, the other nearer the ſhore of Java; and as we did not know to what nation they might belong, we thought proper to prepare our ſhips for action. At ſix o'clock, we dropped our anchors in twenty-five fathoms water, about four miles eaſt by ſouth from North Iſland. Here we remained the whole night, during which we had very heavy thunder and lightning to the north-weſt; the wind blowing in light breezes from the ſame quarter, attended with violent rain.</p>
                     <p>On the 8th, about eight o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we weighed, and proceeded through the Straits of Sunda, the tide ſetting towards the ſouth, as it had done all the preceding night At ten, the wind failing, we anchored again in thirty-five fathoms; an elevated iſland, or rather rock, named the Grand Toque, bearing ſouth by eaſt. Being, at that time, not above two miles from the ſhips before mentioned, which now hoiſted Dutch colours, Captain Gore ſent a boat on board to procure intelligence. The rain ſtill
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:030274_1575_0FE57B200C2D10C0"/>
continued, accompanied with thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>The boat returned early in the afternoon, with information that the larger of the two veſſels was a Dutch Eaſt-Indiaman, bound for Europe; and the other a packet from Batavia, with inſtructions for the ſeveral ſhips lying in the Straits. It is cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary for the Dutch ſhips, when their cargoes are almoſt completed, to quit Batavia, on account of its very unwholeſome climate, and repair to ſome of the more healthy iſlands in the Straits, where they wait for their diſpatches, and the remainder of their lading. The Indiaman, notwithſtanding this precaution, had loſt four men, ſince ſhe had left Batavia, and had as many more whoſe lives were deſpaired of. She had remained here a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and was now on the point of proceeding to Cracatoa to take in water, having juſt received final orders by the packet.</p>
                     <p>At ſeven o'clock the next morning, we weighed anchor, and ſteered to the ſouth-weſtward through the Straits, taking care to keep cloſe in with the iſlands on the Sumatra ſhore, for the purpoſe of avoiding a rock near Mid-channel Iſland, which was ſituated on our left.</p>
                     <p>Between ten and eleven, Captain King was ordered by Captain Gore to make ſail towards a Dutch veſſel that now came in ſight to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and which we imagined was from Europe; and, according to the nature of the information
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:030274_1576_0FE57B2BD5449C50"/>
that might be obtained from her, either join him at Cracatoa, where he deſigned to ſtop, in order to furniſh the ſhip with arrack; or to proceed to the ſouth-eaſtern extremity of Prince's Iſland, and there provide a ſupply of water, and wait for him. In compliance with theſe inſtructions, Captain King bore down towards the Dutch ſhip, which, in a ſhort time after, caſt anchor to the eaſtward: when the current ſetting with great force in the Straits to the ſouth-weſt, and the wind ſlackening, Mr. King was unable to fetch her: having therefore got as near her as the tide would allow, he alſo anchored. He immediately ſent Mr. Williamſon, in the cutter, with orders to get on board the Dutch veſſel, if poſſible; but, as ſhe lay at the diſtance of almoſt a mile, and the tide ran with great rapidity, the boat dropped faſt aſtern; in conſequence of which, Captain King having made the ſignal to return, began, without delay, to veer away the cable, and ſent out a buoy aſtern, to aſſiſt the boat's crew in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on board again.</p>
                     <p>Our poverty with reſpect to cordage, was, on this occaſion, very conſpicuous: for there was not, in the Diſcovery's ſtore-room, a ſingle coil of rope, to fix to the buoy; ſo that her people were under the neceſſity of veering away two cables, and the greater part of their running rigging, before the boat, which was driving very rapidly to the ſouthward, could fetch the buoy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="288" facs="unknown:030274_1577_0FE57C008EA2D768"/>Captain King was now obliged to wait till the force of the tide ſhould abate; and this did not happen till the following morning, when Mr. Williamſon went on board the Dutch ſhip, and was informed, that ſhe had been ſeven months from Europe, and three from the Cape of Good Hope; that, before her depart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re, the kings of France and Spain had declared war againſt his Britannic Majeſty; and that ſhe had left Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hughes at the Cape, with a ſquadron of men of war, and alſo a fleet of Eaſt-India ſhips. Mr. Williamſon being, at the ſame time, aſſured, that the water of Cracatoa was extremely good, and that the Dutch always preferred it to that of Prince's Iſland, Captain King determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the Reſolution at the former place. He therefore, taking the advantage of a fair breeze, weighed, and made ſail towards the iſland of Cracatoa, where he ſoon after perceived her at anchor; but the tide ſetting forcibly againſt him, and the wind failing, he again thought proper to caſt anchor, at the diſtance of near two leagues from the Reſolution, and immediately diſpatched a boat on board, to communicate to Captain Gore the intelligence procured by Mr. Williamſon.</p>
                     <p>When the Reſolution ſaw her conſort preparing to come too, ſhe fired her guns, and diſplayed the ſignal for leading a-head, by hoiſting an Engliſh jack at the enſign ſtaff. This was intended to prevent the Diſcovery's anchoring, on account of
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:030274_1578_0FE57BEDF6B4AF38"/>
the foul ground, which the maps on board the Reſolution plated in this ſituation. However, as Captain King met with none, but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, found a muddy bottom, and good anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ground, at the depth of ſixty fathoms, he remained faſt till the return of the boat, which brought him orders to proceed to Prince's Iſland the enſuing morning. He was, at this time, about two miles diſtant from the ſhore; the peak of Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoa bearing north-weſt by north, Prince's Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and ſouth-weſt by weſt, and Bantam Point eaſt-north-eaſt half eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Cracatoa is the ſouthernmoſt of a cluſter of iſlands lying in the entrance of the ſtraits of Sunda. It has a lofty peaked hill at its ſouthern extremity<note n="*" place="bottom">The iſland of Sambouricou, or Tamarin, which ſtands twelve or thirteen miles to the northward of Cracatoa, may eaſily be miſtaken for the latter, ſince it has a hill of nearly the ſame figure and dimentions, ſituate likewiſe near its ſouth end.</note>, which is ſituated in the latitude of 6° 9′ ſouth, and the longitude of 105° 15′ eaſt. The whole circumference of the iſland does not exceed nine miles. Off its north-eaſtern extreme is a ſmall iſland, forming the road where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution anchored; and within a reef runing off the ſouthern end of the latter, there is tolerable ſhelter againſt all northerly winds, with twenty-ſeven fathoms water in the mid-channel, and eighteen near the reef. Towards the north-weſt,
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:030274_1579_0FE57BF227EAC7D0"/>
there is a narrow paſſage between the two iſlands for boats.</p>
                     <p>The ſhore that conſtitutes the weſt ſide of the road, runs in a north-weſterly direction, and has a bank of coral extending into the ſea, about a third of the length of a cable, which renders landing difficult for boats, except at the time of high water; but the anchoring-ground is very good, and clear of rocks. The place where the Reſolution procured a ſupply of water is a ſmall ſpring, abreaſt of the ſouthern extreme of the ſmall iſland, at no great diſtance from the ſea-ſide. To the ſouthward there is a ſpring, whoſe water is extremely hot, and is uſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as a bath. Whilſt we lay off the ſouth end of this iſland, the maſter was ſent aſhore, in a boat, to ſearch for water; but, after he had landed with ſome difficulty, he returned without ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Cracatoa conſiſts of elevated land, gradually riſing on all ſides from the ſea; and is entirely covered with trees, except a few ſpots which have been cleared by the natives for the purpoſe of forming rice fields. The population of the iſland is very inconſiderable. Its Chief is dependent on the King of Bantam, to whom the Chiefs of all the other iſlands in the ſtraits are alſo ſubject. The coral reefs afford ſmall turtles in abundance; but other refreſhments are exceedingly ſcarce, and are ſold at a very exorbitant price. This
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:030274_1580_0FE57BEC0F8FD748"/>
iſland is conſidered as very healthy, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the neighbouring countries.</p>
                     <p>The latitude of the road where the Reſolution caſt anchor is 8° 6′ ſouth; its longitude, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, 105° 36′ eaſt, and by Mr. Bayly's time-keeper, 104° 48′ eaſt. The variation of the compaſs was 1° weſt. It is high water, on the full and change days, at ſeven o'clock in the morning; and the water riſes three feet two inches perpendicular.</p>
                     <p>About eight in the evening the wind began to blew freſh from the weſt, accompanied with violent thunder, lightning, and rain. The next morning (the 11th) at three o'clock, Captain King weighed anchor, and ſteered for Prince's Iſland; but the weſterly wind dying away, a breeze from the ſouth-eaſt ſucceeded, and the tide, at the ſame time ſetting with great force to the ſouth-weſtward, he was prevented from fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iſland, and obliged, at two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, to anchor at the diſtance of nine or ten miles from it, in ſixty-five fathoms water, over a muddy bottom; the elevated hill bearing ſouth-weſt by ſouth, and the peak of Cracatoa north by eaſt.</p>
                     <p>Light airs and calms prevailed till ſix o'clock the following morning, at which time the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery weighed and made ſail, though, in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the anchor out of the ground, the old meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger was twice broken and alſo a new one.
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:030274_1581_0FE57BF42BE57128"/>
This, however, was entirely owing to the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate of the cordage, ſince the ſtrain was not very conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>The wind being fair, ſhe came to an anchor, at twelve o'clock, off the ſouth-eaſtern extremity of Prince's Iſland, in twenty-ſix fathoms water, over a bottom of ſand, at the diſtance of half a mile from the neareſt part of the ſhore; the eaſt end of the iſland bearing north-north-eaſt, the high peak north-weſt half weſt, and the moſt ſoutherly point in view ſouth-weſt by ſouth.</p>
                     <p>The Diſcovery had no ſooner anchored, than Lieutenant Lannyon, who had been at this iſland, in the year 1770, with Captain Cook, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, in company with the maſter, to ſearch for the watering-place. The brook from which the Endeavour, according to the beſt of Mr. Lannyon's recollection, had been furniſhed, was now found extremely ſalt. They obſerved fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inland a dry bed, where the water had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably lodged in rainy ſeaſons; and another run about a cable's length below, ſupplied from a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pool, whoſe bottom, as well as ſurface, was covered with dead leaves. This, though ſomewhat brackiſh, being far ſuperior to the other, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery's people began watering here early in the morning of the 13th, and finiſhed that ſervice the ſame day.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants, who came to them ſoon after they had anchored, brought a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:030274_1582_0FE57BFF0AF1AA90"/>
of fowls, and ſome turtles; the laſt, however, were in general very ſmall. During the night, it rained with great violence; and on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 14th, at day-break, the Reſolution was ſeen to the north, ſteering towards the iſland, and about two o'clock in the afternoon, ſhe caſt anchor cloſe to the Diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>As Captain Gore had not completed his ſtock of water at Cracatoa, he ſent his men aſhore on the 15th, who repaired to the brook that was firſt mentioned, which was now become perfectly ſweet in conſequence, of the rain, and flowed in great abundance. This being a treaſure too valuable to be diſregarded, Captain King gave orders, that all the caſks which the ſeamen of his ſhip had before filled ſhould be ſtarted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with the freſh water. This was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly performed by twelve o'clock the next day; and in the evening the decks were cleared, and both veſſels prepared for ſea.</p>
                     <p>We had heavy rains, and variable winds, in the morning of the 18th, which prevented us from getting under way till two o'clock in the afternoon, when a light northerly wind aroſe; but this being of ſhort duration, we were under the neceſſity of anchoring again, at eight in the evening, in fifty fathoms water. The following morning, at the ſame hour, being favoured by a north-weſterly breeze, we broke ground, to our extreme ſatisfaction, for the laſt time in the ſtraits

of Sunda; on the 20th, we had totally loſt ſight of Prince's iſland.</p>
                     <p>As this iſland has been deſcribed by Captain Cook in the narrative of a former voyage, we ſhall only add, that we were uncommonly ſtruck with the great general reſemblance of the natives in point of complexion, figure, manners, and even language, to the inhabitants of the various iſlands viſited by us in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                     <p>The country is ſo plentifully furniſhed with wood, that, notwithſtanding the quantities an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually cut down by the crews of the veſſels which touch at this iſland, there is no appearance of its diminution. We were well ſupplied with fowls of a moderate ſize, and ſmall turtles; the former of which we purchaſed at the rate of a Spaniſh dollar for ten. The natives likewiſe brought us many hog-deer, and an amazing number of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, to our great annoyance, as the greater part of our ſailors found means to procure one, if not two, of theſe troubleſome and miſchievous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
                     <p>If Mr. Lannyan had not been with us, we ſhould probably have met with ſome difficulty in finding the watering place: it may, therefore, not be improper to give a particular deſcription of its ſituation, for the benefit of ſubſequent navigators. The peaked hill on the iſland bears north-weſt by north from it; a remarkable tree, which grows on a coral reef, and is entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached

                     <p>The latitude of the anchoring-place at Prince's Iſland is 6° 36′ 15″ ſouth, and its longitude 165° 17′ 30″ eaſt. The variation of the compaſs was 54′ weſt; and the mean of the thermometer 83°.</p>
                     <p>We had begun to experience, from the time of our entering the ſtraits of Banca, the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of this noxious climate. Two of the Diſcovery's people became dangerouſly ill of malignant putrid fevers; which, however, were prevented from being communicated to others, by putting the patients apart from the reſt of the crew, in the moſt airy births. Many of us were attacked with diſagreeable coughs; ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of violent pains in the head; and even the moſt healthy perſons among us felt a ſenſation of ſuffocating heat, accompanied with an extreme languor, and a total loſs of appetite.</p>

                        </gap>ſe deſtructive ſeas without the loſs of a ſingle life. This circumſtance, in all probability, was partly owing to the vigorous health of the ſhip's companies, on our firſt arrival in theſe parts, as well as to the unremitting attention, that was now become habitual in our men, to the prudent and ſalutary regulations introduced among us by Captain Cook.</p>
                     <p>At the time of our departure from Prince's Iſland, and during our whole paſſage from thence to the Cape of Good Hope, the people of the Reſolution were in a far more ſickly condition than thoſe of the Diſcovery. For though many of the crew of the latter ſhip continued, for ſome time, to complain of the effects of the peſtilential climate they had left, they all happily recovered. Of the two who had been afflicted with fevers, one, after having been ſeized, on the 12th, of February, with violent convulſions, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to the verge of diſſolution, obtained ſuch relief from the application of bliſters, that he was out of danger in a ſhort time afterwards: the other recovered, but by more ſlow degrees. On board the Reſolution, beſides the fevers and coughs under which the greater part of the crew laboured, many were attacked with fluxes, the number of whom, contrary to our expectations,
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:030274_1586_0FE57BE356C0B118"/>
continued to augment till our arrival at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
                     <p>This difference was partly aſcribed by Captain Gore, and probably not without good reaſon, to the Diſcovery's fire-place being between decks; the heat and ſmoke of which, he was of opinion, contributed to mitigate the noxious effects of the damp nocturnal air. But Captain King was rather inclined to imagine, that his people eſcaped the flux by the precautions which were taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their receiving it from others. For, if ſome kinds of fluxes be, as he apprehended they were, contageous, he thought it not improbable that the crew of the Reſolution caught this diſorder from the Dutch veſſels at Cracatoa. For the purpoſe of avoiding this danger, Mr. William<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when he was diſpatched to the Eaſt-India-man in the entrance of the ſtraits of Sunda, was ſtrictly commanded to ſuffer none of his people, on any account whatever, to go on board; and afterwards, whenever the Diſcovery had occaſion to have any communication with her conſort, the ſame caution was continually obſerved.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as we were clear of Prince's Iſland, we had a light breeze from the weſt-north-weſt point. This, however, was not of long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, on the 20th, the wind again became variable, and remained ſo till the 25th at noon, when it blew freſh from the northward, with ſqualls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="298" facs="unknown:030274_1587_0FE57BDDE1623BF0"/>On Tueſday the 22d, about twelve o'clock, when our latitude was 10° 28′ ſouth, and our lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 104° 14′ eaſt, we perceived great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of boobies, and other birds that ſeldom fly to any great diſtance from land. Hence we conjectured, that we were not far from ſome ſmall unknown iſland.</p>
                     <p>The wind in the evening of the 25th, ſhifted ſuddenly to the ſouth, attended with heavy rains, and blew with very conſiderable violence, Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night, almoſt all the ſails we had bent gave way, and moſt of them were ſplit to rags; the rigging likewiſe ſuſtained material injury; and, the following day, we were under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of bending our laſt ſuit of ſails, and of knotting and ſplicing the rigging, as the whole of our cordage was expended. We aſcribed this ſudden tempeſt to the change from the monſoon to the regular trade-wind. We had made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our reckoning, about 4° ½ of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude weſt from Java Head, and our latitude was about 13° 10′ ſouth.</p>
                     <p>From the 26th of February to the 28th of the ſucceeding month, we had a regular trade-wind from the ſouth-eaſt to eaſt by ſouth, accompanied with fine weather; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A freſh eaſterly breeze then aroſe, which continued till the afternoon of the 4th; and, for the two following days, a calm prevailed.</p>
                     <p>Captain Gore had hitherto deſigned to proceed directly to the iſland of St. Helena, without ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the Cape of Good Hope; but, as the Reſolution's rudder had been, for ſome time, complaining, and, on examination, was found to be in a dangerous ſtate, he formed the reſolution of repairing immediately to the Cape, as being the moſt eligible place, both for providing a new main-piece to the rudder, and for the recovery of his ſick.</p>
                     <p>From the 21ſt day of March, when our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was 27° 22′ ſouth, and our longitude 52° 25′ eaſt, to the 5th of April, when we were in the latitude of 36° 12′ ſouth, and the longitude of 22° 7′ eaſt, we ſtrongly felt the influence of the currents, which ſet towards the ſouth-ſouth-weſt, and ſouth-weſt by weſt, ſometimes at the rate of eighty miles in a day. But, on the 6th of April, we t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the forenoon of the 6th, a veſſel appeared to the ſouth-weſt, ſtanding towards us; and, the wind, not long after, beginning to blow from the
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:030274_1589_0FE57BE167B5B1F8"/>
ſame quarter, we prepared our ſhips for action. We now perceived, from the maſt-head, five more ſail on our lee-bow, ſteering an eaſterly courſe; but the weather becoming hazy, we loſt ſight of them all in the ſpace of an hour. At twelve o'clock, the latitude was 35° 42′ ſouth, and the longitude 21° 32′ eaſt.</p>
                     <p>The following morning, at ſeven o'clock, we deſcried the land to the north at a conſiderable diſtance. On the 8th, the wind blew freſh from the north-weſt, with ſqualls. The next day it ſettled in the weſtern point, and we made a pretty near approach to the veſſel ſeen on the 6th, but did not hail her. Though ſhe was clumſy in figure, and, to all appearance, was unſkilfully managed, ſhe greatly out-ſailed us. The colours which ſhe hoiſted differed from any we had ſeen, and were ſuppoſed by ſome of us to be Imperial; but others imagined they were Portugueſe.</p>
                     <p>On Monday the 10th, at break of day, the land again made its appearance to the north, north-weſtward; and, in the courſe of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a ſnow was ſeen bearing down to us. She proved to be an Engliſh Eaſt-India packet, which had quit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She informed us, that Monſieur Trongoller's ſquadron, conſiſting of half a dozen ſail, had left the Cape about three weeks before, and was gone to cruiſe off
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:030274_1590_0FE57BDFE1E8E498"/>
St. Helena, in ſearch of our Eaſt-India fleet. From this intelligence we conjectured, that the five veſſels we had ſeen ſteering to the eaſtward, probably belonged to the French ſquadron, which, in that caſe, had relinquiſhed their cruiſe, and were, perhaps, proceeding to the iſland of Mauritius. Having communicated our conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the packet, and likewiſe mentioned the time we underſtood the China fleet was to ſail from Canton, we left her, and continued our progreſs towards the Cape. In the evening, Falſe Cape bore eaſt-north-eaſt, and the Gunner's Quoin north by eaſt; but we were prevented by the wind from getting into Falſe Bay, till the evening of the 12th, when we let go our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors a-breaſt of Simo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>We weighed the next morning, and ſtood into Simon's Bay. At eight o'clock, we came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, at the diſtance of one-third of a mile from the neareſt ſhore; the ſouth-eaſt point of the bay bearing ſouth by eaſt, and Table Mountain north-eaſt half north. We found the Naſſau and Southampton Eaſt-Indiamen lying here, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a convoy for Europe. The Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaluted the fort with eleven guns, and was complimented with an equal number in return.</p>

                        <pb n="302" facs="unknown:030274_1591_0FE57C109F0A4230"/>As ſoon as we had caſt anchor, Mr. Brandt, the governor of this place, favoured us with a viſit. This gentleman had the higheſt regard and eſteem for Captain Cook, who had been his conſtant gueſt, whenever he had touched at the Cape; and though he had, ſome time before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intelligence of his unfortunate cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe, he was extremely effected at the ſight of our veſſels returning without their old comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He was greatly ſurpriſed at ſeeing moſt of our people in ſo robuſt and healthy a ſtate, as the Dutch ſhip which had quitted Macao at the time of our arrival there, and had afterwards ſtopped at the Cape, reported, that we were in a moſt wretched condition, there being only fourteen perſons left on board the Reſolution, and ſeven in the Diſcovery. It is difficult to conceive what motive could have induced theſe people to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate ſo wanton and infamous a falſehood.</p>
                     <p>Captain King, on Saturdy the 15th, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied Captain Gore to Cape-Town; and, the following morning, they waited on Baron Plet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg, the Governor, who received them with every poſſible demonſtration of civility and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He entertained a great perſonal affection for Captain Cook, and profeſſed the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his character; and, on hearing the recital of his misfortune, broke forth into many expreſſions of unaffected ſorrow. In one of the principal apartments of the Baron's houſe, he
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:030274_1592_0FE57BFD683E1408"/>
ſhewed our gentlemen two pictures, one of De Ruyter, the other of Van Trump, with a vacant ſpace left between them, which, he ſaid, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fill up with the portrait of Captain Cook; and, for this purpoſe, he requeſted that they would endeavour to procure one for him, at any price, on their arrival in Great-Britain.</p>
                     <p>The Governor afterwards informed them, that all the nations then at war with England had iſſued orders to their reſpective cruiſers to ſuffer us to paſs without moleſtation. With regard to the French, there was ſufficient reaſon to conſider this as true; for Mr. Brandt had already delivered to Captain Gore a letter from Mr. Stephens, Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Admiralty, incloſing a tranſcript of Monſieur de Sartine's orders, taken on boaad the Licorne. The affair, however, with reſpect to the Americans, ſtill reſted on report; but, as to the Spaniards, Baron Plettenberg aſſured our gentlemen, that he had been expreſsly told, by the Captain of a Spaniſh veſſel, which had ſtopped at the Cape, that he, and all the officers of his nation, had received injunctions of the ſame nature.</p>
                     <p>By theſe aſſurances, Captain Gore was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his reſolution of maintaining, on his part, a neutral conduct; in conſequence of which when, upon the arrival of the Sibyl, to convoy the Eaſt-Indiamen home, it was propoſed to him to attend them on their voyage, he thought
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:030274_1593_0FE57C0EAFE156E8"/>
proper to decline an offer, the acceptance of which might perhaps have brought him into a very embarraſſing dilemma, in caſe of our fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with any of the ſhips belonging to our enemies.</p>
                     <p>During our continuance at the Cape, we met with the moſt friendly treetment, not only from the Governor, but alſo from the other principal perſons of the place, as well Africans as Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans. On our firſt arrival, Colonel Gordon, the Commander of the Dutch troops, was abſent on a journey into the inland parts of Africa, but returned before we left the Cape. Upon this occaſion, he had penetrated further into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts of the country than any preceding traveller, and made very conſiderable additions to the excellent collection of natural curoſities with which he has contributed to enrich the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum of the Prince of Orange. Indeed his long reſidence at the Cape, and the great aſſiſtance he has derived from his rank and ſtation there, joined to an ardent deſire of knowledge, and an active, indefatigable ſpirit, have enabled him to gain a more perfect knowledge of this part of Africa, than any other perſon has had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of acquiring; and it is with pleaſure we congratulate the public, on his intentions of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a narrative of his travels.</p>
                     <p>Falſe Bay lies to the eaſtward of the Cape of Good Hope, and is frequented by veſſels during
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:030274_1594_0FE57C0870AC3480"/>
the prevalence of the north-weſterly winds, which begin to exert their influence in May, and render it dangerous to remain in Table Bay. It is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to the eaſtward by Falſe Cape, and to the weſtward by the Cape of Good Hope. It is eighteen miles wide at its entrance, and the two Capes bear due eaſt and weſt from each other.</p>
                     <p>At the diſtance of eleven to twelve miles from the Cape of Good Hope, on the weſtern ſide, is ſituated Simon's Bay, the only commodious ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſhipping to lie in; for, though the road without it affords tolerable anchorage, it is rather too open, and not well adapted for procuring neceſſaries, the town being ſmall, and ſupplied with proviſions from Cape-Town, which ſtands at the diſtance of about twenty-four miles. To the north-north-eaſtward of Simon's Bay, there are ſome others, from which, however, it may with eaſe be diſtinguſhed, by a remarkable ſandy way to the north of the town, which forms a conſpicuous object.</p>
                     <p>In ſteering for the harbour along the weſtern ſhore, their is a ſmall flat rock, known by the name of Noah's Ark; and about a mile to the north-eaſtward of it, there are ſeveral others, which are denominated the Roman Rocks. Theſe are a mile and a half diſtant from the anchoring-place; and either to the northward of them, or
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:030274_1595_0FE57C06C1E72AD8"/>
between them, there is a ſafe paſſage into the Bay.</p>
                     <p>When the north-weſterly gales are ſet in, the navigator, by the following bearings, will be directed to a ſecure and convenient ſtation; Noah's Ark, ſouth 51° eaſt, and the centre of the hoſpital ſouth 53° weſt, in ſeven fathoms water. But, if the ſouth-eaſterly winds ſhould not have ceaſed blowing, it is more adviſeable to remain further out in eight or nine fathoms. The bottom conſiſts of ſand, and the anchors, before they get hold, ſettle conſiderably. The land, on the northern ſide of the bay, is low and ſandy; but the eaſtern ſide is very elevated. About two leagues to the eaſtward of Noah's Ark, ſtands Seal Iſland, whoſe ſouthern part is ſaid to be dangerous, and not to be approached, with ſafety, nearer than in twenty-two fathoms water. There are many ſunken rocks off the Cape of Good-Hope, ſome of which make their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at low water, and others conſtantly have breakers on them.</p>
                     <p>The anchoring-place in Simon's Bay is ſituated in the latitude of 34° 20′ ſouth, by obſervation; and its longitude is 18° 29′ eaſt. It was high water, on the full and change days, at 5<hi rend="sup">h</hi> 55<hi rend="sup">m</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent time. The tide roſe and fell five feet five inches; and, at the neap tides, the water roſe only four feet one inch.</p>

                        <pb n="307" facs="unknown:030274_1596_0FE57BF5B1F2AEA0"/>According to the obſervations made by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain King and Mr. Bayly, on the 11th of April, when the Cape of Good Hope bore due weſt, its latitude is 34° 23′ ſouth, which is 4′ to the northward of the Abbé de la Caille's poſition of it.</p>
                     <p>Having provided the neceſſary quantity of naval ſtores, and compleated our victualling, we quitted Simon's Bay on Tueſday the 9th of May. On the 14th of the ſame month, we got into the ſouth-eaſt trade wind, and ſtood to the weſt of the iſlands of Aſcenſion and St. Helena. On Wedneſday, the 31ſt, we were in the latitude of 12° 48′ ſouth, and the longitude of 15° 40′ weſt. On the 12th of June, we paſſed the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial line for the fourth time during our voyage, in the longitude of 26° 16′ weſt.</p>
                     <p>We now perceived the effects of a current ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting north by eaſt, at the rate of half a mile in a hour. After continuing in the ſame direction till the middle of July, it began to ſet a little to the ſouthward of the weſt. On Saturday, the 12th of Auguſt, we deſcried the weſtern coaſt of Ireland, and endeavoured to get into Port Galway, from whence Captain Gore intended to have diſpatched the journals and charts of our voyage to London. This attempt, however, proved ineffectual; and we were compelled, by violent ſoutherly winds, to ſtand to the north.</p>

                        <pb n="308" facs="unknown:030274_1597_0FE57BF7A514CC40"/>Our next deſign was to put into Lough Swil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the wind continuing in the ſame quarter, we ſteered to the northward of the iſland of Lewis; and on Tueſday, the 22d of Auguſt, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, both our veſſels anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Stromneſs. From this place Captain King was ſent by Captain Gore to inform the Lords of the Admiralty of our arrival; and, on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 4th of october, the ſhips reached the Nore in ſafety, after an abſence of four years, two months, and two and twenty days.</p>
                     <p>When Captain King quitted the Diſcovery at Stromneſs, he had the ſatisfaction of leaving the whole ſhip's company in perfect health; and, at the ſame time, the number of ſick perſons on board the Reſolution did not exceed two or three, only one of whom was incapable of ſervice. In the whole courſe of the voyage, the Reſolution loſt no more than five men by ſickneſs, three of whom, at the time of our departure from Great-Britain, were in a precarious ſtate of health: the Diſcovery did not loſe one individual. A ſtrict attention to the excellent regulations eſtabliſhed by Captain Cook, with which our readers are, doubtleſs, already acquainted, may juſtly be deemed the chief cauſe, under the bleſſing of Divine Providence, of this extraordinary ſucceſs. But, notwithſtanding theſe ſalutary precautions, we might, perhaps, in the end, have felt the pernicious effects of ſalt proviſions, had we not
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:030274_1598_0FE57BE8747EEB48"/>
availed ourſelves of every ſubſtitute which our ſituation, at different times, afforded us. As theſe were ſometimes extremely nauſeous, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conſiſting of articles which our people had not been accuſtomed to conſider as food for men, it became neceſſary, for the purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving their prejudices, and conquering their diſguſts, to employ the united aid of perſuaſion, example, and authority.</p>
                     <p>Portable ſoup and ſour krout were the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives we principally depended on. We had no opportunity of trying the effects of the antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic remedies, with which we were plentifully furniſhed, as they did not appear, during our whole voyage, the ſlighteſt ſymptoms of the ſcurvy among the crew of either ſhip.</p>
                     <p>Our malt and hops had likewiſe been kept as a reſource in caſe of ſickneſs; but, on being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined at the Cape of Good Hope, they were found totally ſpoiled. About the ſame time, we opened ſome caſks of oatmeal, peaſe, groats, flour, biſcuit, and malt, which, for the ſake of experiment, we had put up in ſmall caſks, lined with tin-frail; and all the articles, except the peaſe, were found in a much better condition, than could have been expected in the ordinary mode of package.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion, we cannot omit recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conſideration of government, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of furniſhing ſuch of his Majeſty's ſhips
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:030274_1599_0FE57BEA8CE02480"/>
as may be expoſed to the influence of unhealthy climates, with a ſufficient quantity of Peruvian bark. It fortunately happened in the Diſcovery, that only one of the men who were attacked with fevers in the Straits of Sunda, ſtood in need of this valuable medicine; for the whole quantity that ſurgeons are accuſtomed to carry out in ſuch veſſels as ours, was conſumed by him alone. If more perſons had been affected in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is probable that they would all have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for want of the only remedy that could effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually have relieved them.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall conclude our narrative of this voyage, with the mention of a circumſtance, which, if we conſider its long duration, and the nature of the ſervice in which we were employed, ſeems ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſs remarkable than the uncommon healthineſs of the ſhips' companies. This was, that our veſſels never loſt ſight of each other for a whole day, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on two occaſions; the firſt of which was the conſequence of an accident that befel the Diſcovery off the coaſt of Owhyhee; and the ſecond was owing to the fogs we met with at the entrance of the bay of Awatſka. As this ſhare of merit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs almoſt entirely to the inferior officers, it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a ſtriking proof of their ſkill and vigilance.
