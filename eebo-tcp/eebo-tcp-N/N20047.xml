            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>—But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
            <p>THESE are words, which, by many, have not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly underſtood; but have been groſſly miſinterpreted and miſapplied. But, the true and proper ſenſe and meaning of them may, from the general tenor of St. Paul's reaſoning in the chapter of the text, be clearly aſcertained.</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing on them, I ſhall, in the FIRST place, explain them. And then, SECONDLY, draw ſome inference from them. IN the firſt place, I ſhall explain the words of the text.</p>
            <p>BY the natural man receiving not the things of the ſpirit of God, we are to underſtand, that men in a ſtate of nature, who will be perſuaded to believe nothing but what is demonſtrated by arguments of reaſon and philoſophy, will not receive the things revealed by the ſpirit of God, the truth of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a different kind of evidence, the demonſtration of miracles, &amp;c. Such men as theſe, who depend wholly on the diſcoveries of reaſon and philoſophical demonſtration, will not receive or believe the things revealed by the ſpirit of God. To them ſuch revelations appear to be fooliſhneſs, or things not founded in truth. Theſe are the perſons whom the Apoſtle calls natural men, men in a ſtate of nature. Such were the Greeks, to whom the goſpel appeared to be fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it appeared not, in the wiſdom of man, embell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with human learning, and founded on deductions of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026261_0003_0FD00B94A91D9E98"/>
reaſon. They would not receive doctrines delivered in plain ſimple language, and reſting on the teſtimony of miracles. Such men, depending on nature or the mere light of nature or reaſon as being fully ſufficient, would not receive ſupernatural aid. Hence, they are called natural men who would not receive the things of the ſpirit of God. And, that St. Paul meant by natural men or the natural man, ſuch perſons as theſe, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the general tenor of his diſcourſe in the chapter of which our text is a part. Says he, "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech or of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom declaring unto you the teſtimony of God; for, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to know any thing but Jeſus Chriſt and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and my ſpeech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wiſdom, but in demonſtration and with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that, your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God. Now, we have not received the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit of God, that we might know the things which are freely given us of God; which things, alſo, we ſpeak; not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual." And then are introduced the words of the text—"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God," &amp;c. Here, it plainly appears, that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of revelation being rejected of men, who depended wholly on their worldly wiſdom and deductions of reaſon as the only valuable knowledge. Such men, whom he denominates natural men, receive not the things of the ſpirit of God or the truths revealed by the ſpirit of God, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the evidence of miracles. A revelation, to ſuch men, appeared to be fooliſhneſs, becauſe of its ſimplicity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it depended on a kind of evidence they did not admit as rational.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle goes on—"Neither can he," the natural man, "know them,"; that is, the things of the ſpirit of God, "becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned." His meaning is, that men who depend wholly on human reaſon and the light of nature, and who will not admit of revelation, cannot know the things of God, the things which God reveals. Natural reaſon can in no way diſcover them, becauſe they are things originally known only to the ſpirit of God, and are beyond the reach of natural light. But, he that would know them,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026261_0004_0FD00B98B5CBC250"/>
muſt receive them from the ſpirit of God by revelation. For, "who," ſays the apoſtle, "hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may inſtruct him."—That is, who is he that hath known the will of God in matters of mere revelation, 'till God hath revealed his will or made it known. The natural man, therefore, who admits of nothing but what he can find out by the light of mere reaſon, does not know the things of God, which can be known only by revelation.—Nor will he receive them, becauſe they depend on a kind of evidence which he will not admit as ſufficient to eſtabliſh any truth. This is the ſenſe of our text; and the proper ſenſe of it, when examined by the ſenſe of the whole chapter of which the text is a part. But, by the natural man here, is not meant all unregenerate or carnal men; but thoſe men only are meant, who, through their attachment to wordly wiſdom, will not attend to and admit a revelation. But, if by the natural man, was intended all unregenerated men, then, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all ſuch, till they were converted, muſt neceſſarily be entirely ignorant of the things of the ſpirit of God, or the things revealed by him. But, then, the goſpel would be no benefit to ſuch; for to them it would be fooliſhneſs. They could not have any knowledge of it, or receive it. And hence, it would be impoſſible they ſhould be ſanctified or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it: For, how could they be ſanctified by that of which they had no knowledge, and which they could not receive? But I would be a little particular on my remarks here.</p>
            <p>IT has been ſuppoſed by ſome perſons, that unregenerate men cannot have any proper underſtanding or knowledge of the holy ſcriptures, or ſuch as may make them wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: but that, before they can have ſuch an underſtanding of the ſcriptures, they muſt have ſome new faculty conveyed to the mind which they had not before, to enable them to know and properly underſtand and receive things of a divine and ſpiritual nature. But this, no doubt, is a miſtake; for, even to regenerated and ſanctified perſons, the ſpirit of God conveys no new faculty. The man has before and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation all the ſame mental faculties. He has all the ſame powers of perception, reaſoning, judging, recollecting, &amp;c. both before and after regeneration. Before regeneration, he can obtain as good a ſpeculative knowledge of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and reaſon on them as pertinently, as afterwards. He
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026261_0005_0FD00B9E93F45E30"/>
can have as clear a perception of religious truth, and diſcourſe on it as intelligibly before his converſion as after. And he can obtain, by the ordinary aids of God's ſpirit, ſufficient knowledge of the way of ſalvation and the importance of it, to be ſtired up to conviction, and to cry, What ſhall I do to be ſaved. Knowledge muſt be before conviction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
            <p>A MAN before he is brought to Chriſt, muſt have ſome knowledge of him, or he can never come to or receive him. The goſpel is able to make perſons wiſe to ſalvation. But it is impoſſible for the goſpel to make men wiſe, when they can have no knowledge of it. If unregenerate men cannot obtain by the ordinary aids of God's ſpirit ſufficient knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the holy ſcriptures to obtain ſalvation, it muſt be either owing to their wanting ſome new faculty of perception or underſtanding, or to their ſtanding in need of ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary efflatus or revelation from the ſpirit of God. But it may be evident to common ſenſe, that regenerated men have no faculty of diſcerning truths, which the unregenerate have not; for both the regenerate and unregenerate have, often, the ſame perception and underſtanding of the ſame truths: and therefore, the unregenerate have no need of any new faculty to underſtand the ſcriptures. Nor have they need of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary efflatus or revelation from God, to enable them to obtain right perceptions and underſtanding of the ſcriptures: for we are now compleat in Chriſt: nor is any new revelation to be expected. But if we need a new revelation to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the firſt, we muſt have a third to enable us to underſtand the ſecond. And then we muſt have revelation upon reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation without end, in order to underſtand any thing; which would prove that they were all ſo obſcure, that we could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing; and the very end of revelation would be defeated.</p>
            <p>IT is a very dangerous thing for men to believe that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary light or communications of truth from the ſpirit of God are neceſſary in order to their underſtanding the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for then they will make that extraordinary light their guide, becauſe revelation is ſuppoſed to be inſufficient in the ſcriptures. And then they beſure muſt try the ſcriptures by the ſpirit—but will not try the ſpirits by the ſcriptures to know whether they are of God. But then the ſcriptures will not be their guide in faith; but they will be led by their own
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026261_0006_0FD00BA0450F6518"/>
ſancies, and will not be able to diſtinguiſh the ſpirit of God from a ſpirit of deluſion. Thus they will be deprived en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of the benefit of a written and ſtanding revelation. The goſpel of Chriſt is a plain intelligible revelation of the will and counſels of God. It is adapted to the capacities of mankind in general; but it is not a ſyſtem of refined and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure philoſophy, requiring great abilities to underſtand it, ſo far as is neceſſary to ſalvation.—But, ſo far is it from being obſcure in the moſt eſſential parts of it, that it is plain and ſimple in its meaning, ſo that he that runs may read: And it is addreſſed to mankind at large—to the wiſe and ſimple—to men ſanctified, and to ſuch as are not: and it is the power of God to ſalvation through faith; and was deſigned to enlighten and reform ſinners, as well as to carry the juſt on to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it would be abſurd to ſuppoſe that God would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs ſinners by a revelation which they could not (in the great eſſentials) underſtand; or, that a revelation was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reform the vicious, without giving them any light or information. The Apoſtle Paul obſerves, that they, the Apoſtles, uſed in their preaching great plainneſs of ſpeech, commending themſelves to every man's conſcience. But this could not be done, unleſs men could underſtand the truths they taught. That which is plain, muſt be underſtood.— And that which takes hold of a man's conſcience muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey light and conviction. And, it is fact, that ſome have been in ſome good meaſure enlightened by, and have taſted the good word of God, and have felt the powers of the world to come, but yet have fallen away. So that we find, that men who are not real Chriſtians, may underſtand the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo as to be in ſome meaſure convicted and reformed.— And no doubt, had it not been their own fault, they would have become converted and ſanctified.</p>
            <p>THE great and eſſential truths of religion are adapted to the conceptions and underſtandings of men in common, to thoſe of ſinners as well as ſaints. But then there are ſome things, it is true, hard to be underſtood; not becauſe of any original obſcurity of the language, but on account of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime nature of the ſubjects they are upon, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible finite underſtandings ſhould fully comprehend—and alſo on account of our not being acquainted with thoſe uſages and cuſtoms to which they referred, and of which we now
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026261_0007_0FD00BA1C0594778"/>
have not competent knowledge. Though ſome things may on theſe accounts be hard to be underſtood, yet enough can be known about every part of the ſcriptures, to lead us in the way of ſalvation. And thoſe parts of the holy ſcripture, which, as to the mode of their exiſtence, are hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, are hard to be underſtood by ſaints as well as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>A MAN's becoming a good man is not always neceſſarily attended with any enlargement of his ſpeculative knowledge. A ſaint may be a babe in knowledge, and a ſinner may have a very comprehenſive knowledge of the holy ſcriptures. But, were we once to ſet it down as a fact, that the regenerate only could have a proper knowledge and underſtanding of the ſcriptures, we ſhould make knowledge an evidence of grace. But St. Paul ſuppoſes a man may have all knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all myſteries, but yet be deſtitute of charity, be as ſounding braſs and a tinkling ſymbol. So you may ſee, that a man, according to St. Paul, may have a great knowledge of the holy ſcriptures, but not be a man of grace. But, if a true underſtanding of the ſcriptures was an evidence of grace, almoſt every man would claim it; for every man, in his own judgment, underſtands the ſenſe of the holy ſcriptures rightly. And all thoſe who are ſincere in their opinions will conclude, that they are good men, becauſe their ideas of the ſcriptures are juſt and proper. And, when this ſhould be the caſe, men might ſuppoſe they might live in ſin, but might get ſafe to heaven if they ſhould be careful to underſtand the ſcriptures in their proper ſenſe, which all men, no doubt, would ſuppoſe that they themſelves did.—A dangerous doctrine this! which St. John in his Epiſtle ſeverely condemns.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible that ſome perſons are ready to ſuppoſe that the goſpel is a ſyſtem of myſticiſm; and that there is in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing a myſtical ſenſe, different from that which is obvious or literal. And this has led ſome to explain almoſt every doctrine of the holy ſcriptures in a myſtical ſenſe, and to overlook the ſenſe that is obvious or literal. But in this way of interpreting the ſcriptures, men may make the holy word of God ſpeak any language they pleaſe. They may, in this way, explain away all truth; and thus exceedingly diſſerve the cauſe of truth and religion; for they are governed by their wild imaginations and fancies inſtead of being governed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026261_0008_0FD00BA33B16C908"/>
by the word of God. And, ſuch men as theſe, put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above refutation by arguments founded on the literal or plain ſenſe of ſcripture, by pretending that they are ſpiritual, and can diſcern a ſpiritual meaning of the holy ſcriptures, which others cannot. Such a perſon will tell you, that ";he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things; yet he himſelf is judged of no man." Thus he places himſelf, with all his myſticiſm, above any attack or refutation, becauſe he is ſpiritual and can judge all things; and, is ſo infallibly in the right, that no man can correct him, or prove that he is in the wrong. And thus, by receiving an error, he becomes confirmed in a deluſion, and has nothing for his guide but the ſpirit within, and makes no uſe of the written word. But, I would obſerve, that ſuch men miſinterpret the paſſage I have quoted above. The meaning of the paſſage is this: He that is ſpiritual, or is taught of God by inſpiration, or by his word, judgeth of the mind of God by his word revealed; but not by the wiſdom of this world or by principles of worldly philoſophy; yet he himſelf is judged of no man, as to the truth of what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves as revealed by God. That is, he is not judged by the worldly wiſdom of any man, who argues from the light of mere reaſon or the light of nature.—That is, no man can, by the light of nature, prove that what he believes, as it relates to facts, is not true; becauſe his faith is grounded on the teſtimony of God. But the man who is not ſpiritual, or taught of God by his word, cannot, by arguments of reaſon, diſprove the validity of this divine teſtimony; but the man who reſts his faith on this divine teſtimony will ſtand firm, notwithſtanding all the attacks of men who reaſon from mere natural light. This is the true and proper ſenſe of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>

            <head type="sub">CORINTHIANS, Firſt Epiſtle, ii. Chapter, 14 Verſe.</head>
            <p>—But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
            <p>THOUGH men, who are ſpiritual or are taught of God by his word, cannot be refuted as to their judgment of the truth of facts reſting on divine teſtimony, yet they may miſtake the ſenſe in which ſome parts of revelation ought to be underſtood; for God does not give his teſtimony to the truth of every ſenſe in which any man may underſtand the ſcriptures: but the ſenſe is to be found out by arguments of reaſon grounded on the ſcriptures, or by comparing (as the Apoſtle expreſſes it) ſpiritual things with ſpiritual, or one part of ſcripture with another. This being the caſe, men may miſunderſtand the ſcriptures as to their ſenſe or meaning; yes, even men who are taught of God and believe his word; and they may be in this corrected and refuted: and men may, by ſcripture arguments, by comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual, convince ſuch that they were wrong in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this or that doctrine or paſſage of ſcripture. So that, though a man who is ſpiritual, or taught of God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, is, as to his judgment of facts reſting on divine teſtimony, judged of no man, yet he may miſunderſtand the ſenſe of ſome parts of ſcripture; and, in this, may be judged of men reaſoning out of the ſcriptures—and may be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and convinced that he was in the wrong; and he may give up his former ſenſe of this or that doctrine and embrace anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. So that this paſſage we have explained will not warrant
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026261_0010_0FD00BA63627B560"/>
any man in preſuming he is infallibly right in his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all parts of the holy ſcriptures, on account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual or being taught of God; for the infallible ſenſe in which all parts of revelation are to be underſtood, is not by God revealed to any man. Hence we may ſee, that thoſe that are good men are not infallible in their underſtanding of the ſenſe of the ſcripture, any more than men unconverted.— But then, I would obſerve, that though good men have no fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulty which vicious men have not, to enable them to perceive and know the truth, yet, they making a better uſe of their fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties have the advantage of the ſinner.</p>
            <p>THE man who makes a good uſe of his perceptive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding faculties, becomes better qualified to perceive, know and receive the truth, than a man who makes not ſuch an uſe of them. And, when a man by this right uſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe faculties, perceives and knows the truth, his moral taſte becomes by the force of truth and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry influences of God's ſpirit corrected. And, he then loves the truth; and conſequently, his former prejudices and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which gave occaſion to him to judge wrongly of the truths of God are mainly removed. When this is done, he, before, will judge more fairly, uprightly and impartially of truth than he would have done under the prevailing prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a wrong taſte and diſtempered mind. But, though this be the caſe, yet he has no new faculty of mind. He now has none but what belong to the man as a rational and moral agent. But, he had all that were neceſſary to this before his change. His change from ſin to holineſs, does not include the addition of any new faculty to his nature, but only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of thoſe he had before, and their being brought to their proper uſe and exerciſe. So that the unregenerate man has all the ſame faculties to perceive and underſtand the truths of God that regenerated men have. But, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in their advantages for knowing and receiving the truth, conſiſts in the right uſe and application the good man makes of his faculties for knowing and doing the will of God, and the bad uſe the unregenerate man makes of his. And, hence it is, that we are taught, if any man will do the will of God, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God. That is, the man of an honeſt deſire and endeavour to pleaſe God, will be able to diſcover in general truth from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026261_0011_0FD00BA7DB27A900"/>
error, and will not fatally miſtake. Such an one (loving the truth) will uſe his faculties in ſearching after it and judging of and receiving it. Such a man has a good moral taſte or reliſh: and in a proper uſe of his faculties; becomes ſanctified by the ſpirit. But in this ſanctification, the ſpirit of God gives no new faculty; but only (by the means of grace) brings the common faculties of the man to their proper uſe and exerciſe. And then the man has a view of the importance of the truth that he had not before, and greatly delights to know and receive it. But yet, his ſpeculative knowledge of it, may be the ſame as before; nor may, perhaps, his knowledge be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. But what he knows, he knows more affectingly, and believes heartily, ſo that, by the truth he becomes ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Hence it is evident, that ſinners not knowing the things of God revealed in his word, is not owing to a want of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or ability, but to a miſuſe and abuſe of the faculties God has given them. Therefore, it is poſſible for them in the proper uſe of their mental faculties, to know the will of God, revealed, as well as ſaints; yes, even the moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible truths: for things incomprehenſible, cannot be underſtood either by good men or bad. And, when men pretend to be able (becauſe they are ſpiritual) to underſtand and explain every thing, and pretend that revelation is ſuch a myſtery that unregenerate men can have no proper under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, they have given themſelves up to the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded enthuſiaſm and deluſion. The goſpel of Chriſt or the things revealed in it, are not, in the ſcripture ſenſe, myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. There are ſome things in it, it is true, hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as to the manner of their exiſtence; and which we cannot comprehend. But the facts or truths related, conſidered as facts, are not incomprehenſible, or in other words there is no abſurdity in the ſuppoſition of their exiſtence; becauſe, they are not contrary to reaſon, though reaſon would not diſcover them, and they are demonſtrated by divine teſtimony. And be ſure, there is no abſurdity in that being true, which is grounded on divine teſtimony, or in our believing it to be true. So that the facts and truths related in the goſpel are plain. And, that they exiſt, is not incomprehenſible: for, it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the teſtimony of God that they do. And the belief of theſe truths or facts objectively, is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, that we muſt know and believe them in this or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026261_0012_0FD00BAAB46DEBB8"/>
that ſenſe, as one man or another ſhall explain them, may not be abſolutely neceſſary to the ſalvation of this or that perſon, becauſe God has not made it ſo; and, eſpecially, when the mode of the exiſtence of ſuch truths or facts, is incomprehenſible. But things in the manner of their exiſtence incomprehenſible, are incomprehenſible to ſaints as well as ſinners: but, things not ſo, may, by unconverted men, be underſtood, or they may have a ſpeculative knowledge of them as well as ſaints can; and, therefore, thoſe who pretend, that becauſe they are converted men, they can underſtand every thing of the truths of revelation, and that ſinners can know nothing, are deceiving and being deceived. And, that pretence, that the ſcripture cannot be underſtood by any but ſanctified perſons, becauſe they are all or the greater part of them myſterious, is going on a falſe ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>AN Apoſtle obſerves, they, the Apoſtles, "uſed in their preaching great plainneſs of ſpeech," which does not well <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with the idea of <hi>their</hi> preaching myſteriouſly, and in general, unintelligibly. The doctrine of the reſurrection of the dead, is aſſerted and proved; and we believe it, and can comprehend the truth of the fact. But we cannot comprehend the manner of it, which is quite a different thing. Nor is it neceſſary to ſalvation that we ſhould. The reſurrection of the dead, and the change of thoſe (that ſhall be alive) in the twinkling of an eye, at the ſounding the laſt trump, St. Paul calls a myſtery; but he meant it was a myſtery before, or a thing before it was revealed, unknown, whether the dead ſhould be raiſed, or what would be done with thoſe who ſhould be alive when our Lord ſhould come to judgment. But he did not mean this was a myſtery after it was revealed; for he ſays, "I ſhew you a myſtery." But, when a truth is ſhewn or known, it ceaſes to be a myſtery. There are many things in the goſpel, which were ſaid to be myſterious, that is before they were revealed or made known, but not afterward; for when a truth is known, the myſtery ceaſes. The word myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery refers to things not made known or revealed; but not to ſuch as are.</p>
            <p>BUT good men cannot know things not revealed any more than men of different characters. But things made known or revealed are not myſteries; and, therefore, they may be known and underſtood by men of all deſcriptions, if they will
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026261_0013_0FD00BAC43D4B680"/>
make a proper uſe of their faculties. But though there are ſome things in the goſpel hard to be underſtood; or, as to the manner of their exiſtence incomprehenſible, yet, theſe are not the truths, when revealed, that are in the ſcripture ſtile called myſteries. But myſteries are things not revealed, and, while they ſo remain, cannot be believed or known. But after they are revealed and known, may and muſt be believed; and then they ceaſe to be myſteries. So that thoſe men who pretend becauſe they are ſpiritual, that they can explain and know things myſterious which others cannot, are in a deluſion. That which is revealed is not a myſtery, and therefore, it may by others be known and underſtood. But that which is not revealed is a myſtery: therefore, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known or underſtood. And hence, it is folly for any to pretend to know or explain the meaning of it, though he may be ſanctified by the ſpirit of God. But a perſon's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the influences of the ſpirit of God, by which he becomes ſanctified in the right uſe of his faculties or a good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the means of grace, does not imply or include an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gift of the ſpirit to know the will of God. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary gifts do not involve each other. The man who is endowed with the one, may not neceſſarily be endowed with the other: but, they are diſtinct in their nature, and one may exiſt in a perſon who is deſtitute of the other. And therefore, it does not follow, that (becauſe a man is regenerated) he has a faculty of diſcerning the will and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God in inſtances wherein others have not.</p>
            <p>EXTRAORDINARY gifts, and eſpecially the gift of inſpiration, by which perſons become acquainted with the counſels and will of God, were not, in apoſtolic times, deſigned ſo much for the benefit of thoſe to whom they were given, as for the benefit of others. They were given to enable perſons to preach and ſpread the truths of the goſpel to bring men to repentance, faith and holineſs. And, ſuch as were endowed with theſe ſpiritual gifts, were thoſe who were denominated ſpiritual, knowing the mind of the ſpirit, and judging all things, and being judged of no man. It does not appear that, in apoſtolic times, the common graces of the ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a ſpirit of inſpiration and prophecy. It appears that the apoſtle exhorted chriſtians to covet to prophecy; and hence, it appears, they might be chriſtians though they had not this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026261_0014_0FD00BADC0BB60C0"/>
extraordinary gift. The graces of the ſpirit, ſuch as faith, love, joy, peace, long ſuffering, meekneſs, temperance, and patience are common to all chriſtians in all ages. Nor can any be chriſtians without them. Theſe are conveyed to the mind by common and ordinary operations of the ſpirit, but not by extraordinary. Therefore perſons may be chriſtians without theſe extraordinary gifts, and without the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary operation of the ſpirit. Therefore men may be chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and poſſeſs all the ordinary graces of the ſpirit, but yet not be poſſeſſed of any extraordinary capacity on this account to know the mind of God, wherein it was not before revealed.</p>
            <p>THE ſpirit of God does not in its ordinary operations in converſion, convey any new truths to the mind not revealed before—It only awakens the mind to attention to thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready revealed, and gives them a ſanctifying effect upon the heart. But the ſpirit gives no new revelation, no new truth: therefore it is a deluſion to pretend to know more of the mind of God, even after converſion, than we can learn from the holy ſcriptures.—Therefore unregenerated men may have as much ſpeculative knowledge of the ſcriptures as others; if they are not groſſly deficient in the uſe of their rational fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties in reſpect to enquiry. Therefore the words of out text mean not that all unregenerate men are incapable of knowing the things of the ſpirit of God, or that they cannot, by the ordinary influences of the ſpirit, receive them. But the natural man, ſpoken of in the text, is the philoſopher who depends on human wiſdom and mere reaſon, and will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit revelation.—Such an one cannot know the things of God, his counſels and purpoſes; and will not receive them, becauſe they cannot be diſcerned and known by mere human reaſon or natural light. But unregenerate men; who will enquire for truth, and are diſpoſed to attend to and receive the word of God, may know it. They are poſſeſſed of a capacity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between truth and error: and there is nothing to prevent their knowing the mind and will of God, but theſe miſuſe and miſimprovement of their mental faculties.</p>
            <p>BUT I ſhall now offer ſomething to help our improvement of what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>AND, from what has been ſaid, we may ſee the inexcuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of all ſinners in living in the practice of ſin, and in rejecting the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:026261_0015_0FD00BAF45650EC8"/>IF it was a fact, that all mankind before their regeneration, were entirely incapable of knowing the will of God, or the things revealed by God, beſure they would not have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious knowledge to abuſe, or conſequently any to anſwer for before God.—Therefore they could not juſtly be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the miſuſe or abuſe of any—Much leſs would they be liable to be puniſhed with an aggravated puniſhment for rejecting the goſpel of Chriſt; for they could not be obliged to know that which they could not know or underſtand; or to believe that which they could not obtain a knowledge of; or receive and conform to that rule of conduct in which they could have no belief. Therefore, was it impoſſible for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to know the will of God, or ſuch a meaſure of it as is neceſſary to ſalvation, they ſurely could not be puniſhed for their not accepting the offers of the goſpel; for he only who knows his maſter's will, will be puniſhed for not conforming to it: but he that has or might have a conſiderable knowledge of it, will be beaten with many ſtripes. Therefore, perſons who know nothing, nor can know any thing of the will of God (in the day of judgment) will have nothing to anſwer for. But all ſinners, who know much of his will, will be puniſhed with great ſeverity. But all ſinners under goſpel light, may know much of the will of God; for they who trample under foot the Son of God, will have great condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe great light has ſhone upon them. They lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed darkneſs better than light becauſe their deeds were evil. But if they had not great light, they would not be great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But for us to ſay that ſinners cannot know or are not capable of knowing the things of God or his will, ſo as to lead them by proper improvement of their faculties to practiſe accordingly, is excluding ſinners from guilt.—It is encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in ſin, and lulling them to ſleep in a ſtate of carnal ſecurity, which is the moſt certain road to perdition. A more dangerous doctrine than this could not be inculcated. It at once, defeats the great end of revelation, and the end for which man was made a rational creature. It is impeaching the Judge of the world with injuſtice, in inflicting puniſhment on thoſe who know not his will, nor could know it.</p>
            <p>BUT will not the Judge of all the earth do right? Will he puniſh thoſe who could not know his will, in the ſame manner that he will thoſe who do know it? Shall a man give an
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026261_0016_0FD00BB42B748AD0"/>
account for ten or even one talent, when he has received none? If ſo, there is an end of all trial of rational beings. Nor is there any rule in judgment. But this is not the caſe. There is no ſinner under heaven, that will by God, be chargeable with guilt, who could not know what his duty was. Nor will there be a ſinner in the day of judgment, that will be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an aggravated condemnation, for rejecting the great ſalvation, who could not obtain by all the helps and grace of God a ſaving knowledge of it, or ſuch a knowledge as would have terminated in ſalvation, had it been in the beſt manner improved. And this is a doctrine that is ſo evidently true from our ideas of the juſtice of God and the holy ſcriptures, that every honeſt and unprejudiced mind will aſſent to it. And we may talk what we will about ſinners being juſtly damned, when God never enabled them to eſcape damnation, but laid them under a neceſſity of ſinning, and remaining in ſin, but all our reaſonings upon it will be contrary to common ſenſe, the juſtice of God, and the plain declarations of his word, which aſſert, that God delighteth not in the death of a ſinner; that puniſhment is his ſtrange work; and that Chriſt died for all; and that the ſinner will not come to Chriſt that he might have life. Is this all conſiſtent with God's damning the ſinner, when he could never know ſavingly his will, and when God never by his grace enabled him to do his will or to accept the great ſalvation? No—it is impoſſible: and I ſhould ſuppoſe that all who have any reſpect for God's character, would be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of aſſerting any ſuch thing. But ſurely all ſinners are in great danger of the judgment of God, becauſe God has enabled them more or leſs to know and do his will, and, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, to accept the great ſalvation.</p>
            <p>LET not ſinners, therefore, under goſpel light, reſt in a ſtate of carnal ſecurity, by flattering themſelves that they cannot know ſavingly the truths of God, or receive them or do any thing by ſtriving for regeneration, till God has given them ſome new faculty to enable them to diſcern divine things, for a new faculty is not to be expected; but it is their buſineſs to ſtrive to improve aright the faculties God has already given; and, in order to this, to improve the goſpel revelation, to ſtudy to know and do the will of God, to believe in his Son affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026261_0017_0FCF4BA9D9F9F6A0"/>
to repent of all ſin, depending on Gods grace to help and ſanctify them. Though they muſt receive ſtrength from God, yet it muſt be expected only in their ſtrivings; for he that buries his talent ſhall be caſt into utter darkneſs: that is, he that ſtrives not to make a proper uſe of his faculties in the good improvements of the gifts of God, eſpecially the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the goſpel, ſhall be damned.</p>
            <p>IT is a moſt dangerous doctrine to hold up to ſinners, that they cannot poſſibly do any thing in order to becoming chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, but that they muſt become ſo by the immediate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary operations of the ſpirit by an impulſe they cannot reſiſt; for this at once excuſes the ſinner from blame in not becoming a chriſtian; and it is aſſcribing his impenitency and unbelief to God, who affords not ſufficient grace for the ſinner to become a chriſtian.</p>
            <p>THOUGH it might doubtleſs have been juſt in God to have left the man to periſh, who had once ſinned, yet ſince the goſpel revelation has been given, and the grace of God hath appeared, it is not conſiſtent with the declarations of God, to ſuppoſe that he will leave the ſinner without afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aid to enable him to embrace ſalvation or the goſpel; for in caſe he does not, he is threatened with a greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he would have been worthy of had not the goſpel revelation been given, or had he not rejected it.—But this could not be, unleſs the goſpel was conſidered as a talent for him to improve; nor, unleſs he could have improved it, or believed in it, by the grace of God, and practiſed according to it.</p>
            <p>LET not ſinners, then, through pretended ignorance of the truths of God, or inability to receive them and practice ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely according to them, encourage themſelves in ſin; for it is a deluſion, which, if perſiſted in, will be fatal in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. But let them realize, that if they ſtrive not they will never enter into reſt, or be intereſted in the great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let them rouſe up from their ſlumbers—cry to God for help, truſting in him with all their heart, for grace and ſtrength, and they will derive grace and ſtrength from him. Their ſtrength in ſtriving depends on their truſt in the grace and promiſes of God. Let them withdraw their truſt in God's grace, and they will become weak and impotent. Let
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026261_0018_0FD00BB608C9C180"/>
them put their truſt in him for help and ſtrength, and they will receive them; and this will give efficacy to all their ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Let them ſtudy and meditate on the word of God, and pray, and mourn for ſin and be watchful againſt it, repent of, and forſake it. Let them reſolve to devote themſelves to Chriſt, and to make his goſpel their guide in faith and practice: and in this way of ſtriving and walking in the preſence of God, and truſting in him to help them, they will be in the way to become new born and veſſels of honour ſanctified to every good work. To ſuch God hath ſaid, "aſk and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened to you." Upon ſuch the grace of God, will no doubt, be effectual to the ſalvation of the ſoul: for our bleſſed Saviour hath ſaid, He "will not break the bruiſed reed, or quench the ſmoaking flax, but will ſend forth judgment unto victory."</p>
