            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere is a Glorious Prophecy, in Hab. 2 14 <hi>That the knowledge of the Glory of the Lord, ſhall fill the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> We know, That in all Prophetical Scripture, <hi>People,</hi> are ſtill meant by, <hi>Waters.</hi> The Spirit of Prophecy in this paſſage of Scripture, ſeems to fore-ſee, the Improvement and Advancement of Navigation, after the Invention of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> in the Latter Dayes; The <hi>People</hi> ſhall then <hi>Cover the Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Ocean</hi> ſhall be <hi>Covered</hi> with Veſſels, carrying of Men, to <hi>Do Buſineſs on the Great Waters.</hi> In the Prediction of that matter, 'twas very proper to call, <hi>The People,</hi> by the Name of, <hi>The Waters</hi>; for beſides the Reſemblance, which at all times they bear unto the <hi>Waters,</hi> upon which they are now Sailing, their Living on the <hi>Waters</hi> Entitles them to this Denomination, juſt as a Country or City, gives a Denomination to its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Grecians, Rome</hi> to <hi>Romans.</hi> And it is Predicted, That by means of <hi>Navigation</hi> thus grown towards perfection, it will come to paſs, <hi>That the Knowledge of the most Glorious Lord will fill the Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, ſhall be carried into all Corners of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord, Forgive</hi>! the Sinful Neglects of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Nations</hi> to make their <hi>Navigation,</hi> Subſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient unto the Illuſtrious Deſign, of conveying the <hi>Knowledge of the moſt Glorious Lord,</hi> unto all parts of the Univerſe. And let Pious and Zealous men, Seriouſly Conſider, what a Shame it is, that the <hi>Proteſtant Nations,</hi> which do ſo much Exceed the <hi>Popiſh</hi> in their <hi>Shipping,</hi> ſhould ſo far come ſhort of them, in their Endeavours by their <hi>Shipping</hi> to
<pb facs="unknown:000932_0003_0FAD92FCB02A5E38"/>
               <hi>Propagate</hi> the Noble <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> I hope, It will not be long, before <hi>Societies</hi> will be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, in the <hi>Proteſtant Nations,</hi> which will Study Numberleſs wayes, as much to out-do the <hi>Popiſh</hi> ones, in ſending abroad the Charms of our <hi>Holy Religion</hi> unto the Regions where they ſend our <hi>Veſſels,</hi> as our <hi>Holy Religion</hi> it ſelf out-does the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,</hi> or the <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry. <hi>God will Bleſs your Voyages, O ye Chriſtian Societies; The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will Bleſs them wonderfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean Time, I could not but count it one way of being <hi>Serviceable,</hi> To promote the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and <hi>Service of the moſt glorious Lord,</hi> among thoſe that profeſs the Art of <hi>Navigation</hi>; who, tis moſt proper, ſhould firſt have it <hi>themſelves,</hi> before they will do much to bring <hi>others</hi> into it. A <hi>Ship well-Rigg'd,</hi> is a lovely Sight; a <hi>Ship well Mann'd,</hi> is a better. The Author was willing to do what he could, that the <hi>Ships</hi> belonging to his Neighbours (who are very much a <hi>Sea faring-Tribe,</hi>) ſhould be fill'd with <hi>Good Men</hi>; which is the <hi>beſt-way,</hi> to be <hi>Well-Mann'd.</hi> He gave them therefore a Short-<hi>Winter-Sermon,</hi> which at their Deſire, is now put into their Hands for their more <hi>Perpetual Monitor</hi> If he have not Set it off, with <hi>Ornaments</hi> and <hi>Gaieties,</hi> it may as well anſwer the End, (your <hi>Ships</hi> do ſo, and why not <hi>Sermons</hi>?) without them.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>It is written, in Jon. I. 16.</bibl>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The men feared the Lord exceedingly.</hi>

            <p>WHAT <hi>men</hi> were theſe? The Beginning of the Chapter tells us, Theſe men were the <hi>Marriners,</hi> of a Veſſel bound for <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi>: which <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> is by ſome Great Geographers, counted, not the <hi>Tarſus,</hi> that was the Metropolis of <hi>Calicia,</hi> but rather <hi>Tarteſſus,</hi> a City in a Spaniſh Iſland of the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> But we have now, a point of more Importance to proſecute, than that <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical</hi> Controverſy and Curioſity.</p>
            <p>It has been an Obſervation, older than the Dayes of <hi>Plato,</hi> That the <hi>Sea is a School of Vice.</hi> It ſeems, the <hi>Fear of God</hi> is not ſound ſo much among <hi>Sailors,</hi> as one would expect from
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000932_0005_0FAD92FE2B9D0230"/>
their peculiar Circumſtances. Tho' <hi>Seamen</hi> are both Afflicted by God, and Relieved by God, above other men, yet there is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be found among them, that <hi>Fear of God,</hi> whereto their Circumſtances do oblige them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true; In the Sacred Story, we find ſome <hi>Seamen</hi> remarkable for the <hi>Fear of God</hi>; And ſuch Things as they met withal at <hi>Sea,</hi> were the occaſion of it. Theſe were the <hi>Marriners</hi> of the Veſſel, that were carrying <hi>Jonah</hi> to <hi>Tarſhiſh.</hi> A <hi>Fearful Storm</hi> was by God ſent upon them in their Voyage. Both in the <hi>Coming</hi> of the <hi>Storm,</hi> and in the <hi>Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of the <hi>Storm,</hi> they could not but evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, the <hi>Finger of God.</hi> And, behold, the <hi>Fear of God</hi> was the Effect of what they ſaw. Before the <hi>Storm,</hi> theſe <hi>Marriners</hi> were poor, forlorn, wretched <hi>Idolaters.</hi> But a Miniſter in the Veſſel told them of the Lord JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, the True God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Great God of <hi>Heaven.</hi> After the <hi>Storm,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Worſhippers of that Lord JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, and, <hi>Feared the Lord exceedingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very many of you, O Congregation of the Lord, are <hi>Marriners.</hi> This Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, above other Parts of the Town or Land, may be called, our <hi>Tribe of Zebulon.</hi> You are Witneſſes, O our Sea-faring Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and all the Neighbours, yea, and the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000932_0006_0FAD92FEC5862B58"/>
Holy Angels, are Witneſſes, of our daily Agonies for your Welfare. <hi>Brethren, our Hearts Deſire and Prayer to God, for you, is, that you may be Saved.</hi> We <hi>Fear exceedingly,</hi> Leſt you <hi>Steer</hi> thoſe <hi>Falſe Courſes</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> which may Entail Diſaſters on you, and leſt you miſs of a ſafe Arrival to the Port of Eternal Bleſſedneſs; And we <hi>Love exceedingly,</hi> to do all that can be done, to make you Happy. To Aſſiſt you in the obtaining of Happineſs, I am willing to ſet before you, the Example of the <hi>Marriners,</hi> that <hi>Feared the Lord excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</hi> The <hi>Problem,</hi> which we have now to <hi>Work,</hi> is This;</p>
            <p>That Sea-faring People ſhould be God-fearing People.</p>
            <p>Yea, I will carry the point ſo far, as to ſay, That <hi>No men,</hi> are more bound unto the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> than <hi>Seamen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis to be hoped, That none of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, will count themſelves excuſed from the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> There are none of us all, to whoſe <hi>Conſcience,</hi> there may not be made that Appeal, in Neh. 5.9. <hi>Ought ye not to walk in the Fear of God?</hi> But the <hi>Sea-faring</hi> Hearers, are to be now Addreſt, with this Advice, above the Reſt. There are none more obliged than YOU, to <hi>Walk</hi> (and Sail) <hi>in the Fear of God.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000932_0007_0FAD92FF54AE4408"/>
You</hi> paſs thro' <hi>Exceeding Hazzards, You</hi> Endure <hi>Exceeding Hardſhips, You</hi> Receive <hi>Exceeding Mercies</hi>; and therefore Syrs, it becomes You, to <hi>Fear the Lord exceedingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, In the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> now give Attention, to thoſe Admonitions, that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe unto you, from this Important</p>

               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Marriners</hi> are a Generation of men, greatly Serviceable to the <hi>Common wealth.</hi> Ordinarily they are men of ſtout and brave Spirits: They are under God, indeed the very Defence of our Nation: And we are beholden to them, for a very great part of thoſe Enjoyments, whereby our Lives are ſweetened unto us. The <hi>Invaluable Benefits,</hi> by the means of our <hi>Sea faring Friends</hi> done unto us, oblige us to no little Value and Friendſhip for them.

Syrs, You'l hazard the <hi>Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> of your <hi>Ships,</hi> and which is infinitely worſe, the <hi>Breaking</hi> of your <hi>Souls,</hi> if you don't <hi>break off</hi> your Ungodly Wayes, and <hi>Shape another Courſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When You are Sollicited unto the doing of my <hi>Ill Thing,</hi> I wiſh you would fortify your ſelves, with the Thoughts of <hi>One Thing,</hi> which often occurs unto the <hi>Marriner.</hi> Don't you often Divert your ſelves with <hi>Fiſhing</hi>?

caſt out his Hooks, to catch my precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul: His Hooks I am told, are Baited with the pleaſures of Sin; or, perhaps with the Hopes of Riches: If I do any Sinful Thing, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe Pleaſures and Riches, the Hooks of the Devil have taken me.

               </p>
               <p>In fine; 'Tis a common thing, for <hi>Sailors</hi> when they have received their <hi>Wages,</hi> to be gone unto Ill Houſes, and there <hi>Squander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> in a <hi>few weeks</hi> at Riotous Living, all that they have got, by <hi>many months</hi> of hard Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice aboard and abroad.

               </p>
               <p>More particularly. One Caution proper for you, is This: That you be ſure, you don't <hi>Go out of the way,</hi> when you <hi>Go to Sea.</hi> There was a man, who would needs <hi>Go to Sea,</hi> when
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000932_0019_0FAD930D00CE6BC0"/>
he had no <hi>Call</hi> to be there: But we read in Jon 1.4. <hi>The Lord ſent out a great Wind into the Sea, and there was a mighty Tempeſt in the Sea, ſo that the Ship was like to be broken.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you <hi>Go to Sea,</hi> ſeriouſly Examine, <hi>What Call you have to Go to Sea</hi>? Examine, Whether the <hi>Rules of Chriſtianity</hi> given in the Sacred Scriptures, be obſerved in your going to <hi>Sea</hi>? Examine, Whether in going to <hi>Sea,</hi> you have done, what you may with peace Reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if you ſaw the <hi>Ship</hi> foundring, or ſplitting under you. Could you ſay, <hi>Lord, I am where thou didſt call me to be</hi>? Syrs, Where are your <hi>Sailing Orders?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly, 'Twere much to be adviſed, That the <hi>Enchantments</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> may not have too ſtrong and quick a Force upon ſome, to make them raſhly leave <hi>Good Callings,</hi> by which they might competently ſubſiſt aſhore.

               <p>But then, there is another Caution, which is no more than what is Needful for you; This is, That when you <hi>Go to Sea,</hi> you don't go out with the Guilt of any <hi>Injuſtice</hi> upon you.

               <p>And perhaps, it may not be amiſs to add this one Caution more, unto all the reſt. There are ſome kinds of <hi>Paſſengers,</hi> 'tis a dangerous thing to <hi>Ship</hi> them.

and <hi>Pyrates,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and thoſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Wickedneſs, that have a mountain of Sin upon them, enough to Sink the ſtrongeſt Ship under Heaven.

with this little <hi>Spot</hi> of <hi>Time!</hi> Oh, a little more of this <hi>Time,</hi> in <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> and <hi>Meditations</hi> over the State of thy <hi>Soul.</hi> That, <hi>That</hi> would be for thy good Account, when <hi>Time</hi> ſhall be no more.

                  <hi>VII.</hi> Let the <hi>Fear of God</hi> work in you, a zeal rightly to improve the <hi>Works of God</hi>; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe <hi>Works,</hi> which at <hi>Sea,</hi> you are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained withal. We read concerning the <hi>Sea-faring,</hi> in Pſal 107.23, 24. <hi>They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do buſineſs in great Waters; theſe ſee the works of the Lord, and His Wonders in the Deep.</hi> Now there is an uſe which they ſhould make of what they ſee. And what uſe? When ſome had ſeen the Great <hi>Works</hi> of God, it was ſaid upon it, in Zeph. 3.7. <hi>I ſaid, ſurely thou wilt Fear me.</hi> When you go to <hi>Sea,</hi> you cannot but ſee the <hi>Wonders</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi>: See them all, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Wonders</hi> confeſſing the <hi>Creator</hi> of them all. Your <hi>Ships</hi> carry you to <hi>Do Buſineſs,</hi> where you ſee <hi>Creatures,</hi> that are full of <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Let it be part of your <hi>Buſineſs</hi> there, devoutly to confeſs, <hi>Theſe are the Works of the Lord</hi>! and adore the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the Lord, which is diſplay'd in all
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000932_0034_0FAD931F08B2AF40"/>
theſe <hi>Works.</hi> You'l ſee many <hi>Wonderful Things</hi> by <hi>Going to Sea,</hi> which they who Travel not from the ſight of their own <hi>Chimneys</hi> can ſee nothing of: The Invention of the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> and the <hi>Compaſs,</hi> about <hi>Three hundred years</hi> ago, has led men to the view of <hi>Wonderful Things</hi> every where, which till then they were more ſtrangers unto; Behold them all with pious Contemplations, and give Glory to the God, Who made all theſe Things Even the <hi>mute Fiſh</hi> themſelves, do with a <hi>Loud Voice</hi> call upon you, <hi>Fear God, and give Glory to Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then the <hi>Wonders</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> theſe Entertain you at <hi>Sea,</hi> with yet a more particular Application.</p>
               <p>Have you not met with <hi>wonderful Mercies,</hi> with merciful Deliverances and Salvations, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Sea</hi>! Let the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> keep you from Forgetting thoſe <hi>Mercies.</hi> The Favours we have received on the <hi>Waters,</hi> the memory of them ſhould not be written on the <hi>Waters</hi>; no, but as it were, on the durable <hi>Marble.</hi> Oh, lay that charge, and charm upon your Souls, in Pſal. 103.2. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and Forget not all His Benefits, who hath Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Life from Deſtruction.</hi> Have you no <hi>Journals,</hi> of what <hi>Mercies</hi> God hath at <hi>Sea</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon you? 'Tis fit, they ſhould be <hi>Entred.</hi> And when you come home, 'tis well, that you ordinarily publiſh in the Congregation,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000932_0035_0FAD931FA69E0C20"/>
your deſires to <hi>Praiſe</hi> the Name of God, for ſuch <hi>Mercies.</hi> Thus we read, in Pſal. 107.31, 32. <hi>He brings them unto their deſired Ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven. Oh, that men would praiſe the Lord, for His Goodneſs, and for His wonderful works to the Children of men. Let them Exalt Him alſo in the Congregation of the people, and praiſe Him in the Aſſembly of the Elders.</hi> But what ſignifie theſe verbal <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> if you don't <hi>Live</hi> your <hi>Thanks,</hi> as well as <hi>Give</hi> your <hi>Thanks</hi>? Who is the man, that ſo <hi>Offers praiſe,</hi> as to <hi>Glorify God</hi>? We are told, in Pſal. 50.23. <hi>He that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his Converſation aright.</hi> Now, if you would <hi>Order your Converſation aright,</hi> be ſure to <hi>Order</hi> it ſo, as in your <hi>perils</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> you would have choſen to have done. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that like <hi>Jonahs Marriners,</hi> you have laid your ſelves under <hi>Vows</hi> to God Oh, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the VOWS, you have made in your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>God</hi> will Remember them, if you do <hi>not</hi> Have you not <hi>Vow'd,</hi> That if God ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you in ſuch and ſuch Diſtreſſes, you would be more <hi>prayerful,</hi> more <hi>watchful,</hi> and ſpend your Time to better <hi>purpoſes,</hi> than formerly? Trifle not with the Eternal Majeſty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Tremble at His Word, in Eccl. 5.4. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, defer not to pay it, for He hath no pleaſure in Fools: wherefore ſhould God be angry at thy voice, and deſtroy the work of thy Hands?</hi> Reſolve with the Saint,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000932_0036_0FAD9320624C5D70"/>
in Pſal. 66.13, 14. <hi>I will pay thee my Vowes, which my Lips have uttered, and my Tongue hath ſpoken, when I was in Trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; Have you not ſeen <hi>wonderful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> at <hi>Sea?</hi> Perhaps, you have <hi>your ſelves</hi> met with <hi>Diſaſters</hi> there. Don't fancy now, that a Blind <hi>Fortune</hi> ſent thoſe <hi>Diſasters.</hi> There is the Hand of God in them all. They ſpeak to you, as in Hag. 1.7, 9. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, conſider your wayes. Ye looked for much, and lo it came to Little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it.</hi> You have alſo been Witneſſes, to the Doleful, and Rue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Calamities,</hi> wherewith others have there been overwhelmed. It was the commination in Iſa. 2.16. <hi>The Day of the Lord of Hoſts, ſhall be upon all the Ships.</hi> Our Lamentation has been upon the Execution of that Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in <hi>grievous Things,</hi> that our <hi>Marriners</hi> have met withal. Alas, Alas, How hardly have they been uſed? What <hi>Cruelties</hi> have many of them ſuffered; not only from the Hands of cruel <hi>Enemies</hi> abroad, but alſo from ſome of their own <hi>Commanders</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> in their own <hi>Ships</hi> at Home? To what conſuming <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> have they been expoſed, while the <hi>Destroying Angels</hi> have had large Commiſſions to conſume them, and cut them off, and what <hi>Peſt houſes</hi> have even their own <hi>Ships</hi> been unto them? Upon them there has fallen the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000932_0037_0FAD93212A7A7F18"/>
ſhare of thoſe <hi>Calamities,</hi> that have of late years diſtreſs'd a ſinful world; and they have, <hi>Dy'd of Grievous Deaths.</hi> Take warning by theſe diſmal Things, I entreat you; and let ſuch things awaken you unto the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> It was ſaid of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> in Zech. 9.4, 5. <hi>Behold, the Lord will ſmite her power in the Sea</hi>; And of others it follows, <hi>They ſhall See it and Fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But know it, That if you would <hi>Fear the Lord Exceedingly,</hi> you muſt <hi>Fear the Lord Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably</hi>; I mean, in your <hi>Youth.</hi> We read of One, who <hi>Feared the Lord Greatly:</hi> But that perſon could ſay, in 1 King. 18.12. <hi>I Fear the Lord from my Youth.</hi> Our <hi>Sea men</hi> are moſtly <hi>Young Men.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Fear of God</hi> is no more among them, therefore it is, that ſo few of them ever come to be <hi>Old Men.</hi> Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Young men.</hi> Do you <hi>Betimes</hi> Devote your ſelves unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and be able to ſay unto Him, <hi>Lord, I am thy Servant, devoted unto thy Fear.</hi> There is a <hi>Ship</hi> of the greateſt Conſequence imaginable; The <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is that <hi>Ship.</hi> The <hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>Ship</hi> is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf. Come to the Illuſtrious <hi>Commander.</hi> Requeſt Him to Accept you among His <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners.</hi> Commit your ſelves to His Conduct; That is to ſay, Enter into <hi>Covenant</hi> with Him.

                  <hi>Do This,</hi> now in your <hi>Youth,</hi> O my <hi>Young Folks</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Leſt you never have any Opportunity to do it at all. <hi>Do This,</hi> and you will make a more gainful Voyage, than ever the <hi>Marriners</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> did unto <hi>Ophir,</hi> or, <hi>Africa</hi>; as much more <hi>gainful,</hi> as <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>better than the gain of fine Gold.</hi>

               <p>Upon the whole; Take my <hi>Wiſhes</hi> for you all.
