            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE only apology for the publication of this SERMON is the deſire of thoſe who heard it. And if the peruſal of it, ſhould afford either entertainment or inſtruction to them, or others, into whoſe hands accident may throw it, my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will be amply compenſated. The inaccura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſtyle which may be found in it, will, I hope, find favour from the candor of the public, and its defects not be weighed in the balance of ſevere criticiſm.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE pulpit is devoted to more important purpoſes, than the fate of kingdoms, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the inſtruction of mankind in the way to everlaſting life. But, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity calls, it may with propriety, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs us on civil liberty; and at once inſtruct and warm thoſe who are willing to hazard their lives, in the defence of the privileges of their country. On this affecting occaſion, when ſome preſent, ſoon expect to go into the ſervice of the colonies, on whoſe account we are now aſſembled in the houſe of God, your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn attention is earneſtly ſolicited to the paſſage of holy writ, juſt read.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:014382_0004_0F926258AEE24608"/>I RETURN to the firſt of theſe. Miſchiefs are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined againſt us, by evil men.</p>
            <p>To paint the diſtreſſes of our native land in colours ſufficiently bright, is a taſk to which I own myſelf unequal. However, a few words on this ſubject, will be pertinent, and not unentertaining to you. Our forefathers purchaſed our invaluable liberties at the expence of their blood and treaſure. To enjoy their religion, their God, and their conſciences, and to tranſmit an unembarraſſed worſhip, untaxed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and fair freedom, with her happy train of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous bleſſings, down to future generations; they left their pleaſant, native ſoil, the other ſide of the atlantic, relinquiſhed friends and near connexions, braved all hardſhips and deſpiſed all dangers. At the expence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, without the leaſt charge to the country from whence they came, by unwearied endeavours and an intrepid ſpirit, they effected ſettlements in the diſtant and inhoſpitable wilds of <hi>America,</hi> then filled with ſavage barbarians. Propitious heaven ſmiled on their arduous attempts, and crowned their bold enterpriſes with unexpected ſucceſs. How ſoon did this country after their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, change its appearance! the huts of ſavages were converted into the dwellings of chriſtians. That dark, blind ignorance, which ſat brooding over the minds of the aborigines was gradually chaſed away. Now fair ſcience dawns, and the arts of life are culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated diligently and are brought to a tolerable perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where ſatan was once worſhipped, now the true God is ſerved. Where ſuperſtition once raged, now the pureſt form of worſhip on the face of the earth is eſtabliſhed, and the ſacred rights of conſcience main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. In a word, the glorious light of chriſtianity has diſpelled the dark glooms of paganiſm. And as <hi>America</hi> was ſought as an aſylum for civil as well as religious freedom, ſo governments, veſted with perfect legiſlatures were erected by <hi>royal leave,</hi> and a friendly
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014382_0005_0F92625CCEECA208"/>
correſpondence eſtabliſhed between the colonies and the kingdom from whence they derived their origin. The mutual advantages of this union were great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation. From this ſource the exceeding increaſe of the wealth and fame, ſtrength and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the realm aroſe. <hi>America</hi> was peculiarly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py under the ſhadow of the wings, and in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the friendſhip of <hi>Britain.</hi> Indeed no people more happy, more free, more virtuous could be found where'er the circling ſun performs its deſtined courſe. But alas, ſhort is the date of human felicity! forgetful of the ties of blood, hardened againſt the bonds of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and unfeeling to the ſentiments of gratitude, the parent ſtate envies the liberties, riſing glory, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing greatneſs, and growing riches of the dutiful daughter. On theſe ſhe fixes her malignant eye. Over theſe oppreſſion longs to ſtretch her iron rod. Fair LIBERTY, offspring of virtue, trembles at the ſight of the hated monſter. Deſpotiſm aſſumes the ſpecious name of government; would puſh coercive meaſures under the colourable pretence of wiſe commercial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, and calls abſolute ſervitude, juſt ſubmiſſion to parliament.</p>
            <p>ABSURD as are the principles and notions on which the doctrine of arbitrary power is eſtabliſhed, there have been ever in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> found many to adopt it. The vulgar are liable at all times to be deceived; as they are now by the plauſible argument uſed with them to perſuade them, every ſhilling raiſed by taxes in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica will ſo much lighten their burden; by which artifice the <hi>Premier</hi> has ſecured on his ſide the landed intereſt; and the nation has ever produced a number of bad citizens, who prone to be corrupted, have been the ready tools of wicked miniſters, and the zealous partiſans in a cauſe big with the ruin of the ſtate. It is juſtly remarked by an able writer,
<q>that there may be a faction for the crown as well as againſt it, and conſpiracies againſt freedom as well as againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</q>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:014382_0006_0F92625FB8AD6A28"/>
Whoever attempts to remove the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations neceſſary to render monarchy conſiſtent with liberty, are rebels in the worſt ſenſe, rebels to the laws of their country, the law of nature, the law of reaſon, and the law of God. Was the queſtion to be put, could there be ſuch wretches? we ſhould be ready to anſwer, it cannot be. But the Britiſh annals have a ſhameful tale to tell, that ſuch lovers of arbitrary power have ever exiſted in the ſtate from the earlieſt period of the conſtitution. They have not only prevented the eſtabliſhing any regular ſyſtem for ſecuring and improving the <hi>liberties</hi> of the ſubject and fixing the line of prerogative, but always lye in wait for every opportunity, which the imperfections of the conſtitution may give them to deſtroy thoſe rights which have been purchaſed by the toil and blood of the moſt exalted individuals who ever adorned humanity. Having carried their deſpotic plan to enormous lengths, by the influence of bribery at <hi>home,</hi> ſince the acceſſion of the <hi>preſent King,</hi> they have taken large ſtrides, in the ſame plan, in <hi>America.</hi> Indeed, if we but for a moment look over our land, and glance a reflection on the cruel, unjuſt, and oppreſſive meaſures of the miniſtry at <hi>home,</hi> we ſhall be ſtruck with horror at the miſchiefs imagined againſt us. The ſum of them all is in the ſtatute, which declares parliament can of right, make laws to bind us in all caſes whatever. Did ever more arbitrary ſtatute diſgrace the annals of the Britiſh nation, even in the moſt arbitrary reigns?— They have undertaken to give and grant our money without our conſent—they ſhew no regard for our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or rights.— But why do I ſtand to enumerate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars? No conquered province was ever dealt more hardly by.—Our precious liberties are invaded—Our ſacred charters violated—Our property taken from us —foreign troops, the bane of government, quartered among us in times of profound peace.—The cruel ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of popery eſtabliſhed, protiſtaniſm only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014382_0007_0F926262A8B19270"/>
and a deſpotiſm dangerous to the laſt degree to us, erected in a large neighbouring province. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God! what miſchiefs are imagined againſt us! Never, never did ſo dark, ſo gloomy, ſo alarming, ſo terrible calamities hang over <hi>America</hi> as the preſent. Who that is zealous in the cauſe of liberty, and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fervent devotion to the civil rights of his country, but muſt weep over her fate? Cruel as are the miſchiefs imagined againſt us, fleets and armies are ſent over to enforce them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To make them take effect, or to bring us to ſubmiſſion, war is begun. "Continually are they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together for war." Had man continued in a ſtate of innocence, war had never been known. But now, alas the fatal effects of apoſtacy, in every age of the world, and among all nations killing one another hath been taught and practiced by mankind, as a ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In this ſtate of ſin and imperfection, war is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, not only abſolutely neceſſary, but ſtrictly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It can only be lawful, either conſonant to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of reaſon or permitted by the precepts of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, when an invaſion is made upon us. It is true, according to the peaceable maxims of policy in our bleſſed Saviour's kingdom, we are to love our enemies, bleſs them that curſe us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them who deſpitefully uſe us. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the apoſtles doctrine are to be ſubject to the powers that be. From theſe paſſages to ſupport arbitrary principles and to argue againſt the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of oppoſing force by force, would be to draw ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and dangerous concluſions, from the gentle and condeſcending laws of the religion of Jeſus. To draw the ſword and ſhed human blood for the ſake of conqueſt, muſt, in the judgment of reaſon, be deemed a horrid crime. An offenſive war can therefore never be either neceſſary or juſtifiable. To enlarge empire, feed vain glory, exalt pride, reward favourites, ſupport luxury, and gratify peſtilential ambition, muſt be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014382_0008_0F926262DBEB4720"/>
wretched motives in a Prince to engage in a war. And all the blood ſhed, horrors felt, and diſtreſſes endured, muſt be laid at the doors of the aggreſſors. The wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es who compoſe the army of a tyrant, are aſſociated by folly in the ſervice of rapine and murder; and that men ſhould imagine they were deſerving of honour by the maſſacre of their fellow creatures or fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects merely to flatter ambition with a new tittle or to enforce oppreſſive meaſures, is, perhaps as inſcrutable a myſtery as any that has perplexed reaſon, and as groſs an abſurdity as any that has diſgraced it. It is equally to puniſh vice and prevent miſery, that I wiſh always to ſee it branded with infamy: For even the ſucceſſes of vice terminate in the anguiſh of diſappointment. As to Alexander, the fruit of all his conqueſts was tears, ſo I wiſh not only the tears of diſappointment, but the tears of repentance to thoſe who want to have <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> ſacrificed to the luſt of domination. A vaſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of weighty and invincible arguments might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be produced to prove the iniquity of an offenſive war, for the ſake of the acquiſition of honor or additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of territory. But to plunder under ſanction of law, to ſtrip a people of the bleſſings of peace, to raiſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue out of the fruits of their honeſt induſtry, to involve in diſtreſs, and to reduce them to the hard neceſſity of either giving up their liberty, or of appealing to arms is a crime of which words cannot deſcribe the blackneſs, and which muſt fill us with painful ſentiments to think humanity is depraved enough to commit. How nearly this is the caſe with us and <hi>Great Britain</hi> is too plain not to be ſeen by all. We have reaſoned—we have remonſtrated—we have prayed—we have even weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>royal ear</hi> with our cries—we have perſued every reſpectful, every gentle meaſure.— But all in vain. We muſt be ſcourged into vaſſalage like ſlaves. We have been dragged reluctantly into an unnatural civil war.— Hoſtilities are commenced, and the <hi>kings troops,</hi> the inſtruments of tyranny, were the aggreſſors. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

the battle at Lexington, ſhameful in every view, to the Britiſh arms! We are reduced to the ſad, depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated neceſſity of defending our rights at the point of the ſword. We muſt either reſiſt unto blood or be ſlaves. No other alternative is left us. As our's is then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, it muſt be a righteous war. Should a ruffian meet me on the road, demand my purſe with a dagger at my throat, or piſtol at my breaſt, if by any means I could ſtrike him dead, I ſhould think myſelf warranted to do it, by the laws of God and man.</p>
            <p>WHEN therefore our money is demanded of us, by the <hi>gentle arguments</hi> of fleets and armies, or with the boyonet at our breaſts, we are warranted by all laws human and divine, to defend ourſelves by the hardeſt, &amp; appeal to heaven for the juſtice of our cauſe. Tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unreſiſtingly to give up the liberties, with which God and nature have bleſſed us, and which we hold dear as men, and ſacred as chriſtians, muſt be a crime in us. Nay, I may venture to affirm you have no more right to give up your life and liberties, than your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour has forcibly to take them from you. We may therefore with humble confidence in the mercies of the impartial judge and ſupreme ruler of the univerſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly commit our righteous cauſe to him, and fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implore his compaſſionate interpoſition for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.

            <p n="3">III. DELIVERANCE is to be ſought from the Lord. When David prays, as he does in the text, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a coward; for he was as diſtinguiſhed a warrior as eminent ſaint. As he appeared in Zion, fervent in devotion, ſo he proved himſelf undaunted in fortitude in the field of battle. His fear of the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God, was the beſt ſecurity againſt an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeing fear of man. While therefore he complains of the injuſtice of his enemies, he implores the merciful interpoſition of heaven for deliverance and is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to engage the preſence of the God of battles with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014382_0010_0F926263F985CCB0"/>SEEKING deliverance from the Lord implies a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe of our abſolute dependance on—conviction of the almighty power of—continued application by prayer to the mercy of God, and repentance of ſin. To ſeek deliverance from, is to feel our dependance on God. Mankind are naturally filled with pride and ſelf-dependance; unwilling to own their ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the diſpoſal of him, who is their Lord and Maker. But the truth is, both as individuals and as a people we are entirely dependant for life, and breath, and being, and all things, upon, and abſolutely at the diſpoſal of a ſovereign God. Whether we realize it or not, it is true, God could with infinite eaſe cut us down and ſend us to endleſs miſery. It is therefore of great moment to have our minds deeply and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſed with an habitual conviction of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant dependance on God the great creator and moral governor and ſupreme law-giver of the univerſe, from whom alone we may hope for deliverance, and who juſtly claims from all rational creatures, the higheſt eſteem, moſt ardent love, and unremitted obedience.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, we muſt be convinced <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the almighty power of God, in order to ſeek acceptably deliverance. The ſupreme being chuſes to have his people acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege his power. When God interpoſes in behalf of any, he will have his arm made bare in ſuch a manner as to convince all it is his, both thoſe for whom, and thoſe againſt whom it is made bare. We muſt then realize his almighty power; believe and reſt aſſured he can do every thing; that nothing is too hard for omnipotence; that as he made, ſo he governs the world with unering rectitude; that he can ride forth conquering and to conquer for his people; can ſtrike dead all that oppoſe his people, and work deliverance for them by unthought of means; he can turn their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity into proſperity, their affliction into joy, their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles into bleſſings, and cut of darkneſs bring forth light.</p>
            <p>Again, WE muſt continually apply to his mercy
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014382_0011_0F926264B1A82880"/>
by prayer. God hath in gracious condeſcention ſtyled himſelf a prayer hearing God. He permits ſuch worms of the duſt as we are, to approach his ſacred preſence; to ſpread our requeſts before and make known our wants to him through Jeſus Chriſt, by whoſe atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone our ſins can be pardoned &amp; our cries heard. Now the word of God abounds with proofs of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's pleaſure to make his power, as it were, tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the prayers of his faithful people. Thus the prayer of Joſhua ſtopped the ſun in his courſe; and that of Elijah, though a man of like paſſions with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves opened and ſhut the ſprings which water the earth. The prayer of the three children preſerved them in the fiery furnace from being hurt, and that of Daniel from the devouring lions. The time would fail me to mention what we find recorded in ſcripture of the wonders wrought through the powers of prayer. There is indeed no age without a cloud of witneſſes of the infaliable efficacy of prayer. Let us then begin, let us perſevere in calling upon the Lord for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this dark and alarming day. Real chriſtians muſt value prayer, and be conſtant and unwearied in it; ſo will the ſame bountiful God, whoſe ears are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver open to the prayers of his faithful people, open in the end, heaven to receive their perſons. He will give them an abundant entrance into that kingdom, where petitions are no more; becauſe neither weakneſs, nor want, nor fear, nor trial, remain, but all the ſoul feels is perfect felicity, and all it expreſſes, perfect praiſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, WE muſt repent of ſin, or we do not ſeek a right for deliverance from the Lord. In true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſin itſelf becomes the greateſt burden and object of averſion; ſorrow ſprings from an affecting hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſenſe of the diſhonor and injury the penitent feels he has done unto God; not from a ſelfiſh concern for his own ſafety, but from a regard to God, to which he was before a ſtranger; from a conviction that his whole
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014382_0012_0F9262659072DC78"/>
deportment and the ruling tempers of his heart at all times have been evil &amp; deſperately wicked. Now the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality among us ſeem to be concerned for our diſtreſſed country, and are ardently deſirous to contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſave it from ruin. They are willing to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice much to the cauſe of freedom. But there is one kind of ſacrifice by which you could do more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential ſervice to your country, than to give all your goods to feed its ſuffering poor. A ſacrifice, in one view, of the cheapeſt kind. A ſacrifice which will coſt you nothing. Do you aſk what it can be? It is the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of your ſins to the cauſe of liberty. If you would give up your ſins, ſlay them, and, ſo to ſpeak, offer them on the altar of liberty as bleeding victims; it will be the beſt thing you can do for your country, for liberty, and for yourſelves.</p>
            <p>A ſhort improvement will cloſe the preſent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, from what hath been ſaid, we ſee the juſtice of our cauſe.—The obſtinacy and cruelty of our foes have obliged us to appeal from reaſon to arms. There is no choice left us but ſlavery or civil war. England, whoſe conſtitution hath been the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, admiration, and envy of ſurrounding ſtates—Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as famous for arts as for arms—England, which hath ſhed the blood of her beſt citizens in the glorious cauſe of liberty, hath now ſat down herſelf to forge the arbitrary chains. The laws of reaſon and ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation will juſtify the moſt ſtrenuous oppoſition, nay duty calls on us to buckle on the harneſs &amp; march out into the field and if we muſt give up our liberties, give them up at the point of the ſword.</p>
            <p>IN the ſecond place, we may with humble confidence implore the merciful interpoſition of Almighty God for our deliverance. All who have an intereſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are loudly called upon, to beſiege the throne of grace, as conſtant and devout ſupplicants. Every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that can operate on the human heart, urges to this duty. A fervent attachment to the civil rights

of your country, muſt irreſiſtably force you to cry migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to God. Let us therefore devoutly recommend our bleeding country's righteous cauſe, to the pitying eye of a compaſſionate God, through a divine Saviour, and piouſly crave his bleſſing on our rulers, on the meaſures that may be adopted, for ſucceſs to our arms, and the divine preſence to be with thoſe, that are going from among us, in this place, into the ſervice of the colonies, an addreſs to whom will wind up the preſent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>MY FRIENDS,</p>
            <p>IT is at your deſire I now addreſs you from this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred deſk; you will therefore allow me to uſe the utmoſt freedom, and to give you my parting advice with the greateſt plaineſs. It will be comprehended in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars, which I wiſh you to remember &amp; by which I wiſh you to act.—Be courageous—be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly—be ſober, and fear the Lord.</p>
            <p>Be courageous. Cowardice is as unſeemly in a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, as ignorance is in a ſtateſman As the ſkill of a pilot in a ſtorm, and the worth of a chriſtian in a time of trial, ſo the valour of a ſoldier is beſt ſeen in a day of battle. You know not how you will feel when called into an engagement, to give back then will brand you with the odious name of a coward. The moſt of you are ſtrangers to the dreadful horrors of battle. An army drawn up in battle array, the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of cannon, the ſmoke and confuſion, the cries of the wounded, groans of the dying, and all the dreadful horrors of battle are things to which you have not been accuſtomed. He is the brave ſoldier who at ſuch an awful juncture, has entire ſelf-poſſeſſion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind. You have every thing to inſpire you with undaunted fortitude. You fight not for your daily bread—not for four-pence ſterling a day, but for your lives, your property, your native land, your dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends, your juſt rights, all you hold dear as men and ſacred as chriſtians, your ALL. If theſe motives do
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014382_0014_0F92626703B1E858"/>
not fire your ſouls in your country's cauſe, what can! Indeed you have every thing before you to rouſe up the ſoldier, warm the man and animate the chriſtian. Play the men therefore for your God, your people, and the cities of your God.</p>
            <p>BE orderly. Nothing is more beautiful in a ſoldier than the moſt exact attention, ſcrupulous regard and punctual obedience to order. Orderly troops are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more likely to gain honor to themſelves, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their arms, and triumph for their country, than a confuſed rabble. If, in the day of battle, you do not obey ſtrictly orders and keep in ranks, defeat will moſt certainly enſue. Well diciplined and orderly forces, hiſtory abundantly evinces, carry the greateſt terror with them, and are generally ſucceſsful. I muſt therefore enjoin upon you, the moſt punctual attention to orders.</p>
            <p>BE ſober. Temperance and ſobriety are fine orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the ſoldier whoſe life expoſes him to number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs dangers, throws him in the midſt of temptation and hardens him in the commiſſion of ſin. No two profeſſions ſo full of danger, as the ſailor and ſoldier, and none ſo looſe and wicked. Extravagant mirth, vain levity and univerſal forgetfulneſs of decency of deportment will ſit with a very ill grace on thoſe, who pretend to ſacrifice life to the cauſe of freedom and their country. As I would not have you lay aſide the man, when you aſſume the ſoldier, ſo I would not have you forget the duties of religion in the noiſe of a camp. Let compaſſion, tenderneſs, kindneſs and benevolence to all, be your companions. Do not imagine you may put on the unfeeling fierceneſs of a barbarian, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt yourſelves of humanity. Wherever you may be poſted, and in all your marches remember the ſabbath day to keep it holy. Remember all the duties of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion &amp; ſink not down into ſtupid neglect or thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs contempt of them. Let it appear that the camp and religion, commonly great ſtrangers to each other,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014382_0015_0F926267B992E440"/>
are not inconſiſtent. With you, inſtead of profanity, let there be reverence of divine things; and inſtead of oaths and curſes, the cries of prayer.</p>
            <p>LASTLY. Fear the Lord. I do not mention this part of the advice, laſt in order, becauſe it is laſt in importance; for it is the one thing needful and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite moment. He that fears God the moſt, will be the leaſt likely to fear man; for the fear of God is the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſecurity againſt cowardice, and the good man will make the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt ſoldier; and if you are never to return to your friends, the fear of the Lord will be a ſure paſſ-port to eternal honours. Life, you know, is very uncertain, you are going into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ought ſolemnly to be reminded of a dying hour. Do not think then when you have on the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of war, the inſtruments of death, you are complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equipped. There is another kind of armour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite moment and abſolute neceſſity, the armour of righteouſneſs. Take then, the girdle of truth—the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs—the ſhield of faith—the helmet of ſalvation—and the ſword of the ſpirit, and you will be completely armed, prepared to meet your fate, either to conquer, or die in battle.</p>
            <p>To conclude. WE wiſh you the divine preſence—we wiſh you the divine bleſſing—we wiſh you ſucceſs, may you be ſecured from temptation, preſerved from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhielded from danger, and ſaved from death. But if we never ſee one another's faces again in the land of the living, may we all be ſo happy as to meet in that world, where there will be no war, nor rumors of war, but where peace ſerene ſhall fill every breaſt, love divine glow in every heart, and hoſanna's exalted ſound from every tongue.</p>
