            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My dear Children,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT appears to me, by the cleareſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I draw near, very near to the period of this mortal life. Divine Providence has been pleaſed to lay my feeble body on a languiſhing ſick bed. I believe, from various ſymptoms, that my diſeaſe is incurable, and conſequently muſt iſſue in death; and, to confirm this truth, I am given over by my phyſicians, and muſt in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, in a very ſhort time depart into the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible world of ſpirits, and never ending eternity.</p>
            <p>What a great and important change death makes on mankind. The body dies, and in a ſhort time turns to putrefaction in the grave; but the ſoul will ſurvive through the countleſs ages of eternity. But, my dear children, this is my conſolation, and the foundation of all my hopes, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chief, Tim. i. 15; and whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. Therefore, reſpecting my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I am contented and happy. For, through the riches of divine grace, I can, with aſſurance, ſay, that when the earthly houſe of this my tabernacle is diſſolved by the pale meſſenger Death, I have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, 2 Cor. v. 1. Therefore, I ſhall very ſhortly in the words, and I humbly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022827_0019_0FBA6CB716B10178"/>
hope and pray in the faith, of bleſſed Stephen, commit my ſoul into the hands of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is ready to receive it, and bid an eternal farewel to all temporal things. But what troubles and concerns me, is you, my dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; after my departure you will be poor help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs orphans, and my dear wife, and your kind indulgent mother, will be a diſconſolate widow. I leave you in a troubleſome and wicked world, beſet with enemies on every ſide; but my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is mitigated and my hopes revived, through the gracious and comfortable promiſes of my covenant God, who commands me to leave my fatherleſs children "with him and he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them above alive, Jerem. xlix. 11. and my dear widow, by believing and truſting in the Lord, ſhall want nothing that is truly good." They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. Truſt in the Lord, my dear children, with all your hearts, and lean not to your own underſtandings; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct your paths. The Lord tells us by his prophet Jeremiah, that the way of man is not in himſelf; it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps, Jer. x. 23. We have nothing to hope in but ſovereign grace.</p>
            <p>Give me leave, my dear children, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, in the ſtrongeſt terms, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtudying of the ſacred and inſpired wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which our gracious heavenly Father hath given us to learn and know his will. Bleſſed is he that readeth and they who hear the words of this prophecy, Rev. i. 3. and keeps thoſe things
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022827_0020_0FBA6CB82A4CE350"/>
which are written in this divine book. Make the Bible your treaſure, the promiſes your inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and you will be happy here and for ever.</p>
            <p>I alſo beg and requeſt, I pray and beſeech you, my dear children, with all the ſympathizing bowels of compaſſion, and endearing entreaties of a loving and tender parent, that you will grant me this one requeſt, namely, to read my dying words through at leaſt once a month; it is my laſt will and teſtament, and I deſire it as much as I do that you ſhould enjoy my eſtate and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral goods which I have given and bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you. I have been inſtrumental, through God's bleſſing, of your birth into this world; your ſpiritual nativity is out of my power, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of the omnipotent power of divine grace, can poſſibly effect it: And this divine change muſt paſs, on your ſouls, my dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, otherwiſe there can be no ſalvation for you in the world to come, John iii. 5. Therefore, my earneſt cries, prayers, and petitions are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently offered up to the God of heaven; and you, my dear children, muſt not be wanting to addreſs the throne of grace yourſelves, that God would pour his grace and ſpirit upon your ſouls, and make you new creatures in Chriſt Jeſus. "Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children, even ſo is the Lord merciful unto them that fear him.—The merciful goodneſs of the Lord endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever and ever upon them that fear him, and his righteouſneſs upon children's children.—The Lord hath engraven his people on the palms of his hands, he keeps them as the apple of his eye, Deut. xxxii. 10. and waters them with his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022827_0021_0FBA6CB9A54FC9D0"/>
grace every moment—For the mountains ſhall depart and the hills be removed, but my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall not depart from thee; neither ſhall the covenant of my peace be removed, faith the Lord that hath mercy on thee, Iſaiah lxiv. 10." I am commanded in the ſacred oracles of truth, to teach and inſtruct my children in the good old way, that the holy fathers, prophets, and apoſtles have trod; and thro' grace, I have endeavoured, according to the ability given me of God, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this weighty and important duty. I will further, my dear children, addreſs you in the words of the pious Pſalmiſt, to his beloved ſon Solomon: And thou, know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, for the Lord ſearches all hearts and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou ſeek him he will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever, 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. Hear, ye children, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a father, and attend to know under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for I give ye good doctrine, forſake ye not my law, Prov. iv. 1, 2. Call on the Lord and he will anſwer thee, and ſhew thee great and mighty things which thou knoweſt not, Jer. xxxiii. 3. For the Lord hath promiſed in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible word, that he will be found of you, when you ſearch for him with your whole heart and ſoul, Jerem. xxix. 13. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them whoſe heart is perfect towards him, 2 Chron. xvi. 9. For the Lord God is a ſun and ſhield, the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he

withhold from them that walk uprightly, Pſal. lxxxiv. 11." The omnipotent Jehovah is a wall of fire about his choſen people, and a munition of rocks to defend them from every enemy and every evil. Secure his favour by an evangelical faith in Chriſt, and you may bid defiance to every evil; you may laugh at all the wicked powers of earth and hell. The omnipotent Jehovah fills heaven and earth with his preſence, and always ſurrounds us with his immenſity, as the light and darkneſs doth our bodies, day and night, Jerem. xxxiii. 23. For in GOD we live, and move, and have our being, Acts xvii. 28. Therefore, my dear children, do you not behave in any manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting YOURSELVES, or others, which you would be aſhamed of before the meaneſt of your fellow creatures. There is no creature that is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the ſight of God, Heb. iv. 13. Light and darkneſs are both alike to him, Pſal. cxxxix. 12. His all-ſeeing eye beholds every creature with one comprehenſive glance, and no created ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can ſcreen his all penetrating eye from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it.—Be ye, therefore, ſtrong in the faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus; becauſe abundance of grace, the ſpecial gift of faith, will enable you to ſtand complete and perfect in the whole will of God, John vi. 29. The glory of God and the ſalvation of your ſouls, ought always to have the pre-eminence, becauſe it is the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Happy is the man that findeth wiſdom, and the man that getteth underſtanding; for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of it is better than the merchandize of ſilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold: She is more precious than rubies, and all the things

thou canſt deſire are not to be compared with her; length of days are in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour: Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace: She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her, Prov. chap. iii. You are very near my heart, my dear children, and I do moſt earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your eternal felicity; but you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what the word of God ſays on this head, that without holineſs of heart and life, you can never ſee the face of God with comfort. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation; catch the preſent moments as they fly: Ariſe, therefore, and be doing, and the Lord ſhall be with you.</p>
            <p>But I am become exceeding faint and weak with ſpeaking, and in a very ſhort time my ſoul will take its everlaſting flight into the inviſible world of ſpirits; therefore, as Moſes the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Lord, breathed out his ſoul in prayer to God, for his people, ſo my ſoul cries to the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, for you, my dear children. Oh! that you were wiſe, Oh! that you underſtood this, that you would conſider your latter end; how ſhortly will this great change paſs on your ſouls, and pale death bring your bodies to the duſt. Probably not one of the human race in fifty thouſand lives to my age, which is about ſeventy; and you, my dear children, though in the bloom of youth, and perfect health of body, may inſtantly cut down like a flower in its prime, as thouſands and tens of thouſands of mankind are; its is thought
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022827_0024_0FBA6CC39101F930"/>
that three parts of mankind are called off by death before they arrive at the age of thirty years. It is the opinion of the wiſe and learned, that there is not a moment paſſes (all mankind conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered throughout the world), without an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul departing into the inviſible world—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Judge ſtandeth before the door. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is at hand, be ye therefore ſober, and watch unto prayer. Now, my dear wife and children, I muſt leave you, therefore, I commit you to God and the word of his grace, who is able to build you up in the moſt holy faith, and give you an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.—Farewel my dear wife and children, farewel.</p>
