            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Who am of the Leaſt, the moſt Unable, and Unworthy of all your Servants in the Lord, am called at this time to Preach before this Great, and Good Aſſembly, an Aſſembly of the Choſen People of the Lord: The Choice, the Beſt, the moſt Wife, the moſt Able in the Province; an Aſſembly, which is yet accounted (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a great Declenſion and Degeneracy) the moſt truly Honourable, Venerable, Pious, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, of any in the <hi>Weſtern World.</hi> This Land was Sown with good Seed, planted with choice Vines, Men generally Vertuous, Pious and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Religion was their main intereſt; it was no Worldly deſign, but meerly on the account of Religion; they came to theſe remote Ends of the Earth, a vaſt and howling Wilderneſs: God ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally owned, and bleſſed them in their great, and
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0003_0FB292B4C10CC4B0"/>
dangerous Undertaking, God was <hi>with them,</hi> and it was well with them. God was a <hi>Wall of fire round about them,</hi> and their glory in the midſt of them: No weapons formed againſt them Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Counſels were turned to Fooliſhneſs. <hi>We have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us, what God did for them in their days, How He did drive out the Heathen, and Planted them; they got not the Land in Poſſeſſion by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm ſave them.</hi> They were <hi>with God,</hi> and God was with them: They Sought and Served God, God Proſpered them: They Sought the Kingdom of God in the firſt Place; They had the additional Bleſſings of Heaven, and Earth, Sea and Land: From Small beginnings, in few years they became a Flouriſhing, and conſiderable Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But ſince their days, their Poſterity, and Succeſſors have much Degenerated: <hi>As we have increaſed, ſo we have Sinned, and Provoked the Lord againſt us.</hi> We have changed our Ways and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in great meaſure; God hath changed his Ways, and dealings towards us. God hath Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed againſt us by variety of Judgments for a long time. We have been Impoveriſhed, brought Low, Afflicted, many evils and troubles have befallen us; eſpecially the <hi>Sword,</hi> a cruel Sword; a Cruel Barbarous Enemy. The Sword God is not wont to draw upon His People when leſs Chaſtiſements are effectual. Here hath been great Declenſion: God hath been greatly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked; <hi>How is our Gold become dim, and our fine Gold changed?</hi> This is matter of Lamentation!
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0004_0FB293458CADC9E0"/>
and that which is greater, We are ſtill Declining, notwithſtanding all Means uſed to prevent and to reduce.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to apply my ſelf in ſuch manner, as I judge moſt ſuitable to a People ſo circumſtanced. <hi>Deo annuente, et adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vante.</hi> God needeth no Inſtruments: He can work with them, or without them, as in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Him. The <hi>beſt</hi> can do nothing <hi>without</hi> God; the <hi>weakeſt</hi> can do much <hi>with</hi> God. God's Strength is made perfect in Weakneſs, 1 Cor. 3.7. <hi>He that planteth is not any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not offend any Perſon, nor offer any thing, but what might be agreeable to all; yet to pleaſe all I account a thing next to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>Quot Capita tot Senſus. Omnes non idem Sapiunt.</hi> I deſire not the Praiſe of Men, I deſire to pleaſe God above all: I deſire God may give me His Grace ſo to do. Give what He may accept and accept what He gives.</p>

               <pb facs="unknown:001369_0005_0FB29346F9517258"/>THIS Book is called by the Hebrews, <hi>Vajedabber,</hi> from the firſt words: And (the Lord) <hi>Said.</hi> Some-times <hi>Bemidbar,</hi> that is, <hi>In the Wilderneſs,</hi> where theſe things were acted. According to the Greek Title, it is called <hi>Numbers</hi>; ſo called from the many Numbrings recorded in the Book. The moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Numbring we have in <hi>Numb.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. Where God commandeth Moſes, <hi>On the firſt day of the ſecond Month, in the ſecond year after they were come cut of the Land of Egypt, to Take the Sum of all the Congregation of Iſrael: from twenty year old and upward, that were able to go forth to War.</hi> Except the Levites, <hi>v.</hi> 47. Twenty years old: [<hi>Heb.</hi>] a Son of twenty, entring into, or beginning to be twenty. The total Sum we have, <hi>v.</hi> 46. <hi>Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand and three thouſand, and five hundred and fifty.</hi> A wonderful increaſe of Seventy Souls in ſuch a time. A reward of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11, 12. <hi>Through faith Sarah received ſtrength to conceive, therefore there ſprang even from one, ſo many as the Stars of the Skie for multitude, and as the Sand of the Sea Shore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable. Balaam</hi> beholds them with admiration, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Who can count the duſt of Jacob, and number the fourth part of Iſrael.</hi> 'Tis of awful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that God conſumed this great body of People (all but two, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>) in His Wrath.

put you in remembrance, how the Lord having ſaved his People out of Egypt, afterward deſtroyed them.</hi> The Contents of this Book are partly <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> partly <hi>Hiſtorical</hi>: The Doctrinal part contains ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, explanations of ſundry Laws, Moral, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial, mostly Ceremonial. The Hiſtorical part containeth the most remarkable things, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael did, or ſuffered in the Deſert, by the ſpace of Thirty-nine years: Dangers, Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, Troubles, Travels, Provocations, Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In the Fourteenth Chapter we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, a Rebellion that did conſummate their Provocation, and compleat their Sin, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their utter Deſtruction. God will bear no longer: He will utterly conſume them; there is no remedy. <hi>Verſe 28. Say unto them, as I live ſaith the Lord, their Carcaſes ſhall fall in the Wilderneſs.</hi> Verſe 35. <hi>In the Wilderneſs they ſhall be conſumed, and there they ſhall die.</hi> God minds that this is now the Tenth time, v. 22. <hi>They have tempted me now theſe ten times.</hi> God remembers, though men forget. Ten is ſometimes put for many: <hi>Numerus certus pro incerto.</hi> But here it may be taken properly, for ten times. 1. At the Red-Sea, Exod. 14.11, 12.2. At Marah, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.23, 24. Again in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Sin, Exod. 16.2. Then twice about Manna, Exod. 16.20, 27, 28. After at Rephidim, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. Then by the Calf at Horeb, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. At <hi>Taborah, Numb.</hi> 11.1. Again at <hi>Kebroth Hatta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avah, Numb.</hi> 11.4. Now the tenth time in <hi>Pharan.</hi> Of this provocation, we have,</p>

<pb facs="unknown:001369_0007_0FB2934A5BED3738"/>
report brought of the Promiſed Land by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous Spies, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.32. <hi>It is a Land that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the Inhabitants thereof, the People we ſaw in it, are men of great Stature. There we ſaw the giants, and the Sons of Anak, that came of giants: we were in our own ſight as graſhoppers, ſo we were in their ſight.</hi> We are not able to go up againſt the People, for they are ſtronger than we.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Rebellion. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1.—4. (1.) An ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, v. 1. <hi>All the Congregation lifted up their voice and cryed, and the People wept that night.</hi> [<hi>Heb.</hi>] in, or through that Night. [<hi>Greek</hi>] that whole Night. This Lamentation was a Bitter fruit of their Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. They believe not GOD that promiſed the Land: They believe not Caleb, that tells them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.30. <hi>Let us go up at once, and poſſeſs it, for we are able to over-come.</hi> Caleb ſpake as was in his heart, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14.7. They believe not <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb, Numb.</hi> 14.6.—9. <hi>The Land is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good Land: a Land flowing with Milk &amp; Honey. Only rebel ye not againſt the Lord, neither fear ye the People, for they are bread for us: Their defence is departed from them, the Lord is with us: fear them not.</hi> (2.) The Rebellion and Provocation. 2, 3, 4. verſes. <hi>All the Children of Iſrael murmured againſt Moſes and againſt Aaron: and the whole congregation ſaid, would God we had dyed in Egypt, in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Wherefore hath God brought us into this Land to fall by the Sword. Let us make us a Captain: Let us return into Egypt.</hi> But alas! how ſhould they Live in the barren deſert? how ſhould they get thither? Would God work more Wonders for ſuch Rebels?
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0008_0FB2934C33534070"/>
Verſe 10. <hi>All the Congregation had Stone them with Stones.</hi> They had almoſt done the like to Moſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.4. They after Stoned the Prophets, —Killed them. Here ſee what good Men may meet with from an evil Murmuring People. Think it not Strange to ſee it. No wonder they carry themſelves ſo to good Men, that ſo do to the good GOD.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Conſequents of it, in the following Verſes: God is Highly provoked; God threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth preſent deſtruction. By Moſes's interceſſion they are ſpared as to that, v. 13.—20. Yet they ſhall not ſee the Land, they ſhall bear their iniquity till they be conſumed. They that brought the evil report died of the Plague before the Lord. <hi>As I Live ſaith the Lord,</hi> the Earth ſhall be filled with the Glory of the Lord. Another Conſequent you have in the Words of the Text; which are a great complaint God makes to Moſes, of the People, they are alſo Minatory. In the Text, v. 11. (1.) The party complaining, GOD: the God of Iſrael; God that brought them out of the Land of Egypt. (2.) The Object complained to, <hi>Moſes.</hi> Here God acts with Moſes, as a Man in trouble would do with his Friend; make known his mind and grievances to him. (3.) The Subject com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of: <hi>This People.</hi> This People in way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Averſation: not <hi>My People,</hi> as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. (4.) The Matter of the complaint. 1. They Provoke Me; they Provok'd long: <hi>How long will This People Prevoke</hi>? Deſpiſe, Provoke contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. 2. They believe not Me; [<hi>Greek] In Me:

[Chald.] My Word.</hi> This their Unbelief was the cauſe of their Rebellion, and ſo of their ruin and deſtruction. For brevity I ſhall take up but one Doctrinal Concluſion, which is all I ſhall make uſe of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> That Unbelief is a Great Evil, and a cauſe of thoſe Evils, and Provocations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Perſons Provoke the Almighty God to Wrath againſt them, to their Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>This we ſee here. Thus it was with the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, in the Wilderneſs. This Moſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain mentioneth, Deut. 1.32. <hi>You did not believe the Lord your God: And the Lord was Wrath, and Swear, ſaying, There is not one of this evil Congregation ſhall ſee the good Land.</hi> The Apoſtle, Heb. 3.18. <hi>To whom Swear be they ſhould not enter, but to them that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not.</hi> Thus it was with their Poſterity afterward, 2 King. 17.14. <hi>God teſtifyed againſt Israel and againſt Judah, by all his Prophets, ſaying, Turn ye from your Evil ways; but they would not bear, but hardened their Necks like their Fathers that did not believe in the Lord their God.</hi> Therefore the Lord removed them out of his fight, rejected all the Seed of Iſrael; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them into the hands of Spoilers. Iſrael was carryed out of their own Land, into the Land of Aſſyria to this day. Thus with the Jews, Rom. 11.20. <hi>Becauſe of Unbelief they were broken off.</hi> Thus with the old World. Unbelief brought the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal deluge, 1 Pet. 3.19. <hi>By which he Preached to the Spirits in Priſon</hi>; which were diſobedient in
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0010_0FB2935008B45138"/>
the days of <hi>Noah.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Unbelieving. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief was the door let in Sin, Death and Sorrow into the World. Satan himſelf tempted Eve to Unbelief, Gen. 3.4. <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely dye.</hi> Satan was harken'd to. God was not believed, Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> So the tranſgreſſion was committed; the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit eaten; the Glory departed; Man fallen. All Mankind, all of Man, every Man. Man is not what he was: was not what he is: He was once glorious: <hi>Crowned with Glory and Honour,</hi> Pſal. 8.5. Now filthy and abominable. Job 15.16. <hi>There is none that doeth good, no not one,</hi> Rom. 3.10. &amp;c. Man was once happy, bleſſed: Now under Wrath, curſed, miſerable. Man was God's Image: Sin is Man's Image: Miſery Sin's Image. Man is God's Creature: Sin is Man's Creature: Miſery Sin's Creature. <hi>Unbelief</hi> was the door that let in Sin, and Miſery into the World; and it is Unbelief that now Perpetuates it. Unbelief is diſhonorable to God; deſtructive to Man: Departeth from God, leads to Sin, and rebellion againſt God: Keeps Men Obſtinate in Sin, Perpetuates Sin; and ſo the bitter fruits of Sin, Sorrows and Miſeries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But more Particularly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Unbelief departs from God, Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Faith Obeyeth, Unbelief diſobeys.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Unbelief carries men to Sin, any Sin, all Sin. It is a fruitful Mother of a World of tranſgreſſions. It caſts off the fear of God: Where there is no fear of God, there is no Conſcience of Sin. No Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0011_0FB2935173F888F0"/>
of Sin, what Sin is it men will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit? The Apoſtle having ſet down a Catalogue of Sins, concludeth with this as a cauſe of all the reſt; <hi>There is no fear of God before their Eyes,</hi> Rom. 3.18. Unbelief defileth the heart, blinds the mind, feareth the Conſcience; to Mans Natural, it addeth a contracted Hardneſs, that they become paſt feeling, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It holds men obſtinate in Sin, that they will not be reclaimed. (1) It rendereth the Means uſed to bring men to repent, &amp; reform; vain, and ineffectual; Inſtructions, Directions, Perſwaſions, Diſſwaſions, Promiſes, Threats; The Word, the Rod: The Word profiteth not without Faith; the Rod profits not, <hi>In vain have I ſmitten, why ſhould you be ſmitten any more</hi>? (2) It fills men with Atheiſm; to conclude, either there is no God, or He is not ſuch a God as He is declared to be. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, There is no God,</hi> Pſal. 14.1. What follows, <hi>They are corrupt, they have done abominable Works, there is none that doeth good.</hi> Unbelief ſaith, God ſeeth not: Job 22.13, 14. <hi>Thou ſayeſt how doth God Know, can he judge through the dark cloud. Thick Clouds are a covering to him, He ſeeth not.</hi> Pſal. 94.7. <hi>They ſay, the Lord doth not see, neither doth the God of Jacob regard it.</hi> Zeph. 1.12. <hi>That ſay in their heart God will not do good, neither will he do evil.</hi> (3) It regards neither Law nor Goſpel. It deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Promiſes: derideth the Threats, Iſa. 5.19. <hi>They ſay let him make ſpeed, and haſten his work that we may ſee it. Let the Counſel of the holy one come that we may Know it.</hi> They draw iniquity with cords,
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0012_0FB29354E9EBDF60"/>
and Sin with Cartropes. (4) It abuſeth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and long-ſuffering of God, which ſhould lead to Repentance; to Harden in Sin, Eccl. 8.11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Judgment againſt an evil work is not ſpeedily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: therefore the hearts of the Sons of men are fully ſet to do evil.</hi> But let ſuch know, that the longer Judgment is delayed, the Heavier it will be when it cometh. Rom. 9.22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his Wrath, and make his Power known, indured with long-ſuffering the Veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction.</hi> It ſhall come; it hath ſometime Leaden feet, but Iron hands. Sin ſhall not go unpuniſhed. <hi>Your Sin ſhall find you out: Though hand joyn in hand, the wicked ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.24, 25. <hi>Some mens Sins are open before hand, going before to judgment: and ſome they follow after. Likewiſe the good works of ſome are manifeſt before hand, and they that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cannot be hid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. As Unbelief holds men Obſtinate in Sin, and Perpetuates Sin; So it Perpetuateth Miſeries, the juſt Puniſhment, and bitter fruit of Sin: Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral here, and eternal hereafter; everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; Men don't believe, therefore they don't obey: therefore they ſhall be puniſhed <hi>with an Everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, — from the Glory of his Power,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.9. <hi>A part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the Second Death.</hi> Rev. 21.8. <hi>But the fearful and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and abominable, and murderers, and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,</hi> &amp;c. They are Unbelieving, therefore it is they are Fearful, Abominable, Whore-mongers, Sorcerers, &amp;c. and ſo have their part in that Lake.
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0013_0FB29356B3468E70"/>
Now ſome USE and Improvement.
USE. I. See the great Evil of <hi>Unbelief.</hi> Evil in it's Self: Evil to GOD; Evil to Man; Evil in its fruits. It is a root of Bitterneſs, whence the gall and wormwood of Evils both Sinful and Painful proceed. Men are more ready to be convinced of, and charge themſelves with the guilt of other Sins than with <hi>this</hi>: yet this is a Mother Sin. The damning Sin. Mark 16.16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved: he that believeth not ſhall be damned. He that believeth not, ſhall not ſee life: the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> He that believeth ſhall be Saved, were his Sins never ſo many. He that believeth not ſhall be damned, were his Sins never ſo few.</p>
            <p>USE. II. <hi>Examination.</hi> Are we guilty of this Sin of Unbelief? If we are, Let us ſee it: be convinced of it: Conviction of Unbelief is a ſtep to Faith, and ſo to Life, and Salvation; All Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.</p>
            <p>Let me offer ſomething in way of Trial, and Conviction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Have not we provoked the Lord our God; Provoked him greatly? Read the cauſe in the effect. Sin, in the Puniſhment. Have not Gods Judgments been great? Have not therefore our Sins been grievous? Would a gracious God, and merciful Father, who doth not willingly afflict, nor grieve the Children of men, Inflict ſore, and
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0014_0FB2935C02A5E6F8"/>
heavy Judgments on His People, were not their Sins great and hainous? We have confeſſed <hi>Guilty</hi>: It hath been oft confeſſed, and acknowledged, and that before this Honourable Aſſembly. I might remind you of many conſiderable Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that have been here given. I ſhall mention but one, in the year 1698. He is a Stranger to the Affairs of <hi>New-England,</hi> and one that conſiders not the Operation of God, that knows not this. Who knows not that our Fields that uſe to ſmell as the Fields that God hath bleſſed, Have a long time been blaſted. A fruitful Land been turned into barreneſs. Inſtead of Plenty, we have had Scarcity: of Health, Sickneſs: of Peace, War. Inſtead of Divine Favour, Direction, Protection: we have had Deſertions, Fruſtrations, Rebukes in things of greateſt Importance. Our Degeneracy is too palpable to be denied, too groſs to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed: It calls rather for Lamentation, than for Proof, and Demonſtration. I may mind you of the Words of an Eminent Divine, in his Epiſtle prefixed to a Sermon Preached on a day of Election in the year 1674. they are as followeth. <q>Do not the Ancient men that have ſeen the firſt Houſe weep over this? If we be not ſenſible of theſe things, our caſe is no leſs deſperate than <hi>Ephraim's,</hi> when gray Hairs were upon him and he knew it not. That People who were newly come out of the hands of thoſe that ſometimes ſaid to their Souls, <hi>Bow down that we may go over</hi>: And whoſe preſent Intereſt was to carry on Temple Work, when they were arrived to a
<pb facs="unknown:001369_0015_0FB2935D758D55D8"/>
full enjoyment of Peace and Liberty, soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their main and true intereſt, being under the Powerful and Prevailing intereſt of a World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Degenerate Spirit: and yet they ſaid, wherein ſhall we return. How many are with us of the ſame Spirit, making the ſame enquiry? It is a difficult thing to reclaim an Apoſtatiſing, &amp; Backſliding People. Almoſt all preſent would be let alone in the condition wherein they are: and thoſe that would reform them will be look'd upon as troublers.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Have we not provoked God long? Many years hath God been contending with us: follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us with variety of Judgments, which we have been bleeding under. God hath been Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, not willing we ſhould periſh.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hath not God ſhewn us our Tranſgreſſions, and our Sins? As in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.1. Hath not God been long Warning, and Calling upon us to turn from our evil ways, and doings, which have not been good?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hath not God been uſing means with us? Word and Rod, greater and leſſer Judgments, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mercies and Deliverances. God hath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Mercies in the midſt of Judgments: He hath been Compaſſionate: As in <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.38. <hi>Being full of Compaſſion he forgave them their Iniquities, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them not. Many a time he turned away his Anger, and did not ſtir up all his Wrath: for he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred they were but fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Have not Means been ineffectual? Are not thoſe Sins, God hath been contending for,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001369_0016_0FB2935F11E1FCD8"/>
committed as much, or more than before? Have not our Iniquities encreaſed over our heads? Sin abounded, love waxed cold. Is there not a great deal of Atheiſm, Prophaneneſs, Senſuality, Pride, Oppreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> among Some; Luke-warmneſs, Formality, Hypocriſy, decays in Faith, Love, Zeal among others. Many ſhameleſs in Sin, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.15. Graceleſs in Profeſſion: Profeſs they know God, but keep not his commands. They love God, but love not their Brethren, but live in Malice, Envy, Strife, Wrath, Contention. Jam. 3.14, 15. <hi>But if there be bitter envying, and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not againſt the Truth. This Wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is Earthly, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and Deviliſh.</hi> They Profeſs themſelves Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, but bridle not their Tongues, Jam. 1.26, <hi>If any man ſeem to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, This man's Religion is vain. They make their boaſt of the Law, but by breaking the Law diſhonour God; abhor Idols, but commit Sacrilege</hi>? Rom. 2.23. Are there not Multitudes of Uncircumciſed Unconverted Souls, that hate to be Reformed? God is angry with them every dayp: God will puniſh the Circumciſed with the Uncircumciſed: <hi>Egypt and Judah, Edom and Ammon,</hi> Jer. 9.26.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Do we not ſtill provoke God? Is not his hand ſtill ſtretched out? God hath not yet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued our Enemies; nor turned his hand againſt our Adverſaries: As Pſal. 81.13. <hi>O that my People had hearkened to me, and Iſrael had walked in my ways, I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their Enemies.</hi> A great
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001369_0017_0FB293607A704420"/>
part of the Land lyeth in ruins, and deſolate; great Part fear, or are in danger day and night: there is no Peace, nor Safety to him that goeth out, nor to him that cometh in: Many may be ſaid rather to indure Life, than to enjoy Life. What would many give to enjoy the days they have ſeen? to go out in Peace, to lye down in Peace, and none to make them afraid? The way to obtain it, is to make Peace with God; to have no Peace with Sin; to put away the evil of their doings; to ceaſe to do evil, to learn to do well. It is in vain to look for Good, or Promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Peace, while they walk in the imagination of their own hearts. Deut. 29.19. <hi>And it come to paſs when he heareth the Words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have Peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart: The Lord will not ſpare him, but the anger and jealouſy of the Lord ſhall Smoke againſt that man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Doth not God yet complain, <hi>How long? How long will you Provoke?</hi> How long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within you? How long ye ſimple ones will you love ſimplicity? Men are ready to complain of God, Iſa. 58.3. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not, afflicted our Soul, and thou takeſt no Knowledge.</hi> How long will God hide his face? How long ere God hear, help, ariſe? But how long will it be ere they hear; turn to Him that ſmites? Put away their Idols, the evil of their doings: Iſa. 59.1. Gods <hi>Hand is not ſhortened that he cannot ſave, nor his ear heavy that he cannot
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001369_0018_0FB2936204A6C3F0"/>
hear: But your iniquities have ſeparated between you, and your God, your ſins have hid His face from you, that he will not hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Is not <hi>Unbelief</hi> the cauſe of all this? Muſt we not confeſs guilty?</p>
            <p>USE. III. We have ſeen our Malady, <hi>viz. Unbelief,</hi> That hath brought all our Miſeries, and Calamities upon us; and if continued in, will yet bring more, ſeven times more: If we will yet provoke, God will ſtill puniſh. Let us ſeek a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: get Unbelief cured, Unbeliving hearts Circumciſed: Get Faith. 2 Chron. 20.20. <hi>Believe in the Lord ſo ſhall you be eſtabliſhed, believe his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſo ſhall you proſper.</hi> God hath warned us by his Prophets. Hath not God teſtifyed by all His Prophets? <hi>Saying, Turn ye from your evil ways.</hi> Have not the former Prophets given early warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sins then preſent, and prevailing; of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments impending and approaching? Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: <hi>Nineveh</hi> believed, and they were ſpared, Jonah 3.10. <hi>God ſaw their works that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil he ſaid he would do unto them, and did it not.</hi> Iſrael believed not, and they are rejected: 2 King. 17.14.—20. <hi>They heardened their Necks like their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that did not believe in the Lord their God.</hi> The Lord rejected them, afflicted them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them into the hand of Spoilers. If we will not believe, the means that are for our ſoftening, will harden us, and we ſhall Sin more,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001369_0019_0FB2936374911F70"/>
and provoke more, and at laſt be deſtroyed without remedy. God may bear long, wait long, but not always: Iſa. 42.14. <hi>I have a long time refrained my ſelf, now will I deſtroy and devour at once.</hi> Jer. 15.7. — <hi>I will deſtroy my People, ſith they turn not from their ways.</hi> Ezek. 24.14. <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, and it ſhall come to paſs, and I will do it, I will not go back, I will not ſpare, I will not repent.</hi> God hath ſo done: He hath oft done it: He will ſo do: He is the ſame God: He is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably Juſt and Holy. God hath ſo done to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where the Houſe of God was continued almoſt four hundred years. To <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> once called, <hi>The perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole Earth.</hi> To the Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> once glorious, planted by the Apoſtles: Theſe Candleſticks have been removed for a long time out of their places, not one remaining. To many Thouſand Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>Africa.</hi> Many Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince the Reformation. In <hi>Saxony, Bohemia, Hungaria, Poland, France,</hi> and other Places, Unchurched and Diſſipated. To the Churches among the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> in the Land of our Fathers Sepulchres. When other Judgments would not Reform them, God at laſt brought the <hi>Saxons</hi> upon them, who rooted them out of the Land. There is a day of Gods Patience, a ſet time, with ſome longer, ſome ſhorter; when that time is once expired, there is no place for Repentance, either on God's part, or on Man's part. God will not repent: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.24. Man ſhall not be purged: Ezek. 24, 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſs any

anymore, till I cauſe my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi> It ſometimes comes and goes again; but at length it reſts and abideth, till it utterly conſumeth: The things of their Peace are then hid from their eyes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42, 43. Chriſt wept over the City, <hi>Saying, If thou hadſt known, even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong to thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes. They ſhall not leave one Stone upon another, becauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy Viſitation.</hi> A general Security under, or after Divine Judgments, and Warnings, is a fore-runner of a general and ſpeedy Deſtruction, When the Prophets Propheſie Peace, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Promiſe Peace: When there is a Spirit of deep Sleep poured on them, and their eyes are cloſed: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10. Jer. 14.13. <hi>Then ſaid I, Ah Lord God, behold the Prophets ſay unto them, Ye ſhall not ſee the Sword, — but I will give you aſſured Peace in the Land. Thus ſaith the Lord, by the Sword, and Famine ſhall thoſe Prophets be conſumed. And the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom they Propheſie, ſhall be caſt out in the Streets, and there ſhall be none to bury them:</hi> — Ezek. 13, 10. <hi>They have ſeduced my People, ſaying Peace, when there was no Peace. One built up a Wall, and others daubed it with untempered Mortar.</hi> Jer. 5. ult. <hi>The Prophets Propheſie falſly, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my People love to have it ſo: and what will you do in the end thereof?</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.3. <hi>When they ſhall ſay Peace, and Safety: then ſudden Deſtruction cometh upon them, as travail on a Woman with Child, and thay ſhall not eſcape.</hi>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:001369_0021_0FB2936675702D00"/>USE. IV. We have cauſe to Lament our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy and Obſtinacy therein; to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under the Divine Rebukes of Heaven, which we have been long under. Yet let us not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the many Mercies of God, which call for our Thankfulneſs, and due Acknowledgements. We are Subjects of many, and great Sins, and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Yet are Subjects of many and great Mercies, undeſerved Mercies. Our Mercies are more, and greater than we deſerve. Our evil things, and afflictions are fewer, and leſs. Let our Unworthineſs turn to Gods Praiſe, make us more admire, and magnify Mercy. Let good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lead to Repentance; Long-ſuffering be Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Among many, Let me inſtance a few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have ſeen many a black and dark day. Drank of the Waters of gall and wormwood, and the wine of aſtoniſhment; have ſeen great ruins, and deſolations, yet God hath preſerved us from utter Deſolation: 'Tis the Lords Mercy we are not utterly conſumed; though God hath viſited our iniquities with the Rod, yet he hath not taken his Loving-kindneſs from us: He hath corrected with Judgment, therefore we are not brought to nothing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we have had ſo long a time of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no more diſturbance from the Enemy: Breaking in, and Leading out, crys of Blood and Violence: which next to God, is, and hath been aſcribed to the good conduct of Him that Sitteth

            <p n="3">3. The great bleſſing of GOD to us, and our Nation, in giving ſo Gracious a QUEEN, whoſe Heart GOD hath enclined to Favour His People, to Suppreſs, and Puniſh Vice, and Immorality, to encourage and promote what is good: A good King, or Queen is a great bleſſing, and gift of God's Love: I King. 10.9. — <hi>Becauſe the Lord Loved Iſrael, he made thee King to do Juſtice, and Judgment.</hi> Kings have a great Influence upon the People.

A good GOVERNOUR, well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed for that Service, eſpecially in our diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult juncture of Affairs. Good Magiſtrates; Men Faithful and Religious. We may in good meaſure ſee our Judges as at firſt, our Counſellors as at the beginning. Let us Know when we are well! Let not frowardneſs &amp; diſcontent make a Change for the worſe?

The glorious Goſpel: the Goſpel of Salvation: the Word of Life: Glad Tidings, the beſt that ever came to the Ears of the Sons of Men. Eccleſiaſtical Liberties: The doors of God's houſe are open; we have his Word, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Ordinances, in Purity, without any humane Impoſitions. Take heed, Unthankfulneſs, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs don't deprive us of the beſt things; here is our great danger: by ſlighting and not regarding theſe things, we ſhall either juſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit them, or render our ſelves unworthy the Kingdom, or be hardened to deſtruction. We are Priviledged as to Spiritual things, above ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I think as much as any in the World. We dwell in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> a Land of Light; when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Mankind ſit in darkneſs and the ſhadow of Death. According to Computation, Chriſtianity taken in the largeſt Latitude, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no greater proportion to the other groſsly falſe Religions, than Five to Twenty-five.</p>

            <p>ELECTION being the Work of the Day: Give me leave to Speak a Word to the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the Electors. The Government is in great part E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective by the People; which if wiſely managed, the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> will be of the Beſt: our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours will be of the Beſt; the moſt Wiſe, moſt Able, moſt faithful in the Province. If it be not ſo, who will be to blame? <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Prudence and Fidelity are conſided in: You repreſent the People: You are choſen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Choſen for the People; Seek their intereſt and welfare: The great intereſt of this People hath been, and in good meaſure, is <hi>Religious.</hi> 'Tis like to fare with us on other accounts, as it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Religion: <hi>The Lord is with you while you are with him.</hi> If we let Religion, which is our Life, die, we may not Live long after. You are truſted with the choice of a Council: Have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Piety, and the Fear of God in Election. Such, you may expect Gods Preſence with them; and Bleſſing upon them; that their Steps ſhall be ordered of the Lord, and God will delight in their way. Chuſe ſuch as are in the beſt intereſt: Chuſe for God; Such as will take Care of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as well as Honeſty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. Such as

Name is, Wonderful, Counſellour; who is God only Wiſe, the God of Wiſdom, and the giver of Wiſdom. I need not mind you to have regard to the Intereſt of CHRIST, the Beſt Intereſt. God hath given this Part of theſe Ends of the Earth to His Son for a Poſſeſſion: You know it is your Duty to maintain His Poſſeſſion what you can. God hath ſet you as a Hedge, a Wall, part of the defence upon the Glory. I need not mind you of <hi>Schools of Learning,</hi> to encourage and uphold them: But thankfully acknowledge your Care, and Proviſion made for this end. If Learning ſhould utterly fall here, this Land would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to it's Primitive Darkneſs, notwithſtanding the light that is in every man that cometh into the World. It is matter of thankfulneſs, that the COLLEGE is ſo well Setled with a <hi>Reſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Preſident,</hi> a thing long deſired; a Perſon ſo well accompliſhed, and furniſhed for that Service, having been extraordinarily Advantaged thereto. He Succeeds Men eminent in Piety, and of great Learning. God grant the Bleſſing to Him, and to the Province; that as he <hi>Succeeds,</hi> ſo he may not fall ſhort, but rather <hi>Exceed</hi>; Give a double Portion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not add any thing further, but conclude with a Word of <hi>Exhortation.</hi>

               <hi>Let us conſider what hath been ſaid, and the Lord give us underſtanding in all things.</hi> I have ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

as to the Subſtance, <hi>Quod non ante dictum,</hi> that hath not been before ſaid. It hath been, and is the general Voice of the Miniſtry, and therefore calleth for a Serious regard. Let us once at laſt <hi>Believe,</hi> and let us ſhew our Faith by our Works. Let <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the whole Congregation of the Lord, every one according to his Character, endeavour to revive <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and to Suppreſs all <hi>Vice,</hi> and purſue it to the out-most. Though means uſed have hitherto been without the deſired Succeſs: Yet give not over, be not diſcouraged; do not ſay, there is no Hope! Our caſe is bad; yet not deſperate: there is <hi>Balm in Gilead,</hi> there is a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician there.</hi> God can Heal us. <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make us clean</hi>! Soveraign Mercy may Save us: Iſai. 57.17. <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him.</hi> Implore Mercy, Convincing, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Healing, Pardoning Mercy, for Mercies Sake, God's Name Sake, for Chriſts Sake, who is Worthy, though we are unworthy. <hi>Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord, be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, for your own ways.</hi> Ezek. 36.22, 32. Pray with <hi>Ephraim, Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God.</hi> If God hear us with <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaning our Selves, He may ſay to us as he did to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 3I.20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is be my pleaſant Child: Since I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: My bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have Mercy on him, ſaith the Lord.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Conſider the Neceſſity of <hi>Reforming.</hi> If we are not Reforming, we ſhall be Deforming, Sinning; we ſhall yet be more Sinful, and more Miſerable. If the torrent, or flood of Vice be not Stopped, an over-flowing Scourge will follow, and over-take. Let Her <hi>Majeſties</hi> Royal PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLAMATION for Puniſhing Vice and Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, be attended, which She ſo ſtrictly enjoyns, as they Tender God's Honour, Her Favour, their own Welfare. It might be great Advantage, were Her Majeſties Royal Proclamation follow'd in <hi>New-England,</hi> as it was in <hi>Old-England,</hi> with <hi>Reforming Societies.</hi> Let the good Laws Enacted be duly Executed. A Violation of Laws is not ſo hurtful, as a Non-execution. If we will not be Warned, when Warnings are given; Reformed, when Reproved; be prevailed with, when beſeeched; Regard, when threatned; be amended, when corrected; be purged, when God would purge us; What will our End be? Our fleſh may tremble! <hi>O that my People were Wiſe, that they would conſider their latter end. O that there were ſuch a heart in my People, that they would fear me, that it might be well with them, and their Children after them.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The Benefit, and Good of it. How happy might we then be? It would be well with us not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all our Provocations; they ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001369_0029_0FB293795B18F360"/>
be all blotted out, and remembred no more. <hi>The iniquities of Jacob ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the Sins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found: for I will Pardon them.</hi> Could we grieve and mourn for our Sins, our Enemies ſhould not long Rejoyce: God would be grieved for our Miſeries, bind our Breaches, repair our Loſſes, build up the waſte Places; make glad according to the days we have ſeen Evil; Remove the evils we feel, Prevent the evils we fear, Beſtow the good things we want. God would be an Enemy to our Enemies; they that devour us, ſhould be devoured; they that Spoil us, ſhould be a Spoil; and they that Prey upon us, ſhould be given for a Prey: the Enemies that come againſt us ſhould be Smitten before us: they that come out againſt us One Way ſhould flee before us Seven Ways; God would give Peace in the Land; we ſhall dwell in Safety, and none ſhall make us afraid: God would keep us Night and Day: He would Water us every Moment: So our Laſt days might be our Beſt; and our Latter End better than our Beginning. Let thoſe that Love Sion Seek it, ſay, <hi>AMEN.</hi>
