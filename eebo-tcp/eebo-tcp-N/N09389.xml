            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>HONOURED SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT has been often obſerved, that Men are apt to run from one Extreme to another, and perhaps they do ſo as much in their treatment of Rulers, as in any of their Affairs; for as long as they have hopes of Favours from them, their Addreſſes will be filled with Compliment and Flattery; but when diſappointed, it is turned to Slander and Abuſe: Examples of which, at this Day, in our Nation and Land, are too conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and their Miſchief too ſenſibly felt, to need a Proof: Therefore I ſhall beg Leave to depart from this modern Road, and attempt to follow the ancient Example before me, of avoiding flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Titles on one Hand, and falſe Accuſation on the other, and ſpeak out plainly ſome of my Views of the Truth, concerning an Affair which has lately made conſiderable Noiſe in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. In doing of which I ſhall firſt make a few Remarks upon the chief Pleas I have heard, for civil Rulers exerciſing their Power to ſupport religious Worſhip; and then upon their late Treatment of the Baptiſts in particular.</p>
            <p>The leading Plea that I have heard made, for rulers exerciſing Authority in the Affair is, that ancient Rulers did ſo; and the Church has a Promiſe, that Kings ſhall be her nurſing Fathers, and Queens her nurſing Mothers. It is readily granted that Rulers as well as others ought to be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011972_0003_0F87CE8AF86345B0"/>good Men, and to uſe all their Influence in a Goſpel Way, to promote Religion; but I am not convinced that they have any Warrant to uſe the civil Sword to <hi>force</hi> any to ſupport religious Worſhip. I find that when the coſtly Furniture for Worſhip was to be prepared in the Wilderneſs, though the great Lawgiver, if he had ſeen fit, could have as exactly proportioned each Man's part, as to have given the Pattern of what was to be made; yet inſtead of that, after letting the People know what was wanted, he ſays, <q>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is of a <hi>willing</hi> Heart, let <hi>him bring</hi> an Offering to the Lord, Gold, Silver, &amp;c.</q> Exod. xxxv. 5. And when the Temple was to be built in Canaan, with vaſt Coſt indeed, David like a nurſing Father led the Way, and of his <hi>own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Goods,</hi> offered very largely thereto; and then exhorted his People to do the like, which had ſuch Effect, that with grateful Wonder he could ſay, <q>As for me, in the Uprightneſs of mine Heart I have <hi>willingly</hi> offered all theſe things; and now have I ſeen with Joy thy People which are preſent here, to offer <hi>willingly</hi> unto thee.</q> 1 Chron. xxix. 3, 17. And though particular Offerings of Money and other Things, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined upon every Man by the Law, for the Support of Worſhip, yet I cannot find any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, much more Commandment, for the uſe of any Force to collect it. As plain an Inſtance, and the plaineſt, of their Method of proceeding, that I have obſerved, is in 2 Chron. xxiv. 9, 10. When after a terrible Seaſon of Declenſion and Corruption, the King was ſtirred up for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the Levites being negligent in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011972_0004_0F87CE8D240CC280"/>Affair, he cauſed a <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made through his Kingdom, to <hi>bring in</hi> to the Lord the <hi>Collection</hi> which Moſes the Servant of God laid upon Iſrael; and <hi>all the Princes, and all the People rejoiced and brought in.</hi> They <hi>brought</hi> it themſelves; and I cannot find but one Intimation, in all their Hiſtory, of the uſe of <hi>Force</hi> in ſuch Affairs, and that will hardly be pleaded as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for us now to follow. 1 Sam. vi. 16.</p>
            <p>And if Force was not uſed under a Law given from infallible Authority, what ſhall we think of it among thoſe who profeſs to renounce Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity! The Goſpel expreſly allows of the civil Magiſtrate's uſe of the <hi>Sword to execute Wrath,</hi> in the Kingdoms of this World; but though the crafty Jews, when they found that their Charge againſt Jeſus of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> would not avail with a Roman Governour, they then tried to repreſent him as an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> yet when Pilate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the Caſe, Jeſus anſwered, <q>My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not <hi>of this World;</hi> if my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants <hi>fight:</hi>—But now is my Kingdom <hi>not from hence.</hi>
               </q> And goes on to ſhew that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does not receive it's Support <hi>from</hi> earthly Power, but <hi>from</hi> TRUTH. Joh. xviii. 36, 37. If ſo, then what is that Religion which it's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors often ſay, <q>would ſoon fall if it was not ſupported by civil Power?</q> How much more agreeable to our Lord's Words, are Mr. Locke's Sentiments, than theſe Men's? He ſays, <q>The Buſineſs of Laws is not to provide for the Truth of Opinions, but for the Safety and Security of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011972_0005_0F87CE8D2E768030"/>the Common-wealth, and of every particular man's Goods and Perſon; and ſo it ought to be; for TRUTH certainly would do well enough if ſhe were once left to ſhift for herſelf. She ſeldom has received, and I fear never will receive, much Aſſiſtance from the Power of great Men; to whom ſhe is but rarely known, and more rarely welcome. She is not taught by Laws, nor has ſhe any need of <hi>Force</hi> to procure her Entrance into the Minds of Men. Errors indeed prevail by the Aſſiſtance of foreign and borrowed Succours.—The Care of Souls cannot belong to the civil Magiſtrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Power conſiſts only in outward <hi>Force;</hi> but true and ſaving Religion conſiſts in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perſuaſion of the Mind, without which nothing can be acceptable to God.<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter on Toleration.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But upon this I hear ſome ſay, <q>This relates to Liberty of Conſcience, but we hope you don't call <hi>Money</hi> Conſcience!</q> No; we truſt we know the Difference between them, and wiſh our Neighbours did too, who ſo often deprive others of their <hi>juſt Rights;</hi> for as a late Writer well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>To allow Mankind as Individuals, the free Choice of their Religion, and yet to take by <hi>Force</hi> their Eſtates from them to ſupport a Religion or Worſhip which they do not chooſe, is a piece of <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> that would make even a moral Heathen bluſh; yet many Inſtances of the ſame have we had, and ſtill have.</q> And what Work do theſe Men make of our Lord's repreſenting to Pilate, that he need not fear his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011972_0006_0F87CE8DD95B2E30"/>Kingdom's interfering with Caeſar's, becauſe his Servants were not to promote it by the <hi>Sword,</hi> but with <hi>Truth?</hi> For now they tell us, that then the Rulers were Heathens, but when they became chriſtian, they ought to exerciſe Power to ſupport Religion: Which is no better than to make our Lord ſay to Pilate, <q>You need not ſear my giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trouble to the valiant <hi>Romans,</hi> for I have not Power to do it, and am not likely to get the Sword into my Hand until long after Caeſar is dead!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly when Peter's pretended Succeſſor had got the Sword into his Hand, he did much more with it than to cut off Men's <hi>Ears,</hi> for he cut their Souls and Bodies aſunder in a helliſh Manner; and though ſuch an uſe of it is much out of Credit among us, yet to uſe it in the very Language of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, is much pleaded for, viz. If you will not <hi>give it me,</hi> I will <hi>take it by Force!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Plea for ſuch Conduct is, they ſay, <q>Theſe Lands were given upon Condition of ſupporting our Worſhip, and if you do not like the Condition you may go off and leave them.</q>— By whom were they given? If by our Fathers, they did not intend to take our Money for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, (as their Children now do) for they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>make</hi> us religious, as well as to ſupport Religion: Accordingly about the Year 1646, they made a Law to puniſh any that ſhould turn their backs, or go out of the place of Worſhip when an Infant was to be ſprinkled. And in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011972_0007_0F87CE93F7E48090"/>1651, as Mr. <hi>John Clark,</hi> Paſtor of a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Church in <hi>Newport,</hi> with his Friends, were at Worſhip in their own Way, on Lord's-day July 20th. at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Witter</hi>'s in <hi>Lynn,</hi> they were ſeized, and forcibly carried to the Pariſh Worſhip, and afterward ſent Priſoners to <hi>Boſton;</hi> where one was fined £. 20. and another £. 30. Not only for ſetting up another Worſhip; but part of their Crime was, their not joining in the Pariſh Worſhip when they had carried them there; and he that was fined £. 30 for refuſing to pay it, was whipt 30 Laſhes: And two of his Friends, for openly taking him by the Hand, and praiſing God for his Courage and Conſtancy, were fined 40ſ. each, or to be whipt. <q>Thus, ſays Mr. <hi>Neal,</hi> the Government of <hi>New-England,</hi> for the ſake of Uniformity in divine Worſhip, broke in upon the natural Rights of Mankind, puniſhing Men, not for diſturbing of the <hi>State,</hi> but for their differing Sentiments in Religion.</q> And though Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> pleads, that, <q>This Separation of the <hi>Annabaptiſts</hi> (as he calls them) was a manifeſt Violation of the Laws of the Common-wealth, concerning the orderly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Churches;</q> yet, Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> replies, this Plea, <q>Condemns all the diſſenting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations that have been gathered in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſince the Act of Uniformity in the Year 1662.</q> And, ſays he, <q>Let the Reader judge, who had moſt Reaſon to complain; the <hi>New-England</hi> Churches, who would neither ſuffer the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> to live quietly in their Communion, nor ſeparate peaecably from it? Or theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Perſons, who were treated ſo unkindly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011972_0008_0F87CE95C9124018"/>for following the light of their Conſciences?<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſtory of New-England, Vol. I. Page 299.—305.</note>
               </q> When the account of theſe Proceedings got to England, Sir Richard Saltonſtall, wrote to his Friends in Boſton, that he was grieved to hear of ſuch Courſes in this Wilderneſs, as they went to prevent; and which tended to make Hypocrites: To which Mr. Corton, (one of the moſt eminent Fathers of the Country) anſwers, <q>We believe there is a vaſt difference between Mens Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and God's Inſtitutions: We fled from Mens Inventions, to which we elſe ſhould have been compelled;<note n="†" place="bottom">Here we ſee an Inſtance of the Force of Prejudice: For I believe it will be generally allowed that the Baptiſts call many Things in the Church of New-England, "Men's Inventions," with full as much Propriety as Mr. Cotton calls the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Church of Old England, Men's Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore his Argument is good for nothing.</note> we compel none to Mens Inventions.—If it did make Men Hypocrites, yet better to be Hypocrites than profane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward Man, but the profane Perſon giveth God neither outward nor in ward Man.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Maſſachuſetts Hiſtory, Vol. III. pag. 405, 406.</note>
               </q>— Thus they were in earneſt to do us ſome good, and not get away our Money for nothing; and though theſe Proceedings of their's are generally now condemned, and by ſome exclaimed againſt at a great rate; yet I fear the Body of the preſent Generation imitate them more, in theſe two, great eſt of all their Errors, viz. aſſuming a Power over their Neighbours that did not belong to them, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011972_0009_0F87CE974C8AE060"/>thinking that Hypocriſy does ſome good, than they do in any of their Virtues! And if our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers erred in ſuch Compulſions then, what are thoſe doing who bring theſe Errors to juſtify their own Compulſions now! If it be ſaid, that our Lands were given us by Charter, then it is well known that the Charter gives general Liberty of Conſcience, and gives others no more Power to compel <hi>us</hi> to ſupport <hi>their</hi> Worſhip, than it does <hi>us</hi> to compel <hi>others</hi> to ſupport <hi>ours.</hi>

            <p>When we come to this, ſome would bear us in hand, that we have actually as much Liberty as the other Denomination; therefore to ſuch I will ſuppoſe a Caſe, that I heartily wiſh they may never experience: Suppoſe <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in New-England, and yet ſhould allow them a Toleration, but only upon theſe Terms, that they muſt certify, not only concerning their Church-members, but alſo of every Perſon in their Congregations, that they believe them to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly</hi> of their Perſuaſion, or elſe have them all taxed to ſupport Epiſcopacy; yea, and to do this by ſuch a certain Day <hi>every</hi> Year, and (their Miniſter being one that <hi>muſt</hi> ſign the Certificate) if any Difficulty ſhould happen between the Church and him, ſo as to prevent its being done by the appointed <hi>Day,</hi> then to have their Church and all taxed to ſupport other Worſhip (as we have had ſuch an Inſtance of a Church conſiſting of above 50 Members): Add to which, if the tolerating Laws ſhould be attended with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption Mr. Locke deſcribes, viz. <q>Princes ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or writing to their Servants, in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

               </q> If theſe Laws ſhould be ſo hard to be underſtood, as to coſt them Hundreds, or Thouſands of Pounds from Year to Year, at executive Courts, to plead for their Rights; and in their Tryals, to have all their own Denomination taken off from the Jury, and ſometimes not ſo much as allowed to be Witneſſes, but have their Caſes tried by Judges and Jurors, whoſe <hi>Intereſt ſwayed</hi> the other Way: If after all this, the Epiſcopalians ſhould tell theſe People, that they had as great Liberty as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, could they help thinking, that either thoſe Men were <hi>blinded</hi> by <hi>Self-intereſt,</hi> or elſe did not believe what they ſaid themſelves! And if after long Struggles in this Way, a perpetual Law ſhould be made, which cut off a Number of their Brethren from any ſhadow of this Liberty at all; by Virtue of which, their Lands, which they had cleared with the peril of their Lives, becauſe of Indian Savages, ſhould be torn from them to ſupport others Worſhip, and that at ſuch a rate that 20 Acres, with a Building on it, and a good Orchard, which is particularly valuable in a new Place, ſhould all be ſold for 35<abbr>ſ.</abbr> and after five Journies in a Year, of above an hundred Miles, to the General Court, and long waiting there for Relief, ſhould at laſt be told by a Number of its Members, <q>That they had good Right to make that Law, and to keep theſe People under it as long as they pleaſed;</q> which Law the King himſelf could not diſannul, if it was let alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

If upon this a worthy Miniſter, lately come among them, ſhould, with Advice of his Brethren, publiſh a brief Sketch of their capital Grievances; yet, inſtead of any fair An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſhould be treated with ſuch Stuff as this:— <q>There is a little upſtart Gentleman, lately ſettled in Town,—the <hi>Youth</hi> diſcovers a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable <hi>Arrogance:</hi>—I very much <hi>ſuſpect</hi> he is one employed by the <hi>Enemies</hi> of America, to <hi>defame</hi> and blacken the Colonies;—to ſpread the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Diſcord</hi> among the Provinces,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. And yet that the Writer of all this ſhould have the Impudence to ſubſcribe himſelf a <hi>Catholick</hi> Member of this ſame Denomination of People!</p>
            <p>Suppoſe all this, and more of like Nature, ſhould happen, could all the Men upon Earth, ever perſwade them to believe, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed equal Liberty with their Oppreſſors! Yet, without the leaſt Exaggeration, this is the true State of our Caſe; therefore I leave it, Sir, to your Judgment, whether this laſt piece of <hi>Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montade,</hi> which appears in the <hi>Evening-Poſt</hi> of January 7th. does not look much more like the Jeſuitical Tricks of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> than like a <hi>Catholic Baptiſt.</hi>

And though we have ſufficient Evidence, that a principal Inſtrument of our capital Grievance, is one who has been openly honored by the late Governor, for his appearing in Oppoſition to thoſe called Sons of LIBERTY; yet we have as full Evidence, that we have ſuffered from the other Party, into which our Country is ſo unhappily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: So that we cannot juſtly lay the blame of all our Troubles to either Side. And what I have ſeen has often reminded me of Mr. <hi>Wright</hi>'s Remark, ſixty Years ago:</p>
            <q>
               <l>'Tho' Whigs and Tories be each others Foes,</l>
               <l>'And act in divers Circles, yet they cloſe</l>
               <l>'In this great Centre, and at laſt do fall</l>
               <l>'Upon the point of wiſhing SELF HAD ALL.'</l>
            </q>
            <p>Therefore I have made this Attempt to turn each Side to read an ancient Law, which, though often forgotten by us, yet will be that by which we muſt all be acquitted or condemned, after all earthly Law-books are burnt up; and Dr. Watts's Comment upon it may doubtleſs be helpful in the Affair:</p>
            <q>
               <l>'Is Reaſon ever at a Loſs?</l>
               <l>'Call in Self-love to judge the Cauſe:</l>
               <l>'Let thy own fondeſt Paſſion ſhew</l>
               <l>'How we ſhould treat our Neighbour too.'</l>
            </q>
            <p>If this Law of Equity may but now have its proper Influence, both with Regard to what we have already ſuffered, and with Regard to our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Liberty; then if any of our People ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011972_0013_0F87CE99EB2FF438"/>interrupt the civil Peace of their Neighbours, or of the Province, let them be complained of and welcome, and puniſhed too according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of their Crimes: But until that is done, all the Smoke of News-Papers can never make us inſenſible of what we feel.</p>
            <p>If an Anſwer to the Cambridge piece, wrote by one of our Brethren, who has experienced much of theſe Things, had arrived in Town ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, it would have prevented the Occaſion that has been taken to abuſe a Stranger; which, as it confirms what I have wrote, and will ſerve farther to open the Truth: It is inſerted here, and is as follows:</p>

                  <p>To which I anſwer: At South-Hadley a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt Church was gathered ſome years ago, who took Advice of one of the beſt Lawyers in the County, and carried in their Certificate, yet they were rated to the Paedobaptiſt Miniſter, and their Goods ſtrained away: The Caſe was carried to Court, and they were caſt, and had the Charges of two Courts to pay, and then they gave the Town about twenty Dollars to let them be free for the future; and ſo with a <hi>great Sum</hi> obtained they their Freedom, who were truly <hi>free born.</hi>

In the Diſtrict of Montague is another Baptiſt Church, who carried in their Certificate by direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Lawyer, yet the Aſſeſſors put them into the Miniſter's rate: The Conſtable made Diſtreſs upon one of the Committee who ſigned the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate. —When they came to Court, they were caſt, becauſe (ſaid the Judge) he witneſſed for himſelf, when yet there were two more to witneſs with him. They appealed to the Superior Court, and have attended two, and the Caſe is hung up to the third, and all this time they are left in the Hands of their Adverſaries, who treat them in a moſt barbarous Manner, driving away their Cattle and ſelling them at an Out-cry, for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's rate. At Shuteſbury, one Daniel Fiſk, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Certificate, was ſeized by two Conſtables at once, held under Keepers ſome Time; and though the Aſſeſſors met and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed him, yet no Recompence was made for his loſs of Time and Charge. At Colerain, Hezekiah Smith, and John Call, Members of the Church in Aſh field, were both ſeized in the dead of Winter to be carried to Goal; but after they had put them to a great deal of Trouble and loſs of Time, they let them go.—At Cheſterfield, one William White, alſo a Member of the Baptiſt Church in Aſhfield, yet is put into the Miniſter's rate; and when he petitioned in a Town-Meeting to be releaſed, they refuſed, and the Miniſter told the Conſtable if he would not pay to ſtrain upon him. All theſe Accounts I had from the Perſons own Mouths.</p>
                  <p>This Writer makes mention of Aſh field, and ſays, <q>What their Circumſtances are I know not,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011972_0015_0F87CE9B6DA30F48"/>few are acquainted with them; it would be of public Service to have an authentick Account given.</q> Which I will endeavour to do, being fully acquainted with the Affair from the very firſt.—In 1761, a Baptiſt Church was here ſettled, and I was ordained their Paſtor, when there was but nineteen Families in the Town, and twelve of them were Baptiſts: Afterward other People came into the Town, and in 1763, ſettled another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and forced me and my People to pay our equal part of his Settlement, ſaying, 'The General Court had ordered us to ſettle a Miniſter in the Town, and that a Baptiſt Miniſter did not anſwer the Law.' When they had got him ſettled, then we muſt build their Metting-Houſe, and pay his Salary until that was done. So we were forced to ſell off part of our Lands under Price, to get Money to pay the Tax on the reſt; and ſome they ſold at Vendue for a mere trifle. Being no longer able to bear this cruel Oppreſſion, in 1768, we laid the Matter before the General Court, and cried to them as to the Fathers of our Country for help; and they ordered us to notify the Town and Proprietors Clerks of our Petition, and that they ſhould ſuſpend the Collection of Taxes from us until the Court ſit again: Yet a few Days after our Petitioner came away, they paſſed an Act im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering the Paedobaptiſts to raiſe Money for their Miniſter and Meeting-Houſe, and aſſeſs all the Lands, be they in whoſe Hands they would; and if any did not pay to ſell the Land for the Money. By Virtue of that Act they ſold laſt April about 400 Acres of our Lands at an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry. I paid all their Demands but about 22ſ. yet
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011972_0016_0F87CE9C26AD1F80"/>they ſold ten Acres of the beſt of my Home-lot, which I got prized at about £. 30 Lawful Money. One of my Brethren paid all but<note n="*" place="bottom">If any enquire why theſe People did not pay all their Rates, ſeeing they paid a part? the anſwer is, becauſe the Aſſeſſors there, and in other places (contrary) to Law and Equity) put their Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Rates into one; and they never refuſed to pay their Civil Tax.</note> 15ſ. yet they ſold 20 Acres of his Home-lot, in which was a good Orchard, a Dwelling-Houſe, and our Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Place, which is prized at above £. 100; and the reſt much after the ſame Manner, and not one Penny returned to us. Since which, ſome of them have broke into our Fields, breaking down our Fences, meaſuring off our Lands, tore up ſixteen Apple-trees, and abuſed ſome who ſtood in their Way. We have been at the coſt of ſix Journies to Boſton, to try to get that Act altered by the General Court, but cannot obtain it.</p>
                  <p>This Writer ſays, <q>There never was a Time ſince this Country was ſettled, when Magiſtrates, Miniſters and People were more univerſally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to religious Oppreſſion, than at this day.</q> To which I ſay, The aforeſaid Accounts ſhew the minds of Aſſeſſors, Conſtables, and executive Courts in this County; and a Number of the Houſe of Repreſentatives told me in College-Hall in Cambridge, laſt Summer, <q>That they had a Right to make that Act by which my Land is ſold, and to keep me and my Brethren under it as long as they ſaw fit.</q> As to Miniſters, I aſked the Miniſter of this Town to let me be free from his Rate, he refuſed, ſaying, <q>He would have his Money;</q> and ſince has ſaid in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic

The Man that bought my Land told me, 'He was glad he bought it, and wanted another Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due that he might buy the reſt' And is it not ſtrange that there is ſo much <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Body averſe to it!—This Writer ſays, <q>All poſſible care has been taken to prevent our ſuffering.</q> If ſo, I think it is high Time to ſeek help of the higher Powers; for if the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here cannot ſtop our ſuffering, I hope our gracious Sovereign can: What then have I now done in ſending to him? Is there not a Cauſe? I hope that Writer, when he has read theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, will be able to gueſs whence the News-Paper Complaints aroſe. The People of this Province call themſelves <hi>Sons of</hi> LIBERTY, but they treat me like <hi>Sons of</hi> VIOLENCE.</p>

But how often are our greateſt Expectations diſappointed, our rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Hopes daſhed, and our flattering Dreams vaniſhed? Our Grievances, inſtead of being in the leaſt redreſſed, are rather augmented, and the cauſes of Complaint increaſed.

            <p>A Friend to his Country deſires Liberty here to add, That ſince America in general do not aſk it as a Favour, but claim it as their eſſential Right, to <hi>give</hi> their Money, and not have it <hi>forced</hi> from
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011972_0019_0F87CE9E785BF2B0"/>them without their <hi>Conſent,</hi> either by themſelves or their Repreſentatives; and hundreds of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Remonſtrances have been ſent to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land againſt being deprived of this Right: And they look upon themſelves intolerably abuſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Complaints are not heard and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

I ſay, worſe; for what they complain of, is having their Money <hi>forced</hi> away to ſupport civil Government, where the Magiſtrate is armed with the <hi>Sword</hi> as the <hi>Miniſter of God, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.—For this cauſe pay you Tribute.</hi> Their Complaints therefore, are only againſt the undue uſe of Force in civil Matters where Force properly belongs; yet they uſe it towards their Neighbours, in eccleſiaſtical Affairs, where Force has no Right at all. For as Mr. Locke, in his Letter upon Toleration, obſerves, <q>To give Laws, to receive Obedience, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel with the Sword, belong to none but the civil Magiſtrate; and upon this ground I affirm, that the Magiſtrate's Power extends not to the eſtabliſhing any Articles of Faith, or forms of Worſhip by force of Laws: For Laws are of no Force without Penalties.—The care of Souls cannot belong to the civil Magiſtrate, becauſe his Power conſiſts only in outward Force: But true and ſaving Religion conſiſts in the inward Perſuaſion of the Mind; without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be acceptable to God.</q> And a late Writer ſays, "That Mankind have a right to be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011972_0020_0F87CE9F24EA41A0"/>free in the Choice of Religion, is a Truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to take it away; nor can, without being guilty of aſſuming that Power over others, which God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave them: And to allow Men as Individuals the free Choice of their Religion, and yet to take by <hi>Force</hi> their Eſtates from them to ſupport a Religion or Worſhip which they do not chuſe, is a piece of Oppreſſion that would make even a moral Heathen bluſh; yet many ſuch Inſtances have we had, and ſtill have!"</p>
            <p>I think if theſe things do not cauſe ſome remorſe in thoſe who have thus oppreſſed their Brethren, they muſt be more ſtupid than thoſe who had been cruel to Joſeph; for when they met with like Treatment they ſaid, <hi>We are verily guilty concerning our Brother!</hi> yea, more ſtupid than a Heathen King, who, though what he met with was by the hands of Men, yet ſaid, <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath requited me.</hi> Judg. i. 7.</p>
            <p>For if it be Oppreſſion to take away from a People the right of <hi>giving</hi> their Money, either by themſelves or their Repreſentatives, to ſupport civil Government, where Force belongs (as I believe it is) what muſt it be to deprive them of a right that never can be conveyed to any Repreſentative! For unleſs a Man could conſtitute another to anſwer for him at the Bar of God, it is impoſſible for him to convey to another a right to compel him or others to attend, or ſupport any Worſhip contrary to their Conſciences.</p>
