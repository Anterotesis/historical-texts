            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GOD's own viſible People are not exempt from Judgments; yea thoſe among them who are truly godly and dear to God, if by their ſinful carriages they caſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon God, and upon Religion; do expoſe themſelves to many humbling and afflictive rebukes from God in this World. Tho' their Sin be pardoned, and ſhall not condemn them in the other World: yet God ſees it neceſſary for the vindication of His own Name, and the promoting of their good, to give ſome publick teſtimony of His diſpleaſure againſt Sin. Not only ſuch as are of a profane and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001341_0003_0FB280960E053008"/>
vicious Spirit, whoſe carriages are an open defiance to Heaven; but many times the Sins of thoſe who are upright and ſincere, do help to bring publick rebukes and judgments upon themſelves &amp; others. God was ſo diſpleaſed with the Impatience and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that he excluded them out of Canaan, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.51.52. God was ſo offended with <hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> that He brought a great deal of ſorrow upon his Family and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: So provoked with <hi>Solomon</hi> for his Connivance at, and Encouragement of the Idolatry of his Wives, as to rend away ten parts of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the hand of his Son. And in the Context God denounces an awful threatning againſt the Houſe of <hi>Eli</hi> for his undue toleration and connivance at the wickedneſs of his Sons. Such examples ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, not to be high minded but fear: Not to think our ſelves ſecure becauſe of any viſible relation to God; but to carry a holy awe and trembling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts, of his Holineſs and Jealouſie, who is of purer Eyes than to look upon ſin.</p>
            <p>In the words we may take notice of three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſevere Threatning denounced againſt the houſe of <hi>Eli, [I have told him;]</hi> by the meſſage before ſent to him <hi>[that I will judge:]</hi> The word ſignifies either to Condemn, Puniſh, or Deſtroy. Here it ſeems to intend to puniſh. <hi>[His Houſe]</hi> That is, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or Poſterity, which is often called a mans <hi>Houſe. [For ever]</hi> That is, either till they are utterly waſted and conſumed, or rather for a long time, as the phraſe <hi>for ever</hi> is oft uſed. This was in part fulfilled when his two Sons were ſlain by the Philiſtines, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4 11. And in part when <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew <hi>Ahimeleck</hi> and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.18. And finally when the Prieſt-hood
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001341_0004_0FB28097B46200F0"/>
was tranſlated from the Houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> and of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> to that of <hi>Eliazar,</hi> by <hi>Solomon</hi> about Eighty years after, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reaſon of this threatning is, <hi>Becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.</hi> Their Sin was very horrid and prodigious, as is reported in the preceding Chapter. Their Sins were ſuch as rendred them abominable to God, and contemptible to the People: they brought their Sacred Offices and Gods Holy Ordinances into contempt. Yet their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not uſe that Authority which God had given him as an high Prieſt, as a Judge or chief Magiſtrate, in puniſhing them, as by the Law of God he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do: but contented himſelf with an eaſy and gentle reproof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Aggravation of this Sin, which is eſpecially taken notice of as the immediate, procuring cauſe of the Judgment: <hi>For the Iniquity which he knoweth.</hi> He could not pretend Ignorance, or want of evidence, that the matter was uncertain: the cry of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs was got abroad among all Iſrael: and God had particularly warn'd him of it by a meſſenger ſent to him, as you read, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2 27 &amp; <hi>ſequ.</hi> But though the matter was ſo notorious, yet his Parental fondneſs and indulgence ſeems to have brib'd <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> judgment that he doth not attend his Duty to God and them, in puniſhing of them ſuitably to their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Guilt.</p>
            <p>That is the clauſe in the Text that I would parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly take notice of at this time, and from it you may take this Doctrine.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>
                  <hi>DOCT.</hi> It is Highly Offenſive to God, and ſhews Men to be very faulty; when they will not Reform what they Know to be amiſs.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001341_0005_0FB2809D47355E10"/>This Aggravated <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sin, that he knew his Sons to be vile, and did not do what he might and ought to have done to reſtrain them. Sometimes a People, and ſo particular Perſons Sin through Ignorance, they are under diſadvantages to know the mind of God in particular caſes; or elſe the matter is diſputable, its a queſtion to them whether the thing be a Sin: now tho' this dont wholly excuſe Sin, yet it leſſens it; it is not ſo heinous nor ſo aggravated. But when men have ſo much light held forth, that Sin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly diſcovered, and God is plainly teſtifying againſt it, and they are often confeſſing it, yet do not ſet themſelves to reform it, but perſiſt in it ſtill; this makes them very guilty before God, and ſhews their offence to be very great. Hence it is God threatens in a peculiar manner to puniſh His <hi>Own</hi> People, <hi>Amos</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Earth, therefore will I puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> Why is this? Not becauſe God loves them leſs than He doth other People; but becauſe His Name and Honour ſuffers more by their Sins, and they being committed againſt more light than the Sins of others, are the more inexcuſable. <hi>Job.</hi> 15 22. So <hi>James</hi> 4 17. <hi>To him that knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is Sin.</hi> (i. e.) It is ſo with peculiar aggravations.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt give you the confirmation of the Doctrine, and then make ſome Application of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Truth of it appears in this, <hi>That it diſcovers a prevailing</hi> Love <hi>to Sin.</hi> It ſhows that Sin hath got a great deal of power in their hearts, the more light is reſiſted in Sinning, the ſtronger and deeper love men have to it: their pleas and excuſes for it, their
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001341_0006_0FB280A1EEACF1B0"/>
willingneſs to juſtify it, their readineſs to roll it as a ſweet morſel under their Tongues; ſhews their hearts to be much ſet upon it, that it hath a great intereſt and activity in their affections, and this corrupts and blinds their judgments. Were there ſuch a hatred and abhorrency of Sin, as ought to be, it would engage to watchfulneſs againſt it, and care to reſiſt it, and ſhun Temptations when offered, and put upon endeavours to mortify it: but mens eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſerving it under light and conviction, is a ſign it hath got a great deal of power in their hearts. This reaſon the Apoſtle gives us why <hi>Balaam</hi> was ſo ſet to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>He loved the Wages of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi> Now to <hi>Love</hi> Sin is a bad ſign: Where it reigns it ſhews a mans State to be bad. The Pſalmiſt gives it as the Character of a Wicked man, <hi>Pſal</hi> 52.3. <hi>Thou</hi> Loveſt <hi>evil more than good.</hi> When men prefer <hi>Sin</hi> before <hi>Holineſs</hi> in their ordinary habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual courſe, it ſhows their State to be bad; ſhews the heart to be in a bad frame and very much wanting as to the Exerciſe of Grace, which ought to be maintained. Now <hi>Love</hi> to Sin, very much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates Sin. Joh. 3 19. <hi>This is the Condemnation that light is come into the World, and men love darkneſs rather than light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It ſhews want of Love to God; too little ſenſe of and regard to Gods honour</hi> Sin is loathſome and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God: He looks upon it with diſpleaſure and abhorrency, and it ſhould be ſo look'd upon by us, and be the object of our hatred and diſpleaſure. And where a ſpirit of Love to God is kept in Exerciſe, it will be ſo: they that love the Lord will hate Evil, ſo the Pſalmiſt expreſſes his indignation againſt Sin, Pſal. 101.3. <hi>I hate the works of ſuch as turn aſide, it ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001341_0007_0FB280A2C87177F0"/>
not cleave to me:</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.104. <hi>I hate every falſe way.</hi> If Perſons have a tender reſpect to Gods Glory, His Name and Honour be dear to them; this will make them afraid of provoking Him, of doing any thing that will leſſen and obſcure it; and make them watchful againſt all encroachments of Sin, and be ready to ſay as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great Wickedneſs and Sin againſt God?</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſons perſevere in the practice of <hi>Known</hi> Evils; though they <hi>See</hi> Sin, are unwilling to <hi>forſake</hi> it: it ſhews either the want of <hi>Love</hi> to God, or the want of the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it. For if a principle of Love to God were in Exerciſe, Sin would be a burthen and a grief to the Soul; Holineſs would be deſired and endeavoured after with all poſſible means, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. Now this will be readily granted, that men are very much to blame either when they hant a ſpirit of Love to God, or dont maintain it in a lively exerciſe and activity; for God is worthy of our Love; our beſt affections are due to Him, both upon account of his infinite and amiable Perfections, and his innumerable and repeated Benefits; and alſo becauſe this is the great principle of all Evangelical Obedience; nothing is well done in Religion without it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is an argument of much Deadneſs, Stupidity and Sleepineſs of Conſcience, that Sin can be let alone, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lye quietly in the Heart.</hi> A tender Conſcience may be ſometimes clouded with Ignorance, and thro' miſtakes paſs a wrong judgment in particular caſes, and ſo ſuffer the Man to lie for a time in ſome Sin without Repentance; but otherwiſe a wakeful and tender Conſcience will ſmite and condemn for Sin; it is Gods Deputy in the Soul, and will take His part, and witneſs for Him when His Honour is contemned,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001341_0008_0FB280A50465A410"/>
and His Law violated. When <hi>David</hi> had but cut off the skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi> robe, preſently his heart ſmote him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5 When <hi>Peter</hi> remembred the words of Chriſt, he went out and wept bitterly, <hi>Math.</hi> 26 75. A ſenſible Conſcience, will fill the Soul with diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting accuſations, and make it uneaſy under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of its own guilt, and reſtleſs to be delivered from it, and from the burthenſome and diſtreſſing effects and conſequents of it: and therefore will put upon the uſe of proper means for it. When the Apoſtle had ſtir'd up the Conſciences of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to reflect upon their Sinful connivance at the Inceſtuous Perſon among them, and their pride and unhumbled Spirit, not mourning for and over him; you ſee how it wrought in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. They could have no reſt till they were throughly clear of it, and had by unfeigned Repentance teſtifyed their diſpleaſure againſt it. Now it is every ones unqueſtionable duty, to get and keep a tender Conſcience; and their Sin, to give way to Security and Sleepineſs of Conſcience, for when ſuch a frame of heart prevails, it ſhews a careleſs, unwatchful, unthinking heart; the want of a due ſenſe of Gods unſpotted Holineſs, and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the certainty of his Righteous Judgment; the want of care to pleaſe God and approve their hearts to Him in a holy Converſation. Yea, if Conſcience be ſuffered to fall aſleep, the Soul lies like a Town unguarded, ready to be a prey to an approaching E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: Satan eaſily gets an advantage over ſuch, many ſad breaches are made in the Peace of their Souls, and many defilements contracted, to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable prejudice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Becauſe it ſhews a greater Voluntarineſs and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Sinning.</hi> Such dont Sin through inadvertency,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001341_0009_0FB280A6ACC5DA60"/>
or from the ſudden ſurprizal of Temptation; but with more deliberation. Now the more freely men commit Sin, and the more of the conſent of the Will there is in it, the more vile it is. It diſcovers a very bad ſtate or frame of heart, that men have loſt in a great meaſure the ſenſe of Gods Authority, and the awe of His Judgment: and therefore ſuch Sins are the more heinous and offenſive to God: Joh. 15 22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had had no Sin, but now they have no cloak for their Sin.</hi> The coming in of ſo much Light, made their Sin inexcuſable, and took away all pleas and pretences, they had to excuſe or cover it before. They cant ſay they did not know it was Sin, or that it was a thing ſo offenſive to God, or would be of ſuch a dangerous tendency to themſelves. The coming in of Light diſcovers theſe things to them. Hence Chriſt tells us, that ſuch Sins expoſe to greater Judgment: Luk. 12.47. <hi>The Servant that knew his Lords will and prepared not himſelf to do according to it, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> And as hereafter it expoſes to a ſorer Condemnation, ſo at preſent, when-ever the Conſcience of a Sinner comes to be awakened, the remembrance of the Light that hath been reſiſted, the warnings and convictions that have been ſlighted; makes deep wounds in the Conſcience, and procures many heart-piercing fears, and agonies of Spirit. Its great folly for any to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to theſe diſquiets of Conſcience, by giving way to ſuch Conſcience-waſting Sins.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Becauſe it ſhews, that there is but little Dread upon their hearts of Gods Judgments, either felt or threatned.</hi> Sin expoſes men to the juſt diſpleaſure of a Holy &amp; Righteous God; and He is many times in His Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences revealing His wrath againſt the ungodlineſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001341_0010_0FB280AF00D3F9A0"/>
and unrighteouſneſs of men, and expects that theſe things ſhould be an awe upon their hearts, and be a means to reſtrain them from adventuring any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in their impenitency: But when his Wrath is not made viſible in the <hi>Puniſhments</hi> of Sin; yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſcovered in his <hi>Threatnings</hi> againſt it, and hangs like a flaming Sword over the head of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Theſe ſhould be an awe to Perſons and make them afraid of expoſing themſelves to Divine Juſtice: ſo they have been to ſome. <hi>David,</hi> ſaid, Pſal 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.23. <hi>Deſtruction from God was a terror to me, and by reaſon of his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I could not endure.</hi> And it ſhould be ſo with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: God requires men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4 4. <hi>Stand in awe and ſin not.</hi> And ſaid, Iſa. 26.9. <hi>When his Judgments are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants of the World will learn righteouſneſs.</hi> Corrections ſhould be inſtructive, we ſhould learn the evil of Sin by them, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of continuing in it. If there were any ſuitable awe of the Juſtice, or Truth of God upon the heart, any ſenſe of the terribleneſs of his diſpleaſure, and what a fearful thing it is to be the ſorrowful ſubject of his Threatnings or Judgments, it would be ſo. Thoſe therefore are very much to blame, whoſe hearts are glued ſo faſt to their Luſts and Idols; that rather than part with them, will ſlight their own Mercies, and expoſe themſelves to the Wrath and Jealouſly of a Sin revenging God. And though Knowing the Judgment of God in his threatnings or providences, will not be check'd or reſtrain'd by it.</p>

It is to be blamed, when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple corrupt themſelves, and grow degenerate; but it is worſe, when they continue ſo, and will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed: They are to blame upon a double account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>With reſpect to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankfulneſs for the Light that is held forth to them</hi> Their not improving of it, and ſubmitting to it, ſhews their low eſteem of it; that they dont as they ought, acknowledge the Mercy of God in it. It is a great frown of God upon a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he lets them alone in their Sins, without uſing the means that are proper to convince, reform, and convert them, and bring them back to their duty: When He ſuffers them to walk in their own ways, as he did the Gentile World, <hi>Acts</hi> 14 6 When He lets them alone, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4 17. When He leaves them to blindneſs, and darkneſs; and will not vouchſafe to uſe thoſe means with them, that he is wont to do with his People: dont diſcover their Sin or danger to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor call them to Repentance: It is a ſign God hath mark'd them out for his vengeance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. But it is on the other hand a great mercy and bleſſing when God takes pains with men to bring them to a ſight of Sin, and a conviction of their duty; reveals his will to them, ſhows them how they ſhould govern themſelves, and order their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001341_0012_0FB280B1C2D480A8"/>
teſtifies againſt their Evils; warns them of the danger of Sin, and encourages them to obedience by promiſes of Mercy: theſe are ſit means to work upon a heart, and gain men to their duty. God reckons it a great indulgence to Iſrael, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19. <hi>He gave his Statutes to Jacob, and his Judgments to Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. And juſtly takes it ill, when it is not duly received: Hoſ. 8.12. <hi>I have written to them the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</hi> Or a forreign thing, as a thing they had no concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in; not belonging to them; nor did deſire to be governed by. Whatever pretences men make of thankfulneſs for the word of God, and ſpeak of it as a priviledge, that they have light, and means of Grace; yet if they dont yield Obedience to the light, and conform themſelves to the Commands of it; they are <hi>Practically</hi> Unthankful; and do in effect, caſt it behind their backs, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In that an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwillingneſs to be Reformed argues much of an Incorrigible Spirit.</hi> It ſhows their hearts are ſet upon their Evil ways: Hoſ. 11.7. <hi>My People are bent to backſliding from me:</hi> tho' they called them to the moſt High, none at all would exalt him: it ſhews the Inveterateneſs of a diſeaſe when it reſiſts, and overcomes healing Medicines. So when ſuitable means are uſed to bring a People to Repentance; and all prove fruſtrate and ineffectual; when nothing will do, it ſhews much Incorrigibleneſs and of Irreclaima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs. When they ſay; either in Words or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they, in Jer. 44.16. <hi>As for the Word thou haſt ſpoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.</hi> And 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36 15, 16. When this comes to the height, Judgments come on irremedileſly, and there is no reſiſting or eſcaping. Ordinarily, this
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001341_0013_0FB280B366906BD8"/>
ſpirit doth not come to the height at once, but grows upon a People gradually. Now this is a great degree of it, when they withſtand means of Conviction, dont hearken to the voice of Gods Warnings or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; when they Plead for Sin, and are unwilling to Repent, Reform and Turn to God unfeignedly. To be of ſuch a ſpirit, as to ſlight Reproofs, and contemn Reprovers, is a very bad Eſtate. Its bad enough when the hearts of a People are gone off from God, and ſet upon their Luſts: but it is worſe, when they will Not return; but perſevere in their evil ways.</p>
               <p>USE. II. <hi>May be to Warn you that you dont reſiſt the Light, that ſhould diſcover your</hi> Sin, <hi>and bring you to your</hi> Duty. It is a dangerous thing to neglect to Reform what you <hi>Know</hi> to be amiſs: there's a great deal of Sin in it, and it expoſes thoſe who are guilty of it, to many Judgments. <hi>Eli</hi> had been before now warned of the wickedneſs of his Sons; but his Sinful Indulgence towards them blinded him: and here God tells him, <hi>He will Judge his houſe for ever.</hi> So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet declares againſt <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 Chron 25 16 <hi>I know God hath determined to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt done this, and hast not hearkened to my counſel.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding evident teſtimonies from God, men do ſometimes harden their hearts: and by perſiſting in Sin, expoſe themſelves to <hi>Spiritual, Temporal,</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Judgments. I will mind you of ſome of the ways whereby Perſons do ſometimes do it; that you may be cautioned againſt them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>By pleading the</hi> Example <hi>of others.</hi> Bad Examples are very pernicious, and a great occaſion of harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in Sin. <hi>Jereboam</hi>'s Idolatry had a fatal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon all the ſucceding Kings of Iſrael. You
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001341_0014_0FB280B762DDC030"/>
find in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44 17. They juſtifyed themſelves in their Idolatrous practices, from the <hi>Example</hi> of their Kings, Princes, and Fathers before them: So it is now, ſome ſtand upon their own vindication on ſuch grounds, as to many particular evils: they are not alone in what they do: Many men that they know do ſo, and ſuch as are wiſe and good men too. But this is no ſufficient vindication. If the thing be in its nature or under ſuch circumſtances, evil; the practice of others, will not make it good, how many or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be. You know that good men have their failings, and in many things carry corruptly. But beſides, all are not good men, that are taken to be ſo. Many that the World calls <hi>Wiſe,</hi> Knowing men; are and will be found <hi>Fools</hi> at laſt: but if they are never ſo good, or wiſe; you muſt follow none any farther than they follow CHRIST, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Precepts</hi> muſt be your Rule, not <hi>Examples: Iſa.</hi> 8.20. There's hardly any <hi>Duty</hi> but ſome or other fail in; or any <hi>Sin,</hi> but ſome have fallen into, and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in a degenerate time; a great laxneſs, both as to principles, and practices, is wont to prevail among a People. So that if you make this a Rule, you will find very little to be Reformed; yea a great part of your Bibles muſt be laid by, as uſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By entertaining</hi> Prejudices <hi>againſt thoſe that Warn and Reprove them; as if they did it not in faithfulneſs to them, but upon ſome ill deſign.</hi> This was one reaſon why they rejected the word God ſent by the Prophet, Jer. 43.2. <hi>The Lord hath not ſent thee, but Baruch the Son of Neriah ſetteth thee on:</hi> So Jer. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. — <hi>The word of the Lord is unto them a reproach:</hi> — They interpret faithful reproofs to be reproaches, they ſay they are
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001341_0015_0FB280B88DFD8718"/>
railed upon. <hi>Ahab</hi> was prejudiced againſt <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Micajah,</hi> as if their reproofs were only from want of love to his Perſon: he counts them his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and thence takes nothing kindly. Sometimes perſons pretend, that others would reſtrain them from their juſt Liberties; or they dont know the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their condition; ſometimes that they aim at their own particular intereſt. But theſe pretences are ordinarily from the deceitfulneſs of Sin; or the efficacy of Satan, to harden the heart; there's no juſt reaſon for them. Our duty, when reproved, is ſeriouſly to examine the caſe, if the Word of God condemns the practice, that's ſufficient to deter us from it; for it is by this that God will juſtify, or condemn us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By trusting to their</hi> Religious Priviledges, <hi>or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goodneſs in other caſes.</hi> The carnal Jews when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for their Oppreſſion, Injuſtice, Idolatry; and called to amend their ways, they boaſt of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, Jer. 7.4. <hi>The Temple of the Lord are theſe:</hi> as if their viſible relation to God, and external obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would ſecure them from Judgments. So ſhe makes this a cloak for her wickedneſs, Prov. 7.14. <hi>I have Peace-offerings with me, this day I have performed my Vows.</hi> Thus carnal Chriſtians reſt upon their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſhews of Devotions, becauſe they attend the Worſhip of God in Publick, Pray in their Families, and the like, that therefore God will excuſe their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities: They truſt in their righteouſneſs and commit iniquity, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. But alas theſe things do rather aggravate, than at all excuſe Sin; and ſhow that men know their duty. God calls for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obedience; the doing of one duty will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the neglect of another, <hi>James</hi> 2.11. <hi>Herod</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001341_0016_0FB280BA0D9FA008"/>
did many things, and heard <hi>John</hi> gladly: but would not part with his <hi>Herodias.</hi> The <hi>Phariſee</hi> could boaſt, he was no Extortioner, no Adulterer: but he could not ſay, he was not Proud, and Self-confident. God that calls you to Pray, to Hear, to Meditate upon his Word; calls you alſo to Live Soberly, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to walk Humbly with God. Partiality in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpoils it, and utterly fruſtrates men of the Rewards of it: <hi>James</hi> 1.26. <hi>If a man ſeem to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, his Religion is vain.</hi> If the heart be upright, <hi>All Duty</hi> will be choſen; and <hi>All Sin</hi> avoided, Pſal. 119.6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all thy Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By</hi> Preſuming <hi>upon the</hi> Mercy <hi>of God; hoping that ſhall ſecure them from the stroaks of</hi> Juſtice. They Sin freely, and cry, God is Merciful: they dont think God will be ſo ſevere, as He threatens, or men would have them believe: <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. <hi>When he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart.</hi> This hardens the hearts of abundance: They take up wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Gods Mercy; as if He were of ſo pitiful, and tender a Nature, that He could not <hi>bear</hi> to ſee men ſuffer what He threatens. But you muſt know, God is <hi>Juſt,</hi> as well as <hi>Merciful;</hi> and it is no Unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for God to Puniſh men according to his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Yea, his Truth and Faithfulneſs oblige him to it. God hath determined the way and time for the Exerciſe of his Mercy; and if theſe be neglected, no Mercy will be ſhown. The very Devils may as well hope for Mercy, as impenitent Unbelievers, who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in the day of Salvation to ſeek for Mercy in a Goſpel way. You cannot take a more direct and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to turn away the Heart of a Merciful God
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001341_0017_0FB280BBABE78080"/>
from you, than by abuſing his Goodneſs to ſtrengthen your ſelves in Rebellion againſt Him: This is a moſt vile Abuſe of it, and an Unreaſonable inference from it: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Shall we continue in Sin, that Grace may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound?</hi> God forbid! it is a thought to be abhorred.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>By entertaining</hi> Purpoſes of future Repentance. Men know their courſe is Evil, and ſuch as God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns: that this and the other practice which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is ſinful; they dare not juſtify it: but they ſtill their Conſciences with this, that they intend to <hi>Repent</hi> of it, and reckon upon no great difficulty in it: tis but repenting, and all ſhall be well. Theſe purpoſes of repentance for the future, harden abundance, &amp; make them bold to continue in Sin, againſt all Counſels, and Reproofs. But alas Repentance is not ſo eaſy a work: the heart that is now ſo much in love with <hi>Sin;</hi> and ſo full of enmity to <hi>Holineſs,</hi> will not eaſily be changed. A deceitful heart will find other excuſes, when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are anſwered: the old man will ſtruggle hard, before it is ſubdued. But repentance is a Grace of Gods giving; the heart of ſtone is too hard, for any created power to break. And as it is what God <hi>gives,</hi> ſo it is what he gives <hi>freely,</hi> 2 Tim. 2 25. <hi>If God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure will give them repentance.</hi> Many that preſume upon having repentance at leiſure, find themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; either a ſudden Death arreſts them, or a hard heart, and a ſleepy Conſcience ſeizes upon them. It is a bold adventure to reject Gods gracious Offers, preſuming upon <hi>Future</hi> Time, or Grace.</p>
               <p>USE III. <hi>Of Examination and Expoſtulation with you, whether you are not faulty in this matter.</hi> Are there not ſeveral things which you know to be Duties, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; ſeveral things, that you know to be Sins,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001341_0018_0FB280BD5220CAF8"/>
practiced? We live in a land of <hi>Light,</hi> have great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to know the mind of God, to know how we ſhould adorn the Goſpel, and our profeſſion of it. The Grace of God toward us, both as to Light and Peace under Goſpel Privileges, is very peculiar and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing. And altho' there may be Errors in practice that ariſe thro' Ignorance, and inadvertency: and ſome points that are diſputable, that perſons are not ſo well ſatisfyed about. Yet ſurely, the Evils of this Country are for the moſt part in ſuch things as are <hi>Known,</hi> yea ſuch as have been often <hi>Acknowledged;</hi> ſometimes in a more Publick manner, both by Civil and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rulers: and often in a general way upon ſuch days as this. It is not the want of <hi>Light,</hi> but the want of <hi>Improving,</hi> and <hi>Submitting</hi> to the Light that we have, that retards the Reformation, which hath been ſo long called for. Let me proſecute this Expoſtulation in the following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the great Duty of Improving Seaſons &amp; Means of Grace, unto a Repentance from Dead Works, Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; to a getting into a Converted and Pardoned Estate, while the Patience and long-ſuffering of God is continued:</hi> Is not this a thing abundantly Known and Confeſſed? Certainly Perſons that have been bred up under the Calls of the Goſpel, and have had the duties of it ſo frequently inculcated upon them, cant be ignorant of theſe things. The word is plain and poſitive concerning them preſſing a preſent Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Converſion to God, Iſa. 55 67 <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him whilſt he is near. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 6 1, 2. <hi>Behold now is the accepted time; now is the day of Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. And Heb 3 5. And how plainly doth it warn of the danger of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001341_0019_0FB280C1895DFAD0"/>
it: Heb. 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> There will be no eſcaping or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foreſt condemnation. God ſhows the riches of his Grace in affording the Seaſons of Grace unto men; theſe are not to be ſlighted and trifled away; but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, ſeaſonably, and faithfully improved. It is a great diſhonour caſt upon Chriſt, and contempt of the Love of God in the work of Redemption, when Peace and Reconciliation with him, are not regarded; when the fruits of redeeming love in Sanctification, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, are counted a <hi>Miſery,</hi> rather than a <hi>Privilege.</hi> It is a daring preſumption, as well as poſitive Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when God calls for <hi>preſent</hi> Repentance &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, to defer the matter to <hi>future</hi> care. Surely, men know it is their duty to put Honour upon the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to acknowledge him in his Office of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Surely it is fit that He, who hath been at the expence of his precious Blood, undergone ſuch abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſufferings; ſhould be glorious in the Eyes of thoſe to whom he is offered; and the fruits of his Redeeming love, be received with all Thankfulneſs. This is plainly required. <hi>Joh</hi> 5.23. He will have all men honour the Son as they honour the Father: and how is Chriſt honoured, if he be not believed in, and obeyed? <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9 Doth not every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that there is no other way of Salvation but this which God hath conſecrated through faith in his Blood? Yet alas how many are there who neglect theſe great duties; Live in impenitency, and unbelief, are very little concerned to obtain a real Union with Chriſt, &amp; Communion in the Benefits of Redemption; make no great matter of letting ſlip the Seaſons of Grace; feel no Miſery in their Eſtrangement from God, captivity to Sin, and Satan; dont groan after
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001341_0020_0FB280C56300A9B0"/>
Redemption; are more intent upon ſecuring the <hi>World,</hi> than obtaining <hi>Heaven;</hi> are more inquiſitive what they ſhall Eat &amp; Drink, and wherewith they ſhall be Cloathed; than how they may glorify God, adorn the Goſpel, ſecure the happineſs of their Souls in Chriſt, and an unfailing Title to that Glory which he hath purchaſed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the Means of Worſhip which God hath appointed, whether Publick, Private, or Secret.</hi> Certainly, the Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them that are among us, are not through Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance Men know and confeſs that God is the Supreme and firſt Being, the fountain of Goodneſs; &amp; thence the proper object of Worſhip; that all our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies flow from Him; ſhould be ask'd by Prayer, and acknowledged with Praiſe. As to the <hi>Secret Duties</hi> of Worſhip, how plain is the Precept, Mat. 6 6 <hi>When thou prayeſt, Enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, Pray to thy Father which is in Secret.</hi> &amp;c. Every man hath Perſonal Wants, Sins, and Temptations; many concerns that are moſt fit to be tranſacted in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret between God and his own Soul; therefore, to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, is both an act of Diſobedience to God. &amp; a great prejudice to your Selves. Yet, are there not ſuch who are Strangers to this Duty? can ſeldom find time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God in Secret Duties; can often Sin in Secret; be Wanton, Unjuſt, Intemperate, in Secret; but dont Pray in Secret: And as to the Publick Worſhip of God, how plainly hath God enjoyned the ſeveral parts of it? And particularly, that very much neglected Ordinance of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> obliging all his Diſciples to do it in Remembrance of Him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22 19 That they might keep up a thankful Memorial of the Death of Chriſt, and the great Ends of it; and reſtify their dependance upon him for the bleſſings purchaſed by it.

Such Perſons will be very inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Day of Chriſt. You pretend a zeal for Chriſts Inſtitutions, and commend your Fore-fathers that ventured their blood to reſcue your Ordinances from Popiſh corruptions; and yet when you may attend it in Goſpel Purity, turn your backs upon it!</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>As to</hi> Families; <hi>do not men Know that it is their Duty to Educate and Inſtruct them in Religion, &amp; Vertue; and reſtrain from Impieties and Immoralities?</hi> This is plain, Prov. 22 6 <hi>Train up a Child in the way he ſhould go;</hi> — Eph. 6.4. <hi>Bring them up in the nurture &amp; admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord:</hi> For this <hi>Abraham</hi> is honoured and commended by God, Gen. 18 19 <hi>I know Abraham that he will command his children and houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord to do Justice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> It is the way for Parents to be inſtruments to convey the beſt Bleſſings to their Children. Not only the tyes of Religion, and Conſcience, but of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo, oblige to it. To neglect it, would be to be worſe than the <hi>Oſtriches</hi> of the Wilderneſs. Are they

not ſuch as you have ſolemnly Dedicated to God, and profeſſed a deſire that they may be the Lords? Now it will be groſs hypocriſy in you, to be negligent of their Education; as well as great Unfaithfulneſs to God and to their Souls. Have not you been the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſtruments of propagating <hi>Original Sin</hi> to them? and ſhould not this oblige you, to do the beſt you can for them, that they may be delivered from the guilt of it? Beſides, You have a ſpecial intereſt in them, are always with them, know their Tempers, and Diſpoſitions; have peculiar advantages to be inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Principles of Piety, and Vertue; to inure them to the practice of Religion, Civility &amp; Induſtry. The great concern of upholding Religion, and Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it to ſucceding Generations ſhould be a preſſing encouragement hereunto. The Work of Chriſt in our Towns and Churches, will ſoon languiſh, if this be neglected: they will be like unpoliſh'd Stones, unfit to be laid in any building; if a vertuous and pious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation be neglected. The preſent, ſorrowful State of many of our Children, ſnatch'd from us and expoſed to a Popiſh and Heatheniſh Education, ſhould awaken to ſerious reflections whether among other juſt reaſons for it, God may not be pointing at this neglect. Its certain, <hi>Eli</hi>'s Poſterity ſmarted for his Indulgence, as in the Text. So did <hi>David</hi>'s, tho' he was a very holy man. Theſe therefore, who <hi>Know</hi> all theſe things, &amp; yet neglect a Godly Education of their Families; who indulge them in ignorance of things fundamental to their Salvation and Converſion: connive at their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiouſneſs, rudeneſs, diſorders, neglect of Family-Worſhip, not Sanctifying the Lords Day; or allow irreverent clowniſh carriages: are greatly to blame.

               <p n="4">4 <hi>Do not men</hi> Know <hi>that an inordinate Affection to the things of this World, is very unbecoming thoſe that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſtianity; and most frequently forbidden in the Word of God?</hi> James 4 4. <hi>Ye adulterers &amp; adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 13.5. <hi>Let your Converſation be without Coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> Mat. 6 19, 20, 31, 32. Yea, God hath told you that this is Idolatry, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. When that Eſteem, Love, Complacency, Deſire, which is due to God; is ſet upon the World: this is as real Idolatry, as mens bowing down to a Stock or a Stone: And when God hath plainly declared wherein this inordinacy of heart diſcovers it ſelf, in anxious, perplexing, diſquieting cares; neglecting a dependance upon God, or ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with the diſpoſals of his Providence; in greedy, violent deſires; when they will be rich, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. We are told, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.22. <hi>He that makes haſte to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.</hi> Men often wrong their Souls, and wound their Conſciences, as well as blaſt their Reputation, when they take any unrighteous ways of gain; defraud, oppreſs, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach in their dealings; dont deal truly and honeſtly; or neglect paying of juſt debts; or neceſſary acts of Charity; dare not depend upon Divine Providence, on the encouragement of the Promiſe; but withold more than is meet: when they begrutch God <hi>His</hi> due; and the Poor, <hi>their</hi> due; count themſelves loſers in all that they diſpoſe in Works of Mercy and Charity. Or when their worldly cares encroach their time, and thoughts; choak convictions, hinder the Duties of Religion, or occaſion Formality, &amp; Slightineſs in them;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001341_0024_0FB280CB48E9CCA0"/>
when the care for the <hi>Body</hi> crouds out care for the <hi>Soul;</hi> and things of the <hi>World</hi> make them neglect <hi>Heaven.</hi> Now doth not ſuch a Spirit too much prevail, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding convictions &amp; profeſſions to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Is it not a thing evident to conſidering and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Perſons, that the <hi>Abatement</hi> of Love to Chriſt, &amp; the <hi>increaſe</hi> of love to the World, is a main root of the degeneracy that hath grown upon us? How much cauſe is there to think that Gods impoveriſhing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences point at this evil, and give us ſpecial reaſon to lament our too great averſion, to Reform it!</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Doth not every one</hi> Know, <hi>that</hi> Intemperance <hi>is an Evil?</hi> The very light of Nature condemns it; Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd Heathen have abhord it, and born witneſs againſt it. The word of God doth this more eſpecially, not only witneſſing againſt the groſſer acts of it, in noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> and ſhameful Spewing: but all the tendencies that way; and the occaſions of and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to it; forbiding men to tarry long at the wine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20. Yea, not ſo much as to look upon it when it gives its colour in the Cup, and moves it ſelf aright, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23 31. (if ſuch a ſight proves a temptation) and denounces a Woe againſt thoſe that are Strong to drink Wine, and men of Strength to mingle Strong drink, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.22. That can pour down cup after cup, without being intoxicated, and bereft of the exerciſe of Reaſon. And doth not the Goſpel more eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire men to live Soberly, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.12, 13. To govern their Appetites as to Meat &amp; Drink; &amp; are not ſome under ſpecial engagements, not to frequent Taverns, or give way to an inordinate affection to Strong Drink? If yet any act contrary hereunto, and needleſly ſpend away their Time and Eſtates, in indulging a Tipling humour, and gratifying the inordinacy of their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001341_0025_0FB280CCBA759F38"/>
to the wounding of their Conſciences; quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their convictions; diſhonouring their Profeſſion; impoveriſhing of their Families; and refuſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as is the deplorable caſe of ſome, that will certainly be found very culpable before God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inexcuſable: Theſe things with others of the like nature (that might have been named) are too ſad evidences of a great abuſe of Light that hath been afforded.</p>
               <p>USE. IV. <hi>Of EXHORTATION, Be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then to Reform thoſe things that you</hi> Know <hi>to be amiſs, and are plainly diſcovered to be Sins:</hi> If you neglect this, there will be juſt cauſe to fear that Gods diſpleaſure will be continued, and increaſed. God is as angry with mens Pride and Stubbornneſs in contempt of his Warnings, as formerly. Its a dangerous thing for a People againſt whom God hath a controverſy, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay their Repentance, and to continue the cauſes of his anger. For as it is with particular Perſons, ſo it is with a People; God limits the time of his patience, how long He will wait before the decree ſhall bring forth, and his wrath break out, till there be no remedy. Our Wiſdom therefore is to take up the matter quickly, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.49. To remove what we <hi>Know</hi> is Evil; and to ſearch out what <hi>we know not.</hi> In particular, I would here ſay.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reform ſuch things as your own</hi> Conſciences <hi>tell you are amiſs, and do often ſmite and condemn you for.</hi> Conſcience is Gods Monitor in your breaſts, and you ſhould liſten to it (as you would to a meſſenger from Heaven) when it warns you of Evil committed, or Duty neglected. Is not Conſcience often ſmiting of you? Sometimes when you hear Sin reproved, and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001341_0026_0FB280D387D32C80"/>
ſometimes when a day of diſtreſs and affliction comes; when you think Death and Judgment are near. Are there not many inward diſquietments, and perplexing thoughts ariſing in your hearts? Are there not ſecret Reſolutions to avoid thoſe Evils, or do thoſe duties that Conſcience deals with you about? Oh then obey the voice of Conſcience in theſe things, whatever it be that it witneſſes to, dont ſlight or ſmother it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the checks of it: If you dont carry kindly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it as a friend; you muſt expect that it will ſhortly carry towards you as an enraged Enemy, and will dreadfully upbraid you for the violence done to it: <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> Prov 18.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Reform what you often</hi> Confeſs <hi>to be Amiſs.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, beſides Publick Prayers, and ſolemn Confeſſions, that are made on ſuch Days as this, wherein we are uttering many things againſt our ſelves, for the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Righteouſneſs of God in the things He hath brought upon us: I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides theſe, God hath your particular and perſonal Confeſſions, in the daily Prayers that you make. How often are you bewailing the Miſpenſe of Time; abuſe of the Seaſons &amp; Means of Grace; Unthankfulneſs for Goſpel Mercies; Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, and Unprofitableneſs under Divine Cultivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the neglect of government over your Spirits and Paſſions; inordinate affection to the things of the World; and a too great indifferency and coldneſs in the things of God and your own Salvation? Now will you not be ſelf-condemned, if notwithſtanding theſe Confeſſions, theſe things are ſtill continued! How ſad is it, when a mans Prayers ſerve only for a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his hypocriſies! And evidence the deceitfulneſs of his heart in the religious ſhows that he makes. If there were a hearty Sorrow for ſuch Evils, and a due
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001341_0027_0FB280D62B1DC010"/>
ſenſe of them; it would be manifeſted in a ſerious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, both to reform, and mortify them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Reform ſuch things as are plainly Witneſſed against from the</hi> Word of God. You all confeſs the Word of God to be the Rule according to which our Lives and Actions ſhould be ordered: that it is to be our Guide, as to matters of Inſtitution, and as to moral duties; Truth, Juſtice, Temperance, Charity, Modeſty, and the like. When ever therefore your Duty laid down in it, is cleared up from it in the Miniſtry ſo plainly that your Conſciences cant gain-ſay it; be careful that you dont withſtand any ſuch Counſel, or Meſſage from God to you. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 119 161. — <hi>My heart ſtandeth in awe of thy word.</hi> God looks with a gracious reſpect to thoſe that tremble at his Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66 2. When any <hi>Duty</hi> is enforced by it, or <hi>Sin</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we ſhould ſubmit to it with reverence, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. It is not matter of <hi>Liberty,</hi> whether you will receive, or reject the Commands of God; but what God requires, <hi>Muſt</hi> be cheerfully ſubmitted to. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, where matters are diſputable or dark to them, there it is mens duty to enquire to labour to have their doubts reſolved: but where matters are plain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable; as in duties of <hi>Love</hi> to God, and Men, eſpecially in Moral Precepts &amp; ſuch things as all agree to be duties; and a mans own Conſcience cant gain-ſay it: if in ſuch caſes men dont hearken to the voice of God, He will ſurely require it of them. To inforce this Exhortation, I ſhall add theſe following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The neglecting to Reform what you</hi> Know <hi>to be Amiſs, will argue you to be guilty of great</hi> Hypocriſy <hi>in your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn tranſactions with God on ſuch days as theſe.</hi> Tis a thing confeſſed, that days of <hi>Humiliation</hi> without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001341_0028_0FB280D799EE2730"/>
are not acceptable to God; but rather days of <hi>Provocation, Iſai.</hi> 58.5, 6, 7. There is not that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, Repentance, brokenneſs of Heart for Sin, humble waiting upon God for Mercy, as ought to be: but men put off God with empty ſhows, and external devotions, which rather heighten, than moderate his anger. If there were a ſerious deſire, and engagedneſs of Heart to be reconciled to God; they would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to remove what lyes as a bar in the way to it; did men count Sin to be ſo bad, as they profeſs it to be; certainly they would be willing to let it go. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deſire <hi>Peace,</hi> and Atonement with God, and to neglect the <hi>Terms</hi> upon which He offers it: what is this but to act hypocritically? To cry for favour &amp; pardoning Mercy; and perpetuate the grounds of Gods controverſy: what is this but to mock God, to flatter Him with your lips, while your hearts are far from Him? it evidently ſhows the carnality, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of mens hearts, in ſuch Prayers: Hos 7.14. <hi>They aſſemble themſelves for corn and wine, and they rebel againſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider what loſers you have been, and are ſtill like to be, by not Reforming the Evils God hath witneſſed againſt.</hi> It is confeſſed, that the <hi>Sins</hi> of Gods profeſſing People, are the <hi>Provoking Cauſes</hi> of their calamities: Micah 1 5. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of Jacob is all this, and for the ſin of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Idolatry, Oppreſſion, and neglect of Gods Worſhip prevaild; and that brought on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Miſery. It is the abounding of <hi>Iniquities</hi> among us, that hath made way for the many <hi>Rebukes</hi> of Heaven, that we have been under: and neglecting to be reformed, hath continued them; our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience may convince us, what loſers we have been hereby: we have forſaken God to our Loſs. Is not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001341_0029_0FB280D966A50930"/>
much of the preſence of God loſt? His gracious ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual preſence in His <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and His protecting Preſence in His <hi>Providences:</hi> what loſſes in your Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts; in your Liberties, Eſtates, Families? Men have been violent to ſerve their Luſts; &amp; have ſmarted ſorely for it. And is it like to be otherwiſe ſtill? Can we expect that God will change the methods of his Providences, if there be no change for the better in us? Jer. 7.5, 6, 7. <hi>If ye thorowly amend your ways, and your doing; — Then I will cauſe you to dwell in this place,</hi> &amp;c. God is immutably Juſt and Holy. If our carriages are changed; then we become meet ſubjects for His Mercy to be exalted upon. Surely then the bitter fruits of Sin ſhould make every one willing to forſake it: Surely, it is time to grow wiſer, to ſay as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. — <hi>I will go and return to my first Husband, for then was it better with me then now.</hi> Some men think to advance themſelves by Sin; to get Eſtates, &amp; raiſe their Families, by Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, and a violent purſuit of the World: but they conſult ſhame to their houſe. What are men like to get by greedineſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, ſottiſh neglects of their Souls, and the great Salvation provided for them thro' Chriſt; but ſorrow here, and eternal ruine at the laſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If you Reform what you</hi> Know <hi>to be Amiſs; it will give ground to hope that God will ſhew you what you know not.</hi> Some are asking, Wherein ſhall we return? If this queſtion be ſerious; Surely, ſuch will reform what they do <hi>Know</hi> to be Evil: if otherwiſe, they act like them in the Prophet, <hi>Exek</hi> 14.3, 4.7. And expoſe themſelves by their mocking of God, to greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But God is ready to <hi>Teach</hi> thoſe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>to Do</hi> their Duty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7 17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 15, 16 <hi>Job</hi> Prays with the more confidence, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34 32. That
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001341_0030_0FB280DA421D6990"/>
God would teach him what he knows not; while he reſolves, that wherein he hath done iniquity, he will do ſo no more.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Thus to do, will give hope, that God will have a gracious reſpect to our Prayers this Day.</hi> For God doth not begrutch <hi>Mercies</hi> to His People, if they are but <hi>Obedient:</hi> Iſa. 1.19. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land.</hi> We have very great and weighty Requeſts to preſent before God this day; That God would bleſs Our Sovereign, and our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſmile upon their Warlike Preparations; ſtill honour them with Succeſs and Victory; give Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to His Church; and a Revival to the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Perſecuted Members of it; would preſerve our Land from the incurſions of Adverſaries; would bleſs, guide and proſper our Military Forces; that He would remember &amp; reſtore our diſtreſſed Captives. Surely, there is no conſidering Perſon, but accounts it would be a ſingular Mercy, if our Prayers for theſe things, might be accepted at the Throne of Grace. And will you not be prevaild with ſo far, as to part with your Sins, that you may obtain theſe Mercies? Oh that you would conſider it! Were it not better to part with the deareſt Luſt, than to be an <hi>Achan</hi> to trouble our <hi>Iſrael</hi> at ſuch a day as this? How reaſonable are Gods demands! When he calls men to deny Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Worldly Luſts; to live Soberly, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and Godly in this preſent World; to love God, and love one another; and eſpecially, to love your own Souls, by being throughly careful to Redeem time, and improve all helps, to ſecure the happineſs of them in Chriſt, while the day of Salvation is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; to turn to Him by a thorow Repentance, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001341_0031_0FB280DBC07C4C50"/>
acknowledgement of our offences, and a humble ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the blood of the Covenant, that God would Pardon our Sins, and heal our Land. God requires no compenſation for the wrongs we have done Him; no requitals for his injured Name and Glory, which hath ſuffered ſo much by us. But if you will return to Him with all your hearts, accept His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Grace, and reſign your ſelves to His Service in Sincerity, He will be gracious and prevent us with bleſſings of goodneſs: Zech. 1.3. — <hi>Turn ye unto me, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, and I will turn unto you, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> And can any be unwilling to this? Many are ready to ſay, They would be willing to part with many Pounds of their Eſtates; yea to venture their Lives, that they might enjoy peaceable dayes again: And will you not part with your Luſts for it? Abridge your ſelves of Unlawful Liberties, be humble and holy that you may obtain it! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>ult. — To him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the Salvation of GOD.</hi>
