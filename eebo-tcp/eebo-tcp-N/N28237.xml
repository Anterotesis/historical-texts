            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE anſwer to theſe tender inquiries is legible in the countenances of all, who compoſe this aſſembly. Yes, my fathers and brethren, my friends and fellow-citizens, I there read the cauſe of your lamentation. WASHINGTON, your COUNSELLOR, is periſhed. The Friend, the Father, of our country is no more; and ye have aſſembled to "teſtify your grief for his death." This ſun marks the anniverſary of his nativity.

this day. To other climes, illuſtrious Shade! haſt thou departed, where ſuns no longer meaſure the duration of thy exiſtence; where ſeaſons no more revolve; and where, we believe, thy felicity will be as interminable, as thy ſpirit is immortal.</p>
            <p>Already, my reſpected auditors, have we paid the merited tribute to the memory of this revered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved man. In this very ſanctuary, on the reception of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037640_0005_100F26C06DCCF5D8"/>
the melancholy tidings of his death, we indulged the ſpontaneous emotions of ſorrow; and, impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay for legiſlative recommendation, we haſtened at once to mitigate our grief by our tears, and to commemorate <hi>the man,</hi> whom we had always <hi>delighted to honour.</hi> On that mournful occaſion, we contemplated him in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious characters of <hi>the mighty man, and the man of war;</hi> of <hi>the prudent, and the ancient;</hi> of <hi>the honourable man, and the counſellor.</hi> What now remains? Had not that funereal ſervice precluded a delineation of his character at this time; it would have been precluded by the very intereſting and inſtructive portrait of him yeſterday ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in this houſe, and by the tributary honours then offered to his memory.<note n="*" place="bottom">The academical exerciſes of Harvard Univerſity, in honour of General WASHINGTON, conſiſting of Prayers and appropriate Muſic; a Latin Oration by the Preſident; a Diſcourſe by Profeſſor Tappan; an Elegiac Poem, and a Funeral Oration, by members of the Univerſity; were performed on the 21ſt of February.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead, then, of recapitulating what ye have repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly heard, and what has already been the univerſal ſubject of Diſcourſes and Eulogies throughout the Union; indulge me in reminding you of the COUNSEL of WASHINGTON, and in recommending it to your practical obſervance. A Diſcourſe, embracing theſe objects, will, if I miſtake not, perfectly coincide with the leading deſign of this ſolemnity. It will be honourary to the memory of the man, whoſe counſels we recall to remembrance; it will teſtify our grief for his death; it will furniſh us with ſolace in our bereavement; and —what is of vaſtly higher importance, and will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably greater pleaſure to the benevolent Spirit of WASHINGTON, if a witneſs of this celebration,—it will tend to the promotion of our union and peace, of our liberty and happineſs.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Thy counſellor is,</hi> indeed, <hi>periſhed.</hi> But <hi>is wiſdom no more in Teman? is counſel periſhed from the prudent? is</hi> his <hi>wiſdom vaniſhed?</hi>

And what can more tenderly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt our attention to this counſel, than a conſideration of the motive by which it was dictated? "Solicitude for your welfare," ſaid the retiring Sage, "Solicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehenſion of danger natural to that ſolicitude, urge me, on an occaſion like the preſent, to offer to your ſolemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, ſome ſentiments, which are the reſult of much reflection, of no inconſiderable obſervation, and which appear to me all-important to the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of your felicity as a people. Theſe will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the diſintereſted warnings of a parting friend, who can poſſibly have no perſonal motive to bias his counſel." If ye did, indeed, love the paternal WASHINGTON, if ye are ſincere in commemorating his death, this day; thoſe words muſt touch every fibre of your hearts, and inſure a ſilent, may I not ſay a relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, attention to the important advice which he then offered you, and which I am now to bring into your remembrance.</p>
            <p>On this his natal day, then—a day brightened, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by yonder ſun, but deprived of what has long given it its higheſt luſtre—on this eventful day, which,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037640_0007_100F26C465F1E9B8"/>
at once, commemorates the birth and the death of our common FATHER, let us, like children aſſembled around the bed of an expiring parent, liſten, with all the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of filial piety, to his laſt, laſt counſels.</p>
            <p>Viewing the love of liberty as too congenial to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, to require his recommendation to fortify or confirm it, our Counſellor firſt invites our attention to Unity of government. This, ſaith he, "is a main pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the edifice of your real Independence, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your ſafety; of your proſperity; of that very liberty which you ſo highly prize. But, as it is eaſy to foreſee, that from different cauſes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortreſs, againſt which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be moſt conſtantly and actively, (though often covertly and inſidiouſly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you ſhould properly eſtimate the immenſe value of your National Union to your collective and individual happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that you ſhould cheriſh a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accuſtoming yourſelves to think and ſpeak of it as of the palladium of your political ſafety and proſperity, watching for its preſervation with jealous anxiety; diſcountenancing whatever may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt even a ſuſpicion that it can in any event be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; and indignantly frowning upon the firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every attempt to alienate any portion of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the reſt, or to enfeeble the ſacred ties which now link together the various parts."</p>
            <p>The reaſons, on which this counſel is founded, are, that being, "by birth or choice, citizens of a common
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037640_0008_100F26C6A5921A60"/>
country, that country has a right to concentrate our affections; that the name of AMERICAN, which belongs to us in our national capacity, muſt always exalt the juſt pride of patriotiſm, more than any appellation derived from local diſcriminations; that, with ſlight ſhades of difference, we have the ſame religion, manners, habits, and political principles; that we have, in a common cauſe, fought and triumphed together; and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence and liberty we poſſeſs are the work of joint counſels, and joint efforts, of common dangers, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſucceſſes."<note n="*" place="bottom">How fixed the principles, how uniform the counſels, of the great American Patriot! In his Farewell Addreſs to the Armies of the United States, 1783, "it is earneſtly recommended to all the troops, that, with ſtrong attachments to the union, they ſhould carry with them into civil ſociety the moſt conciliating diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that they ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uld prove themſelves not leſs virtuous and uſeful as citizens, than they have been perſevering, and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious as ſoldiers." May this recommendation be ſacredly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the preſent armies of America, and by all which may hereafter be raiſed for the national defence!</note> Perſuaſive arguments! calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bind citizen to citizen, and man to man, and to cement the people of the United States into an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble union.</p>
            <p>But, however powerful theſe conſiderations, addreſſed to our ſenſibility, they are greatly outweighed by thoſe which, with deep diſcernment, the great Counſellor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to our intereſt. "Here," he demonſtrates, that "every portion of our country finds the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding motives for carefully guarding and preſerving the union of the whole." He renders it undeniably evident, that, by an unreſtrained intercourſe of the North with the South, and of the South with the North; of the Eaſt with the Weſt, and of the Weſt with the Eaſt;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037640_0009_100F26C8EE13B338"/>
the immediate and particular intereſt of each part will be promoted, and that "all the parts combined cannot fail to find in the united maſs of means and efforts, greater ſtrength, greater reſource, proportionably greater ſecurity from external danger, a leſs frequent interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of ineſtimable value," that "they muſt derive from union an exemption from thoſe broils and wars between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which ſo frequently afflict neighbouring coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, not tied together by the ſame government; which their own rivalſhips alone would be ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, but which oppoſite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues, would ſtimulate and embitter:" and that "hence likewiſe they will avoid the neceſſity of thoſe overgrown military eſtabliſhments, which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly hoſtile to republican liberty." Under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of theſe truths, how juſtly doth he aſſert, "that your union ought to be conſidered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear to you the preſervation of the other?"</p>
            <p>Among the cauſes which may diſturb our union, he mentions it "as matter of ſerious concern, that any ground ſhould be furniſhed for characteriſing parties, by <hi>geographical</hi> diſcriminations—<hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern —Atlantic</hi> and <hi>Weſtern;</hi> whence deſigning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of local intereſts and views." Miſrepreſentations of this kind are one of the expedients of party to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire influence; and they give riſe to baneful jealouſies, againſt which our paternal monitor cautions us to ſhield ourſelves with peculiar care.</p>

               </note> No alliances, however ſtrict, between the parts, can be an adequate ſubſtitute; they will inevitably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the infractions and interruptions which all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, in all times, have experienced. Senſible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your firſt eſſay, by the adoption of a Conſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment better calculated than your former for an intimate union, and for the efficacious management of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concerns. This government, the offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full inveſtigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the diſtribution of its powers, uniting ſecurity with energy, and containing within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a proviſion for its own amendment, has a juſt claim to your confidence, and your ſupport.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037640_0011_100F26CDA76C0A80"/>
principle of liberty, and of fatal tendency. They ſerve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary force, to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a ſmall but art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and enterpriſing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public adminiſtration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of conſiſtent and wholeſome plans, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by common counſels and modified by mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts." We are faithfully forewarned that ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations are likely, in the end, "to become potent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, by which cunning and unprincipled men will be enabled to ſubvert the power of the people, and to uſurp for themſelves the reins of government."</p>
            <p>"Towards the preſervation of our government, and the permanency of our preſent happy ſtate," we are told, "it is requiſite not only that we ſteadily diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance irregular oppoſition to its acknowledged au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but alſo that we reſiſt, with care, the ſpirit of innovation upon its principles, however ſpecious the pretexts;" and allow it the teſt of time and experience. We are ſpecially counſelled to remember, "that for the efficient management of our common intereſt, in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo extenſive as our's, a government of as much vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as is conſiſtent with the perfect ſecurity of liberty, is indiſpenſable." We are aſſured, that "Liberty itſelf will find in ſuch a government, with powers properly diſtributed and adjuſted, its ſureſt guardian: and that it is little elſe than a name, where the government is too feeble to withſtand the enterprizes of faction, to confine each member of the ſociety within the limits
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037640_0012_100F26D0896C9130"/>
preſcribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the ſecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of perſon and property."</p>
            <p>Here, again, we are "warned, in the moſt ſolemn manner, againſt the baneful effects of a ſpirit of party;" and are inſtructed, that, while it generates "the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate domination of one faction over another, which is itſelf a frightful deſpotiſm, and which leads at length to the more formal and permanent deſpotiſm" of an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, "it ſerves always to diſtract the public counſels and enfeeble the public adminiſtration:" that "it agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the community with ill founded jealouſies, and falſe alarms; kindles the animoſity of one part againſt another, and foments occaſionally riot and inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:" that "it opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acceſs to the government itſelf through the channels of party paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:" and that "thus the policy and will of one country are ſubjected to the policy and will of another." We are taught, that this ſpirit, however ſalutary in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical governments, "in thoſe of a republican form is ſeen in its greateſt rankneſs, and is truly their worſt enemy:" and that, "there being conſtant danger of exceſs, the effort ought to be, by force of public opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, to mitigate and aſſuage it. A fire not to be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it demands uniform vigilance to prevent its burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a flame, leſt, inſtead of warming, it ſhould conſume."</p>
            <p>Another and a very eſſential article in the counſel, addreſſed to us, adviſes us to pay a ſacred regard to moral and religious duties. "Of all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to political proſperity," ſays the pious and patriotic Counſellor, "Religion and Morality
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037640_0013_100F26D2111BBAF0"/>
are indiſpenſable ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who would labour to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them.—A volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked, where is the ſecurity for prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation deſert the oaths which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in courts of juſtice?—And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded of the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of religious principle.—It is ſubſtantially true, that virtue or morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or leſs force to every ſpecies of free government. Who that is a ſincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to ſhake the foundation of the fabric?"<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>How happily did WASHINGTON exemplify this part of his counſel, in his official characters, as well as in private life! In his orders to the American Armies, on the ceſſation of hoſtilities, 1783, he inſtructs the chaplains, with the ſeveral brigades, to "render thanks to Almighty God," for the ſucceſsful termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conteſt. In his Farewell Addreſs to the Armies, he expreſsly acknowledges "the ſingular interpoſition of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence," in the courſe of the war, and devoutly "offers his prayers, in their behalf, to the God of armies."</p>
                  <p>On his reſignation of his military commiſſion, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onſidered it "an indiſpenſable duty to cloſe this laſt ſolemn act o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his official life, by recommending the intereſts of our deareſt country to the protection of Almighty God, and thoſe who have the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, to his holy keeping." On his induction into the Preſidency, he offers his "fervent ſupplications" to God, for his benediction on the newly inſtituted government, and on thoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in its adminiſtration; and remarks, that "no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the inviſible hand, which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people of the United States. Every ſtep, by which they have advanced to the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of an independent nation, ſeems to have been diſtinguiſhed by ſome token of providential agency."</p>
                  <p>With ſuch humility and piety did he uniformly acknowledge the influence of divine Providence, in all inſtances of ſucceſs; and with ſuch devotion did he uniformly commend the intereſts of his country to ALMIGHTY GOD! In this trait of character, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminently does WASHINGTON riſe above the great TIMOLEON, than whom few, if any, of the ancient heroes of Greece and Rome poſſeſſed higher talents and virtues, or, in other reſpects, more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembled the Hero of America. Timoleon aſcribed his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Fortune alone; and, in the ſpeeches he made to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Syracuſe, he frequently ſaid, "That he was very thankful to Fortune, who (deſigning to preſerve Sicily) was pleaſed to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our him with the name and title of its deliverer. And having built a chapel in his houſe, he there ſacrificed to Chance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated the houſe itſelf to Fortune."<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch.</note>—Had the name of GOD been placed in the room of FORTUNE, and <hi>Providence</hi> in the room of <hi>Chance,</hi> the modeſty of this excellent man would have received the additional ornament of religion. But Timoleon ſaw not "the pure and benign light of Revelation,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Circular Letter.</note> which Waſhington juſtly appreciated, and to which <hi>he</hi> was peculiarly indebted for his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime virtues, and for his rational piety.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:037640_0014_100F26D440B08B50"/>In cloſe connexion with this counſel to cheriſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality, we are adviſed to "promote, as an object of primary importance, inſtitutions for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diffuſion of knowledge:" and are reminded that "in proportion as the ſtructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is eſſential that public opinion ſhould be enlightened."</p>
            <p>"As a very important ſource of ſtrength and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity," we are counſelled to "cheriſh public credit." While the execution of the advice given on this ſubject belongs to your repreſentatives, "it is neceſſary," as is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037640_0015_100F26D5E6401570"/>
juſtly obſerved, "that public opinion ſhould co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is eſſential that you ſhould practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there muſt be revenue; that to have revenue there muſt be taxes; and none can be deviſed which are not more or leſs inconvenient and unpleaſant; that the intrinſic embarraſſment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from the ſelection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deciſive motive for a candid conſtruction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a ſpirit of acquieſcence in the meaſures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate."</p>
            <p>We are further adviſed to "obſerve good faith and juſtice towards all nations; to cultivate peace and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with all;" as what is equally enjoined by "good policy," and by "religion and morality." For the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of theſe objects, we are taught that "no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more eſſential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies againſt particular nations, and paſſionate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment for others, ſhould be excluded; and that in the place of them, juſt and amicable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated."</p>
            <p>Having enumerated ſome of the many evils, which originate from ſuch national partialities and antipathies, among which foreign influence is expreſsly noticed; the Counſellor, as if lifting up a monitory voice, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves: "Againſt the inſidious wiles of foreign influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealouſy of a free people ought to be <hi>conſtantly</hi> awake; ſince hiſtory and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the moſt baneful foes of republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037640_0016_100F26D8EC89AC20"/>
Our detached ſituation, we are reminded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites and enables us to keep ourſelves independent of other nations. "Why," we are interrogated, "why forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſituation? Why quit our own, to ſtand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our deſtiny with that of any part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, entangle our peace and proſperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalſhip, intereſt, humour or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price?"</p>
            <p>We are adviſed to "take care always to keep our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by ſuitable eſtabliſhments, on a reſpectable defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive poſture;" and are juſtly taught to believe, "that to be prepared for war is one of the moſt effectual means of preſerving peace."</p>
            <p>We are inſtructed, in fine, that "there can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from nation to nation;" that "it is an illuſion which experience muſt cure, which a juſt pride ought to diſcard."</p>
            <p>Such were the counſels of the venerable and patriotic Sage, whoſe death is the ſubject of this day's lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "In offering to you," ſaid he, "my countrymen, theſe counſels of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the ſtrong and laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I could wiſh—that they will controul the uſual cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the paſſions, or prevent our nation from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the courſe which has hitherto marked the deſtiny of nations: but if I may even flatter myſelf, that they may be productive of ſome partial benefit, ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party ſpirit, to warn againſt the miſchiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures of pretended patriotiſm; this hope will be a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037640_0017_100F26DB096F9A88"/>
full recompence for the ſolicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated."</p>
            <p>Can counſels, ſpringing from patriotiſm ſo diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted, from philanthropy ſo exalted, delivered too with modeſty ſo unaffected, with eloquence ſo perſuaſive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire aught elſe to impreſs them on your memories, to endear them to your hearts, or to recommend them to your obſervance? Nothing, but the near and tender relation I bear to you; a conſcious obligation to do what in me lies to promote your political and ſocial, your moral and religious, improvement and happineſs; ſolicitude for your united and individual welfare, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with that of our common country; and the animating hope, that the voice of your Paſtor will, on ſuch an occaſion as this, be attentively heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, could either prompt, or authorize, me to add my humble recommendation to what has the ſanction of the name of WASHINGTON. But, impelled by a ſenſe of duty, and inſpired by this intereſting ſolemnity, I preſume to aſk a reiterated attention to thoſe counſels, on the obſervance of which your ſafety and happineſs are ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>Remember, my friends and fellow-citizens, they are the counſels of <hi>the prudent, and the ancient; of the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable man, and</hi> THE COUNSELLOR. Remember, they are the counſels of the man, who, during eight long years, jeoparded his life on the high places of the field, in defence of your liberties; of the man, who fought your battles to gain your independence; of the man, who, in yonder encampment, "conſumed ſo many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious days, and watchful nights," to inſure your peace and tranquillity; of the man, who led your armies to vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037640_0018_100F2383F887E898"/>
and triumph; of the man, who aided in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your admirable Conſtitution of government; of the man, who, for eight years, preſided over your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated Republic, and eſſentially contributed to its proſperity and glory; of the man, who, in the evening of his days, again girded on his ſword, to repel your enemies; of the man, who uniformly ſacrificed his own intereſt and tranquillity to the welfare of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; of the man, whoſe whole life was a continued ſeries of patriotic exertions and ſervices; of the man, whoſe firſt and lateſt wiſh was, to ſee you free, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and happy. If ye will not regard the advice of ſuch a man; if even the name of WASHINGTON will not endear it to you; if, now your <hi>counſellor is periſhed,</hi> ye can ſuffer his counſel to periſh with him; ye will forfeit all claim to the expectation of that happineſs, which his counſel was deſigned to promote, and merit all thoſe accumulated evils, which it was intended to prevent. Ye will deſerve to be ſevered by diviſion, and rent by faction; and to become the prey of ſome aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demagogue at home, or of ſome deſpotic ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty abroad.—God forbid, that ſuch infatuation ſhould be the cauſe of your ſlavery and ruin! If ye mean any thing by the tribute, which ye profeſs voluntarily to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, this day; if ye came not hither to inſult the aſhes of the dead; if ye have the leaſt regard to your own beſt intereſts, to thoſe of our common country, and of generations yet unborn; ye will receive, with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt ſenſibility, the advice of wiſdom, and reſolve to honour the memory of your <hi>Counſellor,</hi> by obſerving it.</p>
            <p>To this obſervance, then, let me invite all, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever character or deſcription, in this aſſembly. Each of us, my fellow-citizens, is intereſted in whatever relates
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037640_0019_100F26E033046CC0"/>
to WASHINGTON. If we cannot emulate his wiſdom, we may follow his counſel; if we cannot make preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to his greatneſs, we may copy after his goodneſs; if we cannot aſpire at his talents as a General, a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or a Stateſman, we may imitate his virtues, as a Man, a Citizen, and a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, unitedly reſolve to purſue that courſe, which he has, with equal penetration and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, marked out for the ſecurity of our national liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and order, peace and happineſs; and keep perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in view his own noble and ſublime example. Let the unity of government, "which conſtitutes us one people," be ever a favourite object of our attention and zeal. Impreſſed with a ſenſe of its importance to the ſafety and intereſt, and even to the exiſtence, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us exert our utmoſt endeavours to preſerve it inviolate. Laying aſide local prejudices, let us treat all the citizens of United America as brethren, and aim to become more and more cemented into one great and happy fraternity.</p>
            <p>Convinced that, to the preſervation of our union, a general government is indiſpenſably neceſſary, let us cheriſh a cordial regard to the conſtitution and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States. If, my fellow-citizens, ye are, at any time, invited to aſſociate, "under whatever plauſible character," for the purpoſe of "directing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling, counteracting, or awing the regular delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and action of the conſtituted authorities;" ſpurn, with patriotic indignation, the man, who is capable of inſulting your underſtanding; impeaching your patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm; and undermining your liberty. Should ye find ſerious cauſe to complain of any evil either in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or Adminiſtration, of your government, ſeek
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037640_0020_100F299F124769B0"/>
redreſs in a <hi>conſtitutional</hi> manner; for the Conſtitution itſelf provides for its own amendment, and for the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of miſconduct in thoſe who adminiſter it.— Never forget, that "the baſis of our political ſyſtems is the right of the people to make and to alter their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of government;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Valedictory Addreſs.</note> that ye have the frequent choice of your own rulers; and that, therefore, the ſtaff of power is virtually retained in your own hands. If any, whom ye elect to offices of truſt and authority, abuſe your confidence, and pervert their delegated pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſiniſter purpoſes; ye may remedy the evil, by chooſing better men to ſucceed them. But if, inſtead of this expedient, ye cenſure the Conſtitution, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the execution of the laws; ye take the ſureſt method to diſſolve the union.</p>
            <p>As a mean of promoting unity, and of thus preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your liberty and independence, chooſe ſuch men only into public offices, as ye know to be attached, from principle, to that Conſtitution, which your great Counſellor hath warmly recommended to your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſupport.—If this advice is not expreſſed, it is implied, in the counſels of WASHINGTON; and, which is more, it is impreſſively inculcated by his own example. At the laſt election, in Virginia, for the choice of a Federal Repreſentative, the aged Patriot rode the diſtance of ten miles, to give his vote for a man, whom he knew to be a firm friend to the Conſtitution of the United States. Let this venerable Image be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, whenever ye are about to give your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages at an election; and, like a tutelar angel, guard you from contributing to the diviſion and ruin of your country.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Towards all nations let us obſerve good faith and juſtice; and cultivate peace and harmony with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Avoiding partial predilections for one nation, and antipathies againſt another, let us bluſh to bear any other name, or to ſuſtain any other character, than the name and character of AMERICANS.</p>
            <p>Inſtitutions for the general diffuſion of knowledge let us encourage and promote, as eſſential to the ſtability of the government, and to the happineſs of the people.<note n="*" place="bottom">This part of the counſel of WASHINGTON, like the reſt, was exemplified in his own conduct.
