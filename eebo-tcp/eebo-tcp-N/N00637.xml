            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE life of a Believer is in nothing more expreſt to the life, than in that of a Souldier. There is therefore advantage for a Miniſter of the Goſpel, when called to ſpeak to that Order of men, to improve the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,</hi> for the common benefit of all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to be of the <hi>Church Militant</hi>: and herein to imitate <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf, who took all opportunities to <hi>Spiritualize</hi> every thing that he had Occaſion to diſcourſe of: and were it not for this, there would be ſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to appear in this work at ſuch a day, wherein the ancient <hi>Military Spirit</hi> is well nigh loſt, as if there were no farther uſe for it: whereas, if it be thus alſo with <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in regard of their <hi>Spiritual Warfare,</hi> there is need of taking all Opportunities to rouſe them up, leſt they rue it for ever.</p>
            <p>The great encouragement of a <hi>Souldier,</hi> to be valiant, is the hope of <hi>Victory,</hi> and a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi> following upon it: and herein is the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Priviledged' that he is not left at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty,</hi> to the <hi>Chance of War,</hi> wherein <hi>the Battel is not alwayes to the Strong,</hi> but the

            <p>THE Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> when He was Dying, had his Friends comforting of him with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his paſt <hi>Victories</hi>: He told them that he Gloryed in one Victory above all the reſt; <hi>Inimicorum nequiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimum vici</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>carnem meam: I have had a Victory over my Fleſh, the worſt Enemy in the World.</hi> Now my <hi>Text</hi> preſents us with a Glorious <hi>Victory,</hi> and Eternal <hi>Triumph,</hi> not only over one, but over all Evils and Enemies; and gives the <hi>Dying</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ground to ſay, with the Bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith: Hence forth there is Laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day</hi>; and he

may Triumphantly add, <hi>O Death where is thy Sting? O Grave where is thy Victory?</hi> Of all terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Enemies,</hi> Death the <hi>King of Terrors</hi> is most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; and of all <hi>Houſes,</hi> the Grave, <hi>The Houſe for all Living,</hi> is the moſt dark and diſmal to the Eye of Nature; but yet the Truths of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> concerning both, are much more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: As appears by this glorious Triumph of Faith over both, ariſing from the conſideration of the Reſurrection of the Dead, and Change of the Living; which is expreſt in the 55, 56, 57. <hi>verſes</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh Death where is thy Sting? Oh Grave where is thy Victory? the ſting of Death is ſin, and the strength of ſin is the Law; but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: which the Apoſtle interpreteth thus. <hi>The ſting of Death</hi> [that is, that whereby Death is rendred terrible and deſtructive] is <hi>Sin,</hi> that is, the Tranſgreſſion of the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom all dye; yet made more deadly by our Actual Tranſgreſſions: but it is that which is the Condemning Sin.</p>
            <p>And what is the <hi>ſtrength of Sin,</hi> whereby it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails thus unto death? Why, it is <hi>the Law: In the Day that thou Eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the Death; and the Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye.</hi> Thus, <hi>By one man Sin Entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. Now God's Truth and Juſtice is ingaged to puniſh Sin with Death; and here is the ſtrength of ſin to puniſh the Sinner; that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000774_0004_0FAA5383C3061BE0"/>
is, the demerit of Sin is appointed by the Law.</p>
            <p>But whence then is this Triumph? <hi>God hath given us the Victory</hi>] God that appointed the Law for mans rule, and Death for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mans Tranſgreſſion [<hi>hath given us the Victory</hi>] by taking away Sin, and ſo our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuffer the puniſhment; and ſo changing the very Nature of Death, that now it ceaſeth to be deadly, and becomes ſalutiterous.</p>
            <p>But how did the Lord effect this? It was, [<hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord</hi>] that is, by the Death, and Obedience unto Death of that one man Chriſt Jeſus our Lord: In which there was <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to the Law, <hi>Juſtification</hi> to the Sinner, <hi>Merit</hi> of Life and Glory. Chriſt by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion took poſſeſſion of all for us, and makes way for the Effectual Application of all to us.</p>
            <p>The Summe is,</p>
            <p>That whereas Death and the Grave are moſt terrible Enemies, by reaſon of the demerit of ſin, binding over the Sinner to anſwer the Law in ſuffering the puniſhment by Law due to Sin; yet God of his Grace having given <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for our <hi>Surety,</hi> and ſo for our <hi>Saviour</hi> from Sin and Death, hath by taking away <hi>Sin,</hi> and rendring <hi>Death</hi> unable to do us any hurt, given us cauſe, whilſt we look at Death as terrible through Sin, to Triumph over it, as Captivated to our Service, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: And as Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us an <hi>Eternal Triumph</hi> over Death the Laſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000774_0005_0FAA5384808DAD88"/>
Enemy; ſo hath therein given us a <hi>Happy Victory,</hi> and Holy Triumph over all Evils and Enemies; Temporal, Spiritual, Eternal.</p>
            <p>Hence Obſerve:</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE.</p>
            <p>That the true Chriſtian Souldier ſhall at laſt obtain a compleat Victory, and Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies, is matter of Thanksgiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtiani</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cyprian) mori poſſunt, vinci non poſſunt.</hi> Chriſtians may Dye, but cannot be O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. Death may <hi>Kill</hi> them, but cannot <hi>Conquer</hi> them: The Victory of Chriſtian Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers over their Enemies, is very Glorious in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>To clear up this Doctrine, take two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>PROPOSITION I.</p>
            <p>That the true Chriſtian Souldier ſhall at laſt obtain a compleat Victory and an Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies.</p>
            <p>PROPOSITION II.</p>
            <p>That this is matter of Thanksgiving unto God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>That the true Chriſtian Souldier ſhall at laſt obtain a compleat victory and an Eternal Triumph over all Evils and Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the clearing up of this Propoſition, take a few Concluſions as Praeliminary.</p>
               <p>Concluſion I. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is the Captain General of Salvation.</hi> Heb. 2.10. <hi>For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things; in bringing many Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through Sufferings.</hi> The Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth here evidently compare Chriſt to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Captain and Leader of the People into <hi>Canaan</hi>; and all true Chriſtians are put under his Conduct and Guidance to bring them ſafe to Glory.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is called their <hi>[ARCHEGOS] Prince, Ruler and Captain of their Salvation,</hi> in reſpect of his Authority and Right to Rule over them, in order unto their Salvation. Hence He appeared unto <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as the <hi>Captain of the Lords Hoſt,</hi> Joſh. 5.14. Chriſt is the <hi>Captain of Salvation</hi> in reſpect of this actual Leading and Conduct of them, by his <hi>Example, Spirit and Grace,</hi> through all the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of their way, and warfare: he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, a <hi>Leader and Commander to the People,</hi> Iſa. 55.4. <hi>Behold I have given him for a witneſs to
<pb facs="unknown:000774_0006_0FAA53852D2144B8"/>
the people, a Leader and Commander to the People·</hi> So He is their [<hi>PRODROMOS</hi>] their <hi>Fore-runners</hi> Heb. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Banner</hi> ſignifies the Love of God, and Chriſt to his People, Cant. 2.4. <hi>His Banner over me was Love</hi>: This Love is manifeſted in their Preſervation and Salvation from all their Enemies. Hence it is ſaid, Iſa. 62.10, 11. <hi>Lift up a Standard for the People, ſay, behold thy Salvation cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Banner is put for all the manifeſt tokens of Gods Favour to, and gracious Preſence with his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.9. <hi>The Princes ſhall be afraid of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſaith the Lord</hi>: that is, they ſhall ſee the Love and Faithfulneſs of God to his People and be afraid.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Banner</hi> is for <hi>Encouragement</hi> to the Souldier and his deeper Engagement to fight; he muſt not leave his <hi>Colours</hi> in the greateſt hazard, but rather chuſe to dy: ſo the Chriſtian Souldier, muſt never forſake his God, Chriſt, his Houſe, his Ordinances &amp;c. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.13, 14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Banner</hi> was for defence and ſhelter and deliverance; it was the ſafeſt place in all the <hi>Camp</hi>: ſo is the Spiritual <hi>Banner.</hi> Hence ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, he ſhall in the time of trouble hide me in his pavilion, in the ſecret of his tabernacle.</hi> Thus the <hi>Pillar of Cloud,</hi> was a defence to Iſrael.</p>

               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Diſplaying of the Banner</hi> is the whole Military Improvement of it for the advantage of the Souldier, and the detriment of the Enemy. Therefore it is the flouriſhing of the Colours (as we call it) before the whole Army, and in ſight of the Enemy. It is aſcribed to God when he ſhines forth that <hi>dwells between the Cherubims</hi> &amp; <hi>leadeth Joſeph like a flock</hi>: when he <hi>Stirs up his ſtrength before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manaſſeh, Pſal.</hi> 80.1, 2, 3 Cauſing his face to ſhine that they may be Saved.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Banner</hi> is diſplayed by the <hi>Leaders</hi> of the People, when they give them Military encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: from hence that God is their God; Chriſt upon the Throne, that he guides to the War by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> and that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to be with them, and to fight for them, and that he commands them not to fear but to play the men, for their God and the cauſe of God. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> diſplayed the Banner before Iſrael, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>Fear ye not, ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of the Lord, the Lord ſhall fight for you, and ye ſhall hold your peace.</hi>

In matters <hi>Outward,</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and of this Life; here Death is the great <hi>Bereaver,</hi> and the great <hi>Tormentor.</hi> Death robbs our Bodies of all perfection; Death forceth a man from his Wealth, and whole outward Eſtate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of recovery, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.15. <hi>As he came forth of his Mothers Womb, naked ſhall he return, to go as he came, and ſhall take nothing of his Labour, which he may carry away in his hand, Job</hi> 1.21.

ſhall no longer ſtrive</hi>; Death bereaves us of all opportunity to lay up for Eternity. 3. Death deals with men that dye in their Sins as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in matters Eternal and Everlaſting. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves of Eternal Good: all that dye under the power of Death, it proves an Eternal Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them; they loſe God, Chriſt, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Mercy, Grace, Glory, Heaven and Happineſs. As Death is a great Bereaver, ſo he is a great <hi>Tormentor</hi>; all pain, ſorrow, anguiſh and trouble, is but the working of Death in this Life; yea, it makes way for Eternal Miſery in the Life to come.</p>
